https://openalex.org/W2003208348,"Recent studies have demonstrated a role for Staphylococcus aureus cidA-mediated cell lysis and genomic DNA release in biofilm adherence. The current study extends these findings by examining both temporal and additional genetic factors involved in the control of genomic DNA release and degradation during biofilm maturation. Cell lysis and DNA release were found to be critical for biofilm attachment during the initial stages of development and the released DNA (eDNA) remained an important matrix component during biofilm maturation. This study also revealed that an lrgAB mutant exhibits increased biofilm adherence and matrix-associated eDNA consistent with its proposed role as an inhibitor of cidA-mediated lysis. In flow-cell assays, both cid and lrg mutations had dramatic effects on biofilm maturation and tower formation. Finally, staphylococcal thermonuclease was shown to be involved in biofilm development as a nuc mutant formed a thicker biofilm containing increased levels of matrix-associated eDNA. Together, these findings suggest a model in which the opposing activities of the cid and lrg gene products control cell lysis and genomic DNA release during biofilm development, while staphylococcal thermonuclease functions to degrade the eDNA, possibly as a means to promote biofilm dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2129298171,"The regenerative potential diminishes with age and this has been ascribed to functional impairments of adult stem cells. Cells in culture undergo senescence after a certain number of cell divisions whereby the cells enlarge and finally stop proliferation. This observation of replicative senescence has been extrapolated to somatic stem cells in vivo and might reflect the aging process of the whole organism. In this study we have analyzed the effect of aging on gene expression profiles of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). MSC were isolated from bone marrow of donors between 21 and 92 years old. 67 genes were age-induced and 60 were age-repressed. HPC were isolated from cord blood or from mobilized peripheral blood of donors between 27 and 73 years and 432 genes were age-induced and 495 were age-repressed. The overlap of age-associated differential gene expression in HPC and MSC was moderate. However, it was striking that several age-related gene expression changes in both MSC and HPC were also differentially expressed upon replicative senescence of MSC in vitro. Especially genes involved in genomic integrity and regulation of transcription were age-repressed. Although telomerase activity and telomere length varied in HPC particularly from older donors, an age-dependent decline was not significant arguing against telomere exhaustion as being causal for the aging phenotype. These studies have demonstrated that aging causes gene expression changes in human MSC and HPC that vary between the two different cell types. Changes upon aging of MSC and HPC are related to those of replicative senescence of MSC in vitro and this indicates that our stem and progenitor cells undergo a similar process also in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2072902622,"We have investigated in detail the role of intra-organelle Ca2+ content during induction of apoptosis by the oxidant menadione while changing and monitoring the Ca2+ load of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and acidic organelles. Menadione causes production of reactive oxygen species, induction of oxidative stress, and subsequently apoptosis. In both pancreatic acinar and pancreatic tumor AR42J cells, menadione was found to induce repetitive cytosolic Ca2+ responses because of the release of Ca2+ from both ER and acidic stores. Ca2+ responses to menadione were accompanied by elevation of Ca2+ in mitochondria, mitochondrial depolarization, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Emptying of both the ER and acidic Ca2+ stores did not necessarily prevent menadione-induced apoptosis. High mitochondrial Ca2+ at the time of menadione application was the major factor determining cell fate. However, if mitochondria were prevented from loading with Ca2+ with 10 mum RU360, then caspase-9 activation did not occur irrespective of the content of other Ca2+ stores. These results were confirmed by ratiometric measurements of intramitochondrial Ca2+ with pericam. We conclude that elevated Ca2+ in mitochondria is the crucial factor in determining whether cells undergo oxidative stress-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2126100180,"Obesity-associated inflammation is of critical importance in the development of insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since the cannabinoid receptor CB2 regulates innate immunity, the aim of the present study was to investigate its role in obesity-induced inflammation, insulin resistance and fatty liver.Murine obesity models included genetically leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and wild type (WT) mice fed a high fat diet (HFD), that were compared to their lean counterparts. Animals were treated with pharmacological modulators of CB2 receptors. Experiments were also performed in mice knock-out for CB2 receptors (Cnr2 -/-).In both HFD-fed WT mice and ob/ob mice, Cnr2 expression underwent a marked induction in the stromal vascular fraction of epididymal adipose tissue that correlated with increased fat inflammation. Treatment with the CB2 agonist JWH-133 potentiated adipose tissue inflammation in HFD-fed WT mice. Moreover, cultured fat pads isolated from ob/ob mice displayed increased Tnf and Ccl2 expression upon exposure to JWH-133. In keeping, genetic or pharmacological inactivation of CB2 receptors decreased adipose tissue macrophage infiltration associated with obesity, and reduced inductions of Tnf and Ccl2 expressions. In the liver of obese mice, Cnr2 mRNA was only weakly induced, and CB2 receptors moderately contributed to liver inflammation. HFD-induced insulin resistance increased in response to JWH-133 and reduced in Cnr2 -/- mice. Finally, HFD-induced hepatic steatosis was enhanced in WT mice treated with JWH-133 and blunted in Cnr2 -/- mice.These data unravel a previously unrecognized contribution of CB2 receptors to obesity-associated inflammation, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and suggest that CB2 receptor antagonists may open a new therapeutic approach for the management of obesity-associated metabolic disorders."

The same type of length control is seen in an in vitro polyadenylation system reconstituted from three proteins: poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1). CPSF, binding the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA, and PABPN1, binding the growing poly(A) tail, cooperatively stimulate poly(A) polymerase such that a complete poly(A) tail is synthesized in one processive event, which terminates at a length of ∼250 nucleotides. We report that PABPN1 is required to restrict CPSF binding to the AAUAAA sequence and to permit the stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by AAUAAA-bound CPSF to be maintained throughout the elongation reaction. The stimulation by CPSF is disrupted when the poly(A) tail has reached a length of ∼250 nucleotides, and this terminates processive elongation. PABPN1 measures the length of the tail and is responsible for disrupting the CPSF-poly(A) polymerase interaction.

The poly(A) tails present at the 3′ end of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs have two major functions. The first function is in the control of mRNA decay; degradation of the poly(A) tail by a 3′ exonuclease (deadenylation) is the first step in both of the two main pathways of mRNA decay, and the completion of deadenylation triggers the second step, either cap hydrolysis or further 3′–5′ degradation. Because the rate of deadenylation is governed by sequence elements in the mRNA, it is specific for each mRNA species and serves as a major determinant of mRNA half-life (1Meyer S. Temme C. Wahle E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Obviously, a control of mRNA stability by the rate of deadenylation requires a defined poly(A) length as a starting point. The second function of the poly(A) tail is in the initiation of translation; the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein associated with the poly(A) tail promotes the initiation of translation by an interaction with the initiation factor eIF4G and probably through additional mechanisms (4Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2000: 447-465Google Scholar, 5Tarun Jr., S.Z.

Nature. 2008; 453: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this process, poly(A) tail length can also be important. For example, gene regulation during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development of animals depends on translational regulation of maternal mRNAs, and changes in poly(A) tail lengths of specific mRNAs, determined both by deadenylation and by regulated cytoplasmic poly(A) extension, play a major role in this translational regulation. Long poly(A) tails favor translation, whereas a shortening of the tail promotes translational inactivation of the message (8Wickens M. Goodwin E.B. Kimble J. Strickland S. Hentze M.W. Mathews M.B.

Similar mechanisms seem to operate in neurons (10Klann E. Richter J.D. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Translational Control in Biology and Medicine.

Cell. 2002; 109: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because the length of the poly(A) tail is important for its function, it is not surprising that poly(A) tails are generally synthesized with a defined length, which is species-specific, ∼70–90 nucleotides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Groner B. Hynes N. Phillips S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5378-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and ∼250 nucleotides in mammalian cells (15Brawerman G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 10: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Subtle differences between newly made poly(A) tails of different mRNAs have been described (13Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6548-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and there is even a class of mRNAs that never receives more than an oligo(A) tail (16Rao M.N. Chernokalskaya E. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4078-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Gu H. Das Gupta J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8943-8948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the heterogeneous length distribution seen in the steady-state mRNA population is the result of cytoplasmic shortening starting from a relatively well defined initial tail length; heterogeneity of tail length reflects age differences of the mRNA molecules. The oligo(A) tails present on inactive mRNAs in oocytes or embryos are also generated by shortening of full-length tails made in the cell nucleus (18Huarte J. Stutz A. O'Connell M.L. Gubler P. Belin D. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Vassalli J.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1021-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The poly(A) tail is added during 3′ end processing of mRNA precursors in the cell nucleus (19Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 20Wahle E. Rüegsegger U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 277-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction consists of two steps: an endonucleolytic cleavage followed by the addition of the poly(A) tail to the upstream cleavage product. Whereas a large protein machinery of some 20 or more polypeptides (22Shi Y. Di Giammartino D.C. Taylor D. Sarkeshik A. Rice W.J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Frank J. Manley J.L. Mol.

In the mammalian system, it can be reconstituted from three proteins: poly(A) polymerase, the enzyme catalyzing primer-dependent polymerization of AMP using ATP as a precursor (23Raabe T. Bollum F.J.

Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1678: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Roles of poly(A) polymerase and CPSF in polyadenylation in vivo have been most clearly demonstrated by genetic analysis of the orthologues in S. cerevisiae (21Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Keller W. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Poly(A) polymerase on its own is barely active because of a low affinity for its RNA substrate and thus acts distributively, i.e. it dissociates from the RNA after each polymerization step, and presumably often before it has incorporated any nucleotide; the enzyme also has no significant sequence specificity and will elongate any RNA with a free 3′ OH (24Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 226: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Both CPSF and PABPN1 enhance the activity of the polymerase by recruiting the enzyme to its substrate through direct interactions (38Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2672-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 41Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sequence specificity of poly(A) addition reflects the RNA binding specificities of the two stimulatory factors: CPSF recruits the polymerase to RNAs containing the AAUAAA sequence in the vicinity of their 3′ ends (24Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 226: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 42Takagaki Y. Ryner L.C. Manley J.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 43Christofori G. Keller W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and PABPN1 recruits the enzyme to substrate RNAs carrying a terminal oligo(A) tract (29Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Each factor alone endows the polymerase with modest processivity, such that it can incorporate maybe two to five nucleotides before dissociating (44Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). RNAs containing both the AAUAAA sequence and an oligo(A) tail and thus resembling intermediates of the polyadenylation reaction support a cooperative or synergistic stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by both CPSF and PABPN1. Under these conditions, addition of the poly(A) tail occurs in a processive manner, i.e. without intermittent dissociation of the protein complex from its substrate RNA (29Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 44Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the reconstituted polyadenylation reaction also shows proper length control, generating poly(A) tails of the same length as seen in vivo; tails grow to a relatively well defined length of 250–300 nucleotides in a rapid, processive reaction (29Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 44Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Length control is due to termination of this processive elongation; extension beyond 250 A residues is largely distributive and therefore slow (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These kinetics of in vitro poly(A) tail synthesis are fully consistent with the in vivo kinetics derived from pulse-labeling studies (46Sawicki S.G. Jelinek W. Darnell J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro, poly(A) tail elongation rates beyond 250 A residues are similar when either CPSF or PABPN1 or both are present. In other words, substrates with long poly(A) tails no longer support the cooperative stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by both CPSF and PABPN1 that is the basis of processive elongation (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The termination of processive elongation must be mediated by a change in the RNA-protein complex that remains to be defined. When RNAs carrying poly(A) tails of different lengths are used as substrates for polyadenylation, the tails are always elongated processively to 250 nucleotides, independently of the initial length, whereas extension of a tail of 250 or more nucleotides in length is slow and distributive from the start of the reaction. Thus, poly(A) tail length control is based on some kind of AMP residue counting or length measurement, not on a kinetic mechanism (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this paper, we address the two problems outlined above: first, how does the polyadenylation complex change to terminate processive poly(A) tail elongation, and second, how is the length of the tail measured? We provide evidence that PABPN1 is the active component in the mechanism of length control. The protein promotes the interaction between CPSF and poly(A) polymerase when bound to a short poly(A) tail. PABPN1 no longer promotes or even actively disrupts this interaction when bound to a poly(A) tail of 250 nucleotides or longer and thereby terminates the cooperative, processive elongation reaction in a poly(A) tail length-dependent manner. Only poly(A) sequences are counted as part of the tail. Because this reflects the binding specificity of PABPN1 and because disruption of the CPSF-poly(A) polymerase interaction requires complete coverage of the poly(A) tail by this protein, PABPN1 is also the protein that measures the length of the tail. The expression plasmid containing a partially synthetic PABPN1 gene has been described (47Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The LALA double mutant was generated by introduction of the L119A mutation into the plasmid pGM-synPABPN1 L136A (41Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PABPN1 open reading frame was then subcloned with NdeI and BamHI into the expression vector pUK (47Kühn U. Nemeth A.

For expression of poly(A) polymerase, the PAP open reading frame from pGM10-PAP82 (48Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pUK plasmid with NdeI and BamHI. Plasmids encoding various polyadenylated derivatives of the L3pre RNA have been described (41Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, pSP64-L3preA75 was generated by the same procedure. The mutagenesis of the polyadenylation signal (Δ variant: AAGAAA) of pSP64-L3preA15 and derivatives (41Kerwitz Y. Kühn U. Lilie H. Knoth A. Scheuermann T. Friedrich H. Schwarz E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was done by PCR using Δ forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) and Pwo DNA polymerase (Peqlab). The PCR fragment was digested with PstI and PvuII and subcloned into the PstI/PvuII opened plasmids. A280 was obtained by size fractionation of commercial poly(A) and labeled as described (49Keller R.W. Kühn U. Aragón M. Bornikova L. Wahle E. Bear D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Poly(A) concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy with ϵ (AMP) = 9800 cm−1m−1. Other RNAs were synthesized by run-off transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and [α-32P]UTP (GE Healthcare or Hartmann Analytics). No 5′ cap was added. RNAs were gel-purified and quantified as described (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Templates for run-off transcription were either plasmid DNA-digested with appropriate restriction enzymes or PCR fragments that were amplified with an SP6 promotor forward primer (supplemental Table S1) and a reverse primer that hybridized downstream to the plasmid. DNA templates were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Polyadenylated RNAs L3preA15, L3preA45, L3preA75, and L3preA105 and the corresponding versions with a point mutation in AAUAAA were generated by transcription of suitable plasmids templates (41Kerwitz Y.

RNAs with poly(A) tails longer than 105 nucleotides were obtained by further elongation of L3preA15 or similar RNAs as described (45Wahle E. J. Biol.

The RNA substrates L3pre-N49A15 and L3preA15N63A15 were synthesized from PCR fragments generated as described above using the plasmids pSP64-L3pre and pSP64-L3preA15 as templates and the SP6 promotor primer and the corresponding reverse primers (supplemental Table S1). A first set of RNA processing substrates with no poly(A) tail and with increasing distance between the AAUAAA sequence and the 3′ end were generated by transcription from the plasmids pSP64-L3 or pSP64-L3preΔ linearized with RsaI close to the 3′ processing cleavage site (1 nt upstream of the cleavage site, 19 nt downstream of AAUAAA) or further downstream with DraI (48 nt downstream of the cleavage site), AflIII (101 nt), EcoRI (162 nt), and MbiI (205 nt) and from a PCR fragment (299 nt distance) generated by use of the SP6 promotor primer and a second oligonucleotide priming about 300 nt downstream of the RsaI site (L299 rev; supplemental Table S1). A second set of processing substrates with increasing distance between the AAUAAA sequence and the 3′ end was synthesized from PCR fragments generated from the templates pSP64-L3 and pSP64-L3preΔ, respectively, with the help of the SP6 promotor primer and different downstream primers (supplemental Table S1). The downstream primers were designed such that all RNAs carried the same additional sequence (-UGUA) at the 3′ end. When RNAdraw (54Matzura O. Wennborg A. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 247-249PubMed Google Scholar) predicted that the 3′ end of a particular RNA was included in a double-stranded region, the additional 3′ terminal sequence was extended to UGUUGUA to disrupt the double-stranded structure. Expression of His-tagged PABPN1 LALA was done as described (47Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: M9 minimal medium was used, and induction was started at A600 = 1 by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25–30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and lysed with a Basic Z cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd.) at 2200 bar. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography was performed as described (47Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were dialyzed first against RS buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 m NaCl and then against RS buffer containing 300 mm salt. After dilution to a salt concentration below 150 mm, nucleic acids and contaminating proteins were removed by chromatography on a 1-ml Resource S column (GE Healthcare). Wild-type PABPN1 was expressed in a fermentor-grown culture and purified by a similar procedure. Because recombinant His-tagged PABPN1 is not always fully active, the amount required to saturate the poly(A) tails of substrate RNAs was determined by titrations in gel mobility shift assays. For some experiments, calf thymus PABPN1 was used (50Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPSF was purified essentially as described (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Full-length bovine poly(A) polymerase was also expressed in Escherichia coli Bl21 pUBS. Bacteria were grown in SOB medium to A600 = 1 and induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested after 16 h at 25–30 °C and disrupted as above. The His-tagged PAP was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen) followed by a Hitrap Heparin-Sepharose and a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare). Concentrations of PABPN1 and poly(A) polymerase were determined from the absorption at 280 nm, and extinction coefficients were calculated by the Lasergene software package (DNAStar Inc.). The concentration of CPSF was estimated by titrations in gel mobility shift and polyadenylation assays, assuming that a 1:1 ratio to the substrate RNA was required to saturate the reaction. Polyadenylation assays were performed at 37 °C as described (45Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) except that 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 was substituted for polyvinyl alcohol in the reaction buffer. The reaction volume was 20 or 25 μl or multiples thereof when several time points were taken from one reaction. RNA substrates, proteins, and incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. Amounts of RNA and protein always refer to the unit reaction volume of 20 or 25 μl. Molar quantities of RNA refer to polymers, not mononucleotides. The reaction products were resolved on 5 or 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8.3 m urea, and radioactivity was detected by phosphorimaging. Polyadenylation assays often included a reaction containing a 10-fold amount of poly(A) polymerase to control for the ability of the RNA to be elongated and to gauge the stimulatory effects of the RNA binding proteins. Polyadenylation reactions were performed with 80 fmol of radioactively labeled RNA, 80 fmol of PAP, and an appropriate amount of CPSF (approximately equimolar to the RNA) in the presence of 1.25 μg of competitor tRNA for 0, 2, and 10 min at 37 °C. To measure the activity of unstimulated PAP, control reactions with 800 fmol of PAP were performed in the absence of CPSF for 10 min at 37 °C. Polyadenylation products were analyzed as above and quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 (GE Healthcare). Efficiency of polyadenylation was determined as follows: for each lane, a line graph was integrated in Excel (Microsoft Corp.) to determine the total amount of radioactivity. Then the position in the gel was determined that divided the lane into two portions each containing the same amount of radioactivity. DNA size standards in neighboring lanes were used to determine the RNA length corresponding to this position. The elongation of an RNA is given by the difference between this position and that of the same RNA without incubation (t = 0 min). PAP stimulation was calculated as the ratio of stimulated elongation (in the presence of CPSF) over unstimulated elongation (in the absence of CPSF). Because extension by 1× poly(A) polymerase (80 fmol) was barely detectable, stimulation was normalized to 110 of the extension seen in the 10× poly(A) polymerase lane. Because the RNA intensities are not weighted by the length, this type of quantitation measures mostly the quantity of RNA that is elongated and puts less emphasis on the length of poly(A) that is added. This is desired because the former parameter more accurately reflects the AAUAAA-dependent stimulation by CPSF. 80 fmol of RNA was incubated under reaction conditions in the absence of ATP. The reaction volume was 20 μl, and proteins were used as indicated in the figure legend. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, protein-RNA complexes were resolved by native gel electrophoresis as described (49Keller R.W. Kühn U. Aragón M. Bornikova L. Wahle E. Bear D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). With RNA substrates carrying no poly(A) tails, the stimulation of polyadenylation by CPSF is strongly dependent on the presence of the CPSF-binding site, AAUAAA. Because of the similarity of this sequence with poly(A) and because CPSF binds tightly to a poly(A) column (26Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility was tested that CPSF could stimulate polyadenylation also by binding to the growing poly(A) tail. Indeed, CPSF stimulated extension of size-fractionated poly(A) by poly(A) polymerase quite efficiently, although less so than PABPN1 (Fig. 1A; activity of the same proteins on the regular polyadenylation substrate is shown as a control in the first five lanes). When PABPN1 was titrated into these poly(A) elongation reactions, the rate of elongation increased, but the CPSF-dependent stimulation was reduced to zero at a concentration of PABPN1 sufficient to cover the poly(A) substrate completely (Fig. 1B, compare lanes plus and minus CPSF). Thus, CPSF can stimulate poly(A) polymerase when bound to naked poly(A), but it cannot bind the poly(A)-PABPN1 complex. The effect of CPSF was then examined with a “regular” polyadenylation substrate carrying an AAUAAA sequence; the L3pre RNA corresponds to the cleaved intermediate of a 3′ processing reaction at the L3 site of the adenovirus major late transcript. In L3preΔ, the polyadenylation signal is mutated to AAGAAA. Variants of these RNAs were used that carried different lengths of 3′ terminal poly(A) already at the start of the elongation reaction, thus representing intermediates in the elongation reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1506282373,"Plant growth and development is driven by osmotic processes. Potassium represents the major osmotically active cation in plants cells. The uptake of this inorganic osmolyte from the soil in Arabidopsis involves a root K+ uptake module consisting of the two K+ channel α-subunits, AKT1 and AtKC1. AKT1-mediated potassium absorption from K+-depleted soil was shown to depend on the calcium-sensing proteins CBL1/9 and their interacting kinase CIPK23. Here we show that upon activation by the CBL·CIPK complex in low external potassium homomeric AKT1 channels open at voltages positive of EK, a condition resulting in cellular K+ leakage. Although at submillimolar external potassium an intrinsic K+ sensor reduces AKT1 channel cord conductance, loss of cytosolic potassium is not completely abolished under these conditions. Depending on channel activity and the actual potassium gradients, this channel-mediated K+ loss results in impaired plant growth in the atkc1 mutant. Incorporation of the AtKC1 subunit into the channel complex, however, modulates the properties of the K+ uptake module to prevent K+ loss. Upon assembly of AKT1 and AtKC1, the activation threshold of the root inward rectifier voltage gate is shifted negative by approximately −70 mV. Additionally, the channel conductance gains a hypersensitive K+ dependence. Together, these two processes appear to represent a safety strategy preventing K+ loss through the uptake channels under physiological conditions. Similar growth retardation phenotypes of akt1 and atkc1 loss-of-function mutants in response to limiting K+ supply further support such functional interdependence of AKT1 and AtKC1. Taken together, these findings suggest an essential role of AtKC1-like subunits for root K+ uptake and K+ homeostasis when plants experience conditions of K+ limitation.

Fundamental plant functions such as control of the membrane potential, osmo-regulation, and turgor-driven growth and movements are based on the availability to gain high cellular potassium concentrations (1Clarkson D.T. Hanson J.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1980; 31: 239-298Crossref Google Scholar). The absorption of this inorganic osmolyte from the soil by the root therefore represents a pivotal process for plant life. Classical experiments by Epstein et al. in 1963 (2Epstein E. Rains D.W. Elzam O.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1963; 49: 684-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described K+ root uptake as a biphasic process mediated by two uptake mechanisms: high affinity potassium transport with apparent affinities of ∼20 μm and a low affinity transport system with Km values in the millimolar range. During the last decades several molecular components of potassium transport systems have been identified and functionally characterized in plants (3Lebaudy A. Véry A.A. Sentenac H.

Mutant analyses, heterologous expression, as well as radiotracer uptake experiments characterized the K+ channels AKT1·AtKC1 and members of the HAK·KT·KUP family as major components of the Arabidopsis thaliana root-localized potassium transport system (5Fu H.H.

In this study we focused on AKT1 and AtKC1, members of the Arabidopsis Shaker-like K+ channel family. AKT1 is a voltage-dependent inward-rectifying K+ channel mediating potassium uptake over a wide range of external potassium concentrations (10Basset M. Conejero G. Lepetit M. Fourcroy P. Sentenac H.

As a consequence the growth of akt1-1 seedlings is strongly impaired on low potassium medium (100 μm and less) (11Dennison K.L. Robertson W.R. Lewis B.D. Hirsch R.E. Sussman M.R. Spalding E.P.

AtKC1 shares its expression pattern with AKT1 (18Ivashikina N. Becker D. Ache P. Meyerhoff O. Felle H.H. Hedrich R.

In contrast to root cells of akt1-1 loss of function mutants, root protoplasts of AtKC1 null mutants (atkc1-f) still exhibit inward rectifying potassium currents most likely derived from homomeric AKT1 tetramers (20Reintanz B.

Inward K+ currents in this atkc1-f mutant were characterized by a more positive activation voltage. These data suggested that the AtKC1 α-subunits do not form K+ channels per se but modulate the properties of the AKT1·AtKC1 heterocomplex (20Reintanz B. Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Godde M.

CIPK23 itself was shown to be activated by the two calcineurin B-like proteins, CBL1 and 9, acting in a Ca2+-dependent manner upstream of CIPK23 (25Cheong Y.H. Pandey G.K. Grant J.J. Batistic O.

Acta. 2009; 1793: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of these elements resulted in transgenic plants exhibiting a phenotype comparable with that of the AKT1 loss of function mutant. This regulatory system, based on a calcium sensor, a protein kinase, and a K+ channel, was functionally reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes (23Xu J. Li H.D. Chen L.Q. Wang Y. Liu L.L. He L. Wu W.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Kim B.G. Cheong Y.H. Pandey G.K. Luan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here we report on the physiological properties of the heteromeric K+ uptake module formed by the predominant root potassium uptake channel subunits, AKT1 and AtKC1 and its regulating kinase complex, CBL1 and CIPK23. Our studies show that the physical interaction of the CBL1·CIPK23 complex is specific for AKT1 channels and does not involve the AtKC1 subunit. AKT1 possesses a K+ (absence) sensor affecting channel activity at submillimolar K+ concentrations by strongly reducing its maximal cord conductance. Despite this K+ sensor, upon activation, AKT1 homomeric channels were shown to represent a potassium leak at low external potassium concentrations. Integration of AtKC1 into the K+ uptake module, however, prevented potassium loss by modulating both the voltage sensor and conductance in the channel complex. Moreover, activation of the AKT1-like maize channel ZMK1 by CBL1·CIPK23 suggests a conserved interaction and regulation across monocot and dicotyledonous plant species. Our biophysical studies as well as growth assays with plant mutant lines lacking the respective channels underline that acquisition of potassium under limiting K+ conditions is mediated via the root AKT1·AtKC1 K+ uptake channel complex. calcineurin-B-like protein CBL-interacting protein kinase wild type bimolecular fluorescence complementation 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid yellow fluorescent protein. The dependence of seedling growth on extracellular K+ was measured on sterile agarose medium containing a defined ionic composition as previously described (12Hirsch R.E. Lewis B.D. Spalding E.P. Sussman M.R. Science. 1998; 280: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Growth of akt1-1 mutant was compared with Wassilevskija WT seedlings and atkc1-f mutant to Col-0 WT seedlings. The fresh weight as well as the root length of WT and mutant seedlings was determined after 11 days of seedling growth under a 12/12-h light to dark rhythm. 2 mm NH4+ was added to the medium to inhibit transporter-mediated K+ uptake (11Dennison K.L.

Root length and the fresh weight of at least 20 seedlings were measured at each condition in three independent experiments (±S.D.). To generate cRNAs for CBLs and CIPKs, full-length cDNAs for CBL1, 4, 5, and 9 and CIPK1, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, and 24 were cloned in oocyte expression vectors and verified by sequencing. For oocyte BiFC experiments these cDNAs were fused to the N- or C-terminal half of an YFP cDNA. For functional analyses cRNA of AKT1, AtKC1, ZMK1, KAT1, and the members of the CBL and CIPK kinase families was prepared using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocyte preparation and cRNA injection have been described elsewhere (28Becker D. Dreyer I. Hoth S. Reid J.D. Busch H. Lehnen M. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8123-8128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). AKT1, AtKC1, and ZMK1 cRNA (10–20 ng) was injected in combination with 0.5 ng of cRNA of CBL1 and CIPK23, respectively, unless stated otherwise. Yeast transformation and two-hybrid analyses were performed as described (29Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Shi W. Zhu J.K.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used, and the yeast were incubated at 23 °C on medium supplemented with 2.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The generation of the CBL and CIPK two-hybrid constructs has been described (30Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K. Kudla J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). To generate the additional constructs used in this study, the C-terminal regions of AtKC1 (amino acids 330–662) and AKT1 (from amino acid 220) were amplified by PCR and after sequence verification were cloned into pAD-GH as described (30Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K. Kudla J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). For in planta BiFC studies, the full-length AKT1 cDNA construct was amplified by PCR and cloned with XbaI-XmaI into pSPYCE-35S, whereas AtKC1 cDNA was cloned with BamHI-XhoI into pSPYNE-35S. Infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was performed as described (30Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K.

Protoplasts were prepared 3 days after infiltration by incubating leaf discs in 500 mm mannitol, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MES/KOH, pH 5.5, 3% cellulase, and 0.75% Macerozym. For documentation of the results, pictures were taken on an inverted microscope (Leica DMIRE2) equipped with the Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning device. In two-electrode voltage-clamp studies, oocytes were perfused with KCl-containing solutions, based on Tris/MES buffers. The standard solution contained 10 mm MES/Tris, pH 5.6, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm KCl. Osmolarity was adjusted to 220 mOsmol/kg using d-sorbitol. The ionic strength was adjusted with LiCl to 100 mm. To inhibit oocyte endogenous currents, especially at potentials negative from −160 mV, 1 mm LaCl3 was added to the bath solution (32Naso A. Montisci R. Gambale F. Picco C. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 3673-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was verified that LaCl3 had no effect on the K+ channel activity. Voltage-dependent activation of KAT1, AKT1, and AKT1·AtKC1 heterotetramers was recorded using single-pulse protocols. Starting from a holding potential (VH) of −20 mV, a series of voltage pulses were applied as indicated in the figure legends. Steady state currents, ISS, measured at the end of the activation pulses (voltage, V) were well described by the equation, Iss=GKmax×(V-Vrev)/(1+exp(zF(V-V1/2)/RT))Eq. 1 where Vrev is the reversal voltage, i.e. the voltage at which the electrical gradient compensates the chemical K+ gradient; V½ is the half-maximal activation potential; z is the apparent gating charge; and GK-max is the maximal conductance. Subsequently, channel cord conductance was extracted according to the following equation. GK=ISS/(V-Vrev)Eq. 2 This calculation eliminates the chemical driving force of the K+ gradient. The voltage-dependent potassium channel AKT1 is activated during K+ starvation in a calcium- and phosphorylation-dependent manner (23Xu J. Li H.D. Chen L.Q. Wang Y. Liu L.L. He L. Wu W.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In addition to AKT1, root cells express the structural homologues AtKC1 and GORK (18Ivashikina N. Becker D. Ache P. Meyerhoff O. Felle H.H. Hedrich R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Reintanz B. Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Godde M. Becker D. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to AKT1 and AtKC1, the GORK protein represents a K+ outward rectifier (efflux) channel. To investigate the contribution of AtKC1 to channel-mediated high affinity K+ uptake in roots, we compared K+-dependent seedling growth of the A. thaliana mutants akt1-1 and atkc1-f with that of the respective wild types (Wassilevskija, Col-0; Fig. 1). On medium containing as low as 100 μm K+, akt1-1 seedlings appeared significantly impaired in root growth (57% +/− 4.5%). Lowering the K+ concentration to 10 μm, WT as well as akt1-1 seeds failed to fully emerge from the seed coat (11Dennison K.L. Robertson W.R. Lewis B.D. Hirsch R.E. Sussman M.R. Spalding E.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Hirsch R.E. Lewis B.D. Spalding E.P. Sussman M.R. Science. 1998; 280: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). At 100 μm K+ the root length of the atkc1-f mutant was reduced by ∼28% (+/− 6.0%) and was less affected than the akt1-1 seedlings. This observation is in line with the fact that root cells of the atkc1-f mutant still conduct inward potassium currents, most probably carried by AKT1 homomers (20Reintanz B. Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Godde M. Becker D. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4079-4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At 10 μm K+, seedling emergence from the seed coat in atkc1-f was as drastically impaired as in akt1-1 and the corresponding WT seedlings. Similar data were obtained for differences in fresh weight (data not shown). Notably, Col-0 WT seeds performed better under potassium-limiting conditions than Wassilevskija-0 seeds. These results indicate that under potassium starvation, both K+ channel α-subunits contribute to the K+ uptake system of Arabidopsis roots. Studies by Xu et al. (23Xu J. Li H.D. Chen L.Q. Wang Y. Liu L.L. He L. Wu W.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (24Li L. Kim B.G. Cheong Y.H. Pandey G.K. Luan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) provided first evidence for a phosphorylation-dependent activation of the AKT1 channel during K+ starvation. As shown for the akt1-1 and the atkc1-f mutant, transgenic plants lacking either the serine/threonine protein kinase CIPK23 or the two Calcineurin B-like proteins CBL1 and CBL9 exhibited impaired growth on low potassium concentrations (23Xu J. Li H.D. Chen L.Q. Wang Y. Liu L.L. He L. Wu W.H. Cell. 2006; 125: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Kim B.G. Cheong Y.H. Pandey G.K. Luan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To study the properties of the K+ uptake channel complex in detail, we performed voltage clamp measurements with oocytes co-expressing AKT1 and a CBL·CIPK pool containing the plasma membrane-localized CBLs 1, 4, 5, and 9 and root-expressed CIPKs 1, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, and 22 except CIPK23 (Fig. 2A, upper traces). This pool of kinases failed to evoke AKT1-mediated macroscopic potassium currents. The addition of CIPK23 cRNA to the CBL·CIPK mix, however, resulted in typical AKT1 hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifying K+ currents (Fig. 2A, lower traces). This finding points to a highly specific protein-protein interaction between AKT1 and CIPK23. When the AKT1 orthologue from maize, ZMK1, was co-expressed with the identical pools of kinases, similar inward rectifying K+ channel activation was monitored only in the presence of CIPK23 (Fig. 2B). This observation indicated that a CBL·CIPK-mediated channel activation mechanism is conserved among different plant species. AtKC1 co-expressed with the CBL·CIPK pool, however, remained electrically silent (data not shown), pointing to a specific interaction between CIPK23 and AKT1. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to test the direct interaction of AKT1 and AtKC1 with CIPKs. To this end, the C-terminal cytosolic regions of AKT1 (starting from amino acid His294) and AtKC1 (starting from amino acid His330) were cloned in activation domain vectors, and interaction with full-length CIPKs in binding domain vectors was analyzed by growth on selective media. As depicted in Fig. 3A, this analysis revealed interaction of AKT1 with CIPK23 as indicated by growth on selective media. Combination of AKT1 with CIPK1 did not rescue growth in these assays, indicating the specificity of the observed interaction with CIPK23. In contrast to AKT1, combination of AtKC1 with either CIPK23 (Fig. 3A) or any other of the 25 CIPKs (data not shown) did not restore growth. To reassess the yeast two-hybrid data, we employed BiFC to follow physical interactions of channels and kinases in Xenopus oocytes. For this purpose we fused the C-terminal half of a YFP to the C terminus of AKT1 (AKT1::YFP CT) and the N-terminal half of an YFP to the C terminus of CIPK23 (CIPK23::YFP NT). Expression of any of these constructs alone did not result in YFP fluorescence (data not shown). Co-expression of AKT1::YFP CT and CIPK23::YFP NT did not lead to macroscopic AKT1 currents in oocytes (Fig. 3D, middle panel), and in plant cells fluorescence complementation caused by AKT1::YFP CT CIPK23::YFP NT interaction was rather weak. Expressing these constructs together with CBL1, however, resulted in typical AKT1 K+ currents (Fig. 3D, bottom panel) and bright YFP fluorescence monitored by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C). This indicates that physical interaction between AKT1 and CIPK23 occurs mainly in the presence of CBL1, which seemed to act as a scaffold protein. As a control AKT1::YFP CT was expressed together with CIPK24::YFP NT and a pool of CBLs (1, 4, 5 and 9). This combination did not show fluorescence complementation. In line with this result, the co-expression of AKT1 with the CIPK24/CBL pool did not result in detectable K+ currents in oocytes (Fig. 3, C and D, top panels). Like their animal counterparts, functional plant shaker-like K+ channel proteins are formed by four α-subunits (33MacKinnon R.

Furthermore it was suggested that the heteromeric assembly of different α-subunits might provide for the molecular basis of the broad functional diversity observed in planta (34Dreyer I. Antunes S.

To directly investigate the potential physical interaction of AKT1 with AtKC1 in plant cells, we again used the BiFC technique in N. benthamiana protoplasts. In these assays, formation of heteromeric AKT1·AtKC1 complexes was observed at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Importantly, no fluorescence was observed in control transformations expressing either AKT1 or AtKC1 in combination with the complementary half of YFP (data not shown). Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for the formation of AKT1·AtKC1 heterotetramers in plant cells. They further suggest that, although both AKT1 and AtKC1 contribute to the K+ uptake system in Arabidopsis roots, only the AKT1 subunit represents a target for phosphorylation by calcium-dependent CBL·CIPK complexes. To study AKT1-mediated high affinity K+ uptake following activation by CBL·CIPK, we monitored channel activity at external potassium concentrations mimicking K+-depleted soils. Fig. 4(A and B) shows that in medium containing 0.5–1 mm K+, pronounced outward currents were recorded in a voltage window between −40 mV and the reversal potential for K+ (EK) at which currents reversed their direction. Thus, under these conditions, AKT1-expressing cells leaked potassium ions (Fig. 4B). Peak K+ efflux was higher at 0.5–1 mm compared with 100 or 10 μm external K+, despite the increased driving force for K+ release at lower external potassium. It became apparent that inward currents, negative of EK, almost disappeared at limiting K+ concentrations (100–10 μm) and pointed to gating control of AKT1 by extracellular potassium ions. A Boltzmann analysis of voltage-dependent channel activity revealed a consistent half-maximal activation potential (V½) of −107 mV (± 3.4 mV) and a slope factor (corresponding to a gating charge) of 1.0 (± 0.05) for AKT1 homomers in the K+ concentration range between 1 and 30 mm (Fig. 4E). This shows that at high extracellular potassium concentrations, AKT1 gating is independent of K+, a feature previously described for voltage-dependent guard cell K+ channels such as KAT1 and KAT2 (17Brüggemann L.

Boucherez J. Thibaud J.B. Sentenac H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Indeed, alike AKT1, KAT1 exhibited pronounced K+ leakage at limiting external K+, too (Fig. 4C). Thus, in the voltage range between EK and the threshold voltage for channel activation, AKT1 homomers cannot avoid K+ efflux at low K+ concentrations (Fig. 4B). Because of these gating characteristics, K+-limiting conditions could open up a shunt pathway for K+ in AKT1-expressing root cells (cf. Fig. 1). In the absence of AtKC1, K+ currents in Arabidopsis root cells activate 50 mV more positive compared with WT protoplasts expressing both AtKC1 and AKT1 (20Reintanz B. Szyroki A. Ivashikina N. Ache P.

In this study, we demonstrate that purified intact mouse liver nuclei convert dUMP to dTMP in the presence of NADPH and serine. Neither nuclear extracts nor intact nuclei exposed to aminomethylphosphonate, a SHMT inhibitor, exhibit thymidylate synthesis activity. Nuclei isolated from Shmt1(-/-) mouse livers retained 25% of thymidylate synthesis activity exhibited by nuclei isolated from wild type mice. This residual activity was due to the presence of a cytoplasmic/nuclear isozyme of SHMT encoded by Shmt2. Shmt2 is shown to encode two transcripts, one which encodes a protein that localizes exclusively to the mitochondria (SHMT2), and a second transcript that lacks exon 1 and encodes a protein that localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus during S-phase (SHMT2alpha). The ability of Shmt2 to encode a cytoplasmic isozyme of SHMT may account for the viability of Shmt1(-/-) mice and provide redundancy that permitted the expansion of the human SHMT1 L474F polymorphism that impairs SHMT1 sumoylation and nuclear translocation."

Proper regulation of the gene products comprising these networks by transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing is not only important for selective pathogen elimination but also for preventing excessive accumulation of cytokines such as interferon-β, interferon-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α that initiate the host defense against microbial attack (6Lynn D.J.

It is presently unclear how miRNAs regulate cellular pathways in innate and inflammatory processes, where precise control of complex networks is needed to engage an appropriate response to microbes that avoids a cytokine storm.

Stathopoulou P.G. Benakanakere M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) based on variations in cytokine response following TLR agonist challenge. The present study tested the hypothesis that differential expression of miRNAs may account for some of the variability in innate immunity. To test this hypothesis, we selected three “normal” and three “diminished” cytokine-response phenotypes. We subjected the corresponding primary human gingival cell cultures to TLR agonist challenge and profiled the expression of 600 miRNAs. We found strong up-regulation of hsa-miR-105 specifically in the diminished cytokine-response phenotype and furthermore showed that TLR-2 protein levels were depressed. This implies a concordant logic circuit in which miR-105 inversely regulates TLR-2 function. A computational (in silico) search of the miRNA database revealed that TLR-2 transcript is a potential target for miR-105 regulation at the 3′-UTR. This binding was confirmed using a linked luciferase reporter gene, and through small interference RNA and inhibitor (antagomir) studies a functional association with cell surface TLR-2 expression. We also confirmed this complementarity. We conclude that cell surface TLR-2 expression is inversely regulated by miR-105 expression in human gingival epithelial cells. This mechanism may reduce inflammatory cytokine production and provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention. A total of 13 human gingival epithelial cells (keratinocytes), with University of Louisville IRB approval, were obtained from healthy patients after third molar extraction.

At confluence, they were challenged with heat-inactivated P. gingivalis (strain 33277) or 1 μg/ml FSL-1 (Pam2CGDPKHPKSF, a synthetic diacylated lipoprotein and a specific ligand for TLR-2) (InvivoGen, CA). Cells were challenged for 24 h, and culture supernatants were subjected to IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences). The transcription factor NF-κB assay was performed using a modified electrophoretic mobility shift assay technique with TransAMTM NF-κB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from ActiveMotif (Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293 (ATCC number: CRL-1573) cells were cultured following ATCC protocol. Briefly, the cell monolayer was washed and incubated with 2–3 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution to the flask and neutralized with trypsin inhibitor after 5 min. The cells were centrifuged and suspended in ATCC-formulated Eagle's minimum essential medium (catalogue no. 30-2003) with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium). The cells were propagated in complete medium until they were ready for transfection. Total RNA was collected by the TRIzol method and purified with a Qiagen purification kit (Qiagen), and total RNA quality was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Equal amounts of each sample were used to generate a reference pool. For each array to be hybridized, 2 μg of total RNA from each sample, and the reference pool were labeled with Hy3TM and Hy5TM fluorescent label, respectively, using the miRCURYTM LNA Array labeling kit (Exiqon, Denmark) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Hy3TM-labeled sample and the Hy5TM-labeled reference pool RNA were mixed and hybridized to the miRCURYTM LNA array version 8.1 (Exiqon). The hybridization was performed according to the miRCURYTM LNA array manual using a Tecan HS4800 hybridization station (Tecan, Austria). The miRCURYTM LNA array microarray slides were scanned by a ScanArray 4000 XL scanner (Packard Biochip Technologies), and the image analysis was carried out using the ImaGene 7.0 software (BioDiscovery, Inc.). Expression ratios were determined for microarray data by computing the background-corrected fluorescent signal from the query sample (Q)/reference sample (R). Ratiometric data were transformed to log 2 to produce a continuous spectrum of up- and down-regulated values. Data were normalized by plotting the difference, log 2(Q/R), against the average, (1/2) log 2(Q*R) followed by the application of locally weighted regression (lowness) to smooth intensity-dependent ratios. The log 2(Hy3/Hy5) intensity data were uploaded into GeneSpring v7.3 for two-way analysis of variance (factors = cell-line and second treatment), using a parametric test with variances assumed equal, α cutoff (p = 0.05) to generate a heat-map through bi-directional hierarchical clustering (31Eisen M.B.

Birth Defects Res. Part A. Clin. Mol. Teratol. 2007; 79: 319-350Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The isolated total RNA samples were used for first strand cDNA synthesis with specific miR-105 hairpin loop primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed by using 1 ng of cDNA with an miR-105-specific primer and probe on an ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of TaqMan DNA polymerase. The data were analyzed by normalizing miRNA level to miRNA RNU48 (small nucleolar RNA used as internal control, which has least variability across the cell types and challenges). For TLR-2 mRNA quantification, the total RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA using a cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) and 100 ng of cDNA to quantify TLR-2 mRNA using the TaqMan method (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the internal control, and –fold increase was calculated as described (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were transfected with 100 pmol of miR-105 mimic (UCAAAUGCUCAGACUCCUGUGGU) and miR-105 inhibitor (AGTTTACGAGTCTGAGGACACCA) (Dharmacon, CA) and co-transfected with 100 pmol of small interference RNA control, labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein to monitor transfection efficiency. The transfection reaction was performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were challenged with P. gingivalis/FSL-1 for 24 h following transfection. The cells were seeded onto collagen-coated chamber glass slides (Lab-TekTM II Chamber Slide®, Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY). At 50–60% confluence, the cells were transfected either with miR-105 mimic or miR-105 inhibitor or with scrambled small interference RNA using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. The transfection reaction was performed for up to 24 h and replaced with fresh medium. The challenge assay was performed after 48 h of transfection with FSL-1 (0.5 μg/ml, InvitroGen), they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with anti-human TLR-2 antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse IgG in 3% bovine serum albumin (1/500, InvitroGen) for 1 h at room temperature and SYTO® 83-orange for 15 min. The stained cultures were photographed using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (FV500, Olympus, Melville, NY). Total protein was extracted from cells using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer after 24 h of challenge. The Western blot was performed by loading 25 μg of total proteins on to each lane. Blotted membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat milk and incubated at 4 °C overnight in anti-TLR-2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The membranes were washed and incubated in anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibody and signal was developed using ECL plusTM Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The ratiometric analysis of band intensity was calculated using FluorChem HD software (Alpha Innotech). The putative miRNA-105 target site of 52 bp within the 3′-UTR region of human TLR-2 mRNA (Ensembl transcript ID: ENST 00000260010) were synthesized with flanking SpeI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites. In addition, the primers with their putative binding site mutated, were also synthesized from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (sense primers: 5′-gctgactagtCATAGATGATCAAGTCCCTTATAAGAGTGGCATAGTATTTGCATATAACaagcttggac-3′; antisense primer: 5′-gtccaagcttGTTATATGCAAATACTATGCCACTCTTATAAGGGACTTGATCATCTATGactagtcagc-3′; mutated sense primer: 5′-gctgactagtCATAGATGATCAAGTCCCTTATAAGAGTGGCATAGTCATATAACaagcttggac-3′; and mutated antisense primer: 5′-gtccaagcttGTTATATGACTATGCCACTCTTATAAGGGACTTGATCATCTATGactagtcagc-3′). The sense and antisense strands of the oligonucleotides were annealed (34Chen X.M. Splinter P.L. O'Hara S.P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28929-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The annealed oligonucleotides were digested with SpeI and HindIII and ligated into the multiple cloning site of the pMIRREPORT Luciferase vector (Ambion, Inc.). The post-transcriptional regulation of pMIRREPORT luciferase vector was potentially regulated by miRNA interactions with the TLR-2 3′-UTR. We then transfected cultured HEK293 cells with each of these reporter constructs (pMIR-TLR2 or pMIR-mutTLR-2), as well as co-transfecting them with pMIF-cGFP-Zeo-miR-105 (pMIF-miR-105) plasmid (System Biosciences) following transfection with FuGENE 6 as noted above. Luciferase expression was assessed by confocal microscopy 24 h after transfection by use of anti-Luciferase antibody (Abcam). The protein extract from the transfected cells was collected using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and equal amounts of protein were tested by a Luciferase activity assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The microarray statistical analysis is detailed under “miRNA Array Profiling/Analysis” above. The mRNA -fold increase data were calculated according to the ΔΔCT method (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Cytokine data were evaluated by analysis of variance using the InStat program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) with Bonferroni corrections applied. Statistical differences were declared significant at p < 0.05 level. Statistically significant data are indicated by asterisks (p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***)). We hypothesized that miRNAs may play a role in innate immune response variation (25Kinane D.F. Galicia J.C. Gorr S.U. Stathopoulou P.G. Benakanakere M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and could differentiate periodontitis disease-susceptible and disease-resistant subjects. From a bank of over 30 primary cell cultures of human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) (2Kinane D.F. Shiba H. Stathopoulou P.G. Zhao H. Lappin D.F. Singh A. Eskan M.A. Beckers S. Waigel S. Alpert B. Knudsen T.B. Genes Immun. 2006; 7: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) we selected cultures having a diminished cytokine response type and “normal” response type as reported previously. Briefly, the rule specification for the latter selected cells that up-regulated IL-6 and TNF-α production by at least 2-fold after 4-h challenge with TLR agonists, and the rule for the former (diminished) phenotype was no significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production after challenge. We thus tested in depth the 3 diminished cytokine response primary cultures against 3 representatives of the normal HGEC type chosen from the median of the range of the 13 available cultures (2Kinane D.F. Shiba H. Stathopoulou P.G. Zhao H. Lappin D.F. Singh A. Eskan M.A. Beckers S. Waigel S. Alpert B. Knudsen T.B. Genes Immun. 2006; 7: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We performed chip-based miRNA profiling from normal and diminished cytokine response cells challenged with heat-inactivated P. gingivalis, a TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonist. The data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data base under the platform GPL7423 and series GSE13042 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). In the preliminary statistical analysis, the normalized miRNA data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (phenotype, treatment, and interaction) for all miRNA chips. Of the 600 miRNA species tested on the platform, 95 miRNAs were significantly different between phenotypes and 45 between treatments. Among the 109 miRNAs that were differentially expressed only 26 were well annotated. These 26 were significantly altered by challenge with heat-inactivated P. gingivalis when compared with unstimulated cells (p = 0.0038). The miR-105 signal was markedly down-regulated in normal versus diminished cells after TLR agonist challenge (Fig. 1A) (p = 0.0017). In silico analyses revealed 1060 hits for miR-105 targets and predicted complimentarity to TLR-2 (Fig. 1C). Because we noted miR-105 up-regulation in the diminished cytokine response cells, we constructed a computational matrix for miR-105 targets, which revealed 37 potential mRNA targets across species. In matrix, hsa-miR-577 and hsa-miR-19b were also differentially expressed between normal and diminished cells but to a lesser degree than miR-105 (see dotted box in Fig. 1A). Numerical expression values were plotted to show the difference between normal and diminished cell types (Fig. 1B). For this reason, we focused on miR-105. Because P. gingivalis signals through both TLR-2 and TLR-4 (2Kinane D.F. Shiba H. Stathopoulou P.G. Zhao H. Lappin D.F. Singh A. Eskan M.A. Beckers S. Waigel S. Alpert B. Knudsen T.B. Genes Immun. 2006; 7: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Eskan M.A. Hajishengallis G. Kinane D.F. Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) we evaluated TLR-2 mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR after challenging both cell types with FSL-1, a specific agonist to TLR-2. Analysis of TLR-2 mRNA abundance between phenotypes revealed a 2.5-fold up-regulation with P. gingivalis challenge and a 4.5-fold up-regulation with FSL-1 challenge relative to the unstimulated control (p = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). In striking contrast, diminished cytokine response cells did not show this up-regulation (Fig. 2A). TLR-2 induction upon P. gingivalis or FSL-1 stimulation is consistent with TLR-2 recognition of P. gingivalis (36Darveau R.P. Pham T.T. Lemley K. Reife R.A. Bainbridge B.W. Coats S.R. Howald W.N. Way S.S. Hajjar A.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5041-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 37Burns E. Bachrach G. Shapira L. Nussbaum G. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8296-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 cytokine protein levels corresponded to corresponding mRNA levels. Normal response cells up-regulated their IL-6 (Fig. 2B) and TNF-α (Fig. 2C) production following P. gingivalis or FSL-1 challenge, and again this response was not evident in diminished response cells (Fig. 2, B and C). We also explored IL-12p40 secretion in the gingival epithelial cells after P. gingivalis and FSL-1 challenge. The primary gingival epithelial cells do not secret IL-12p40. 3M. R. Benakanakere, Q. Li, M. A. Eskan, A. V. Singh, J. Zhao, J. C. Galicia, P. Stathopoulou, T. B. Knudsen, and D. F. Kinane, unpublished data. This has to be further verified and hence not included in the present study. Confirmation of the differential expression of miR-105 was sought by a non-array method. The real-time PCR data indicated an 8-fold up-regulation of miR-105 following P. gingivalis challenge, and an 11-fold increase following FSL-1 challenge, in diminished-response cells relative to an internal benchmark, miRNA RNU48 (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the microarray data, the normal response cells did not show significant up-regulation of miR-105 (Fig. 3). Search of the open miRNA data base revealed over 1060 potential target transcripts for miR-105. These potential target genes were loaded onto Ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity Systems Inc.) software to discover the most significant pathways associated with the global miR-105 target genes. This analysis revealed a preponderance of immune diseases (data not shown) and identified TLR-2 as one of the important targets. Because microarray profiling revealed miR-105 as the most significant miRNA discriminating between normal and diminished HGEP phenotypes, we tested for evidence that miR-105 expression would down-regulate TLR-2 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines in the 3 selected cell types, as well as across the broader panel of 13 HGECs available. This analysis revealed a generalized, strong inverse correlation between TLR2 protein and miR-105 gene expression (Fig. 3, B and C). We next sought to determine whether miR-105 directly modulated TLR-2 mRNA and/or protein expression in HGECs. To test this, we transfected miR-105 mimic (same sequence as mature miR-105) and miR-105 antagomir (sequence complementary to miR-105, which blocks its effect) to diminished cytokine cell phenotypes. After miR-105 transfection, the cells were challenged for 24 h with either heat-inactivated P. gingivalis or FSL-1. The diminished cytokine response cells transfected with miR-105 antagomir up-regulated the TLR-2 protein levels in either challenge (Fig. 4A) compared with mock transfected cells. This indicates a role for miR-105 in modulating TLR-2 protein expression and implies a post-transcriptional repression of TLR-2 translation. However, the miR-105 antagomir control cells expressed higher TLR-2 protein versus non-transfected cells. This implies a role for miR-105 in modulating basal receptor expression, an inference supported by the correlation of TLR-2 and miR-105 (Fig. 3, B and C). Evidence for a functional relationship was sought by transfecting miR-105 antagomir into diminished cytokine response cells challenged with P. gingivalis and FSL-1. This scenario induced significantly higher IL-6 and TNF-α compared with mock control, confirming that miR-105 overexpression is biologically relevant (Fig. 4, C and D). Because we previously showed that P. gingivalis activates NF-κB (38Brozovic S. Sahoo R. Barve S. Shiba H. Uriarte S. Blumberg R.S. Kinane D.F. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and induces cytokines (39Sandros J. Karlsson C. Lappin D.F. Madianos P.N. Kinane D.F. Papapanou P.N. J. Dent.

https://openalex.org/W2047438086,"miRNAs have emerged as important players in the regulation of gene expression and their deregulation is a common feature in a variety of diseases, especially cancer. Currently, many efforts are focused on studying miRNA expression patterns, as well as miRNA target validation. Here, we show that the over expression of miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster in HEK293T cells induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent pathway as proved by the annexin assay, caspase activation, release of cytochrome-c and AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) from mitochondria. Furthermore, the over expressed cluster modulates the expression of a number of genes involved in apoptosis including FADD (Fas Associated protein with Death Domain). Bioinformatically, FADD is predicted to be the target of hsa-miR-27a and interestingly, FADD protein was found to be up regulated consistent with very less expression of hsa-miR-27a in HEK293T cells. This effect was direct, as hsa-miR-27a negatively regulated the expression of FADD 3′UTR based reporter construct. Moreover, we also showed that over expression of miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 sensitized HEK293T cells to TNF-α cytotoxicity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that enhanced TNF-α induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells by over expression of miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster provides new insights in the development of novel therapeutics for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1968960234,"The gut microbiota has been proposed as an environmental factor that affects the development of metabolic and inflammatory diseases in mammals. Recent reports indicate that gut bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can initiate obesity and insulin resistance in mice; however, the molecular interactions responsible for microbial regulation of host metabolism and mediators of inflammation have not been studied in detail. Hepatic serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are markers and proposed mediators of inflammation that exhibit increased levels in serum of insulin-resistant mice. Adipose tissue-derived SAA3 displays monocyte chemotactic activity and may play a role in metabolic inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance. To investigate a potential mechanistic link between the intestinal microbiota and induction of proinflammatory host factors, we performed molecular analyses of germ-free, conventionally raised and genetically modified Myd88−/− mouse models. SAA3 expression was determined to be significantly augmented in adipose (9.9±1.9-fold; P<0.001) and colonic tissue (7.0±2.3-fold; P<0.05) by the presence of intestinal microbes. In the colon, we provided evidence that SAA3 is partially regulated through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling axis. We identified epithelial cells and macrophages as cellular sources of SAA3 in the colon and found that colonic epithelial expression of SAA3 may be part of an NF-kappaB-dependent response to LPS from gut bacteria. In vitro experiments showed that LPS treatments of both epithelial cells and macrophages induced SAA3 expression (27.1±2.5-fold vs. 1.6±0.1-fold, respectively). Our data suggest that LPS, and potentially other products of the indigenous gut microbiota, might elevate cytokine expression in tissues and thus exacerbate chronic low-grade inflammation observed in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2146565556,"Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), a gene identified from the critical region of Down syndrome, has been implied in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RCAN1 expression was shown to be increased in AD brains;however, the mechanism of RCAN1 gene regulation is not well defined. The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of RCAN1 protein degradation. In addition to being degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, we found that lysosomal inhibition markedly increased RCAN1 protein expression in a time- and dosage-dependent manner. Inhibition of macroautophagy reduced RCAN1 expression, indicating that RCAN1 degradation is not through a macroautophagy pathway. However, disruption of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) increased RCAN1 expression. Two CMA recognition motifs were indentified in RCAN1 protein to mediate its degradation through a CMA-lysosome pathway. A promoter assay further demonstrated that inhibition of RCAN1 degradation in cells reduced calcineurin-NFAT activity. Dysfunctions of ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, elucidation of RCAN1 degradation by a ubiquitin proteasome pathway and CMA-lysosome pathway in the present study may greatly advance our understanding of AD pathogenesis.—Liu, H., Wang, P., Song, W., Sun, X.

Others and we have shown that biliverdin is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule, however, the mechanism by which BV exerts its protective effects is unclear. We describe and elucidate a novel finding demonstrating that BVR is expressed on the external plasma membrane of macrophages (and other cells) where it quickly converts BV to BR. The enzymatic conversion of BV to BR on the surface by BVR initiates a signaling cascade through tyrosine phosphorylation of BVR on the cytoplasmic tail. Phosphorylated BVR in turn binds to the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and activates downstream signaling to Akt. Using bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) to initiate an inflammatory response in macrophages, we find a rapid increase in BVR surface expression. One of the mechanisms by which BV mediates its protective effects in response to lipopolysaccharide is through enhanced production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) the prototypical anti-inflammatory cytokine. IL-10 regulation is dependent in part on the activation of Akt. The effects of BV on IL-10 expression are lost with blockade of Akt. Inhibition of surface BVR with RNA interference attenuates BV-induced Akt signaling and IL-10 expression and in vivo negates the cytoprotective effects of BV in models of shock and acute hepatitis.

The mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood and to date have not been linked to BVR activity per se, but attributed rather to the antioxidant power of biliverdin and bilirubin. biliverdin reductase dimethyl sulfoxide lipopolysaccharide phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interleukin human embryonic kidney phosphate-buffered saline small interfering RNA interfering RNA adenovirus total internal reflective fluorescence bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay fluorescence-activated cell sorter bilirubin wild type. The concept that BVR may be an ideal docking protein for SH-2 domains (4Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Torno M.D. Kravets A. Hu Z. Maines M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) combined with the known anti-inflammatory effects of the bile pigments and rapid conversion of BV to BR in vivo, led us to hypothesize that BVR is expressed on the membrane and through its kinase activity regulates Akt signaling via recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We present novel findings that the ability of biliverdin to prevent LPS-induced morbidity and mortality most likely requires BVR surface expression for specific activation of PI3K-Akt and IL-10. We suggest that this is the major pathway by which biliverdin inhibits the inflammatory response and that these molecular events are natural protective mechanisms involved in the innate immune response to bacterial endotoxin that enables homeostasis. The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (RAW), and HEK cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). For treatment, cells were seeded 24 h before experiment. Biliverdin (Frontier Scientific) was freshly prepared in DMSO (Sigma) and kept in the dark before and during treatment. Final concentration of DMSO in medium was <0.01%. LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B08, Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and used for treatment at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 ng/ml. GGTI-287, a selective inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase I (Calbiochem), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Sigma), and dl-Β-hydroxymyristic acid (Sigma) were dissolved in DMSO and used at concentrations of 1, 3, and 100 μm, respectively. LY294002 (Sigma; 10 μm) was used as a selective inhibitor of PI3K. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated and cultured as previously described (13Chin B.Y. Jiang G. Wegiel B. Wang H.J. Macdonald T. Zhang X.C. Gallo D. Cszimadia E. Bach F.H. Lee P.J. Otterbein L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5109-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Adenovirus containing Cre recombinase was used at 50 multiplicity of infection on the third day of culture. Macrophages were treated and harvested on the fifth day of culture. C57BL6/J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. PI3K p85Β−/−/p85α loxp mice were kindly provided by Prof. Lewis Cantley (BIDMC, Harvard Medical School). All animals were held under pathogen-free conditions and the experiments were approved by the BIDMC Animal Care and Use Committee. Lung, liver, and spleen as well as blood samples were harvested for immunohistochemical and immunostaining analyses from control and LPS-injected mice (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 6 h. Biliverdin/bilirubin was freshly dissolved in 0.2 n NaOH, adjusted to a final pH of 7.4 with HCl, and kept in the dark. Mice were administered biliverdin or bilirubin (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 16 h and again 2 h prior to LPS/d-galactosamine (250 μg/kg, intraperitoneal/750 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; E. coli serotype 0127:08, Sigma). Serum bilirubin levels were evaluated spectrophotometrically (Sigma Kit), according to the manufacturer’s protocol in a separate group of non-LPS-treated mice. For adenovirus experiments, mice were administered either Ad-BVR-siRNA or Ad-Y5 (2 × 109 plaque-forming units intraperitoneally) 5 days prior to LPS/d-Gal. Liver, lung, and spleen tissue samples were embedded in freezing medium and stored at −80 °C. Five-μm sections were fixed in cold acetone and embedded in paraffin followed by immunohistochemistry using fluorescently tagged or horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody as previously described (10Fondevila C. Shen X.D. Tsuchiyashi S. Yamashita K. Csizmadia E. Lassman C. Busuttil R.W. Kupiec-Weglinski J.W. Bach F.H. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RAW cells were seeded on glass (Fisher) and treated with 10–100 ng/ml LPS for various time points as described. For detection of surface antigens, cells were rinsed in PBS and blocked with 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin, RIA grade, Sigma) in PBS for 1 h followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. Staining of intracellular antigens was performed by membrane permeabilizers with Triton X-100 or methanol, followed by rinsing with PBS and blocking with 0.5% BSA in PBS. Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed, fixed with 0.25% paraformaldehyde, and covered with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (+/−) mounting medium. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss Apotome Axiovert microscope at ×40 or ×60 magnification. For flow cytometric analysis of surface antigens, cells were gently harvested, centrifuged (300 × g for 5 min), and washed in PBS. Cells were blocked in 0.5% BSA in PBS for 30 min followed by 30 min incubation with primary antibodies. Afterward, cells were washed with blocking buffer and resuspended in fluorescently labeled antibodies and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min followed by extensive washing with PBS. Cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACS Sorter). TIRF measurements were performed on cells culture and stained as for immunofluorescence analysis with few modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded on the glass and after treatment, washed with 1× PBS. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were rehydrated with 5 washes of PBS and blocked for 45 min with 2% BSA. Following staining cells were washed, stained with Hoechst for 30 s, and coverslipped with gelvatol and refrigerated until analysis with a TIRF microscope. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting analyses where indicated: rabbit anti-biliverdin reductase (Stressgen); rat anti-F4.80 (Vector Laboratory); mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Calbiochem); mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories); and rabbit anti-phospho(Ser473)-Akt, rabbit anti-Akt, mouse anti-PI3K p85α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For fluorescence microscopy: FITC-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma); fluorescein anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratory); FITC anti-goat IgG (BD Sciences), and Alexa Fluor 350 anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes) were used. Cytosolic and membrane cell fractions were isolated following the manufacturer’s protocol of the Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (BioVision, CA). Briefly, cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in homogenization buffer, and incubated on ice for 1 h. To isolate total cellular membrane proteins, cell or liver homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. To purify plasma membrane protein, the pellet was resuspended in a 1:1 upper phase solution:lower phase solution, followed by 5 min incubation on ice. The lower phase was extracted twice with the upper phase solution by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The upper phase was collected and diluted in 5 volumes of water for 5 min on ice. The pellet of the plasma membrane protein was obtained by centrifugation for 10 min (14,000 × g). Protein extracts were subjected to further analyses by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and for biliverdin reductase activity assay as previously described (14Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overlap extension PCR was applied for construction of point mutation in hBVR cDNA and followed by ligation to pcDNA3.1 plasmid between KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. The following primers were used with the underlined mutation and marked restriction sites: 1) 5′-CGACGGTACCGAAGGAAGAGACCAAGATGAA-3′; 2) 5′-GAAAGGAAGATCAGTTCATGAAAAT-3′; 3) 5′-GACACTCGAGTGGAAGTGCTACATCACCT-3′; 4) 5′-CTTTCCTTCTAGTCAAGTACTTTTACTGTCA-3′. In PCR-1, primers 1 and 4 were used to amplify a fragment of 609 bp and in PCR-2, primers 2 and 3 gave a fragment of 335 bp. Both fragments gave the whole BVR cDNA with point mutation in the PCR-3 with primers 1 and 3. Proper cloning and mutagenesis were verified by restriction site analysis and sequencing. The Glu97 and Glu47 mutants were generated as previously described and characterized (27Kikuchi A. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Sun D. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). BVR97 (Glu → Ala) was cloned as a single fragment between the KpnI and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1 and the mutation was introduced using the following primer: 5′-TCC CGA GGG CCC TTC TCG ACA CGA AGC C. BVR47 (Glu → Ala) was cloned between the KpnI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 using the following primers: 1) 5′-CTG AGC GGC CGC CAA TGA CAG TGT CAT GGG GTA GGC CAC AAG G; and 2) 5′-CGA GAA GGG CCC TCG GGA GCA TTG ATG GAG. Dominant-negative Akt and control constructs were a kind gift from Dr. Alex Toker (BIDMC). RAW cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Amaxa nucleofection reagents (Amaxa) according to the vendor’s protocol. HEK cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 200 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfection efficiency estimated by FACS analysis (BD Biosciences FACSort) was 30–40%. Pre-designed and verified annealed RNAi against BVRa, GFP RNAi, and negative control RNAi were purchased from Ambion (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Fifty nm RNAi was used for each transfection together with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In some experiments re-transfection with RNAi after 2 days of incubation was performed. BVR protein knock-down was confirmed 100 h after transfection as previously described (15Wegiel B. Bjartell A. Culig Z. Persson J.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Snap-frozen tissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold tissue lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini) (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). 10–20 μg of each protein sample was electrophoresed on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) in NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen). For co-immunoprecipitation, 100–500 μg of protein lysates in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture) were mixed with appropriate antibodies and 30 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) and then rocked for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The proteins were washed with RIPA buffer and eluted (95 °C, 5 min in SDS loading buffer). The proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Ready Gel Blotting Sandwiches; Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, probed with appropriate primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000, and visualized using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) or Femto Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Pierce), followed by exposure to the autoradiography film (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT). IL-10 was measured in culture medium using Quantikine Immunoassay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparison was performed by use of Student’s t test (SPSS Inc) (p < 0.05). We employed several techniques, including TIRF microscopy, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry (FACS) to demonstrate that BVR is expressed on the external plasma membrane. Live cell imaging of BVR activity showed rapid conversion (seconds) of non-fluorescent biliverdin to fluorescent bilirubin (emission at 512 nm), which was lost in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). These observations lead us to hypothesize that BVR may be a membrane protein with an active site present on the external leaflet of the membrane. Co-immunostaining with BVR and the macrophage-specific F4.80 antibodies show the co-localization of surface BVR with the well characterized surface antigen in unstimulated RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophages (Fig. 1B). BVR and F4.80 co-stained cells were then imaged by Z-stack analysis with similar results (Fig. 1C). The induced expression of BVR by LPS on the cell surface was observed via TIRF microscopy (Fig. 1D), which permits specific detection of surface-only expressed proteins. We next tested the effects of LPS on BVR expression in macrophages to potentially understand the anti-inflammatory actions of biliverdin that others and we have reported (6Sarady-Andrews J.K. Liu F. Gallo D. Nakao A. Overhaus M. Ollinger R. Choi A.M. Otterbein L.E. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2005; 289: L1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There was a clear induction of BVR on the cell surface as measured by flow cytometry of non-permeabilized RAW cells (Fig. 2A). LPS administration resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in BVR surface expression as early as 30 min after treatment with LPS, suggesting post-transcriptional activation of BVR (Fig. 2, B and C). LPS had no effect on the level of total BVR (data not shown), whereas it up-regulated membrane-bound BVR. We confirmed the time-dependent increase in membrane BVR after LPS (100 ng/ml) treatment by immunoblotting the lysates of membrane fractions in macrophages (Fig. 2D). This was specific for membrane expression as no change in BVR expression in total lysates was observed Fig. 2D). To evaluate whether our in vitro data were reflected in vivo, we performed immunohistochemical staining for BVR in the livers of mice treated with LPS. Staining results revealed induction of BVR in hepatic macrophages 6 h after LPS injection (Fig. 2E) with surface expression detected by double staining with antibodies to BVR and the macrophage marker F4.80 (Fig. 2E). Finally, to substantiate BVR membrane localization and activity, we performed quantitative experiments with purified membrane fragments. Addition of biliverdin to cells resulted in rapid generation of bilirubin with an increase in absorbance at 450 nm at 1 h from 0.003 ± 0.001 to 0.007 ± 0.001 relative activity change in the cytosolic fraction versus an increase from 0.005 ± 0.002 to 0.015 ± 0.002 (p < 0.02) in purified membrane fractions. Collectively, the data presented in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 support membrane-bound, enzymatically active BVR on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane. A structure analysis of BVR using the transmembrane prediction program (16Persson B. Argos P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) identified a 24-amino acid transmembrane segment among three α-helixes (163–186 amino acids) (Fig. 3A). The C terminus of BVR comprises specific prenylation sites for geranylgeranyl transferase (CLGL), which in addition to five myristoylation sites may be crucial for recruitment and association of BVR to the membrane (Fig. 3, A and B). Lipid modifications of many proteins enable them to localize to the plasma membrane (17Magee T. Seabra M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Inhibition of prenylation or myristoylation prevented LPS-induced cell surface BVR expression (p < 0.005), whereas addition of GGPP resulted in augmentation of LPS-induced BVR surface expression (Fig. 3C; p < 0.01 versus LPS). These data demonstrate that BVR is translocated from the cytosol to the cell membrane by post-translational protein modification, i.e. prenylation and myristoylation. The tyrosine phosphorylation motif (YMKM) is also present in the BVR sequence as previously described (4Lerner-Marmarosh N. Shen J. Torno M.D. Kravets A. Hu Z. Maines M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Although the data in Fig. 3 do not distinguish between internal and external BVR leaflet localization, the data in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 support the concept that BVR is localized to the external plasma surface. To test our hypothesis that surface BVR interacts with a downstream kinase proximal to the membrane via its tyrosine phosphorylation motif, we explored a possible complex formation between BVR and the p85α subunit of PI3K in RAW macrophages. The p85α subunit of PI3K co-immunoprecipitates with BVR in BV-treated RAW cells without changing the total BVR or p85α expression in the lysates (Fig. 4A). After biliverdin treatment, BVR is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 4B) and there is greater binding of p85α to BVR (Fig. 4A). Mutation of the tyrosine that is responsible for the kinase activity (Tyr → Phe198) or catalytically inactive mutant (Glu → Ala97) resulted in a reduced interaction of BVR with p85α in response to BV (Fig. 4C). The Tyr198-Met199-Lys200-Met201 (YMKM) motif within BVR appears to be the binding site for the p85α subunit of PI3K leading to BV-BVR-mediated induction of Akt. Overexpression of BVR or either mutant had any effect on BVR or p85 expression (Fig. 4D). Given that Akt is downstream of PI3K, we next tested the effects of biliverdin administration on Akt activation. BV induced a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in RAW cells (Fig. 5, A and B) and in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 5D). To test whether the effect of BV-induced activation of Akt is dependent on a PI3K-BVR interaction we used pharmacological and genetic approaches. The effect of BV on Akt phosphorylation is blocked by LY290024, a selective inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 5C). We show that the effect of biliverdin is specifically mediated by the p85α subunit of PI3K but not the PI3KΒ subunit by employing bone marrow-derived macrophages from p85Β PI3K−/− and conditional loxp p85α PI3K mice. The absence of p85α resulted in an inability of BV to activate Akt, whereas BV was able to activate Akt in bone marrow macrophages in wild type cells (Fig. 5D). Although there was increased phosphorylation of Akt after expression of WT BVR, introduction of a mutated (Tyr → Phe198) BVR blocked Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). To confirm and validate the activation of Akt by BVR, we employed BVR mutants on BV-induced downstream targets. We observed strong phosphorylation of S6 protein (Fig. 5E) as supportive evidence of Akt activation, which was inhibited by pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K (data not shown). Introduction of a catalytically inactive mutant Glu → Ala97 resulted in a loss in the ability of BVR to convert biliverdin to bilirubin (supplemental Fig. S2). Importantly, inhibition in the binding of p85α to PI3K to BVR (Fig. 5B), and subsequent loss of S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 5F) in cells treated with BV suggests that the activity of BVR is critical for the receptor function of BVRsurf. We also generated an additional BVR mutant Glu → Ala47, which is catalytically active (supplemental Fig. S3) but the edge of the binding pocket for BV and NADH/NADPH is disrupted. With expression of this particular mutant, we observed inhibition of biliverdin-mediated Akt signaling, whereas WT BVR-mediated BV signaling remained normal (Fig. 5F). Previously we have shown that BV enhances IL-10 expression in macrophages and in vivo in rats. Therefore, we evaluated whether a functional link exists between BVR-mediated Akt signaling and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of BVR (70 ± 10% efficiency) led to increased IL-10 production in BV-stimulated RAW macrophages (Fig. 6A), whereas the Tyr → Pro198 mutant BVR blocked BV-induced signaling through PI3K-Akt to increase IL-10 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, introduction of a dominant-negative Akt abrogated BV-mediated induction of IL-10 (Fig. 6C). LPS stimulates rapid induction of HO-1 and biliverdin thereby becomes available as a substrate for BVR as heme is degraded. To test the function of BVR in LPS-mediated IL-10 production, we overexpressed or silenced BVR (Fig. 6, B–D). Overexpression of BVR enhanced LPS-induced production of IL-10 (Fig. 6B), whereas inhibition of BVR or Akt with siRNA or dominant-negative mutants led to significant inhibition of IL-10 production (Fig. 6, C and D). These data suggest that BV acts in part via a BVR-PI3K-Akt pathway to mediate its anti-inflammatory effects in response to LPS through augmented expression of IL-10 and offers one explanation for BV-elicited protection, in addition to its antioxidant power. The regulation of IL-10 expression by BV/BVR, whereas significant is not striking and we speculate that IL-10 regulation is only part of the mechanism by which BV modulates the inflammatory response to impart protection in the animal models described below. We next evaluated the in vivo conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin and the efficacy in a model of lethal endotoxic shock. Biliverdin given as a bolus to mice was rapidly converted to bilirubin, reaching a maximum concentration of bilirubin of 50 ± 7.4 μm at 5 min (the earliest time point measured) from a baseline of 6 ± 2.8 μm at 5 min (p < 0.001), and returning to baseline by 6 h (data not shown). We also tested the ability of biliverdin to prevent acute inflammation following a lethal injection of LPS alone or LPS/d-Gal (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) to induce acute liver failure. One group of mice received biliverdin (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 16 and 2 h prior to LPS-treated mice or LPS/d-Gal-treated mice, whereas controls received saline in both models. In the experiment with LPS alone, all saline-treated mice were dead by 24 h, whereas 100% of biliverdin-treated mice survived long-term (Fig. 7A). We further confirmed our observation with LPS/d-Gal treatment and observed 80% survival rate in the BV-treated group (Fig. 7B). To test whether the protection conferred by biliverdin required the action of BVR, we blocked BVR with an adenovirus expressing BVR-siRNA based on the published sequence (7Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Separate groups of mice were administered 2 × 109 plaque-forming units/mouse intravenously of either Ad-BVR-siRNA or Ad-Y5 control virus, diluted in normal saline. After 5 days, the time when viral expression is maximal and results in high and specific expression of the vector primarily in the liver, we administered LPS/d-Gal in the presence and absence of biliverdin. Six to eight hours later, serum alanine aminotransferase was measured and the livers were harvested and snap frozen for subsequent Western blot analyses. Animals treated with BV or BV+Y5 control virus showed significant inhibition in LPS/d-Gal-induced hepatitis as assessed by serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. BV, but not bilirubin (BR) at the doses tested, blocked LPS/d-Gal-induced increases in alanine aminotransferase, whereas those animals in which BVR was blocked with BVR-siRNA expressed serum alanine aminotransferase levels comparable with LPS/D-Gal controls (Fig. 7C). BVR knockdown was confirmed by Western blot in liver lysates (Fig. 7C, inset). These data validate our in vitro data showing that the protection afforded by BV requires the activity of BVR. We describe here a novel paradigm showing that BVR, the enzyme that converts biliverdin to bilirubin, is a surface protein (BVRsurf) that initiates a signaling cascade upon the binding of biliverdin involving PI3K, activation of Akt, and downstream production of IL-10. We suggest that the remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of biliverdin, previously attributed solely to the antioxidant properties of biliverdin and bilirubin, are in very significant part mediated via this novel mechanism (6Sarady-Andrews J.K.

Smith D.L. Zucker S.D. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We submit that BVR functions in part as a ligand-activated signaling protein that resembles tyrosine kinase receptors and as such is directly involved in regulation of the innate immune response. We define this localized membrane form as BVRsurf. BVR has been studied with regard to functions other than converting biliverdin to bilirubin. It has been shown by others that BVR can function as a kinase (3Salim M. Brown-Kipphut B.A. Maines M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9226-9232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). BVR is present in various compartments of the cell including the inner cell membrane in endothelial cells in association with HO-1 (18Maines M.D. Ewing J.F. Huang T.J. Panahian N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kim H.P. Wang X. Galbiati F. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There are to date many reports in the literature demonstrating the ability of biliverdin to modulate the inflammatory response. The protective potential of biliverdin/bilirubin stems from a history of studies of the enzyme HO-1 (20Stocker R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). HO-1 has emerged over the last decade as a powerful cytoprotective molecule, yet the mechanism(s) by which it functions remains unclear. HO-1 acts on heme and generates three products: biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and Fe2+. Recent studies of these products have begun to shed light on the mechanisms of HO-1 action as a homeostatic gene (8Nakao A. Otterbein L.E. Overhaus M. Sarady J.K. Tsung A. Kimizuka K.

The sequence of amino acids in BVR is consistent with our findings regarding the signaling cascade initiated by biliverdin-BVR. The tyrosine motif of BVR present on the cytosolic side resembles the binding motif of platelet-derived growth factor receptor for the p85α subunit of PI3K. We suggest that biliverdin stimulates BVR phosphorylation of tyrosine 198, which is the critical residue within the membrane that enables BVR to bind the p85α subunit of PI3K and signal to activate Akt. The regulation of this interaction is complex and perhaps in part involves low constitutive regulation due to continuous heme turnover by the cell during normal metabolism and therefore constitutive low basal levels of biliverdin being generated. This would explain the baseline interaction between BVR and p85-PI3K. An EYP (Glu97-Tyr98-Pro99) motif in the active site is believed to be necessary for biliverdin to bilirubin conversion, which lies in the external N terminus region of the enzyme. Indeed our data using the E97A mutant of BVR strongly support this site as important for conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin and for transmission of signaling by BVR. The electrons necessary for the reduction of biliverdin may originate either from extracellular NADH (e.g. by membrane NADH dehydrogenase) (25Garcia-Sancho J. Sanchez A. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or donated from other sources such as transmembrane transporters of electrons (e.g. NADPH oxidase) (26Sun I.L. Navas P. Crane F.L. Morré D.J. Löw H. Biochem. Int. 1987; 14: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). The E47A mutant did not affect conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin, however, it does affect the edge of the Β2 strand of substrate and cofactor binding in the pocket, which likely influences the strength of their interaction with BVR as characterized and reported by Kikuchi et al. (27Kikuchi A. Park S.Y. Miyatake H. Sun D. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If the binding of biliverdin is insufficient as is the case with many ligand-receptor interactions, BVR does not mediate the signaling to Akt and its downstream target S6 as evidenced by the E47A mutant. These data strongly suggest that conversion of BV to BR leads to a conformational change that is important in transmitting the signal. This aspect of BVR function may represent a similar transduction pattern as that observed with the Notch receptor. BVR in a manner similar to Notch could be cleaved and translocated to the nucleus to bind DNA as a cleaved fragment. The expression of BVR on the surface is an important finding and provides a key piece of the puzzle in our understanding of this enzyme and for the cytoprotective heme oxygenase system in general. The presence of surface BVR offers a novel and regulated cell signaling mechanism by which biliverdin as a ligand can exert anti-inflammatory (protective) effects other than via its antioxidant power. First, we elucidate a signaling pathway by which biliverdin as a ligand for BVR can direct cellular function toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype in addition to its antioxidant power. And finally we present relevant in vivo findings supporting a role for BVR in regulating the immune response to prevent multiorgan injury and failure in response to endotoxin. We suggest that this is a major natural mechanism used by the body for defense and to re-establish and maintain homeostasis. We acknowledge G. A.

https://openalex.org/W1980192737,"SMYD3 is a SET domain-containing protein with histone methyltransferase activity on histone H3–K4. Recent studies showed that SMYD3 is frequently overexpressed in different types of cancer cells, but how SMYD3 regulates the development and progression of these malignancies remains unknown. Here, we report the previously unrecognized role of SMYD3 in estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription via its histone methyltransferase activity. We demonstrate that SMYD3 functions as a coactivator of ERα and potentiates ERα activity in response to ligand. SMYD3 directly interacts with the ligand binding domain of ER and is recruited to the proximal promoter regions of ER target genes upon gene induction. Importantly, our chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses provide compelling evidence that SMYD3 is responsible for the accumulation of di- and trimethylation of H3–K4 at the induced ER target genes. Furthermore, RNA interference-directed down-regulation of SMYD3 reveals that SMYD3 is required for ER-regulated gene transcription in estrogen signaling pathway. Thus, our results identify SMYD3 as a new coactivator for ER-mediated transcription, providing a possible link between SMYD3 overexpression and breast cancer.

ER is comprised of several structural domains that are highly conserved in the various nuclear receptors: the N-terminal transcription activation domain, the DNA binding domain, the hinge region, and the C-terminal conserved ligand binding domain (5Enmark E.

Like other nuclear receptors, the ER collaborates with a number of transcriptional cofactors to effectively modulate transcription of its target genes (3Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G.

These cofactors appear to regulate the chromatin configuration in a highly specific manner by controlling nucleosomal rearrangement and histone modifications at the promoter (11McKenna N.J.

This targeted alteration of chromatin structure allows the transcriptional machinery to access the chromatin DNA and form functional preinitiation complexes, thereby facilitating transcription initiation (14Kim M.Y.

The remodeling activities include the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, which alter structure and position of nucleosomes at the promoters of ER target genes. These include proteins such as brahma-related BRG1 (also known as hBRG1 or hSNF2) and BRM, both of which are subunits of the mammalian homologue of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (17Yoshinaga S.K.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The second class of remodeling factors includes a diverse group of single/multisubunit factors that effect post-translational modifications of the histone tails protruding from the surface of the nucleosome (17Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 18Huang Z.Q. Li J. Sachs L.M. Cole P.A. Wong J.

Among the well known histone-modifying factors acting in ER-mediated transcription are histone acetyltransferases, including p300/CBP and GCN5/PCAF, and histone methyltransferases, including the arginine methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1, as well as SET domain lysine methyltransferases such as G9a, RIZ1, NSD1, and MLL2 (10Kraus W.L.

These remodeling factors are recruited to the promoter proximal region of the ER target genes (23Dubik D. Dembinski T.C. Shiu R.P.

Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). SMYD3 contains a SET domain, which is crucial for HMT activity, and an MYND-type zinc-finger domain (zf-MYND) domain, which is common to developmental proteins (24Jakowlew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowski P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, misregulation of H3 methylation events upon overexpression of SMYD3 has been shown to correlate with the development and progression of colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in growth of cancer cells, a possible role of SMYD3 in transcription has been supported by its interaction with RNA polymerase II (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In fact, a microarray analysis of SMYD3-transfected cells has revealed that a large number of genes were up-regulated >3-fold in the SMYD3-overexpressing cells compared with those in the normal cells (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Of special relevance to the present study is that the overexpressed levels of SMYD3 have been observed in breast cancer tissues as well as breast cancer cell lines with associated effects on cancer growth (28Hamamoto R. Silva F.P. Tsuge M. Nishidate T. Katagiri T. Nakamura Y. Furukawa Y. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). ER serves as a sequence-specific transcription factor to regulate a cascade of gene targets whose products mediate the initiation, development, and metastasis of breast cancers. Thus, these results support the idea that SMYD3 might play a functional role in the transactivation of ER-mediated gene transcription in breast cancer cells.As a starting point for the study of transcriptional processes regulated by SMYD3, we checked a possible role of SMYD3 in the ER signaling process. From molecular and cellular studies, we have obtained evidence indicating that SMYD3 is critically involved in ligand-activated, ER-mediated transcription, by methylating histone H3–K4 at the ERE in the promoter regions of target genes. The function of SMYD3 in ER-mediated transcription requires its direct interaction with ER, which in turn allows its recruitment to promoter regions of ER target genes. Down-regulation of SMYD3 expression and concomitant reduction of H3–K4 methylation substantially repressed expression of ER target genes, revealing a major role for SMYD3 as regulator of ER-mediated target gene transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated a possible role of SMYD3 histone methyltransferase in activating ER target genes. The present data demonstrate that (i) SMYD3 physically interacts with ER both in vitro and in vivo, (ii) SMYD3 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of ER that enhances ER-mediated transcription, (iii) SMYD3-imparted transactivation correlates with SMYD3 recruitment and H3–K4 methylation at ER target genes, and (iv) SMYD3 knockdown significantly reduces the ligand-induced expression of ER target genes. These results reveal an essential role of SMYD3 in modulating ER-mediated transcription and provide an example of epigenetic regulation of ER function.The ability of ER to activate transcription requires the repeated cycling of various coregulators onto its target gene promoters in the presence of continuous stimulation by estrogen (3Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Currently, at least two mechanistic models have been proposed to describe the function of these coregulators. First, they transmit the signal of ligand-induced ER conformational change to the basal transcription machinery (31Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Second, they are associated with targeted chromatin remodeling by ER (32Belandia B. Parker M.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical and genetic studies support that methylation of histone H3 at K4 is characteristic to gene activation, and removal of this modification is involved in transcriptional repression (24Jakowlew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowski P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 34Rudolph T. Yonezawa M. Lein S. Heidrich K. Kubicek S. Schäfer C. Phalke S. Walther M. Schmidt A. Jenuwein T. Reuter G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that SMYD3, through its HMT activity, plays a significant role in dictating the transcriptional activity of ER. That the effects of SMYD3 were found to be dependent upon the ability to interact with ER LBD implies that SMYD3 is a functionally important component of estrogen-stimulated ER transcription. Combined with the observation that shRNA-induced silencing of SMYD gene inhibits ER target gene expression, these results argue strongly in favor of SMYD3 as an integral component of the ER response. Although our analyses have been restricted to ER-dependent function of SMYD3, previous studies indicated that activation of other nuclear receptors also involves H3–K4 methylation (35Guccione E. Bassi C. Casadio F. Martinato F. Cesaroni M. Schuchlautz H. Lüscher B. Amati B. Nature. 2007; 449: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Dreijerink K.M. Mulder K.W. Winkler G.S. Höppener J.W. Lips C.J. Timmers H.T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As such, elucidation of a possible role of SMYD3 in the promoter-localized H3–K4 methylation and the consequent activation of transcription at other nuclear receptor target genes is an important issue that warrants further investigation.Many SET domain-containing proteins with HMT activity harbor two conserved amino acid sequence called NHSC and EEL motifs (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 30Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). SMYD3 also possesses these motifs within its SET domain, and they have been shown to be critical for SMYD3 enzymatic activity in HMT reaction (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Our studies performed with SMYD3 mutants demonstrated that, although the NHSC and EEL motifs within SET domain are essential for SMYD3 HMT activity, these motifs are dispensable for SMYD3 binding to ER (Fig. 3E). Importantly, when these deletion mutants were checked in ER luciferase reporter assays, they failed to show coactivator function (Fig. 3, A–D). A simple interpretation of these results is that HMT activity of SMYD3 is required for its action on the transactivation of reporter gene following estrogen stimulation. These characteristics ascribed to NHSC and EEL motifs fit very well with the generic properties previously assigned to the NHSC/EEL motif-containing SET domains in regulating and mediating the enzymatic activity of HMT proteins (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 30Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that NHSC and EEL motifs of SMYD3 could provide the molecular target for regulation of H3–K4 methylation-dependent transcriptional responses by ER. More thorough domain mapping and mutagenesis experiments will be required to provide further insights into the ER-SMYD3 interactions, which facilitate SMYD3 recruitment and H3–K4 methylation in ER-mediated transcription.We have shown that ER promoter occupancy upon E2 treatment coincides with promoter recruitment of SMYD3 and appearance of di-/trimethyl H3–K4 (Fig. 4, A–C). This similar timing of ER occupancy and SMYD3 recruitment strongly supporting that H3–K4 methylation per se endows coactivator properties of SMYD3 in regulating ER-mediated transcription. In further support of a regulatory role of SMYD3-mediated H3–K4 methylation, SMYD3 depletion showed a significant effect on the level of di-/trimethylation, but not monomethylation, of H3–K4 at the promoter of pS2 gene upon E2 treatment (Fig. 6). However, it is also possible that SMYD3 augments the activities of other transcription components at the initial stage of gene induction. In fact, a recent study demonstrated that SMYD3 interacts with an RNA helicase to form a complex with RNA polymerase II (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Hence, SMYD3 could act as a “bridge” protein that mediates functional interaction between ER and RNA polymerase II to coordinate the tightly integrated processes of chromatin remodeling and transcription in ER-driven transcription (31Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 37Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that coactivator proteins such as p300, PRMT1, and CARM1 act together as potential regulators of ER-induced transcription (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 12Daujat S. Bauer U.M. Shah V. Turner B. Berger S. Kouzarides T. Curr.

Thus, it is possible that a distinct group of coactivators play a crucial role in orchestrating ER-mediated transcription. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of SMYD3, together with other coactivators that associate with ER target gene expression.In conclusion, the analysis of SMYD3 described here establishes its role in ER-mediated transcription as a coactivator. H3–K4 methylation appears to be critical for SMYD3 function in ER transcription. Identifying cofactors that influence ER has been important in the development of effective therapies and prevention of breast cancer. Because our studies provide clues as to the requirement of SMYD3 HMT activity for its function, the development of HMT inhibitors may be of therapeutic benefit in modulating SMYD3 action in ER transcription.

ER is comprised of several structural domains that are highly conserved in the various nuclear receptors: the N-terminal transcription activation domain, the DNA binding domain, the hinge region, and the C-terminal conserved ligand binding domain (5Enmark E.

Like other nuclear receptors, the ER collaborates with a number of transcriptional cofactors to effectively modulate transcription of its target genes (3Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G.

These cofactors appear to regulate the chromatin configuration in a highly specific manner by controlling nucleosomal rearrangement and histone modifications at the promoter (11McKenna N.J.

Two major types of chromatin remodeling have been widely investigated for ER transcription. The remodeling activities include the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, which alter structure and position of nucleosomes at the promoters of ER target genes. These include proteins such as brahma-related BRG1 (also known as hBRG1 or hSNF2) and BRM, both of which are subunits of the mammalian homologue of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (17Yoshinaga S.K.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The second class of remodeling factors includes a diverse group of single/multisubunit factors that effect post-translational modifications of the histone tails protruding from the surface of the nucleosome (17Yoshinaga S.K.

Among the well known histone-modifying factors acting in ER-mediated transcription are histone acetyltransferases, including p300/CBP and GCN5/PCAF, and histone methyltransferases, including the arginine methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1, as well as SET domain lysine methyltransferases such as G9a, RIZ1, NSD1, and MLL2 (10Kraus W.L.

These remodeling factors are recruited to the promoter proximal region of the ER target genes (23Dubik D. Dembinski T.C. Shiu R.P.

Recent studies identified that SMYD3 possesses histone methyltransferase activity responsible for catalyzing methylation of histone H3 at K4 (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). SMYD3 contains a SET domain, which is crucial for HMT activity, and an MYND-type zinc-finger domain (zf-MYND) domain, which is common to developmental proteins (24Jakowlew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowski P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, misregulation of H3 methylation events upon overexpression of SMYD3 has been shown to correlate with the development and progression of colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in growth of cancer cells, a possible role of SMYD3 in transcription has been supported by its interaction with RNA polymerase II (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In fact, a microarray analysis of SMYD3-transfected cells has revealed that a large number of genes were up-regulated >3-fold in the SMYD3-overexpressing cells compared with those in the normal cells (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Of special relevance to the present study is that the overexpressed levels of SMYD3 have been observed in breast cancer tissues as well as breast cancer cell lines with associated effects on cancer growth (28Hamamoto R. Silva F.P. Tsuge M. Nishidate T. Katagiri T. Nakamura Y. Furukawa Y. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). ER serves as a sequence-specific transcription factor to regulate a cascade of gene targets whose products mediate the initiation, development, and metastasis of breast cancers. Thus, these results support the idea that SMYD3 might play a functional role in the transactivation of ER-mediated gene transcription in breast cancer cells. As a starting point for the study of transcriptional processes regulated by SMYD3, we checked a possible role of SMYD3 in the ER signaling process. From molecular and cellular studies, we have obtained evidence indicating that SMYD3 is critically involved in ligand-activated, ER-mediated transcription, by methylating histone H3–K4 at the ERE in the promoter regions of target genes. The function of SMYD3 in ER-mediated transcription requires its direct interaction with ER, which in turn allows its recruitment to promoter regions of ER target genes. Down-regulation of SMYD3 expression and concomitant reduction of H3–K4 methylation substantially repressed expression of ER target genes, revealing a major role for SMYD3 as regulator of ER-mediated target gene transcription. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated a possible role of SMYD3 histone methyltransferase in activating ER target genes. The present data demonstrate that (i) SMYD3 physically interacts with ER both in vitro and in vivo, (ii) SMYD3 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of ER that enhances ER-mediated transcription, (iii) SMYD3-imparted transactivation correlates with SMYD3 recruitment and H3–K4 methylation at ER target genes, and (iv) SMYD3 knockdown significantly reduces the ligand-induced expression of ER target genes. These results reveal an essential role of SMYD3 in modulating ER-mediated transcription and provide an example of epigenetic regulation of ER function.The ability of ER to activate transcription requires the repeated cycling of various coregulators onto its target gene promoters in the presence of continuous stimulation by estrogen (3Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Currently, at least two mechanistic models have been proposed to describe the function of these coregulators. First, they transmit the signal of ligand-induced ER conformational change to the basal transcription machinery (31Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Second, they are associated with targeted chromatin remodeling by ER (32Belandia B. Parker M.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical and genetic studies support that methylation of histone H3 at K4 is characteristic to gene activation, and removal of this modification is involved in transcriptional repression (24Jakowlew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowski P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2007; 26: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that SMYD3, through its HMT activity, plays a significant role in dictating the transcriptional activity of ER. That the effects of SMYD3 were found to be dependent upon the ability to interact with ER LBD implies that SMYD3 is a functionally important component of estrogen-stimulated ER transcription. Combined with the observation that shRNA-induced silencing of SMYD gene inhibits ER target gene expression, these results argue strongly in favor of SMYD3 as an integral component of the ER response. Although our analyses have been restricted to ER-dependent function of SMYD3, previous studies indicated that activation of other nuclear receptors also involves H3–K4 methylation (35Guccione E. Bassi C. Casadio F. Martinato F. Cesaroni M. Schuchlautz H. Lüscher B. Amati B. Nature. 2007; 449: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 36Dreijerink K.M. Mulder K.W. Winkler G.S. Höppener J.W. Lips C.J. Timmers H.T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As such, elucidation of a possible role of SMYD3 in the promoter-localized H3–K4 methylation and the consequent activation of transcription at other nuclear receptor target genes is an important issue that warrants further investigation.Many SET domain-containing proteins with HMT activity harbor two conserved amino acid sequence called NHSC and EEL motifs (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 30Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). SMYD3 also possesses these motifs within its SET domain, and they have been shown to be critical for SMYD3 enzymatic activity in HMT reaction (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Our studies performed with SMYD3 mutants demonstrated that, although the NHSC and EEL motifs within SET domain are essential for SMYD3 HMT activity, these motifs are dispensable for SMYD3 binding to ER (Fig. 3E). Importantly, when these deletion mutants were checked in ER luciferase reporter assays, they failed to show coactivator function (Fig. 3, A–D). A simple interpretation of these results is that HMT activity of SMYD3 is required for its action on the transactivation of reporter gene following estrogen stimulation. These characteristics ascribed to NHSC and EEL motifs fit very well with the generic properties previously assigned to the NHSC/EEL motif-containing SET domains in regulating and mediating the enzymatic activity of HMT proteins (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 30Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that NHSC and EEL motifs of SMYD3 could provide the molecular target for regulation of H3–K4 methylation-dependent transcriptional responses by ER. More thorough domain mapping and mutagenesis experiments will be required to provide further insights into the ER-SMYD3 interactions, which facilitate SMYD3 recruitment and H3–K4 methylation in ER-mediated transcription.We have shown that ER promoter occupancy upon E2 treatment coincides with promoter recruitment of SMYD3 and appearance of di-/trimethyl H3–K4 (Fig. 4, A–C). This similar timing of ER occupancy and SMYD3 recruitment strongly supporting that H3–K4 methylation per se endows coactivator properties of SMYD3 in regulating ER-mediated transcription. In further support of a regulatory role of SMYD3-mediated H3–K4 methylation, SMYD3 depletion showed a significant effect on the level of di-/trimethylation, but not monomethylation, of H3–K4 at the promoter of pS2 gene upon E2 treatment (Fig. 6). However, it is also possible that SMYD3 augments the activities of other transcription components at the initial stage of gene induction. In fact, a recent study demonstrated that SMYD3 interacts with an RNA helicase to form a complex with RNA polymerase II (27Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M. Iimura Y. Silva F.P. Li M. Yagyu R. Nakamura Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Hence, SMYD3 could act as a “bridge” protein that mediates functional interaction between ER and RNA polymerase II to coordinate the tightly integrated processes of chromatin remodeling and transcription in ER-driven transcription (31Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Näär A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature. 1999; 398: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 37Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that coactivator proteins such as p300, PRMT1, and CARM1 act together as potential regulators of ER-induced transcription (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 12Daujat S. Bauer U.M. Shah V. Turner B. Berger S. Kouzarides T. Curr.

Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that a distinct group of coactivators play a crucial role in orchestrating ER-mediated transcription. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of SMYD3, together with other coactivators that associate with ER target gene expression.In conclusion, the analysis of SMYD3 described here establishes its role in ER-mediated transcription as a coactivator. H3–K4 methylation appears to be critical for SMYD3 function in ER transcription. Identifying cofactors that influence ER has been important in the development of effective therapies and prevention of breast cancer. Because our studies provide clues as to the requirement of SMYD3 HMT activity for its function, the development of HMT inhibitors may be of therapeutic benefit in modulating SMYD3 action in ER transcription. In this study, we investigated a possible role of SMYD3 histone methyltransferase in activating ER target genes. The present data demonstrate that (i) SMYD3 physically interacts with ER both in vitro and in vivo, (ii) SMYD3 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of ER that enhances ER-mediated transcription, (iii) SMYD3-imparted transactivation correlates with SMYD3 recruitment and H3–K4 methylation at ER target genes, and (iv) SMYD3 knockdown significantly reduces the ligand-induced expression of ER target genes.

Thus, it is possible that a distinct group of coactivators play a crucial role in orchestrating ER-mediated transcription. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine the relative contribution of SMYD3, together with other coactivators that associate with ER target gene expression. In conclusion, the analysis of SMYD3 described here establishes its role in ER-mediated transcription as a coactivator. H3–K4 methylation appears to be critical for SMYD3 function in ER transcription. Identifying cofactors that influence ER has been important in the development of effective therapies and prevention of breast cancer. Because our studies provide clues as to the requirement of SMYD3 HMT activity for its function, the development of HMT inhibitors may be of therapeutic benefit in modulating SMYD3 action in ER transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1985470432,"beta1-Adrenergic receptor (beta1AR) stimulation confers cardioprotection via beta-arrestin-de pend ent transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), however, the precise mechanism for this salutary process is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the beta1AR and EGFR form a complex that differentially directs intracellular signaling pathways. beta1AR stimulation and EGF ligand can each induce equivalent EGFR phosphorylation, internalization, and downstream activation of ERK1/2, but only EGF ligand causes translocation of activated ERK to the nucleus, whereas beta1AR-stimulated/EGFR-transactivated ERK is restricted to the cytoplasm. beta1AR and EGFR are shown to interact as a receptor complex both in cell culture and endogenously in human heart, an interaction that is selective and undergoes dynamic regulation by ligand stimulation. Although catecholamine stimulation mediates the retention of beta1AR-EGFR interaction throughout receptor internalization, direct EGF ligand stimulation initiates the internalization of EGFR alone. Continued interaction of beta1AR with EGFR following activation is dependent upon C-terminal tail GRK phosphorylation sites of the beta1AR and recruitment of beta-arrestin. These data reveal a new signaling paradigm in which beta-arrestin is required for the maintenance of a beta1AR-EGFR interaction that can direct cytosolic targeting of ERK in response to catecholamine stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2031665897,"Efficient turnover of unnecessary and misfolded RNAs is critical for maintaining the integrity and function of the mitochondria. The mitochondrial RNA degradosome of budding yeast (mtEXO) has been recently studied and characterized; yet no RNA degradation machinery has been identified in the mammalian mitochondria. In this communication, we demonstrated that purified human SUV3 (suppressor of Var1 3) dimer and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) trimer form a 330-kDa heteropentamer that is capable of efficiently degrading double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates in the presence of ATP, a task the individual components cannot perform separately. The configuration of this complex is similar to that of the core complex of the E. coli RNA degradosome lacking RNase E but very different from that of the yeast mtEXO. The hSUV3-hPNPase complex prefers substrates containing a 3' overhang and degrades the RNA in a 3'-to-5' directionality. Deleting a short stretch of amino acids (positions 510-514) compromises the ability of hSUV3 to form a stable complex with hPNPase to degrade dsRNA substrates but does not affect its helicase activity. Furthermore, two additional hSUV3 mutants with abolished helicase activity because of disrupted ATPase or RNA binding activities were able to bind hPNPase. However, the resulting complexes failed to degrade dsRNA, suggesting that an intact helicase activity is essential for the complex to serve as an effective RNA degradosome. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the complex of hSUV3-hPNPase is an integral entity for efficient degradation of structured RNA and may be the long sought RNA-degrading complex in the mammalian mitochondria."

Two members, 12/15-LO and 5-LO, regulate inflammatory responses and have been studied for their roles in atherogenesis. Both 12/15-LO and 5-LO inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapy to limit the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Here we used a genetic strategy to disrupt both 12/15-LO and 5-LO on an apolipoprotein E (apoE) atherosclerosis-susceptible background to study the impact of dual LO blockade in atherosclerosis and inflammation. Resident peritoneal macrophages are the major cell type that expresses both LO enzymes, and we verified their absence in dual LO-deficient mice. Examination of AA conversion by phorbol myristate acetate-primed and A23187-challenged macrophages from dual LO-deficient mice revealed extensive accumulation of AA with virtually no diversion into the most common cyclooxygenase (COX) products measured (prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2). Instead the COX-1 by-products 11-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 15-HETE were elevated. The interrelationship between the two LO pathways in combination with COX-1 inhibition (SC-560) also revealed striking patterns of unique substrate utilization. 5-LO- and dual LO-deficient mice exhibited an attenuated response to zymosan-induced peritoneal inflammation, emphasizing roles for 5-LO in regulating vascular permeability. We observed gender-specific attenuation of atheroma formation at 6 months of age at both the aortic root and throughout the entire aorta in chow-fed female dual LO-deficient mice. We propose that some of the inconsistent data obtained with single LO-deficient mice could be attributable to macrophage-specific patterns of altered AA metabolism.

In mammals, these mediators are predominantly formed from arachidonic acid (AA) and act in various physiological and pathological contexts (1Funk C.D.

Accordingly 5-LO and 12/15-LO are two members of the LO family involved in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases expressed to variable degrees in several cell types of the myeloid lineage, and their expression is strictly regulated and incompletely understood (2Kühn H.

Despite considerable structural homology between 5-LO and 12/15-LO, both enzymes generate distinct products. The 5-LO metabolite leukotriene (LT) A4 is precursor to the proinflammatory LTB4 and cysteinyl LTs, which regulate leukocyte subset-specific chemotaxis (LTB4) and vascular permeability (cysteinyl LTs), both crucial events during acute peritonitis (1Funk C.D.

Tissue-resident MΦ (such as PMΦ) represent the first line of defense against invading pathogens and activate the immunological and inflammatory response (17Taylor P.R. Martinez-Pomares L. Stacey M.

These phagocytes are capable of elaborating a wide spectrum of bioactive lipid mediators from the LO and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. Little is known about the regulation and putative interdependence of these pathways. Some insight was gained using mice lacking 12/15-LO where substrate shunting from the 12/15-LO into the 5-LO pathway was observed (12Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The generation of knock-out mice for 12/15-LO (12Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) has enabled the study of these lipid mediator pathways in models of health and disease. Because 12/15-LO and 5-LO are primarily expressed in distinct hematopoietic cells, their implication in various inflammatory disorders and models of host defense mechanisms have been investigated (2Kühn H. O'Donnell V.B. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 334-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Zhao L. Funk C.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease prevalent in societies with high dietary fat intake, is initiated by low density lipoprotein (LDL) retention in the vascular wall (19Hansson G.K. Robertson A.K. Söderberg-Nauclér C. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 297-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and subsequent oxidative modification. This process greatly enhances the LDL atherogenic potential, and intriguingly 12/15-LO can contribute to lipoprotein oxidation (11Huo Y. Zhao L. Hyman M.C. Shashkin P. Harry B.L. Burcin T.

Initial studies using 12/15-LO- and 5-LO-deficient mice indicated proatherogenic roles for these enzymes (20Funk C.D. Cyrus T. Trends Cardiovasc.

Here we studied the consequences of simultaneous 12/15-LO and 5-LO knock-out on peritoneal inflammation and atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice and surmised whether some of the capricious results in atherosclerotic lesion studies could be attributable to variable eicosanoid profiles. 12/15-LO-deficient, 5-LO-deficient, and apoE-deficient mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), backcrossed to C57BL/6 background ≥9 times, were crossbred to obtain four genotypes on an apoE−/− background (abbreviated designations in parentheses): 12/15-LO+/+ 5-LO+/+ (12+5+; also referred to as “wild type” (wt)), 12/15-LO+/+ 5-LO−/− (12+5−), 12/15-LO−/− 5-LO+/+ (12−5+), and 12/15-LO−/− 5-LO−/− (12−5−). In addition, apoE+/+ (C57BL/6) control mice were used in some experiments. Mice were housed in the Queen's University transgenic animal facility at constant temperature (20–22 °C) and given free access to water and normal chow diet. Experimental mice were housed for 6 months ± 2 weeks of age or until cutaneous xanthomas/dermatitis appeared that are commonly observed in C57BL/6 apoE-deficient mice (25Moghadasian M.H. McManus B.M. Nguyen L.B. Shefer S. Nadji M. Godin D.V. Green T.J. Hill J. Yang Y. Scudamore C.H. Frohlich J.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2623-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tail clip DNA of mice from all colonies was regularly genotyped by PCR after weaning and again after euthanization. For most experiments, mice were weighed and sacrificed by CO2 inhalation followed by peritoneal lavage (see below). For lipid analysis, blood was collected from the inferior vena cava and allowed to coagulate at room temperature. Following overnight storage at 4 °C, serum was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and kept at −80 °C until collective analysis for triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL was performed in the Core Laboratory at Kingston General Hospital (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). Spleens were dissected, weighed directly after blood collection, and used to calculate the spleen/body weight ratio (SBR). All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Queen's University Animal Care Committee. Resident peritoneal exudates were collected from mice immediately after euthanization by peritoneal lavage with 3 × 5 ml of complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Fisher Scientific), l-glutamine (HyClone), penicillin, and streptomycin (both from Invitrogen) and kept on ice. Some mice received 1 ml of sterile thioglycollate (TGL) solution (4% in H2O; Sigma) intraperitoneally 3–4 days prior to euthanization. The exudates were centrifuged (240 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in complete medium, counted, and plated according to our experimental design. Typically after 1.5–2 h at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator, adhered resident (res-) or TGL-elicited PMΦ were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-adherent cells prior to experimentation. Peritoneal exudate cells were resuspended in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated with 2 μg/ml fluorochrome-tagged primary antibodies for 60 min on ice: anti-CD11b (clone A95-1; BD Biosciences), anti-F4/80 (BM8; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2; Biolegend), and respective isotype controls. Cells were washed with PBS plus 5% fetal bovine serum, resuspended in PBS, and kept on ice until analyzed by flow cytometry (FC500, Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Importantly to prevent artifactual results due to increasing adherence or death of MΦ during sample processing, samples were prepared in random order in each experiment. Propidium iodide staining (1 μg/ml) was used to gate live cells prior to antigen analysis. A total of 50,000 events was recorded per sample. Data were analyzed using CXP analysis software (Beckman Coulter). mRNA was extracted from res- or TGL-elicited PMΦ (TGL-PMΦ) (cultured for 1.5 or 24 h as indicated) using the Qiagen minikit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), eluted with 30 μl of DNase-free water, and quantified spectrophotometrically by NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Up to 5 μg of RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using a SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). 50–200 ng of cDNA/well was subjected to real time PCR using the SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) relative quantification method on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR instrument. Intron-spanning primers were designed to yield amplicons of ∼100-bp length for 12/15-LO (forward (f) 5′-GGGCAACTCTTGCCTATAGCC-3′, reverse (r) 5′-AAGTCTGAGCTTCGGACCCA-3′), 5-LO (f 5′-CGGGAACAGCTTATCTGCGA-3′, r 5′-GTCAGATCCTGGACAGCCCTC-3′), 18 S rRNA (f 5′-TGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCCATGCAT-3′, r 5′-AACCATAACTGATTTAATGAGCCATTC-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (f 5′-CTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTA-3′, r 5′-TGTTGCTGTAGCCGTATTCA-3′) with 18 S rRNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase used as normalizers. Dissociation curve analysis following each amplification reaction was done to confirm specificity of the amplification. RNA expression was determined based on the ΔΔCt comparative method of relative quantification according to the manufacturer. Non-reverse transcribed RNA from wt PMΦ was used as a control to determine contamination by genomic DNA. Res-PMΦ were plated on 8-well glass slides (BD Biosciences), washed, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min). Alternatively peritoneal exudates in complete medium were cytospun (550 rpm for 4 min) onto Superfrost glass slides (Fisher Scientific) either directly or after incubation with 0.44 mm additional CaCl2 and 5 μm ionophore A23187 (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) for 5 min at −20 °C. Cells were blocked in 5% normal goat serum (Cedarlane Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) in PBS, and primary antibodies in 5% normal goat serum/PBS against murine 12/15-LO (26Cyrus T.

Evans while at Merck Frosst Canada), and/or CD68 (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) were applied overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times; incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody and/or Texas Red-coupled goat anti-rat antibody in 5% normal goat serum/PBS (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 2 h at room temperature; washed three more times; and mounted in Pro-Long Antifade GOLD (Invitrogen) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cytospin slides received an additional blocking step with 5% normal goat serum/PBS between primary and secondary antibody application. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using 40× or 100× oil immersion objectives. Res-PMΦ were lysed by sonication in T-PER reagent (Pierce) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged (13,000 × g for 5 min). Aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% gels using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean system. After blotting to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada) and blocking in 2% dry milk, Tris-buffered saline, primary antibodies (in 5% bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline) against murine 12/15-LO (26Cyrus T.

Res-PMΦ from three to four mice were pooled and plated in two wells of a 6-well plate (Corning, Lowell, MA) in complete medium, washed after 1.5 h, and supplemented with 1.8 ml of colorless Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D1145, Sigma) containing penicillin/streptomycin but no fetal bovine serum. Cells ((3.0 ± 0.5) × 106/well) were primed with phorbol myristate acetate (75 nm; Sigma) for 45 min and preincubated with COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 (10 μm; Cayman Chemical (27Smith C.J. Zhang Y.

Then eicosanoid biosynthesis from endogenous AA was induced by an additional 0.44 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm ionophore A23187 (Sigma). After 45 min, 200 μl of ethanol was added, and the medium was collected immediately. The total cellular protein of each sample was established by T-PER extraction and the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). To the medium, prostaglandin (PG) B2 (50 ng; Cayman Chemical) as internal standard and 1 n HCl (20 μl) for acidification were added followed by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min) and purification using Alltech C18 solid-phase extraction columns (Fisher Scientific). The eluate in methanol was evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 80 μl of methanol, centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min), and filtered through 0.22-μm particle filters (Waters). Aliquots (5 μl) were injected on a Waters Acquity C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7-μm particle size) in a Waters Acquity Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system. HETEs and leukotrienes were eluted isocratically with a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water, and acetic acid (45:24:31:0.007) and detected at 235 nm (HETEs) or 278 nm (PGB2, LTB4 and LTB4 isomers) by a photodiode array detector. The remainder of the samples was used for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Each sample was injected into an high pressure liquid chromatography gradient pump system directly interfaced to the electrospray source of a Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a Gemini 5-μm C18 (2.0 × 150-mm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Starting from 55% solvent A (water/acetic acid, pH 5.7; v/v), 45% solvent B (acetonitrile/methanol, 65:35, v/v), analytes were eluted on a linear gradient up to 80% solvent B followed by an increase to 98% solvent B and isocratic elution at 98% solvent B. Eicosanoids were detected in the negative ion mode by multiple reaction monitoring of m/z 369 → 169 for thromboxane (Tx) B2, m/z 351 → 271 for PGE2, m/z 333 → 235 for PGB2, m/z 624 → 272 for LTC4, m/z 335 → 195 for LTB4 and the 6-trans-LTB4 isomers, m/z 335 → 115 for 5,6-diHETE, m/z 335 → 201 for 5,15-diHETE, m/z 351 → 115 for both lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4, m/z 319 → 115 for 5-HETE, m/z 319 → 155 for 8-HETE, m/z 319 → 151 for 9-HETE, m/z 319 → 167 for 11-HETE, m/z 319 → 179 for 12-HETE, m/z 319 → 219 for 15-HETE, and m/z 303 → 205 for AA. Although neither lipoxin A4 nor lipoxin B4 could be detected in these studies, the limit of detection of our method was determined to be 50–100 pg injected on column. Eicosanoids were quantified using PGB2 as an internal standard with standard curves calculated for PGE2, TxB2, LTC4, LTB4, 5-HETE, and AA. The LTB4 curve was also used to quantify the 6-trans-LTB4 isomers, 5,6-diHETE, and 5,15-diHETE. The 5-HETE curve was used to quantify 8-HETE, 9-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE. Each of the standard curve points was solid-phase-extracted to account for differences in recovery as compared with PGB2. Presented data were calculated from initial area analyte/area PGB2 data, normalized to protein content, and converted to ng of analyte/mg of protein. Mice (8–14 weeks) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and placed on a heated pad. Evans Blue dye (0.5% aqueous solution in saline; General Diagnostics, Warner Chilcott) was injected into the tail vein as a weight-corrected volume (200 μl/25 g of body weight) followed by an intraperitoneal injection (500 μl) of zymosan (stock 2 mg/ml in PBS, boiled and washed; Sigma) or PBS. After 60 min, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the peritoneal exudate was collected using 3 ml of PBS. Exudates were centrifuged (240 × g), and supernatants were analyzed for Evans Blue bound to plasma albumin at 595 nm in a plate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech, Fisher Scientific) and for eicosanoid levels as mentioned above. LDL was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated blood (25 ml) drawn from healthy volunteers (approved by Queen's University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board) by sequential ultracentrifugation (28Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, plasma was adjusted with NaBr (Sigma) to a density of 1.02 g/ml and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, and the infranatant was collected. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm; Sigma) was routinely added to prevent proteolysis. The lipoprotein solution was then adjusted to a density of 1.063 g/ml with NaBr and centrifuged again under the conditions described above. The LDL-containing supernatant was collected and dialyzed twice in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (cutoff, 2,000 kDa; Pierce) against 20 mm HEPES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 for 4 and 18 h followed by protein assay according to the Bradford method. Native (n) LDL (approximately 1 mg/ml) was stored under nitrogen gas at 4 °C in the dark. Acetylated (Ac) LDL was obtained by mixing 200 μl of nLDL with 200 μl of saturated sodium acetate solution and 5 additions of 1 μl pure acetic anhydride (Sigma) in 10 min intervals during continuous rotation at 4 °C based on (29Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). After additional rotation for 30 min, the solution was dialyzed as described above against 150 mm NaCl, 400 μm EDTA, pH 7.4 for 4 and 18 h. Aliquots of nLDL and AcLDL were assessed for protein content by the Bradford test and analyzed for successful modifications on a 0.5% agarose gel in barbital buffer (Sigma). Purity and integrity of the preparations were assured using a 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen) followed by silver staining. Res-PMΦ were maintained in 8-well slides for 1.5 h after extraction, washed twice with PBS, and exposed to nLDL (100 μg/ml) or AcLDL (40 μg/ml) dissolved in minimal medium for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following careful washing (three times) with PBS, cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min, washed briefly, and stained for lipids by Oil Red O (Sigma). Counterstaining was done using Harris' modified hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific). Cells were mounted in AquaPerm (Shandon Immunon, Fisher Scientific), allowed to dry overnight, and mounted in Cytoseal 280 (Fisher Scientific) plus a coverslip prior to analysis by bright field microscopy (40×; Zeiss). Res-PMΦ with ≥1 lipid droplet were defined as positive, and the number of medium sized lipid droplets (diameter, 1–2 μm) was counted and averaged per positive cell. Mice were kept on regular chow diet until 6 months ± 2 weeks of age and then euthanized. After peritoneal lavage and blood collection from the inferior vena cava, vessels were perfused with copious amounts of ice-cold PBS through the left ventricle. Aortae were dissected from the heart to the iliac bifurcation and fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific) overnight. Hearts with aor"
https://openalex.org/W2021206870,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 is the major mediator of the mitogenic, angiogenic, and vascular hyperpermeability effects of VEGF on breast tumors. Overexpression of VEGF and VEGF receptor-2 is associated with the degree of pathomorphosis of the tumor tissue and unfavorable prognosis. In this study, we demonstrate that non-invasive quantification of the degree of tumor vascular permeability to a nanoprobe correlates with the VEGF and its receptor levels and tumor growth. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed an imaging nanoprobe and a methodology to detect the intratumoral deposition of a 100 nm-scale nanoprobe using mammography allowing measurement of the tumor vascular permeability in a rat MAT B III breast tumor model. The tumor vascular permeability varied widely among the animals. Notably, the VEGF and VEGF receptor-2 gene expression of the tumors as measured by qRT-PCR displayed a strong correlation to the imaging-based measurements of vascular permeability to the 100 nm-scale nanoprobe. This is in good agreement with the fact that tumors with high angiogenic activity are expected to have more permeable blood vessels resulting in high intratumoral deposition of a nanoscale agent. In addition, we show that higher intratumoral deposition of the nanoprobe as imaged with mammography correlated to a faster tumor growth rate. This data suggest that vascular permeability scales to the tumor growth and that tumor vascular permeability can be a measure of underlying VEGF and VEGF receptor-2 expression in individual tumors. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that quantitative imaging of tumor vascular permeability to a nanoprobe represents a form of a surrogate, functional biomarker of underlying molecular markers of angiogenesis."

However, Deinococcus remains the beneficiary of most research to date.Published evidence argues that both passive and active mechanisms protect D. radiodurans from ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. Several proposals have been put forward. Radiation resistance might involve the highly condensed and toroidal form of the Deinococcus nucleoid (3Levin-Zaidman S. Englander J. Shimoni E. Sharma A.K.

However, a broader survey of radiation-resistant bacterial species did not find a good correlation between radiation resistance and nucleoid structure (5Zimmerman J.M. Battista J.R.

D. radiodurans and other radioresistant species have been shown to have high ratios of intracellular manganese relative to iron ions, and the elevated ratio correlates with lower levels of protein oxidation post-irradiation, with the higher levels of manganese ion acting as a scavenger of oxygen radicals generated during irradiation (6Daly M.J.

Specialized or enhanced mechanisms of DNA repair may also play a role in IR resistance.After exposure to high levels of γ radiation, genome repair in Deinococcus proceeds in two phases. The first phase is independent of the key recombinational protein RecA. Repair in phase 1 does rely on DNA polymerase A (9Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), a homolog of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Knockouts of the gene encoding DrPolA render the cell very sensitive to ionizing radiation, more than almost any alteration besides a recA gene inactivation. A repair pathway has been proposed for phase 1 by Radman and colleagues (9Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), called extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing. Much of this first phase involves the nuclease-mediated exposure of long single strand extensions at the end of chromosomal fragments, and bringing multiple fragments together by means of simple annealing of the single strands. Replication and ligation processes play a major role in generating ever larger chromosomal constructs. This first phase makes use of a number of novel proteins that are induced to high levels by exposure to large doses of ionizing radiation. The second phase of genome reconstitution follows closely and relies on RecA.The proteins induced in Deinococcus upon exposure to IR have been studied using microarray-based transcriptome analyses (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D. Rogozin I.B. Gaidamakova E.K. Zhai M. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

All are induced to high levels, and all possess a documented role in genome reconstitution (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D.

PprA binds to the ends of duplex DNA and stimulates DNA ligation (14Narumi I. Satoh K. Cui S. Funayama T. Kitayama S. Watanabe H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). No function has been assigned to the DdrB, DdrC, and DdrD proteins, and careful searches of protein and gene databases provide no clues. All appear to function in a RecA-independent process (11Tanaka M. Earl A.M. Howell H.A. Park M.J. Eisen J.A. Peterson S.N. Battista J.R. Genetics. 2004; 168: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), making them likely participants in the first phase of Deinococcus genome reconstitution.Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins are key components of any process in DNA metabolism. Bacterial SSB proteins interact, through their highly conserved C termini, with a multitude of proteins that function in DNA metabolism (15Lu D. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9169-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The SSB proteins effectively act as scaffolds upon which processes in DNA metabolism are organized. In the present study, we focus on the DdrB protein. We report that DdrB is an alternative SSB protein, part of a new bacterial SSB family.DISCUSSIONThe DdrB protein of D. radiodurans is, structurally and functionally, an SSB-like protein. The protein exhibits a stable core structure with definable homology to a known OB-fold domain. This core is attached to a relatively unstructured linker that leads to a C terminus consistent with the key properties exhibited by the bacterial SSB C termini. The DdrB protein binds specifically and tightly to ssDNA. The architecture of the DdrB-ssDNA complex revealed by electron microscopy is consistent with that exhibited by bacterial SSBs. DdrB also affects the ATPase activity of two RecA proteins with patterns similar to the effects of bacterial SSBs. We thus conclude that D. radiodurans encodes an alternative SSB protein and expresses it in response to desiccation or exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation.Given the central role played by bacterial SSBs in organizing processes of DNA metabolism (15Lu D. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9169-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the presence of a new SSB during genome reconstitution could provide the cell with a unique and specific organizing center. Whereas the previously characterized D. radiodurans SSB is present and abundant during genome reconstitution (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D. Rogozin I.B. Gaidamakova E.K. Zhai M. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4191-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). 5S. Saveliev and M. M. Cox, unpublished data. DdrB could interact with particular repair proteins, or direct the assembly of particular repair complexes. DdrB is essentially undetectable in D. radiodurans cells prior to irradiation (11Tanaka M. Earl A.M. Howell H.A. Park M.J. Eisen J.A. Peterson S.N. Battista J.R. Genetics. 2004; 168: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). In principle, the unique expression of DdrB during genome reconstitution could signal the presence of a novel DNA repair process.The lack of striking sequence similarity with bacterial SSBs could reflect a long period of evolutionary divergence. Alternatively, DdrB may have arisen from an evolutionary convergence, with another protein evolving to serve the same function. Outside of the Deinococcaceae, there are no other close proteins yet present in databases. The DdrB protein may thus represent a new family of SSB proteins, so far limited to Deinococcus sp.DdrB is the first bacterial SSB protein to exhibit a pentameric structure. A complete three-dimensional structure of the protein will be of interest. We presume that both the structure and the robust binding of the protein to ssDNA reflect its still-to-be-elucidated role in genome reconstitution.

D. radiodurans and other radioresistant species have been shown to have high ratios of intracellular manganese relative to iron ions, and the elevated ratio correlates with lower levels of protein oxidation post-irradiation, with the higher levels of manganese ion acting as a scavenger of oxygen radicals generated during irradiation (6Daly M.J.

After exposure to high levels of γ radiation, genome repair in Deinococcus proceeds in two phases. The first phase is independent of the key recombinational protein RecA. Repair in phase 1 does rely on DNA polymerase A (9Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), a homolog of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Knockouts of the gene encoding DrPolA render the cell very sensitive to ionizing radiation, more than almost any alteration besides a recA gene inactivation. A repair pathway has been proposed for phase 1 by Radman and colleagues (9Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), called extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing. Much of this first phase involves the nuclease-mediated exposure of long single strand extensions at the end of chromosomal fragments, and bringing multiple fragments together by means of simple annealing of the single strands. Replication and ligation processes play a major role in generating ever larger chromosomal constructs. This first phase makes use of a number of novel proteins that are induced to high levels by exposure to large doses of ionizing radiation. The second phase of genome reconstitution follows closely and relies on RecA. The proteins induced in Deinococcus upon exposure to IR have been studied using microarray-based transcriptome analyses (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D. Rogozin I.B. Gaidamakova E.K. Zhai M. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genetics. 2004; 168: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Five novel proteins, called DdrA, DdrB, DdrC, DdrD, and PprA, stand out in this analysis. All are induced to high levels, and all possess a documented role in genome reconstitution (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D.

The ddrA gene encodes a distant homologue of the eukaryotic Rad52 protein (12Harris D.R. Tanaka M. Saveliev S.V. Jolivet E. Earl A.M. Cox M.M. Battista J.R.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The DdrA protein binds to the 3′-ends of single DNA strands and protects them from nuclease degradation (12Harris D.R. Tanaka M. Saveliev S.V. Jolivet E. Earl A.M. Cox M.M. Battista J.R. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e304Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Gutsche I. Vujicić-Zagar A. Siebert X. Servant P. Vannier F. Castaing B. Gallet B. Heulin T. de Groot A. Sommer S. Serre L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The PprA protein is a distant homologue of the human XRCC5 protein. PprA binds to the ends of duplex DNA and stimulates DNA ligation (14Narumi I. Satoh K. Cui S. Funayama T. Kitayama S. Watanabe H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). No function has been assigned to the DdrB, DdrC, and DdrD proteins, and careful searches of protein and gene databases provide no clues. All appear to function in a RecA-independent process (11Tanaka M. Earl A.M. Howell H.A. Park M.J. Eisen J.A. Peterson S.N. Battista J.R. Genetics. 2004; 168: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), making them likely participants in the first phase of Deinococcus genome reconstitution. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins are key components of any process in DNA metabolism. Bacterial SSB proteins interact, through their highly conserved C termini, with a multitude of proteins that function in DNA metabolism (15Lu D. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9169-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The SSB proteins effectively act as scaffolds upon which processes in DNA metabolism are organized. In the present study, we focus on the DdrB protein. We report that DdrB is an alternative SSB protein, part of a new bacterial SSB family. DISCUSSIONThe DdrB protein of D. radiodurans is, structurally and functionally, an SSB-like protein. The protein exhibits a stable core structure with definable homology to a known OB-fold domain. This core is attached to a relatively unstructured linker that leads to a C terminus consistent with the key properties exhibited by the bacterial SSB C termini. The DdrB protein binds specifically and tightly to ssDNA. The architecture of the DdrB-ssDNA complex revealed by electron microscopy is consistent with that exhibited by bacterial SSBs. DdrB also affects the ATPase activity of two RecA proteins with patterns similar to the effects of bacterial SSBs. We thus conclude that D. radiodurans encodes an alternative SSB protein and expresses it in response to desiccation or exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation.Given the central role played by bacterial SSBs in organizing processes of DNA metabolism (15Lu D. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9169-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), the presence of a new SSB during genome reconstitution could provide the cell with a unique and specific organizing center. Whereas the previously characterized D. radiodurans SSB is present and abundant during genome reconstitution (10Liu Y.Q. Zhou J.Z. Omelchenko M.V. Beliaev A.S. Venkateswaran A. Stair J. Wu L. Thompson D.K. Xu D. Rogozin I.B. Gaidamakova E.K. Zhai M. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Daly M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4191-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). 5S. Saveliev and M. M. Cox, unpublished data. DdrB could interact with particular repair proteins, or direct the assembly of particular repair complexes. DdrB is essentially undetectable in D. radiodurans cells prior to irradiation (11Tanaka M. Earl A.M. Howell H.A. Park M.J. Eisen J.A. Peterson S.N. Battista J.R. Genetics. 2004; 168: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). In principle, the unique expression of DdrB during genome reconstitution could signal the presence of a novel DNA repair process.The lack of striking sequence similarity with bacterial SSBs could reflect a long period of evolutionary divergence. Alternatively, DdrB may have arisen from an evolutionary convergence, with another protein evolving to serve the same function. Outside of the Deinococcaceae, there are no other close proteins yet present in databases. The DdrB protein may thus represent a new family of SSB proteins, so far limited to Deinococcus sp.DdrB is the first bacterial SSB protein to exhibit a pentameric structure. A complete three-dimensional structure of the protein will be of interest. We presume that both the structure and the robust binding of the protein to ssDNA reflect its still-to-be-elucidated role in genome reconstitution.

We screened reported mutations of Mal for activity in reporter assays to test the hypothesis that variants of Mal existed with altered signaling potential. A TIR domain variant, Mal D96N (rs8177400), was found to be inactive. In reconstituted cell lines, Mal D96N acted as a hypomorphic mutation, with impaired cytokine production and NF-κB activation upon lipopolysaccharide or PAM2CSK4 stimulation. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Mal D96N is unable to interact with MyD88, a prerequisite for downstream signaling to occur. Computer modeling data suggested that residue 96 resides in the MyD88 binding site, further supporting these findings. Genotyping of Mal D96N in three different cohorts suggested that it is a rare mutation. We, thus, describe a rare variant in Mal that exerts its effect via its inability to bind MyD88.

Upon activation of TLR2 or TLR4, a signaling cascade is initiated which leads to the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB), interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), and activator protein (AP-1), ultimately culminating in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (6Vogel S.N.

Prohinar P. Gioannini T.L. Weiss J.P. Jerala R. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mal is the most polymorphic of all adapter proteins, harboring at least eight non-synonymous variants in its coding region. It, thus, appears to be an important candidate for studying genetic variation in relation to TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. In the present study we characterized the known polymorphisms in the coding region of Mal for effects on the function of Mal. We report that one of the mutations in the TIR domain of Mal, D96N, is broadly defective in TLR2 and the MyD88 branch of the TLR4 signaling pathway. We show by biochemical and computer modeling data that the basis of this abnormality is the inability of Mal D96N to bind MyD88. Although the incidence of this lesion in humans is not known, we screened three small populations for the defect and found a single heterozygous individual, suggesting that D96N is a rare mutation. We, thus, identify a mutation in Mal that causes a structural change, affecting the ability of the protein to bind the downstream effector MyD88.

HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well and transfected 16 h later with 40 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter genes and the indicated amounts of Mal (WT or polymorphic) using GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). In the case of Fig. 1B, IRF5 construct (10 ng) was co-transfected. The thymidine kinase Renilla-luciferase reporter was co transfected (40 ng) to normalize the data for transfection efficiency.

Cell lysates were made and run on an 8–16% SDS gel (NuSep), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-IkB. (Cell Signaling Technology). HEK293T cells were transfected with TLR2-YFP, TLR4-CFP, or MyD88-CFP and FLAG-tagged Mal (WT or D96N). Two days post-transfection, cells were harvested, and the lysates were incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) and poly-A-Sepharose beads. Rabbit IgG was used as a control. The processed samples were run on an SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (SIGMA, MO, USA). The immunoprecipitation of TLR2-YFP, TLR4-CFP and MyD88-CFP was checked by immunoblotting the same membrane with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Expression level of the proteins in whole cell lysates was checked by immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody and monoclonal anti-GFP antibody. The amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures of the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR2, homologous proteins used as templates for comparative modeling, were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.

Screening was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing. For amplification, the forward primer 5′-AGTGAGAGGGCACCTGGTAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CACAGCTCGGACACTATAGCGCC-3′ were used. Sequencing was performed with the same primers on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by the DNA Sequencing Facility, Radboud University. The non-synonymous SNPs occurring in the coding region of human Mal were selected from the NCBI SNP data base. These were examined for their ability to drive two signaling pathways known to function downstream of Mal. Transient expression of WT Mal in HEK293T cells triggers activation of NF-κB- and IRF5-dependent ISRE luciferase reporters (23Miggin S.M. Pålsson-McDermott E. Dunne A. Jefferies C. Pinteaux E. Banahan K. Murphy C. Moynagh P. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Rothwell N. Golenbock D. Fitzgerald K.A. O'Neill L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2008; 283: 14295-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Notably, IRF5 is activated downstream of Mal and MyD88 but not TRIF or TRAM (24Paun A. Reinert J.T. Jiang Z. Medin C. Balkhi M.Y. Fitzgerald K.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14295-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As expected, WT Mal could drive both reporters. Moreover, four of the five polymorphisms screened were comparable to wild type Mal in their ability to drive both reporters (Fig. 1, A and B). However, Mal D96N was severely compromised in driving either the NF-κB or the IRF5-ISRE reporter. IRF5 by itself can weakly activate the ISRE reporter, but the co-expression of wild type Mal leads to a much greater activation above this background value (Fig. 1B). In the case of Mal D96N, this increase in activity over the background level was not seen. These results suggest that Mal D96N does not drive signal transduction upon overexpression. To study these polymorphisms in phagocytes with a clean genetic background, we immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type and Mal-deficient mice using a retrovirus encoding several oncogenes (15Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar, 25Halle A. Hornung V. Petzold G.C. Stewart C.R. Monks B.G. Reinheckel T. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Moore K.J. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). These cell lines behave similar to their respective primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1). We generated retroviruses expressing FLAG-tagged wild type Mal in tandem with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP). This construct expresses a bicistronic mRNA that allows the translation of both Mal and GFP in the Mal-deficient immortalized cell line. The transduced cells were sorted for GFP and then cloned by limiting dilution. In Mal-deficient macrophages, TNFα production in response to LPS was significantly reduced, whereas in response to PAM2CSK4, it was completely abrogated. We examined TNFα production in the clone obtained from transducing Mal-deficient cell line with retrovirus expressing WT Mal. The single cell clone could completely restore responsiveness to LPS and PAM2CSK4 stimulation (Fig. 2A). Similarly, cells lines expressing each of the variant forms of Mal were generated. Clones with similar levels of expression of Mal, as assessed by Western blot, were selected for further study (Fig. 2B). Reconstituted cell lines were stimulated with LPS and PAM2CSK4, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα was measured in cell supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The variants A9P, R13W, S180L, and V197I were fully functional and produced comparable levels of TNFα as WT cells. However, in agreement with our earlier experiments, D96N was significantly compromised in its ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines upon stimulation (Fig. 2C). The production of another proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6, was similar to TNFα (data not shown). As a control, TNFα production by the double-stranded RNA mimetic poly I:C stimulation was also measured. Poly(I·C) is a TLR3 ligand whose signaling is independent of Mal (26Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In this case, TNFα production in cells expressing the D96N mutation was comparable with WT macrophages as well as to cells expressing the different variants of Mal. To test whether the MyD88-independent TLR4 signaling is intact in D96N-expressing cells, we measured induction of IFN-β mRNA upon LPS stimulation using real-time PCR (Fig. 2D). D96N expressing macrophages induced comparable amounts of IFN-β mRNA as WT and Mal-deficient cells. Thus, macrophages expressing the D96N variant of Mal are defective in signaling through TLR2 and the MyD88 branch of TLR4, whereas signaling initiated through other TLRs occurs normally. NF-κB is the predominant transcription factor responsible for pro-inflammatory cytokine production downstream of TLR2- and MyD88-dependent TLR4-signaling pathways. We, therefore, examined the activation of NF-κB (via IκB degradation) after LPS and PAM2CSK4 treatment in the reconstituted cell lines mentioned above. In Mal-deficient macrophages, IκB degradation is abrogated upon PAM2CSK4 treatment, whereas for LPS stimulation Mal-deficient macrophages undergo delayed degradation (27McGettrick A.F. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In WT bone marrow-derived macrophages, IκB was completely degraded at 10 min after LPS or PAM2CSK4 treatment (Fig. 3, row A). As expected, Mal-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages had a delayed degradation profile in the case of LPS (Fig. 3, left panel, row B) and exhibited no degradation in the case of PAM2CSK4 treatment (Fig. 3, right panel, row B). Immortalized wild type and Mal-deficient cell lines mimicked their primary cell types (Fig. 3, rows C and D). Mal-deficient cell lines expressing wild type Mal, A9P, R13W, S180L, or V197I degraded IκB at 10 min, like the wild type immortalized cells (Fig. 3, rows E–G, I, and J). In contrast, however, and in agreement with the cytokine data, cells expressing the D96N mutant behaved like the Mal-deficient cells (Fig. 3, row H), with no degradation in the case of PAM2CSK4 and a delayed degradation profile after LPS treatment. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal loading control. Thus, Mal D96N is a hypomorphic, if not a null variant of Mal, fully defective in NF-κB activation. Having established the failure of Mal D96N to signal, we next sought an explanation for the inability of D96N to transduce the signal downstream of TLR2 and TLR4. It is thought that Mal acts as a bridging adapter between the receptor (TLR2 or TLR4) and MyD88 and, thus, physically interacts with both (28Fitzgerald K.A. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2006; 125: 834-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether the D96N mutation affected the ability of Mal to interact with TLR2, TLR4, or MyD88. Transient transfections in HEK293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation assays were carried out to address this question (Fig. 4). As expected, wild type Mal interacted with the receptors TLR2 (Fig. 4A) and TLR4 (Fig. 4B) and with MyD88 (Fig. 4C, lane 6). Like wild type Mal, D96N could be co-immunoprecipitated with both TLR2 and TLR4, indicating that this mutation does not affect the ability of Mal to interact with either of these receptors. However, D96N was severely compromised in its ability to interact with MyD88. Although wild type Mal could co-immunoprecipitate with MyD88, D96N could not (Fig. 4C, lane 7). Thus, the hypomorphic phenotype of D96N appeared to result from its inability to interact with MyD88. We generated high quality models of the TIR domains of both WT and D96N Mal using the resolved crystal structures of TLR1 and -2 as templates (29Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The Mal TIR domain was predicted to have good geometry, with none of its ϕ-ψ dihedral angles within the disallowed regions of a Ramachandran plot and 90.6% in geometrically favored regions. JOY and Verify3D outputs (20Núñez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) revealed that the environment of residues in the model of Mal are similar to those of the TLR1 and TLR2 TIR domains used as templates and were not energetically unfavorable. Residue Asp-96 was predicted to lie on the surface of the TIR domain in a highly negatively charged region. Mal D96N was modeled using the same approach as the wild type protein and exhibited no significant changes in structure or geometry compared with wild type Mal, as might have been expected from a change in a surface residue. This prediction was further supported using software capable of estimating the level of structural destabilization encoded by point mutations (site-directed mutator or SDM) (21Topham C.M. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This program uses a statistical potential energy function that predicts the effect that a specific amino acid substitution may have on the stability of that protein and produces the pseudo-free energy difference between a wild type and mutant protein (21Topham C.M. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Worth C.L. Bickerton G.R. Schreyer A. Forman J.R. Cheng T.M. Lee S. Gong S. Burke D.F. Blundell T.L. J. Bioinform. Comput. Biol. 2007; 5: 1297-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The D96N substitution was shown to induce structural alterations with corresponding pseudo ΔΔG values of 0.729 kcal/mol, implying that there is no significant change to the overall stability of the Mal TIR domain caused by this mutation. The loss of a surface-exposed negatively charged side chain resulting from an aspartic acid to asparagine substitution (Asp → Asn) (Fig. 5A) would be predicted to be responsible for the experimentally observed disruption of the Mal/MyD88 protein interaction. Fig. 5B shows a model of the TLR4-TIR homodimer (cyan)-Mal TIR domain (magenta) complex. The change in electrostatic charge resides near a surface region (pattern 108–122; shown in yellow) that is predicted to interact with MyD88 (Fig. 5B and Ref. 20Núñez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, residue 96 lies distal to the BB loop region of Mal (green) that has previously been proposed to interact with TLR4 (Fig. 5B and Ref. 20Núñez Miguel R. Wong J. Westoll J.F. Brooks H.J. O'Neill L.A. Gay N.J. Bryant C.E. Monie T.P. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e788Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), consistent with the immunoprecipitation studies in Fig. 4 indicating that Mal D96N retains its ability to bind to TLRs 2 and 4 even though it is no longer capable of binding MyD88. Mal D96N is an inactivating mutation that is unable to transduce signaling downstream of TLR2 and TLR4. We next addressed the question of what the frequency of this polymorphism was in the general population. We sequenced Tirap in African Tanzanian (n = 91), Chinese Han (n = 97), and Caucasian Dutch (n = 188) individuals. The African Tanzanian and the Chinese individuals all apparently expressed wild type Mal. However, one individual in the Caucasian Dutch cohort was heterozygous for the D96N mutation. Although this experiment is not an exhaustive assessment of the frequency of MalD96N in all populations, we can conclude that this variation of Mal has a very low prevalence in the populations studied. This is understandable given the strong phenotype in innate signaling that we observed in our experiments. Indeed, individuals homozygous for MalD96N would be expected to have a phenotype similar to what has been reported for MyD88 deficiency, i.e. hypersusceptible to common life-threatening pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (31von Bernuth H. Picard C. Jin Z. Pankla R. Xiao H. Ku C.L. Chrabieh M. Mustapha I.B. Ghandil P. Camcioglu Y. Vasconcelos J. Sirvent N. Guedes M. Vitor A.B. Herrero-Mata M.J. Aróstegui J.I. Rodrigo C. Alsina L.

Upon encountering a pathogen, they elicit an inflammatory response involving an intricate network of signaling molecules. Changes in the structure of the TLR signaling components can have dramatic effects on the outcome of various infectious diseases. Some of these changes may be caused by the presence of a SNP in the coding region of the protein. The effects of SNPs on the structure of proteins and the consequent effect on TLR signaling have been described in many studies (32Davila S. Hibberd M.L. Hari Dass R. Wong H.E. Sahiratmadja E. Bonnard C. Alisjahbana B. Szeszko J.S. Balabanova Y. Drobniewski F. van Crevel R. van de Vosse E. Nejentsev S. Ottenhoff T.H. Seielstad M.

TIR domain interactions between the TLR components are a necessary event for downstream signaling to occur. SNPs in adapter proteins could, thus, be influential in determining the progression of infection. Incidentally, Mal is the most polymorphic of all the adapter proteins. Of the eight known coding polymorphisms in Mal, only one, S180L, has been previously described (9Khor C.C. Chapman S.J. Vannberg F.O. Dunne A. Murphy C. Ling E.Y. Frodsham A.J. Walley A.J.

Genet. 2007; 39: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) found that the heterozygotes carrying this polymorphism were protected from malaria, tuberculosis, and bacteremia. In view of these observations we hypothesized that SNPs in Mal could affect TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. The data presented herein make a strong case that a variant of Mal, D96N, is essentially nonfunctional. Our model would indicate that Mal D96N does not bind MyD88 because of a critically located change in charge on its surface and, hence, fails to function as a bridging adapter between the receptors TLR2 and TLR4 and the sorting adapter MyD88. Its inability to engage MyD88 prevents activation of NF-κB, IRF5, and most likely activator protein (AP-1), all of which are required to trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine production. A noteworthy point is that Mal-deficient macrophages from mice were all reconstituted with human Mal. The TIR domains of murine and human Mal are 71% identical, and indeed, human Mal was capable of fully restoring function in these cells. As expected, D96N was defective in pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon stimulation. A surprising finding was the absence of a phenotype for Mal S180L in our studies, an outcome that conceivably could be because of differences in species of the reconstituted protein and cell types, although this explanation would not hold for the ability of transfected Mal S180L to drive reporter constructs in HEK293T cells. In our experiments Mal S180L was fully active, and its effect upon stimulation was comparable with that of wild type Mal. It is true that we have no truly satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between our findings and that of Khor et al. (9Khor C.C. Chapman S.J. Vannberg F.O. Dunne A. Murphy C. Ling E.Y. Frodsham A.J. Walley A.J. Kyrieleis O. Khan A. Aucan C. Segal S. Moore C.E. Knox K. Campbell S.J. Lienhardt C. Scott A. Aaby P. Sow O.Y. Grignani R.T. Sillah J. Sirugo G. Peshu N. Williams T.N.

One explanation for our findings, at least in Mal knock-out macrophages complemented with the various mutant Mal constructs, is that Mal S180L may be a hypomorphic lesion rather than a null mutation. Hence, sufficient overexpression may overcome its relative inability to signal. Indeed, Western blots of the transduced Mal as well as the variants using an established anti-Mal antibody suggested that the recombinant proteins were at least 10–100-fold more abundant in the immortalized cell lines than endogenous wild type Mal (data not shown). Clearly, this discrepancy from previously published results needs to be better analyzed. To this effect, a knock-in mouse expressing the S180L lesion has been engineered (data not shown) and will need to be characterized to determine the nature of this mutation in vivo. Residue 96 and the surrounding 10–12 amino acid region is fairly well conserved in the known orthologs of TIRAP. The presence of an aspartic acid (Asp) at position 96 creates a negatively charged surface that is conducive to protein-protein interactions. Conversion to uncharged asparagine would, thus, be expected to change the binding potential of the protein. Modeling of the TIR domains of Mal and Mal D96N suggested that the residue 96 lies away from the TLR4 or TLR2 binding site but is in very close proximity to the MyD88 binding site (Fig. 5). These predictions were confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation assays and show that Mal D96N retains the ability to bind TLR2 and TL4 but is unable to bind MyD88. Hence, this characterization of a natural Mal mutant identifies with apparent pinpoint precision a single residue in the TIR domain of Mal that is critical for its interaction with MyD88. The frequency of D96N in the populations we analyzed was very low. In the initial screen we genotyped individuals from three different populations. However, we found just one individual (of 376) who was heterozygous for D96N. Considering the deleterious phenotype we observe, the low frequency of this polymorphism is not unexpected. As the mutation exists, it is nearly certain that there are sporadic individuals born who are homozygous for D96N. Because the data suggest the failure to bind MyD88 is the reason for the phenotype of D96N, we believe that individuals carrying this mutation in a homozygous state would be extremely susceptible to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections. In view of the reported serious clinical significance of MyD88 and IRAK4 deficiencies, two gene products that are downstream of Mal and which should be similar to Mal D96N expression, we believe that Mal D96N represents a rare, potentially life-threatening mutation (36Medvedev A.E. Lentschat A. Kuhns D.B. Blanco J.C. Salkowski C. Zhang S. Arditi M. Gallin J.I. Vogel S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 37Picard C. Puel A. Bonnet M.

Indeed, individuals occasionally present for medical case with sepsis in the absence of any known risk factors; we would suggest that MalD96N should be considered under such circumstances as a potential cause of such a clinical presentation. In contrast to what one might expect for the rare individual with two mutant alleles, the fact that this amino acid variant exists in the population, albeit at a very low frequency, suggests that heterozygous individuals have a survival advantage under some, but still undefined, circumstances. The key to determining the nature of this hypothetical heterozygous advantage is to analyze enough individuals from enough different populations to define clinical correlates.

Resistance of breast cancer cells to targeted chemotherapies including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has been linked to persistent PI3K activity, which may in part be due to increased membrane expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (HER2 and HER3). Recently we found that proteins of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family suppress PI3K activity downstream of the receptor by sequestering its p85α subunit from signaling complexes. Because a substantial percentage of breast tumors have RGS16 mutations and reduced RGS16 protein expression, we investigated the link between regulation of PI3K activity by RGS16 and breast cancer cell growth. RGS16 overexpression in MCF7 breast cancer cells inhibited EGF-induced proliferation and Akt phosphorylation, whereas shRNA-mediated extinction of RGS16 augmented cell growth and resistance to TKI treatment. Exposure to TKI also reduced RGS16 expression in MCF7 and BT474 cell lines. RGS16 bound the amino-terminal SH2 and inter-SH2 domains of p85α and inhibited its interaction with the EGF receptor-associated adapter protein Gab1. These results suggest that the loss of RGS16 in some breast tumors enhances PI3K signaling elicited by growth factors and thereby promotes proliferation and TKI evasion downstream of HER activation.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 10Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar), is activated by extracellular receptor tyrosine kinases including the EGF receptor (EGFR or HER) family, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the insulin growth factor receptor. HER stimulation activates Class IA PI3Ks consisting of dimers of p85α or Β and either p110α, Β, and δ catalytic subunits (11Scaltriti M. Baselga J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 5268-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) recruits p85 to the EGFR complex through a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in p85 (12Mattoon D.R. Lamothe B. Lax I. Schlessinger J. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which co-localizes the catalytic p110 subunit and membrane phospholipid substrates at the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generated by PI3K activity recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 through its pleckstrin homology domain, which in turn phosphorylates the mitogenic and antiapoptotic kinase Akt. Substrates of Akt include mTOR, BAD, IKK, FOXO, p27, MDM2, and GSK3Β, all of which are signaling molecules with vital functions in cell cycle regulation and growth (3Harvey R.D. Lonial S. Future Oncol. 2007; 3: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Akt has been shown in several tumors such as ovarian and breast carcinoma and may lead directly to transformation of malignant melanoma (5Govindarajan B. Sligh J.E. Vincent B.J.

Proteins of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family mediate cellular desensitization to G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. RGS proteins act as GTPase-accelerating proteins to reduce the life span of activated (GTP-bound) Gα subunits of the G protein-coupled receptor signal-transducing heterotrimeric G protein (13Willars G.B. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The R4 subfamily of RGSs (RGS1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 16, 18, and 21) are the smallest members of the family, containing few residues outside of the ∼120-amino acid RGS domain that mediates binding to Gα proteins and GTPase-accelerating protein activity. We found recently that several R4 RGS proteins interacted with the phosphorylated p85α subunit of PI3K (14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mast cells, RGS13 inhibited PI3K activation induced by high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) cross-linking by antigen. FcϵRI stimulates PI3K by recruiting its catalytic p110δ subunit through p85 binding to a multi-protein complex that includes Gab2 and Grb2 at the plasma membrane (15Gu H. Saito K. Klaman L.D. Shen J.

PI3K has an essential function in allergic responses (16Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). As a result of increased PI3K activation, mice deficient in RGS13 had more IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and anaphylaxis (14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RGS16, an R4 RGS protein homologous to RGS13, was identified originally as a p53 target gene in breast and colon cancer cells (17Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L.

Recent analysis of 222 primary breast cancers found a high rate (50%) of genomic instability at the RGS16 locus (19Wiechec E. Overgaard J. Hansen L.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008; 47: 766-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because RGS16 associates with both EGFR (20Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48532-48538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and p85α (14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we investigated how it affected the growth and survival of breast cancer cells. We found that RGS16 directly bound the amino-terminal SH2 and inter-SH2 domains of phosphorylated p85α, which mediate p110 and adapter binding and membrane localization (21Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Schmidt-Kittler O. Samuels Y. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). RGS16 overexpression in MCF7 breast cancer cells suppressed proliferation and EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas extinction of RGS16 expression increased cell growth and resistance to TKI treatment. Thus, through regulation of PI3K activity, RGS16 may limit proliferation of mammary cells and render cancer cells more susceptible to TKIs or other therapeutic compounds. HEK293T cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) (containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2). MCF7 and BT474 cells were cultured in complete RPMI (Invitrogen). MCF7 cells expressing either scrambled control or RGS16-specific shRNAs were constructed and maintained in complete RPMI supplemented with neomycin (0.4 mg/ml) as described elsewhere (18Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In brief, the plasmid pSUPER (from Reuven Agami), which contains the human H1 RNA polymerase promoter, was used as the backbone for insertion of short sequence-specific shRNAs. Small interfering RNA sequences were: human RGS16, CGCTTCCTGAAGTCGCCTG (RGS16 shRNA1); or scrambled, GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG (control shRNA1). Lentiviral constructs expressing either scrambled shRNA (catalog number SCH002; control shRNA2) and RGS16-specific shRNA (catalog number TRCN0000014292; small interfering RNA sequence TTCCTGAAGTCGCCTGCTT; RGS16 shRNA #2) were purchased from Sigma. RGS16 wild type and a mutant containing amino acids (aa) 91–202 were generated by PCR and cloned into pLenti6.3-V5 (Invitrogen). The target gene or shRNA constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells together with a lentiviral packaging mix (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 72 h virus was harvested in the supernatant and concentrated 3-fold by centrifugation. Concentrated virus was added directly to MCF7 cells, and gene expression and function was assayed 48 h later. The plasmid pCEFL-hmycEGFP2-PI3Kp85α was the gift of J. Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health). Plasmids encoding p85α truncation mutants were generated by PCR using full-length p85 as a template and subcloned into pCEFLhmycEGFP2. The plasmid pCDA3.1-V5/His-RGS16 was described previously (18Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were stimulated with EGF for 15 min. prior to lysis in buffer containing 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgS04, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were incubated with either 2.5 μg of GST or GST-RGS16 (18Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After three washes with lysis buffer, pulldowns were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. We did GST binding assays using recombinant p85α (250 ng; Jena Bioscience) and GST or GST-RGS16 (2.5 μg). p85α was preincubated in buffer containing 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnSO4, 3 μm Na3VO4, 1.2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with or without 25 ng of recombinant Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min. at 30 °C prior to 10-fold dilution in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and purification with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Biosciences). Binding of His-p85α (200 ng; Jena Biosciences) to GST-Gab1 (200 ng; Axxora LLC) in the presence or absence of His-RGS16 expressed in bacteria and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (18Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was determined after phosphorylation of both p85α and Gab1 and precipitation with glutathione beads as above. The interaction of GST-RGS16 to phosphorylated His-p85α/p110α (200 ng, Jena Bioscience) was assessed by incubation with nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.04% Triton X-100, and 10 mm imidazole. For co-immunoprecipitations, the cells were processed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor tablets followed by immunoprecipitation with Myc antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Fast Flow 4B; Amersham Biosciences). All of the blots are representative of two to four independent experiments. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt, phosphorylated Akt (Thr308), PI3K-p85α, Gab1, PTEN, HER2, and mouse anti-Myc antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Β-Actin antibody was from Sigma, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology. GST antibody was purchased Santa Cruz, GFP antibodies were from University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, and V5 antibody was from Invitrogen. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-RGS16 antibody was described previously (22Estes J.D. Thacker T.C. Hampton D.L. Kell S.A. Keele B.F. Palenske E.A. Druey K.M. Burton G.F. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6169-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were from Thermo Scientific. Click-iT EdU Imaging kit (Invitrogen) was used for S phase entry measurements. The cells were maintained in culture chambers and serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with EGF (50 ng/ml; Sigma) or FBS (10% in RPMI) for 16 h. EdU was added into cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm for 2 h before harvest. Cell fixation, permeabilization, and EdU detection were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was used to identify nuclei. These assays were performed as described (23Liang G. Yang J. Wang Z. Li Q. Tang Y. Chen X.Z. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3254-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in eight separate wells of a 96-well plate. The cell viability was measured using a luminescence assay kit (CellTiter-Glo, Promega), and the results were read on a plate luminometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo Labsystems). MCF7 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing scrambled or RGS16-specific shRNAs or viruses encoding RGS16-V5 (wild type), RGS16-V5 (91–202), or Β-galactosidase-V5 in 6-well plates. 24 h post-transduction the cells were split and seeded into eight separate wells of a 96-well plate for each condition. After incubation for another 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h before stimulation with EGF (50 ng/ml) or FBS (10%) in RPMI for the indicated times. The EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD168393 was purchased from EMD Biosciences. Student’s t test was used for analysis of two groups and analysis of variance for multiple groups. The data are expressed in the form of the means ± S.E. Probability values (P) of less than 0.05 were considered significant. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. The Image J software program (National Institutes of Health) was used for densitometric analysis. To investigate how RGS16 affects proliferation of breast cancer cells, we compared the growth of MCF7 cells stably expressing scrambled or RGS16-specific short shRNA (18Johnson E.N. Seasholtz T.M. Waheed A.A. Kreutz B. Suzuki N. Kozasa T. Jones T.L. Brown J.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The RGS16-specific shRNA (RGS16 shRNA1) reduced RGS16 protein expression more than 75% compared with a control shRNA (control shRNA1) (Fig. 1A, top two panels). Initial examination of control and RGS16-depleted cells revealed an obvious difference in growth between the two populations. After 72 h of incubation with serum-containing medium, the number of RGS16-specific shRNA-expressing cells was double that of control cells (Fig. 1B). Further analysis showed that serum-starved MCF7 cells with reduced expression of RGS16 proliferated significantly more than control cells did over time upon exposure to medium containing either FBS (Fig. 1C) or EGF (Fig. 1E). To evaluate the specificity of this RGS16-targeted shRNA, we treated MCF7 cells with lentiviruses encoding either scrambled or RGS16-specific shRNAs distinct from those used to generated the stable cell line described above. RGS16 knockdown in MCF7 cells infected with the RGS16-targeted shRNA virus (RGS16 shRNA2) was similar to that observed in the stable cell line (Fig. 1A, bottom two panels). These MCF7 cells depleted of RGS16 also grew significantly faster after exposure to medium containing either FBS (Fig. 1D) or EGF (Fig. 1F). Finally, to test whether extinction of RGS16 expression affected cell cycle progression in MCF7 cells, we measured incorporation of EdU, which represents cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Nearly twice as many serum-starved MCF7 cells depleted of RGS16 incorporated EdU than control cells did after exposure to either EGF or FBS (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results suggest that RGS16 negatively regulates growth of MCF7 cells induced by specific factors including EGF.FIGURE 2Stable RGS16 knockdown increases the number of S phase MCF7 cells in response to EGF.

CTL, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Receptors for EGF include the HER family members HER1 (EGFR) and HER2–4. Dysregulated expression and/or activation of HER proteins, particularly HER2 and HER3, have been found frequently in breast cancer cells. Approximately 20–30% of primary human breast cancers overexpress HER2, which presages aggressive tumor growth and poor response to therapy (24Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem. Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because RGS16 knockdown did not affect HER2 expression in MCF7 cells (supplemental Fig. S1), we hypothesized that it may control cell growth by regulating the downstream signaling pathway activated by EGF rather than receptor expression or phosphorylation. Given the importance of PI3K activity in breast cancer cell growth (25Sergina N.V. Rausch M. Wang D. Blair J. Hann B. Shokat K.M. Moasser M.M. Nature. 2007; 445: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), we examined PI3K activation in MCF7 cells stimulated with EGF by measuring Akt phosphorylation. Cells expressing either of the RGS16-specific shRNAs had significantly more Akt phosphorylation after EGF stimulation than cells expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ERK phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation was not affected by RGS16 knockdown. These results suggest that the increased growth of MCF7 cells expressing RGS16 shRNA is due to increased PI3K activity and that RGS16 regulates EGF-evoked MCF7 cell growth primarily by affecting the PI3K-Akt signaling route. Enhanced and/or resurgent PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation has been linked to breast cancer resistance to several antitumor therapies such as doxorubicin (26Li X. Lu Y. Liang K. Liu B. Fan Z. Breast Cancer Res. 2005; 7: R589-R597Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endocrine deprivation (8Tokunaga E. Kimura Y. Mashino K. Oki E. Kataoka A. Ohno S. Morita M. Kakeji Y. Baba H. Maehara Y. Breast Cancer. 2006; 13: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and TKIs (25Sergina N.V. Rausch M. Wang D. Blair J. Hann B. Shokat K.M. Moasser M.M. Nature. 2007; 445: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which PI3K-Akt signaling evades these treatments remain incompletely defined. To determine whether the loss of RGS16 affects susceptibility of breast cancer cells to targeted chemotherapy, we treated cells with an EGFR-targeted TKI (PD168393) and measured viability. MCF7 cells expressing RGS16-specific shRNA were significantly more resistant to the antiproliferative effect of this compound than cells expressing the control shRNA (Fig. 3B). Because these findings indicated a relationship between quantities of RGS16 and resistance of MCF7 cells to PD168393, we explored the relationship between RGS16 expression and PI3K activity in wild type MCF7 cells by examining Akt phosphorylation after TKI treatment. However, because we could not detect Akt phosphorylation in MCF7 cells without EGF stimulation (Fig. 3A), we incubated BT474 breast cancer cells, which also express RGS16, with PD168393. Consistent with prior studies, continuous exposure of BT474 cells to this compound led to a transient decrease in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), which suggested an antitumor effect of the TKI (25Sergina N.V. Rausch M. Wang D. Blair J. Hann B. Shokat K.M. Moasser M.M. Nature. 2007; 445: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). After 24 h, however, Akt phosphorylation rebounded, which correlated with a diminution in RGS16 amounts (Fig. 3C). Amounts of PTEN, a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that is mutated in a wide array of tumors (27Nagata Y. Lan K.H. Zhou X. Tan M. Esteva F.J. Sahin A.A. Klos K.S. Li P. Monia B.P. Nguyen N.T. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Yu D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar) and negatively regulates PI3K activity, did not vary substantially during this time period. These results demonstrate a clear link between PI3K activity and the level of RGS16 expression in TKI-treated breast cancer cells and suggest another possible mechanism by which such cells escape the antiproliferative effect of the TKI. To determine the mechanism(s) whereby RGS16 regulates PI3K activity in breast cancer cells, we performed immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells using an overexpression strategy. In addition to RGS13, several R4 RGS proteins including RGS1, 4, 5, and 16 co-immunoprecipitated the PI3K p85α subunit (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine whether RGS16 interacted with PI3K in breast cancer cells, we incubated the lysates of EGF-stimulated MCF7 cells with recombinant GST or GST-RGS16 immobilized on glutathione beads. Using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we detected a single protein (∼85 kDa) that co-purified with GST-RGS16 but not GST (Fig. 4A). By immunoblot analysis, we identified this protein as p85α. A pulldown assay showed that recombinant, His-p85α directly bound recombinant GST-RGS16 but not GST expressed in bacteria and precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in reciprocal experiments in which bacterially expressed GST-RGS16 fusion protein co-precipitated with His-PI3K bound to nickel beads (Fig. 4C). Although the Src family kinases such as Lyn phosphorylate tyrosine residues on p85, its phosphorylation is not required for p110 or adapter interactions (28Cuevas B.D. Lu Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 29Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y. Wongsasant B. Kinoshita Y. Ichimori Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this case, however, p85α tyrosine phosphorylation was necessary for RGS16 binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, p110 was not required for the direct interaction of RGS16 with p85α (Fig. 4B), nor did RGS16 affect binding of p85 to p110 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that RGS16, p85, and p110 can co-exist in a complex. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous RGS16 interacted with p85α in MCF7 cells under steady-state conditions (FBS) (Fig. 4D). To further define the molecular association of RGS16 and PI3K, we determined the regions in RGS16 and p85α, mediating their interaction using deletion mutants (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Co-immunoprecipitations of lysates from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with full-length p85α, and wild type RGS16 (or its mutants; supplemental Fig. S3) showed that a mutant containing aa 31–202 interacted with p85α, whereas mutants comprised of aa 61–202 or 1–30 did not. This experiment suggests that p85α binding required aa 31–60 of RGS16 (Fig. 5A). To identify the RGS16-binding site on p85α, we constructed p85α deletion mutants lacking one or more domains (supplemental Fig. S4). p85α is a modular protein containing an amino-terminal SH3 domain (aa 1–77), a BCR/RacGAP homology domain (aa 78–301), and Src homology 2 (nSH2 and cSH2) domains (aa 302–428 and 624–724) separated by the p110 binding inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain (aa 429–623) (30Vanhaesebroeck B. Ali K. Bilancio A. Geering B. Foukas L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 194-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of full-length RGS16 by p85α mutants containing deletions of the carboxyl terminus demonstrated that aa 302–724 of p85α were required for RGS16 binding because a mutant containing only residues 1–301 did not co-precipitate RGS16 (Fig. 5B). Further, p85α mutants containing only nSH2 (aa 302–428) or iSH2 domains (aa 429–623) co-immunoprecipitated RGS16 (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that either the nSH2 or iSH2 domains are sufficient for RGS16 binding. The nSH2 domain of p85α is involved in PI3K-adapter interactions. EGFR activation induces Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which promotes engagement of the nSH2 domain of p85α by Gab1 (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar, 12Mattoon D.R. Lamothe B. Lax I. Schlessinger J. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We determined whether RGS16 binding to this region affected the association of phosphorylated p85α with phospho-Gab1 in competition experiments. We first incubated recombinant GST-Gab1 and p85α with Lyn kinase to phosphorylate both proteins. Phosphorylated Gab1 and p85α were then mixed together in the presence or absence of RGS16, and GST-Gab1 was precipitated with glutathione beads. As shown in Fig. 6A, a 5–25-fold molar excess of RGS16 progressively inhibited p85α co-precipitation with GST-Gab1. Importantly, recombinant RGS16 was not pulled down by GST-Gab1 in the presence or absence of p85α (Fig. 6A, middle panel), indicating that RGS16 does not bind Gab1. These results suggested that RGS16 prevents p85α binding to its cognate adapter Gab1. To evaluate the effect of RGS16 binding on p85α protein-protein interactions in vivo, we analyzed association of p85α and Gab1 in RGS16-depleted MCF7 cells. Although RGS16 knockdown in MCF7 cells did not alter expression of either p85α or Gab1 (Fig. 6B), more Gab1 was associated with p85α in the presence of FBS (Fig. 6B) or in response to EGF treatment (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the loss of RGS16 in these cells enhanced PI3K activity as a result of increased Gab1-p85α complex formation. We used lentiviruses to express V5 epitope-tagged RGS16 (wild type or a mutant containing aa 91–202, which lacks the p85α-binding site) in MCF7 cells and detected these proteins in cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 7A). RGS16 overexpression significantly inhibited proliferation of serum-starved MCF7 cells in response to EGF (Fig. 7B) or FBS (Fig. 7C) compared with cells expressing a control protein (Β-galactosidase). In contrast, expression of RGS16 (91–102) had no effect on EGF- or FBS-induced proliferation (Fig. 7, B and C). This finding indicates that RGS16 interaction with p85α is critical for its regulation of MCF7 cell growth. To determine how RGS16 overexpression affected EGF-induced PI3K activity, we assessed Akt phosphorylation in MCF7 cells after EGF stimulation. Cells expressing RGS16 had reduced Akt phosphorylation upon exposure to EGF compared with cells expressing Β-galactosidase (Fig. 7D). On average, Akt phosphorylation (as determined by densitometry) was inhibited 57 ± 7% in such cells compared with control. By contrast, EGF-evoked ERK phosphorylation was not affected by the expression of RGS16 in these cells. These findings support the hypothesis that RGS16 impairs EGF-induced growth of breast cancer cells specifically by binding p85α and suppressing activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Although a major predictor of breast cancer growth is hormone receptor (estrogen and progesterone receptor) status, ∼30% of estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive breast tumors are resistant to endocrine therapy (8Tokunaga E. Kimura Y. Mashino K. Oki E. Kataoka A. Ohno S. Morita M. Kakeji Y. Baba H. Maehara Y. Breast Cancer. 2006; 13: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The EGF signaling pathway and specifically PI3K activation induced by HER family members have emerged as important determinants of breast cancer cell growth. Mutations in genes for signaling molecules downstream of EGF such as p110 (PIKC3A), PTEN, and Akt are also common in breast tumors (31Stemke-Hale K. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. Lluch A. Neve R.M. Kuo W.L. Davies M. Carey M. Hu Z. Guan Y. Sahin A. Symmans W.F. Pusztai L. Nolden L.K. Horlings H. Berns K. Hung M.C. van de Vijver M.J. Valero V. Gray J.W. Bernards R. Mills G.B. Hennessy B.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6084-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Loss of PTEN activity has been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab) therapy (27Nagata Y. Lan K.H. Zhou X. Tan M. Esteva F.J. Sahin A.A. Klos K.S. Li P. Monia B.P. Nguyen N.T. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Yu D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). Thus, dysregulated activation of the EGFR-PI3K signaling axis may promote breast cancer progression and resistance to therapy. Our studies suggest that RGS16 could act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting PI3K-dependent mammary epithelial cell growth. RGS16 was identified recently as a potential breast cancer susceptibility gene. A high rate of allelic imbalance (50%) was found at the RGS16 locus (1q25.3) in a series of clinical breast tumors (19Wiechec E. Overgaard J. Hansen L.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008; 47: 766-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Detailed mapping of chromosomal breakpoints revealed microdeletions in the putative RGS16 promoter region, and in 10% of these tumors the RGS16 promoter was methylated. A substantial portion (∼67%) of tumors with such mutations had reduced RGS16 protein expression (30–60% of nonmalignant epithelial breast tissue amounts) (19Wiechec E. Overgaard J. Hansen L.L. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2008; 47: 766-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We showed here that RGS16 depletion in breast cancer cells enhances EGF-evoked PI3K activity and growth. An inverse relationship exists between RGS16 quantities and PI3K activity in MCF7 and BT474 cells. Together, these findings suggest that abnormal RGS16 expression or function contributes to breast carcinogenesis. Our mutational and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that RGS16 inhibits PI3K activation in MCF7 cells by constraining protein-protein interactions induced by growth factors. p85α exists in two pools: free and complexed with p110 catalytic subunits (30Vanhaesebroeck B. Ali K. Bilancio A. Geering B. Foukas L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 194-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). p85 contacts the adapter-binding domain and C2 domains of p110 through its nSH2 domain and the coiled-coil iSH2 domain (together referred to as niSH2), and this binding inhibits p110 catalytic activity (21Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Schmidt-Kittler O. Samuels Y. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 32Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cellular receptors, nSH2 binds phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor itself (as for platelet-derived growth factor receptor) or on adapter proteins associated with the receptor (such as Gab1 for EGFR) (Fig. 8A) (12Mattoon D.R. Lamothe B. Lax I. Schlessinger J. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because RGS16 contacts the PI3K complex through the niSH2 domain of p85α, such binding may prevent p85α from engaging phosphotyrosines on receptors or adapters (Fig. 8B). In mast cells, RGS13 inhibited p85α binding to Gab2, the adapter phosphorylated upon activation of FcϵRI (14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although collectively these findings suggest that RGS proteins regulate PI3K activity by inhibiting signaling complex formation, they do not exclude other processes. For example, a basic stretch in the iSH2 domain of p85α is thought to contact membrane phospholipids directly (21Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Schmidt-Kittler O. Samuels Y. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. Science. 2007; 318: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and RGS16 binding to niSH2 could interfere with membrane localization of PI3K. Although p110 and RGS both bind iSH2, our preliminary studies have not shown that RGS proteins inhibit p85-p110 interactions (Ref. 14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Fig. 4C). Thus, RGS16 may bind a surface on p85α distinct from that which contacts p110 or may occupy a unique region within iSH2. The temporal and spatial regulation of the p85-RGS interaction itself requires further study. Most R4 RGS proteins such as RGS13 and RGS16 are localized in the cytoplasm under steady-state conditions but may be recruited to the membrane or other organelles (33Clark M.A. Sethi P.R. Lambert N.A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Roy A.A. Lemberg K.E. Chidiac P. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence suggests that in mast cells, RGS13 is rapidly and transiently localized at the plasma membrane after IgE-antigen stimulation of FcϵRI on mast cells. 4G. Liang, G. Bansal, Z. Xie, and K. M. Druey, unpublished data. Thus, cellular localization patterns of RGS proteins may vary based on the distinct binding partners they acquire during the course of cellular stimulation, and future studies will address the timing and stability of RGS16-p85α complex formation in resting and activated cells. In summary, using two different cell types with distinct receptors mediating PI3K activation (Ref. 14Bansal G. Xie Z. Rao S. Nocka K.H. Druey K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and the current study), we have described a general mechanism of PI3K regulation induced by RGS protein binding to the regulatory p85α subunit, which inhibits its recruitment to signaling complexes. Further studies such as co-crystallization of the RGS-PI3K complex should provide mechanistic details as well as provide a basis for the design of new compounds that could mimic RGS regulation of PI3K. Given the importance of PI3K for many physiological processes, such drugs may be useful in a variety of disorders involving dysregulated metabolism, cell proliferation, and immunity, among others.

A high-risk subgroup of HPVs is associated with virtually all cases of cervical cancer [1]–[3]. High-risk HPVs are transmitted sexually; however, the exact mechanisms by which sexual contact promotes virus infection remain uncertain. To study this question we asked whether capsids of HPV type 16 (a high-risk HPV) specifically interact with sperm cells. We tested if purified HPV16 virions directly adsorb to live human sperm cells in native semen and in conditions that resemble the female genital tract. We found that HPV16 capsids bind efficiently to two distinct sites at the equatorial region of the sperm head surface. Moreover, we observed that the interaction of virus with sperm can be reduced by two HPV infection inhibitors, heparin and carrageenan. Our findings suggest that 1) sperm cells may serve as motile carriers that promote virus dispersal and mucosal penetration, and 2) blocking interactions between HPV16 and sperm cells may be an important strategy for the development of antiviral therapies."

Working on the premise that developmental pathways giving a selective growth advantage are often recapitulated in tumors, we investigated the regulation of VEGF by HDAC4 and Runx2 in chondrosarcoma. We tested the hypothesis that there is dysregulation of HDAC4/Runx2/VEGF gene expression and that decreased HDAC4 expression accounts for at least some of the increased VEGF expression seen in chondrosarcoma. We show that reduced expression of HDAC4 in chondrosarcoma cells increases expression of Runx2 leading to increased expression of VEGF and in vitro angiogenesis.

VEGF expression is determined by normal physiologic hypoxia-related pathways and genetic abnormalities. We know that both of these broad categories of gene regulation are operational in chondrosarcomas. Included in genetic abnormalities are epigenetic phenomena such as DNA methylation and histone modification that regulate chromatin structure and gene expression (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3156-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Both histone acetylases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key enzymes that catalyze the reversible acetylation/deacetylation of core histone tails, which is an essential mechanism of the epigenetic control of gene expression (10Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HDACs function as transcriptional co-repressors. HDACs can deacetylate DNA binding transcription factors, thereby decreasing their binding affinity, localization, and half-life (11Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E.

The activity of HDACs is affected by their phosphorylation state, thereby linking them to cell signaling pathways (12Zheng Q. Sebald E. Zhou G. Chen Y. Wilcox W. Lee B. Krakow D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 77: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mammalian HDACs fall into three classes based on their structural and biochemical characteristics (13Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the class II HDACs are involved in cellular differentiation and developmental processes, and their dysregulation may be involved in carcinogenesis. HDAC4 along with -5, -7, and -9 compose the class IIa HDACs. Class I HDACs are ubiquitously expressed, whereas class II HDACs have tissue-specific expression and regulate cell differentiation. HDAC4 is expressed in muscle, brain, and cartilage. Targets of HDAC4 include Runx1 and Runx2. Runx2 is important for skeletal development. There has been no direct link established between HDAC4 and angiogenesis; however, in the growth plate, HDAC4 is expressed in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral bone formation by binding and inhibiting the activity of Runx2/Cbfa1 (11Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N.

Schneider C. Brancolini C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2804-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Runx2 is a transcription factor that is necessary for chondrocyte hypertrophy and endochondral ossification (11Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E. McAnally J. Pomajzl C. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Karsenty G. Olson E.N. Cell. 2004; 119: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). HDAC4 expression decreases in the more mature hypertrophic chondrocytes, releasing Runx2 activity, and endochondral ossification ensues. Runx2 is known to up-regulate VEGF expression during endochondral bone formation, and both changes in HDAC4 and Runx2 expression are necessary for this process to occur (15Zelzer E. Glotzer D.J. Hartmann C. Thomas D. Fukai N. Soker S. Olsen B.R. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The functions of HDAC4 and Runx2 in the growth plate have been demonstrated in HDAC4 knock-out and Runx2 gain of function mice in which there is premature ossification of the growth plate in both models. Overexpression of Runx2 in fibroblasts induces an increase in their VEGF mRNA level and protein production (15Zelzer E. Glotzer D.J. Hartmann C. Thomas D. Fukai N. Soker S. Olsen B.R. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In chondrosarcoma, overexpression of Runx2 has been detected in high grade tumors, although its significance has been heretofore unknown (16Papachristou D.J. Papachristou G.I. Papachristou G.J.

Res. 2007; 13: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In lung cancer patients, reduced expression of class II HDACs is associated with poor progression (18Osada H. Tatematsu Y. Saito H. Yatabe Y. Mitsudomi T. Takahashi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of the class II HDACs in control of Runx2 transcription in normal chondrocyte differentiation and suggest Runx2 may play an important role in angiogenesis and chondrosarcoma development. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that decreased HDAC4 expression in chondrosarcoma cell lines accounts for some of the increased VEGF expression and angiogenic activity in these cells. We also investigated the mechanism of HDAC4 regulation of Runx2 and VEGF transcription. Human chondrocytes isolated from normal adult articular cartilage were cultured in complete medium (40% Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium, 40% minimum Eagle舗s medium, 20% F-12 medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum (19Lin C.

First, the putative Runx-binding site mutation between nucleotides −559 and −553 (Fig. 4C) was generated by amplifying the promoter fragment using the forward primer carrying the mutation site indicated in capital letters, 5′-ggggcgctcggccaGAacagggaagctg-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-cagcttccctgttctggccgagcgcccc-3′. The PCR product was digested with DpnI to destroy the parental DNA, followed by transformation in XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The second mutation between +293 and +287 bp was then generated by using the single mutant promoter as the template with forward primer 5′-tctacttccccaaatcactgtACattttggaaaccagcagaaag-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ctttctgctggtttccaaaatgtacagtgatttggggaagtaga-3′. Incorporation of the substitution mutations was confirmed by sequencing (Brown University, Providence, RI). RNA was isolated from chondrocytes and transfected and nontransfected CS cell lines with RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). After treatment with TURBO DNase (Ambion), 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers to obtain first-strand cDNA using iScript cDNA kit (Bio-Rad). The quantification of mRNA for HDAC4, Runx2, and VEGF was performed by two-step real time quantitative RT-PCR (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Primers for HDAC4 were (5′ to 3′) as follows: forward, gag aga ctc acc ctt ccc g, and reverse, ccg gtc tgc acc aac caa g. Runx2 primers were as follows: forward, ggc agg cac agt ctt ccc, and reverse, ggc cca gtt ctg aag cac c, and can detect the three Runx2 transcript variants. The primers used for VEGF and 18 S rRNA (18 S) were reported previously (19Lin C. McGough R. Aswad B. Block J.A. Terek R. J. Orthop. Res. 2004; 22: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 18 S was used as an internal control gene because it has been shown to be the optimal reference gene (28Asp J. Brantsing C. Lövstedt K. Benassi M.S. Inerot S. Gamberi G. Picci P. Lindahl A. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 1577-1582PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification conditions were as follows: 2 min of preincubation at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C for enzyme activation, and 40 cycles at 95 °C denaturation for 10 s, 55 °C annealing for 30 s, and 72 °C extension for 30 s. The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method, i.e. 2−ΔΔCt method, was used for the calculation of fold amplification (29Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123232) Google Scholar). Each experiment was evaluated with three PCRs, and each experiment was repeated three times, the sample size necessary to maintain power at 0.80 to detect a 50% decrease with an α of 0.025 (one-tailed t test). The expression of HDAC4, Runx2, and VEGF in each tumor cell line was compared with chondrocytes using a one-tailed Student舗s t test to take advantage of the directional hypothesis. After subculture for 18 h, CS cells in 12-well plates were 70% confluent and then transiently transfected with reporter plasmid and co-transfected with gene expression vector, or empty vector, or different concentrations of HDAC4 vector as indicated using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer舗s instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA (1.5 μg/well) for each experiment was kept constant by addition of EV when needed. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured to assess reporter gene expression in a luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA) using Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). In this system, cells were co-transfected with 0.02 μg of pRL-SV40 (Renilla luciferase driven by a full SV40 promoter) to control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency (firefly/Renilla ratios). The relative fold induction or inhibition refers to the ratio of luciferase activity measured in expression vector-transfected cells relative to the activity obtained in the empty vector-transfected cells. Each measurement was made in duplicate. Whole cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were heated and separated by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk/PBST for 1 h and subsequently incubated overnight with primary antibodies (anti-VEGF and anti-HDAC4 polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Runx2 antibody, CeMines, Inc., Golden, CO). Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified using Image Acquisition and Analysis Software (UVP Biosystems, Upland, CA) and normalized to actin. Because of heterogeneity of Western blot data, normalized data were natural logarithm-transformed and analyzed with Student舗s t test with Bonferroni correction. CS cells in 10-cm2 dishes were transfected with 4 μg of HA-CBP and/or FLAG-HDAC4. 48 h later, cells were lysed, and the lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Runx2 antibody (CeMines, Inc., Golden, CO) with shaking at 4 °C overnight, and then with 30 μl of prewashed protein A/G Plus-agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in 1× wash buffer (Actif Motif, Carlsbad, CA), resuspended in 1 volume of Western loading buffer, and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C. The presence of immunoprecipitated proteins (acetylated Runx2, total Runx2, and HDAC4) was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by using anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-Runx2 antibody (CeMines, Inc.), and anti-HDAC4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 5 nm HDAC4 siRNA (MU-003497-02, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) or Runx2 siRNA (Hs_RUNX2_3_HP siRNA, target sequence CAGCACGCTATTAAATCCAAA, Qiagen) per ml by HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). mRNA and protein were obtained from cell lysates as described above 72 h after transfection. Soluble VEGF was detected in the conditioned media (CM) obtained from CS cells transfected with HDAC4 expression plasmid (different concentrations) or empty plasmid or siRNA specific for Runx2 or scramble siRNA for control using a commercially available assay kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer舗s instructions. VEGF levels in the CM were measured two times for each condition and normalized for the number of cells at the end of the culture period. Immunodepletion of VEGF in CM obtained from transfected CS cells as described above was performed by incubating either with 1 μg of anti-VEGF goat IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or with control normal goat IgG per 1 ml of CM for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation; then 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 2 h more at 4 °C with rotation. The resulting immune complexes were removed by centrifugation, and then VEGF levels were remeasured in the CM by ELISA. ChIP experiments were performed following the protocol provided with the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) using JJ and CS-1 cells. Cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA-bound protein and subsequently subjected to sonication in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of the anti-Runx2 antibody or anti-HDAC4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for each ChIP reaction. Following immunoprecipitation, proteins were removed by treatment with proteinase K, and the DNA was purified by the DNA mini-columns supplied with the kit. PCR was performed using primers for three regions of the human VEGF promoter (5′ to 3′) as follows: Pf1, gcttgccattccccacttgaatc; Pr1, tgtctgtctgtctgtccgtcag; Pf2, gtgtgcagacggcagtcactag; Pr2, gatctattggaatcctggagtgacc; Pf3, ctacagacgttccttagtgctgg; Pr3, caccaagtttgtggagctgagaac. CM from CS cells were tested for angiogenic activity in the HUVEC assay. HUVECs in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) were plated at 5 × 103 cells per well in 24-well plates and starved of extrinsic VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor for 24 h. HUVECs were then cultured in the different CM for 24 h followed by 18 h with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well). Proliferation rate was measured from radioactivity incorporated into total DNA using a Topcount NXT scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.) and calculated as a ratio of experimental to control. Results are an average of three independent experiments with four data points for each condition. Similarly, we tested the effect of VEGF-immunodepleted CM on HUVEC proliferation in the presence or absence of rhVEGF165 (R & D Systems). To study the effects of co-culturing HUVEC with JJ cells on HUVEC tube formation, we used a three-dimensional Matrigel system. In this system, each well of 4-well chamber slides was first divided into two equal parts by a thin strip of agarose gel (30Wang I.E. Shan J. Choi R. Oh S. Kepler C.K. Chen F.H. Lu H.H. J. Orthop. Res. 2007; 25: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 100 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was added into one side of the wells and allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37 °C. JJ cells were then plated on the Matrigel, and 2 days after transfection, the other side of the wells were coated with Matrigel onto which HUVECs were plated. JJ cells and HUVECs were initially cultured in their own media. After 2 h, the wells were covered with enough of the HUVEC medium (2% fetal bovine serum, HUVEC medium without VEGF and fibroblast growth factors) so that the agarose divider no longer separated the two wells. After 1 day of co-culture, images of HUVEC were taken using an SpotII digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) attached to a Nikon microscope. Eight different fields were evaluated for each treatment, each image being selected on the basis of the optimal focal plane that had the majority of cells in focus. The tubular structures were traced, and the total length, area, and number of junctions were analyzed using Elements software (Nikon, Inc, Mellville, NY). The experiment was repeated three times. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). ELISA, luciferase activity, and HUVEC proliferation and tube formation results were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. Post test comparisons were made with Bonferroni correction. Experiments with two groups were analyzed with the Student舗s t test. The null hypothesis of no difference was rejected at a significance level of 5%. As a first step in evaluating the potential role of HDAC4, Runx2, and VEGF as dysregulated pathways in chondrosarcoma, we analyzed expression of these genes and proteins in chondrocyte and chondrosarcoma cell lines using quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 1). We found that HDAC4 gene expression was decreased to 17 and 39% in chondrosarcoma cells compared with chondrocytes (Fig. 1A), whereas Runx2 was increased 4.1- and 15.6-fold (Fig. 1B), and VEGF was increased 5.9- and 8.5-fold (Fig. 1C). All chondrosarcoma gene expressions were significantly different from chondrocytes (p < 0.01). Protein levels of Runx2 and VEGF showed analogous changes (Fig. 1D). Quantification of Western blots showed HDAC4 was decreased to 47% in chondrosarcoma cells compared with chondrocytes, and Runx2 and VEGF were increased 3.4- and 3.1-fold compared with chondrocytes. To determine whether the decreased expression of HDAC4 is a cause, either directly or indirectly, of increased VEGF expression, chondrosarcoma cells were transfected with either HDAC4 expression construct or siRNA directed against HDAC4. We tested if increased HDAC4 expression would decrease VEGF expression. Real time PCR showed that HDAC4 transfection repressed the endogenous VEGFa transcription to 34% in JJ cells and to 29% in CS-1 cells compared with the control (EV) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2, B and C, shows high level of HDAC4 expression after HDAC4 transfection. Western blotting also showed that endogenous VEGFa protein level decreased after HDAC4 transfection (Fig. 2C). Thus, VEGF expression was repressed by overexpression of HDAC4. The opposite effect was seen with HDAC4 knockdown. As can be seen from Fig. 2, E and F, siRNA effectively decreased the expression of endogenous HDAC4 mRNA and protein levels, whereas VEGFa mRNA increased 4.1-fold (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2D) as did protein levels (Fig. 2F). Similar results were obtained with JJ cells (data not shown). To understand the mechanism of the regulation of VEGF expression by HDAC4, we did the following studies. We used VEGFa and Runx2 reporter constructs to investigate the effects of HDAC4 and Runx2, alone and in combination, on the VEGF and Runx2 promoters. The results of luciferase activity analysis show that transfection of HDAC4 expression construct repressed VEGFa promoter-driven luciferase activity to 54% in JJ cells (p < 0.05) and to 35% in CS-1 (p < 0.02) (Fig. 3A). Because Runx2 is known to be a target for HDAC4, and because Runx2 is known to regulate endochondral ossification, which requires VEGF, we analyzed the role of Runx2 in the HDAC4 regulation of VEGF expression. When CS-1 was transfected with the HDAC4 expression construct and a Runx2-luciferase reporter construct, promoter activity decreased to 38% of control (Fig. 3B). HDAC4 also decreased Runx2 mRNA in JJ and CS-1 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3C). When Runx2 expression was knocked down using siRNA (Fig. 3E), similar effects were seen on VEGF expression as with HDAC4 transfection. VEGF mRNA decreased to 33% of control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D), and the protein level also decreased (Fig. 3E). When CS-1 was transfected with a Runx2 expression construct, VEGF promoter activity increased 2.9-fold compared with EV (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3F). The effect of Runx2 on the VEGF promoter activity could be counteracted by HDAC4 transfection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3F) (p < 0.05 for 0.1–0.6 μg). To assess if HDAC4 has a direct effect on VEGF expression, we performed separate and combination transfections with HDAC4 and Runx2 siRNA. HDAC4 transfection decreased VEGF mRNA to 35% of control (p < 0.001) and secreted VEGF into conditioned media from 311 to 202 pg/ml (p < 0.05). Runx2 knockdown had a similar effect as follows: VEGF mRNA decreased to 29% of control (p < 0.001), and VEGF protein decreased to 107 pg/ml (p < 0.01). HDAC4 transfection after Runx2 knockdown had no additional effect on VEGF mRNA (27% of control, p > 0.05 compared with Runx2 siRNA) or secreted protein (102 pg/ml, p > 0.05) (Fig. 3, G and H). The results are consistent with Runx2 being the mediator of HDAC4 regulation of VEGF. To show more definit"
https://openalex.org/W1997662291,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by multiple birth defects including heart defects and myeloproliferative disease (MPD). Approximately 50% of NS patients have germline gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2. We provide evidence that conditional ablation of Stat3 in hematopoietic cells and cardiac valvular tissues leads to myeloid progenitor hyperplasia and pulmonary stenosis due to the leaflet thickening, respectively. Consistently, STAT3 activation is significantly compromised in peripheral blood cells from NS patients bearing Shp2-activating mutations. Biochemical and functional analyses demonstrate that activated Shp2 is able to down-regulate Tyr(P)-Stat3 and that constitutively active Stat3 rescues activating mutant Shp2-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in bone marrow cells. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Stat3 is an essential signaling component potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of NS and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia caused by PTPN11 gain-of-function mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2027313170,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is known to catalyze the generation of asymmetric dimethylarginine in polypeptides. Although the cellular role of PRMT6 is not well understood, it has been implicated in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. PRMT6 is known to methylate histone H3 Arg-2 (H3R2), and this negatively regulates the lysine methylation of H3K4 resulting in gene repression. To identify in a nonbiased manner genes regulated by PRMT6 expression, we performed a microarray analysis on U2OS osteosarcoma cells transfected with control and PRMT6 small interfering RNAs. We identified thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent natural inhibitor of angiogenesis, as a transcriptional repression target of PRMT6. Moreover, we show that PRMT6-deficient U2OS cells exhibited cell migration defects that were rescued by blocking the secreted TSP-1 with a neutralizing peptide or blocking α-TSP-1 antibody. PRMT6 associates with the TSP-1 promoter and regulates the balance of methylation of H3R2 and H3K4, such that in PRMT6-deficient cells H3R2 was hypomethylated and H3K4 was trimethylated at the TSP-1 promoter. Using a TSP-1 promoter reporter gene, we further show that PRMT6 directly regulates the TSP-1 promoter activity. These findings show that TSP-1 is a transcriptional repression target of PRMT6 and suggest that neutralizing the activity of PRMT6 could inhibit tumor progression and therefore may be of cancer therapeutic significance.

These findings suggest that PRMT6 is a negative regulator of gene expression; however, the knowledge of its physiological targets remains limited.To answer these questions, a microarray approach was used to identify physiological genes regulated by PRMT6. We report that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is stimulated in PRMT6-deficient cells. TSP-1 is a high molecular weight homotrimeric glycoprotein composed of three identical disulfide-linked 180-kDa subunits (35Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 36Lawler J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 820-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). TSP-1 is synthesized by many cell types and secreted into the extracellular matrix (37Mosher D.F. Doyle M.J. Jaffe E.A. J.

Silverstein R.L. Henkin J. Bouck N.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TSP-1 inhibits cell migration by binding cell surface receptors, including CD36 with its type 1 sequence repeat domains (44Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 45Tuszynski G.P. Rothman V.L. Papale M. Hamilton B.K. Eyal J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The TSP-1 gene is transcriptionally regulated by serum (46Framson P. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4989-4996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and p53 (47Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Epigenetic changes have also been reported, and notably the TSP-1 gene is regulated by DNA methylation (48Rojas A. Meherem S. Kim Y.H. Washington M.K. Willis J.E. Markowitz S.D. Grady W.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 123: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). What is less understood is the epigenetic histone regulation of the TSP-1 gene.In this study, we show that a total of 51 genes are significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05 and fold change >2) and 28 genes down-regulated (p < 0.05 and fold change <2) in PRMT6-deficient U2OS cells. One of the up-regulated genes was TSP-1, which is therefore a putative repression target of PRMT6. Arginine methylation of the H3R2 mark was validated as the mechanism by which TSP-1 gene expression was regulated, indicating an epigenetic mode of TSP-1 regulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a set genes involved in cardiovascular and cellular migration regulated by PRMT6. The knockdown by ∼90% of PRMT6 in U2OS cells led to the identification of 51 genes that were up-regulated and 28 genes that were repressed by >2-fold using Illumina microarrays. One of the genes that is repressed by PRMT6 is the secreted glycoprotein TSP-1, a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and cell migration. We show that PRMT6-deficient U2OS cells exhibited cell migration defects that were rescued by blocking the secreted TSP-1 with a neutralizing peptide or blocking α-TSP-1 antibodies. PRMT6 was associated with the TSP-1 promoter and regulated the balance of methylation of H3R2 and H3K4, such that in PRMT6-deficient cells H3R2 was hypomethylated and H3K4 was trimethylated at the TSP-1 promoter consistent with gene activation. Using a TSP-1 promoter reporter gene, we further show that PRMT6 directly regulates the TSP-1 promoter. These findings show that TSP-1 is a transcriptional repression target of PRMT6 and that epigenetic changes of H3R2 regulate TSP-1 expression.Arginine methylation and PRMTs have not been shown to regulate cell migration. However, cytoskeleton proteins and signaling proteins have been identified as targets of PRMTs using proteomic analyses (3Boisvert F.M. Côté J. Boulanger M.C. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1319-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 55Wu C.C. MacCoss M.J. Mardones G. Finnigan C. Mogelsvang S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2907-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that arginine methylation is likely to play a role in regulating key protein-protein interactions during cell migration. Indeed, the estrogen receptor α was recently shown to be arginine-methylated by PRMT1, and this regulates complex formation with Src kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, and focal adhesion kinase (56Le Romancer M. Treilleux I. Leconte N. Robin-Lespinasse Y. Sentis S. Bouchekioua-Bouzaghou K. Goddard S. Gobert-Gosse S. Corbo L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 212-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, the role of PRMT1, or other PRMTs, in cell migration remains elusive. Further evidence for a potential role of PRMTs in signaling or cell migration is suggested by the identification of PRMT8 as a membrane-bound PRMT (57Lee J. Sayegh J. Daniel J. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32890-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our findings show that the nuclear PRMT6 influences cell migration by regulating genes, including TSP-1, involved in cellular migration.The presence of the asymmetrically dimethylated H3R2 (H3R2me2a) mark is associated with gene repression and infrequently linked with active gene promoters (32Guccione E. Bassi C. Casadio F. Martinato F. Cesaroni M. Schuchlautz H. Lüscher B. Amati B. Nature. 2007; 449: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The asymmetrical dimethylation of H3R2 interferes with key contacts with plant homology domain (30Kirmizis A. Santos-Rosa H. Penkett C.J. Singer M.A. Vermeulen M. Mann M. Bähler J. Green R.D.

Therefore, the knockdown of PRMT6 would be predicted to activate H3R2me2a-repressed genes, and thus the genes that are up-regulated in U2OS PRMT6-deficient cells (supplemental Table 1) likely represent genes that are normally repressed by PRMT6 via H3R2me2a. It is also possible that the monomethyl H3R2, generated by other PRMTs, itself may be an activating mark, as recently demonstrated in yeast (30Kirmizis A. Santos-Rosa H. Penkett C.J. Singer M.A. Vermeulen M. Mann M. Bähler J. Green R.D. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2007; 449: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The hox and myc regulated genes are genes known to be regulated by H3K4 trimethylation (32Guccione E. Bassi C. Casadio F. Martinato F. Cesaroni M. Schuchlautz H. Lüscher B. Amati B.

We did not identify them in our microarray analysis suggesting that these genes are active in U2OS and that the knockdown of PRMT6 does not further change the H3R2 mark that is likely hypomethylated in these cells. The genes that are down-regulated in the PRMT6-deficient cells represent a new category of regulated genes by PRMT6 and suggest that PRMT6 may serve as a coactivator for certain genes via H3R2me2a or via other methyl marks.We reported previously that the hypomethylation of H3R2 in the presence of DNA damage reduced cyclin D1 expression (34Iberg A.N.

The mechanism by which cyclin D1 via p27KIP1 leads to TSP-1 gene regulation is unknown. We did not identify cyclin D1 in our microarray analysis (supplemental Table 1) consistent with our previous findings that PRMT6 knockdown alone was insufficient to reduce cyclin D1 expression (34Iberg A.N.

Cancer. 2008; 123: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we now extend this to histone arginine modification by PRMT6. Our data show that blocking secreted TSP-1 restored cell migration in PRMT6-deficient U2OS cells. However, a total of 14 genes was identified in the cellular migration category in our microarray analysis of PRMT6-deficient cells, suggesting that the other 13 genes may also contribute to the phenotype of PRMT6-deficient cells. In conclusion, our results show that PRMT6 regulates cell migration and invasion by regulating epigenetic changes in the TSP-1 promoter. Our findings suggest that specific PRMT6 inhibitors may be useful to suppress cancer cell invasion and malignant development and/or progression.

A mass spectrometric approach was used to identify residues phosphorylated by CK2, which may regulate the activity of initiation factors during the translation initiation process in plants. CK2 in vitro phosphorylation sites were identified in wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana eIF2α, eIF2β, eIF5, and wheat eIF3c. Native wheat eIF5 and eIF2α were found to have phosphorylation sites that corresponded to some of the in vitro CK2 phosphorylation sites. A large number of the CK2 sites identified in this study are in conserved binding domains that have been implicated in the yeast multifactor complex (eIF1-eIF3-eIF5-eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet). This is the first study to demonstrate that plant initiation factors are capable of forming a multifactor complex in vitro. In addition, the interaction of factors within these complexes was enhanced both in vitro and in native extracts by phosphorylation of one or more initiation factors by CK2. The importance of CK2 phosphorylation of eIF5 was evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis of eIF5 to remove CK2 phosphorylation sites. Removal of CK2 phosphorylation sites from eIF5 inhibits the CK2-mediated increase in eIF5 interaction with eIF1 and eIF3c in pulldown assays and reduces the eIF5-mediated stimulation of translation initiation in vitro. These results suggest a functional role for CK2 phosphorylation in the initiation of plant translation."
https://openalex.org/W2009968714,"Continuous macroautophagic activity is critical for the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis; however, unchecked or dysregulated autophagy can lead to cell death. Cultured Purkinje neurons die by an autophagy-associated cell death mechanism when deprived of trophic support. Here, we report that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) completely blocked the autophagy-associated cell death of Purkinje neurons. To examine the mechanism by which IGF-I influences autophagy, neurons were infected with adeno-RFP-LC3 and subjected to trophic factor withdrawal, and the size and number of autophagosomes were analyzed by live-cell fluorescence imaging. In control neurons, autophagy occurred at a constitutive low level with most autophagosomes measuring less than 0.75 μm. Trophic factor withdrawal increased the number and size of autophagosomes with most autophagosomes ranging between 0.75 and 1.5 μm and some reaching 1.5–2.25 μm. IGF-I added at the time of trophic factor withdrawal prevented the accumulation of the larger autophagosomes; however, it had no effect on the conversion of LC3, an indicator of autophagy induction. Instead, the rate of autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion measured by colocalization of RFP-LC3 and LysoSensor Green was accelerated by IGF-I. Treating the neurons with bafilomycin A1 in the presence of IGF-I led to the accumulation of autophagosomes even larger than those induced by trophic factor withdrawal alone, indicating that IGF-I regulates autophagic vesicle turnover. Finally, the effect of IGF-I on autophagy was mediated by an Akt/mTOR-de pend ent and an ERK-independent pathway.

Autophagy is a regulated, catabolic pathway for the turnover of long-lived proteins, macromolecular aggregates, and damaged organelles by lysosomal degradation (1Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). It also plays a role in clearing the cell of invading bacteria and viruses (2Levine B. Deretic V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3Lee H.K. Iwasaki A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the lysosomal pathway of intracellular degradation is divided into three distinct pathways: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (4Cuervo A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy (5Mizushima N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2861-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar, 6Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) begins with the formation of a unique double-membrane vesicle (autophagosome) that engulfs cytoplasmic constituents such as proteins, lipids, and damaged organelles, including mitochondria. The outer membrane of the autophagosome then docks and fuses with the lysosome to deliver the sequestered cargo. The inner membrane of the fused vesicle (autolysosome) along with the interior contents of the autophagosome are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, a process that generates nucleotides, amino acids, and free fatty acids that are recycled to provide raw materials and energy to the cell. Microautophagy (7Klionsky D.J. Cuervo A.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Levine B. van der Klei I. Seglen P.O. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) circumvents the autophagosome sequestration step and begins with the direct uptake of cytosolic components by invaginations and pinching off of the lysosomal membrane. As in macroautophagy, the internalized cytosolic components are digested by lysosomal enzymes, and the macromolecules are released when the vacuolar membrane disintegrates. In chaperone-mediated autophagy (8Majeski A.E. Dice J.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 9Massey A.C. Zhang C. Cuervo A.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 73: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) specific chaperone proteins bind to targeted proteins containing a KFERQ sequence and direct these proteins to the surface of the lysosome. These proteins bind to LAMP-2A on lysosomal membranes and are then transported across the membrane with the assistance of chaperone proteins where they are degraded by the lysosomal proteases. In eukaryotic cells, macroautophagy (hereon referred to as autophagy) occurs constitutively at low levels in most cells to perform housekeeping functions such as degradation of proteins and destruction of dysfunctional organelles. Dramatic up-regulation of autophagy occurs in the presence of external stressors such as starvation, hormonal imbalance, oxidation, extreme temperature, and infection as well as internal needs such as cellular remodeling and removal of protein aggregates (10Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5585) Google Scholar). Dysregulated autophagy is thought to contribute to many human diseases, particularly neurodegeneration. Morphological studies of diseased human postmortem brain consistently reveal signs of enhanced autophagy in degenerating neuronal populations. Increased autophagy and disturbances in the lysosomal degradative system have been reported in many neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease (11Cataldo A.M. Hamilton D.J. Barnett J.L.

Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Many of these neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the accumulation of mutant proteins. Several of the mutant proteins including α-synuclein and huntingtin are degraded by an autophagic-lysosomal pathway, suggesting that autophagy may be a protective mechanism for the clearance of toxic aggregate-prone proteins (18Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 19Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Atkins J. Skepper J.N. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25009-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In mouse and Drosophila models of Huntington disease, early treatment with the mTOR inhibitor and autophagy stimulator, rapamycin, and a rapamycin analogue (CCI-779) decreased neurodegeneration and improved behavioral performance (20Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). In other animal models of neurodegeneration, it has been suggested that enhanced autophagy contributes to cell death. Autophagy is induced in vulnerable populations of neurons in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease in which human mutant presenilin-1 and the Swedish variant of amyloid precursor protein are overexpressed (21Nixon R.A. Wegiel J. Kumar A. Yu W.H. Peterhoff C. Cataldo A. Cuervo A.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 22Yu W.H. Cuervo A.M. Kumar A.

Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). In both conditions autophagosomes proliferate in dendrites, and the level of LC3-II, a specific marker for autophagosome formation, is elevated. This process occurs before β-amyloid pathology develops, indicating that autophagy induction is an early response in the disease. Likewise, an ultrastructural study on neuronal degeneration in transgenic mice expressing mutant human tau demonstrated the involvement of autophagic processes (23Lin W.L. Lewis J. Yen S.H. Hutton M. Dickson D.W. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 1091-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In experimental animal models of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and scrapie disease, ultrastructural features of autophagy are abundant in cortical neurons (24Sikorska B. Liberski P.P. Giraud P. Kopp N. Brown P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Extensive autophagic vacuole formation occurs in degenerating cerebellar Purkinje neurons in models of ischemia (25Fessatidis I.T. Thomas V.L. Shore D.F. Hunt R.H. Weller R.O. Goodland F. Rowe D.

Finally, neuronal death in the Lurcher mouse, which suffers from extensive Purkinje neuron degeneration caused by a point mutation in the δ2 glutamate receptor (28Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) appears to result from the direct activation of autophagy by Lurcher GRID2 receptors through a signaling pathway consisting of GRID-2, n-PIST, and Beclin 1 (29Selimi F.

DeJager P.L. Selimi F. Heintz N. Neuron. 2002; 35: 921-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is possible that autophagy is initially up-regulated in the nervous system to provide macromolecular nutrients or clear protein aggregates from neurons and that once a certain level of intracellular damage is reached, accumulation of large autophagic vacuoles exacerbate the damage eventually leading to cell death. We have established a novel model system utilizing primary cultured cerebellar neurons in which Purkinje neurons undergo up-regulation of autophagy when trophic factors are removed from their medium. The prolonged up-regulated autophagy and the accumulation of autophagic vesicles contribute to the death of these neurons, thus providing a model to examine the relationship between enhanced autophagy and cell death (31Florez-McClure M.L. Linseman D.A. Chu C.T. Barker P.A. Bouchard R.J. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4498-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this report we have utilized live-cell imaging techniques to monitor autophagy in Purkinje neurons. We demonstrate that IGF-I, a potent neurotrophic factor in the cerebellum, prevents the accumulation of autophagic vesicles and cell death of Purkinje neurons by increasing the rate of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation via an Akt/mTOR-dependent pathway, indicating a novel mechanism by which IGF-I maintains neuronal homeostasis. The polyclonal rabbit antibody to calbindin D-28K and LC3 were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Abgent (San Diego, CA), respectively.

Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado Denver and were conducted in accordance with policies for the ethical treatment of animals established by the National Institutes of Health. Primary rat cerebellar granule neurons were isolated from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (32D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml on poly-d-lysine/laminin (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen), which is referred to as 25K+S medium. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. On day 5, neurons were infected with adenoviral vector expressing MAP1-LC3 labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP-LC3) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 24 h. Autophagic cell death was induced by removing the plating medium and replacing it with trophic factor withdrawal 5K-S medium (serum-free basal modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm KCl). Purkinje neurons in cerebellar cultures were identified by immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody to calbindin D-28K. Neurons were plated and induced to undergo death as indicated above. After the appropriate treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The neurons were then permeabilized and blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with calbindin D-28K (1:250) diluted in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody was aspirated, and cells were washed six times with PBS at room temperature for at least 1 h. Neurons were then incubated with the appropriate Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:500) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed 6 more times with PBS at room temperature, and coverslips were adhered to glass slides with mounting medium (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS). Slides were sealed with clear nail polish and stored at −20 °C before imaging. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Cooke sensicam deep-cooled CCD camera, and images were analyzed and subjected to digital deconvolution using the Slidebook 4.2 software program (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO). Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS), and lysates were briefly sonicated. Lysates were boiled for 5 min, and equal volumes of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE Novex system; Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit anti-LC3 (1:1,000; Abgent) was diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C while on a rotating platform. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes three times in TBS-T at room temperature for at least 30 min. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (1:5000)) diluted in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and were subsequently washed 3 times in TBS-T for 30 min. Immunoreactive bands were detected by use of the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare) and exposed to CL-Exposure film (Pierce). In some experiments membranes were reprobed after stripping in Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce). The blots were rinsed three times in TBS-T and processed as above with a different primary antibody. Autoluminograms shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Purkinje neuron numbers were measured by counting the number of calbindin-positive cells in 152 fields using a 63× oil objective that were randomly selected by following a fixed grid pattern over the coverslip. The total area counted per coverslip was 14.6 mm2 or ∼13% of the coverslip. In addition to calbindin staining, cells were also judged by their morphology. Cells counted as Purkinje neurons had large rounded cell bodies, elaborate processes, and larger, more oval nuclei in comparison to the smaller, rounder nuclei of granule neurons. At least three coverslips were counted per experimental condition. The numbers were averaged and expressed as a percentage of the average number counted in the appropriate controls. This was repeated for at least three independent experiments. Vesicle and fusion analysis from live-cell imaging was performed as described previously (33Bains M. Heidenreich K.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 453: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebellar neurons were infected with RFP-LC3 as described above. Twenty-four hours later, autophagic cell death was induced by removing the plating medium and replacing it with either control medium (25K+S) or trophic factor withdrawal medium (5K-S) containing the appropriate drug for various time points (0–24 h). After the appropriate treatment times, cells were stained at 37 °C with Hoechst (20 ng/ml) for 15 min to visualize cellular nuclei and LysoSensor Green (2 μm) for 5 min to visualize lysosomes. The cells were then washed 3 times for 5 min with 37 °C phenol red-free 25K+S control medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen)) or phenol red-free 5K-S medium (serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm KCL) to remove nonspecifically bound dyes. The individually timed coverslips to be imaged were attached to a 35-mm dish using Vaseline petroleum jelly and submerged in 3 ml of the appropriate phenol red-free medium. The dish was then fitted into a pre-warmed 37 °C heated stage which maintains the temperature at 37 °C. Imaging was performed as described above. Images of LysoSensor Green, RFP-LC3, and Hoechst fluorescence were captured on the fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole channels, respectively, using the 63× water immersion objective. The length of exposure on the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole channel was calibrated by the Slidebook program (Slidebook 4.2). Collected images were used to measure the diameters of all the visible RFP-and LysoSensor Green-positive vacuoles using Slidebook. Autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion was measured as the degree of co-localization between RFP-LC3 positive vacuoles and LysoSensor Green positive vacuoles, which was quantified using the Pearson correlation analysis tool in Slidebook 4.2. Vesicle diameter and fusion measurements were collected from at least 7–10 Purkinje live cell images per treatment condition for at least three independent experiments. Results shown represent the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey's test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The degree of co-localization between RFP-LC3-positive vacuoles and LysoSensor Green positive vacuoles was quantified using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), which calculates the proportion of all red intensities that contain green signals within all red intensities and was assessed using the Pearson correlation analysis tool in Slidebook 4.2. Previous studies by our laboratory have demonstrated that trophic factor withdrawal leads to the death of cultured cerebellar neurons. Granule neurons die by an apoptotic mechanism involving Bax translocation to the membrane, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and nuclear condensation (34Linseman D.A.

Le S.S. Laessig T.A. McClure M.L. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9287-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Purkinje neurons die by an autophagy-associated cell death mechanism, characterized by extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation, the presence of autolysosomes detected by electron microscopy, and the absence of caspase activation and nuclear condensation (31Florez-McClure M.L. Linseman D.A. Chu C.T. Barker P.A. Bouchard R.J. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4498-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The apoptosis induced in granule neurons deprived of trophic support was completely inhibited with IGF-I, which has been well characterized in inhibiting pathways that promote apoptosis (36Linseman D.A. Phelps R.A. Bouchard R.J. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. McClure M.L. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9287-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P.

However, the ability of IGF-I to inhibit cell death associated with autophagy has not been fully investigated. Using live-cell imagining techniques, we examined the ability of IGF-I to inhibit the autophagy-associated cell death of Purkinje neurons. To examine the effect of IGF-I on cell death of Purkinje neurons, we quantified the number of surviving Purkinje neurons after trophic factor withdrawal in the absence or presence of IGF-I (Fig. 1A). Purkinje neurons were identified by staining cultures with the Purkinje marker, calbindin D-28K. After 24 h of trophic factor withdrawal (5K-S), only 50% of Purkinje neurons remained compared with controls, which supports our previously published data (31Florez-McClure M.L. Linseman D.A. Chu C.T. Barker P.A. Bouchard R.J. Le S.S. Laessig T.A. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4498-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, ***, p < 0.001 compared with 25K+S). By 72 h all of the neurons have died and were lifted from the dish. The addition of IGF-I (200 ng/ml) to the cultures prevented the loss of Purkinje neurons induced by trophic factor withdrawal and resulted in 95% survival, which was comparable with untreated control cells (Fig. 1A, ###, p < 0.001 compared with 5K-S). The addition of bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor that disrupts lysosomal vesicle acidification and inhibits vesicle degradation (39Fass E. Shvets E. Degani I. Hirschberg K. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36303-36316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), did not decrease Purkinje survival more than 5K-S treatment alone, but it completely reversed the neuroprotective effects of IGF-I on Purkinje neuron survival, indicating that lysosomal vesicle turnover is required for IGF-I mediated neuroprotection (Fig. 1A, ***, p < 0.001 compared with 25K+S; +++, p < 0.001 compared with 5K-S + IGF-I). In the presence of trophic support (25K+S), IGF-I and bafilomycin A1 had no additional effect on Purkinje survival compared with 25K+S alone (data not shown). We then analyzed the effects of IGF-I on various steps of the autophagy pathway beginning with autophagosome formation using an adenoviral vector expressing RFP-tagged LC3, the mammalian equivalent of yeast Atg8. Atg8 was the first autophagy-related protein shown to localize to autophagosomes (40Huang W.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 41Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). In mammals LC3 is required for the expansion phase of autophagosome formation (42Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5464) Google Scholar) and, therefore, acts as a cellular marker for autophagosomes. To determine whether IGF-I could prevent the extensive autophagic vacuolation observed after trophic factor withdrawal, the size of autophagosomes were measured in RFP-LC3-infected Purkinje neurons subjected to 16 h trophic factor withdrawal in the absence or presence of IGF-I. After 16 h, the cells were stained with Hoechst and LysoSensor Green, and live-cell imaging was performed. Quantitative analysis of vacuolation was performed on captured images by measuring the diameters of all RFP-LC3 vacuoles present after 16 h of trophic factor withdrawal, which was used to create a vesicle size distribution profile (33Bains M. Heidenreich K.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 453: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the presence of trophic support (25K+S), the majority (>95%) of Purkinje neurons contained small (<0.75 μm) RFP-LC3-positive vacuoles (Fig. 1, Ba and C, section 1). IGF-I (200 ng/ml) had no additional effect on vesicle size under control 25K+S conditions (Fig. 1, Bb and C, section 2). After 16 h of trophic factor withdrawal (5K-S), there was a significant shift in the size distribution profile with a ∼40% decrease in RFP-LC3 positive vacuoles less than 0.75 μm and a ∼30% increase in RFP-LC3 positive vacuoles between 0.75 and 1.5 μm (Fig. 1, Be and C, section 5; p < 0.001 (***) and p < 0.001 (###) compared with 25K+S control). The addition of IGF-I to the trophic factor withdrawal media inhibited the autophagosome accumulation induced by trophic factor withdrawal, resulting in a shift in the vesicle size distribution toward control conditions (Fig. 1, Bf and C, section 6). To examine whether IGF-I prevented vesicle accumulation by regulating the formation of autophagosomes or vesicle turnover, we added the lysosomal degradation inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (100 nm), in the absence or presence of IGF-I and analyzed the vesicle size distribution. Under control 25K+S conditions, bafilomycin A1 induced the accumulation of vesicles due to basal autophagy in these cells (Fig. 1, Bc and C, section 3; p < 0.001 (***) and p < 0.001 (###) compared with 25K+S control).

These residues form a bipartite functional surface made of a conserved “core domain” (residues of the loops connecting the secondary structure elements of the molecule core), and a variable “NC domain” (five-residue turn and the C-tail) as was reported for other scorpion α-toxins. 2) The functional role of the two domains was validated by their stepwise construction on the similar scaffold of the anti-insect toxin LqhαIT. Analysis of the activity of the intermediate constructs highlighted the critical role of Phe15 of the core domain in toxin potency at rNav1.2a, and has suggested that the shape of the NC-domain is important for toxin efficacy. 3) Based on these findings and by comparison with other scorpion α-toxins we were able to eliminate the activity of Lqh2 at rNav1.4 (skeletal muscle), hNav1.5 (cardiac), and rNav1.6 channels, with no hindrance of its activity at Nav1.1–1.3.

These channels are large membrane proteins made of a pore-forming α-subunit of ∼260 kDa and auxiliary β-subunits of ∼30 kDa. The α-subunit is composed of four homologous domains (D1–D4), each consisting of six α-helical transmembrane segments (S1–S6) connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. A key feature in Navs function is their ability to rapidly activate and inactivate, leading to transient increase in Na+ conductance through the cell membrane. This mechanism is attributed to the ability of the positively charged S4 voltage sensors to move across the membrane in response to changes in membrane potential (1Catterall W.A.

Thus, ligands that show specificity for Nav subtypes may be used for their identification at various tissues and as leads for design of specific drugs. This requires that the bioactive surfaces of these ligands be resolved along with molecular details that determine their specificity. Among the wide range of Nav modifiers, those derived from scorpion venoms play an important role in studying channel activation (β-toxins) and inactivation (α-toxins) (9Cestèle S. Catterall W.A.

Scorpion α-toxins constitute a class of structurally and functionally related 61–67-residue long polypeptides reticulated by four conserved disulfide bridges. Despite a common βαββ core (10Gordon D.

Efforts to identify α-toxin residues involved in the interaction with the Nav receptor site-3 revealed a generally common bioactive surface divided to two topologically distinct domains: a conserved “core domain” formed by residues of the loops connecting the secondary structure elements of the molecule core, and a variable “NC domain” formed by the five-residue turn (residues 8–12) and the C-tail (20Zilberberg N.

These analyses raised the hypothesis that a protruding conformation of the NC domain correlates with high activity at insect Navs, whereas a flat conformation of this domain appears in α-toxins active at the brain channel rNav1.2a (21Karbat I.

The correlation of this structural difference with toxin preference for Nav subtypes was corroborated by constructing the bioactive surface of LqhαIT on the scaffold of the anti-mammalian α-toxin Aah2 ending up with a chimera (Aah2LqhαIT(face)) active on insects, whose NC domain is in the protruding conformation (21Karbat I.

By functional expression and mutagenesis we uncovered residues on the Lqh2 exterior that are putatively involved in bioactivity. By construction of these residues on the scaffold of the anti-insect toxin LqhαIT we confirmed their bioactive role and differentiated those that determine toxin potency from those contributing to toxin efficacy. Comparison to other α-toxins was then instrumental for the design of an Lqh2 mutant that exhibits high specificity for the neuronal channels hNav1.1, rNav1.2a, and rNav1.3. Native Lqh2 was purchased from Latoxan (Valance, France). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid constructions, and the BL21 strain (DE3, pLys) was used for toxin expression using the vector pET-14b (Novagen) in a protocol similar to that described previously (30Cohen L.

Lqh2- cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library of the Israeli yellow scorpion (34Zilberberg N. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 199-203Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cloned at the NdeI-BamHI restriction sites of pET-14B expression vector, and expressed in fusion behind a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage sequence. Overexpression, in vitro folding, and purification by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography followed a previously described protocol (30Cohen L. Karbat I. Gilles N. Ilan N. Benveniste M. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed via PCR and each toxin mutant derivative was produced and purified as described for the unmodified toxin. Quantification of the purified recombinant toxins was performed by amino acid analysis (21Karbat I. Frolow F. Froy O. Gilles N. Cohen L. Turkov M. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol.

The activity of HisLqh2 was comparable with that of the native toxin in binding and electrophysiological assays and therefore it was used throughout this study (supplemental Fig. S2). Preparation of rat brain synaptosomes, membrane protein quantification, and Lqh2 radioiodination were carried out as described (29Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification of the monoiodotoxin and determination of its concentration, as well as the composition of media used in the binding assays and termination of the reactions have been previously described (29Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14576-14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Gilles N. Chen H. Wilson H. Le Gall F. Montoya G. Molgo J. Schönherr R.

Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of excess (1 μm) unlabeled toxin. Equilibrium competition assays were performed using increasing concentrations of the unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of the labeled toxin (30–50 pmol). The median concentration values for inhibition of toxin binding (IC50) were determined by a non-linear regression analysis using the Hill equation, employing a Hill coefficient of 1. Mathematical curve fitting for IC50 determination was accomplished using KaleidaGraph (version 3.08, Synergy Software). Ki values were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/1 + [L*/Kd], in which L* is the concentration of the radioactive ligand and Kd is its dissociation constant (29Gilles N. Leipold E. Chen H.

Zlotkin E. Ilan N. Chikashvili D. Stuhmer W. Gordon D. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currents were measured 2–3 days after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp and a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Data acquisition was controlled by a Macintosh PPC 7100/80 computer, equipped with an ITC-16 analog/digital converter (Instrutech Corp., Port Washington, NY), utilizing Synapse (Synergistic Systems, Sweden). Capacitance transients and leak currents were removed by subtracting a scaled control trace utilizing a P/6 protocol (37Wallner M. Weigl L. Meera P. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bath solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.85. Toxins were diluted with bath solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and applied directly to the bath to the final desired concentration. To avoid application artifacts, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution was applied prior to toxin addition. Currents were elicited by a 50 ms depolarization to −20 mV from a −80 mV holding potential in the presence of increasing toxin concentrations. At each toxin concentration, the currents were allowed to reach a steady-state level prior to the final measurement. The dose dependence for toxin-induced removal of fast inactivation is calculated by plotting the ratio of the steady-state current remaining 50 ms after depolarization (Iss) to the peak current (Ipeak) as a function of toxin concentration and fitting with the Hill equation,IssIpeak=a0+a1-a01+(EC50[Toxin])H(Eq. 1) where H is the Hill coefficient, [Toxin] is the toxin concentration, and a0 is the offset measured prior to toxin application. The a1 − a0 amplitude provides the maximal effect obtained at saturating toxin concentrations. EC50 is the toxin concentration at which half-maximal inhibition of fast inactivation is obtained. To reduce variability, H was set to 1 in all calculations. Mutant toxin efficacy was determined as the ratio between its maximal effect (Iss/Ipeak) under saturating concentrations relative to that of Lqh2, which was normalized to 1. The scorpion α-toxins Lqh2 and LqhαIT are very similar in structure and yet they differ greatly in preference for the mammalian brain versus insect sodium channels (rNav1.2a and DmNav1, respectively) (10Gordon D.

To identify the Lqh2 face of interaction with the rat brain Nav we produced the toxin in recombinant form and analyzed the contribution of surface amino acids to bioactivity using mutagenesis. Because the activity of the recombinant Lqh2 fused to a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site was similar to that of the native toxin (supplemental Fig. S2), we used in all further experiments the toxin and mutants in their fused forms. Substitution of residues at the Lqh2 surface relied primarily on the results of mutagenic analyses of α-toxins LqhαIT, Lqh3, and BmKM1, which highlighted the bioactive role of residues at the core and NC domains (21Karbat I.

Maertens C. Zhu R.H. Wang D.C. Tytgat J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Each recombinant toxin derivative was assayed at rNav1.2a expressed in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of the β1 subunit. CD spectroscopy was used to discern effects that were due to structural perturbations from those directly associated with bioactivity. From a total of 29 mutants, the CD spectrum of only Y21A changed, and because a conservative substitution, Y21F, had negligible effect on Lqh2 activity (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1), it is conceivable that Tyr21 has a structural role. Substitution to Ala of Lys2, Phe15, Arg18, Trp38, Asn44, Thr57, and Lys58 decreased the potency of Lqh2 more than 5-fold (in EC50 values; Fig. 1; supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S3), whereas substitution of all other residues had little or no effect (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1). Because residues equivalent to all these amino acids but Lys2 have been implicated in activity of α-toxins, we analyzed in parallel how substitution of Arg2 in LqhαIT affects the activity at DmNav1. We found that substitution R2A decreased LqhαIT potency at DmNav1 by 8-fold (not shown) with no change in the CD spectrum, and therefore conclude that the second amino acid in scorpion α-toxins is an integral part of the NC domain as was also suggested for BmKM1 (23Liu L.H. Bosmans F. Maertens C. Zhu R.H. Wang D.C. Tytgat J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As residues of the five-residue turn in the α-toxins LqhαIT and BmKM1 have previously been shown to be involved in bioactivity (20Zilberberg N. Froy O. Loret E. Cestele S. Arad D. Gordon D.

Biol. 2005; 353: 788-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we have substituted one by one their equivalents (Asp8, Asp9, and Val10) in Lqh2. Surprisingly, these substitutions had no effect on activity at rNav1.2a (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1), which led us to examine the possibility that it is the general fold of the five-residue turn that affects the spatial arrangement of the entire NC domain and hence the activity. We constructed a triple mutant, in which these three residues were simultaneously exchanged by their LqhαIT equivalents (D8K, D9N, V10Y). Surprisingly, the potency of Lqh2D8K,D9N,V10Y for rNav1.2a was reduced only 4-fold compared with that of the unmodified toxin (supplemental Table S1), suggesting that by itself the five-residue turn of Lqh2 contributes only slightly to toxin activity. A conservative substitution of Phe15 by Trp had no effect, whereas substitution to Ala decreased the potency of Lqh2 for rNav1.2a by 5.5-fold (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 3). However, substitution of Phe15 to Glu, which appears at this position in LqhαIT, decreased the toxin potency for rNav1.2a by 60-fold. These results have suggested that Phe15 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with the sodium channel. Unlike in BmKM1 (23Liu L.H. Bosmans F. Maertens C. Zhu R.H. Wang D.C. Tytgat J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31679-31686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and Lqh3 (22Karbat I. Kahn R. Cohen L. Ilan N. Gilles N. Corzo G. Froy O. Gur M. Albrecht G. Heinemann S.H. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1918-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), only two residues at the C-tail of Lqh2 were important for activity. Although substitution of Lys58 by Ala decreased the activity nearly 100-fold, a conservative substitution to Arg had no effect on toxin function. In contrast, even a conservative substitution of Thr57 to Ser strongly reduced the activity (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 3). Despite the structural similarity and general conservation of residues at the bioactive domains, the potency of Lqh2 at rNav1.2a is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of LqhαIT (Fig. 2). Comparison of the two toxins at rNav1.2a has indicated that the efficacy of LqhαIT was 40% lower than that of Lqh2 and required 3 orders of magnitude higher toxin concentration (100 μm; Fig. 2). To correlate these differences in effect with structural features at the bioactive surface of the two toxins, and on the basis of a previous successful construction of LqhαIT bioactive surface on the scaffold of Aah2 (21Karbat I. Frolow F. Froy O. Gilles N. Cohen L. Turkov M. Gordon D. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31679-31686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we substituted in a stepwise manner residues on the exterior of LqhαIT by their Lqh2 equivalents. The activity of the resulting constructs was examined at rNav1.2a expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This stepwise construction was useful in determining the contribution of each of the bioactive domains to Lqh2 function. The core domain of the two toxins is nearly identical in amino acid composition, except for Phe17 in LqhαIT whose Lqh2 equivalent is Gly, and Glu15 in LqhαIT whose Lqh2 equivalent is Phe (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). Substitution of Gly17 to Phe had only a minute effect on the potency of Lqh2, whereas substitution of Phe15 by non-aromatic residues had a significant effect at rNav1.2a (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S1). This result led us to examine whether substitution of Glu15 to Phe in LqhαIT would increase its potency for rNav1.2a. Indeed, the potency of mutant LqhαITE15F, in which the core domain was aligned in principle with that of Lqh2, increased 30-fold with no change in efficacy, which was similar to that of LqhαIT (Fig. 2). In sharp contrast was the result obtained when the NC domain (five-residue turn and C-tail) of Lqh2 was constructed on the scaffold of LqhαIT. Whereas the potency of mutant LqhαITLqh2(8–10,56–64) was similar to that of the unmodified LqhαIT, its efficacy increased substantially and was comparable with that of Lqh2 (Fig. 2). When both constructs were combined, the potency and efficacy of the chimera, LqhαITLqh2(8–10,15,56–64), at rNav1.2a were almost indistinguishable from those of Lqh2, and therefore this chimera was named LqhαITLqh2(face) (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the full effect at rNav1.2a requires the cooperative interaction of the two functional domains at the toxin exterior. Because the bioactive surfaces of scorpio"

The first step in functionalization of the A-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5α- or 5β-reductase. Finasteride is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5α-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also used for androgen deprivation in hormone-de pend ent prostate carcinoma, and it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer. The effect of finasteride on steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) has not been previously reported. We show that finasteride competitively inhibits AKR1D1 with low micromolar affinity but does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator. The structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex determined at 1.7 Å resolution shows that it is not possible for NADPH to reduce the Δ1-2-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not proximal to each other. The C3-ketone of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues Tyr-58 and Glu-120 in the active site of AKR1D1, providing an explanation for the competitive inhibition observed. This is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism. The Δ4-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in nearly all steroid hormones apart from estrogens. The first step in functionalization of the A-ring is mediated in humans by steroid 5α- or 5β-reductase. Finasteride is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5α-reductase type 2 with subnanomolar affinity and is widely used as a therapeutic for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is also used for androgen deprivation in hormone-de pend ent prostate carcinoma, and it has been examined as a chemopreventive agent in prostate cancer. The effect of finasteride on steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) has not been previously reported. We show that finasteride competitively inhibits AKR1D1 with low micromolar affinity but does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator. The structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex determined at 1.7 Å resolution shows that it is not possible for NADPH to reduce the Δ1-2-ene of finasteride because the cofactor and steroid are not proximal to each other. The C3-ketone of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the catalytic residues Tyr-58 and Glu-120 in the active site of AKR1D1, providing an explanation for the competitive inhibition observed. This is the first reported structure of finasteride bound to an enzyme involved in steroid hormone metabolism. The Δ4-3-ketosteroid functionality is present in many important steroid hormones, e.g. testosterone, cortisone, and progesterone. An initial step in steroid hormone metabolism is the reduction of the Δ4-ene, which in humans is mediated by steroid 5α-reductases (SRD5A1, SRD5A2) or steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) 3The abbreviations used are: AKRaldo-keto reductaseAKR1D1human liver 5β-reductase5β-DHT5β-dihydrotestosteronePXRpregnane-X receptorPDBProtein Data Bank. to yield the corresponding 5α- or 5β-dihydrosteroids, respectively (1Russell D.W.

The products of these reactions are not always inactive. 5α-Reductase is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), which is the most potent natural ligand for the androgen receptor. By contrast, in addition to being involved in bile acid biosynthesis, 5β-reductase is responsible for generating 5β-pregnanes, which are natural ligands for the pregnane-X receptor (PXR) in the liver (3Bertilsson G.

Finasteride is a selective 5α-reductase type 2 inhibitor that reduces plasma 5α-dihydrotestosterone levels and shrinks the size of the prostate (7Stoner E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Finasteride was originally thought to act as a competitive inhibitor with nanomolar affinity for 5α-reductase type 2 (12Andersson S. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). More recently, it was found that finasteride acts as a mechanism-based inactivator of this enzyme (13Bull H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Andersson S. Baginsky W.F. Chan H.K. Ellsworth D.E. Miller R.R. Stearns R.A. Bakshi R.K. Rasmusson G.H. Tolman R.L. Myers R.W. Kozarich J.W. Harris G.S. J. Am. Chem.

The intermediate enolate tautomerizes at the enzyme active site to form a bisubstrate analogue in which dihydrofinasteride is covalently bound to NADP+ (13Bull H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Andersson S. Baginsky W.F. Chan H.K. Ellsworth D.E. Miller R.R. Stearns R.A. Bakshi R.K. Rasmusson G.H. Tolman R.L. Myers R.W. Kozarich J.W. Harris G.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2359-2365Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The bisubstrate analogue has subnanomolar affinity for 5α-reductase type 2 (Fig. 1). No structural information exists for 5α-reductase type 1 or type 2; therefore, it is not possible to determine how finasteride would bind to the active site of a human steroid double bond reductase in the absence of an experimentally determined crystal structure. Human steroid 5β-reductase is a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and is formally designated (AKR1D1) (14Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The AKRs are soluble NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductases with monomeric molecular masses of 37 kDa. These enzymes are amenable to x-ray crystallography, and during the last year, we and others have reported crystal structures of ternary complexes of AKR1D1 (15Di Costanzo L. Drury J.E. Penning T.M.

The ternary complexes containing steroid substrates include: AKR1D1·NADP+·testosterone (PDB: 3BUR), AKR1D1·NADP+·progesterone (PDB: 3COT), AKR1D1·NADP+·cortisone (PDB: 3CMF), and AKR1D1·NADP+·Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione (PDB: 3CAS) (17Faucher F.

In addition, ternary complexes containing the products 5β-dihydroprogesterone (PDB: 3CAV) and 5β-dihydrotestosterone (PDB: 3DOP) have also been described (16Faucher F. Cantin L. Luu-The V. Labrie F.

As part of an ongoing inhibitor screen of AKR1D1, we now report that finasteride acts as a competitive inhibitor with low micromolar affinity. Additionally, we report the x-ray crystal structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex. The pET16b and pET28a vectors were purchased from Novagen. The Escherichia coli strain C41 (DE3) was provided by Dr. J. E. Walker (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). NADPH was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Steroids were purchased from Steraloids, Inc. [4-14C]Testosterone (50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Finasteride was obtained from Merck Research Laboratories. All other reagents were of American Chemical Society quality or higher. Previously we reported the expression of AKR1D1 using the prokaryotic expression vectors pET16b and pET28a (15Di Costanzo L. Drury J.E. Penning T.M. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16830-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant AKR1D1 was purified to homogeneity as described previously (15Di Costanzo L. Drury J.E. Penning T.M. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16830-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Wild-type AKR1D1 was obtained in 56% yield and had a final specific activity of 80 nmol of testosterone reduced per minute per mg of purified enzyme under standard radiometric assay conditions. The standard assay contained 2 μm [4-14C]testosterone (40,000 dpm), 8 μm unlabeled testosterone, 5% acetonitrile, and 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADPH and performed at 37 °C. The substrate and product of the quenched reaction were separated by TLC and quantitated by scintillation counting. The 5β-dihydrotestosterone (5β-DHT) product was identified by co-chromatography with the authentic standard. Spectrofluorometric analysis of the reduction of testosterone to 5β-DHT was performed by monitoring the decrease in NADPH emission on a fluorescence spectrophotometer F-4500 (Hitachi America, Ltd., New York, NY). Assays contained 10 μm testosterone, 15 μm NADPH, 4% acetonitrile in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) in a final volume of 1 ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored at 37 °C. NADPH emission was monitored by using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (slit width 5 nm) and an emission wavelength set at 460 nm (slit width 10 nm). A standard curve was performed daily to convert the arbitrary fluorescence units measured at 460 nm to NADPH concentration. The curve was used to calculate the amount of NADPH oxidized per minute in the assays. The specific activity observed was in agreement with the specific activity measured radiometrically and gave a value of 80 nmol of testosterone reduced per minute per mg of purified enzyme. Enzyme inhibition studies were performed using the standard radiometric assay to monitor the reduction of 2.0 μm [14C]testosterone in the absence or presence of increasing finasteride concentrations at 37 °C. The Ki value was determined by producing a family of lines using different fixed substrate concentrations and by varying the finasteride concentration. The family of lines was fit using GraFit, and the pattern was examined to determine the mode of inhibition, i.e. competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive. Time-dependent incubation studies were performed with finasteride in which AKR1D1 (7.8 μm) was preincubated with finasteride (31.0 μm) in the presence and absence of NADPH (144 μm) in 100 mm buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed from the incubation over time and directly diluted (100-fold dilution) into the standard spectrofluorometric assay, and the amount of enzyme activity remaining was determined. The AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Typically, a drop containing 3.0 μl of enzyme solution (5.0 mg/ml AKR1D1, 2.0 mm NADP+, 0.5 mm finasteride, 10.0 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) and 4.0 μl of precipitant buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10–20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% isopropyl alcohol) was equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir of precipitant buffer. Crystals of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex appeared within 1 week and were then soaked for 24 h in the same mother liquor solution augmented with 2.0 mm NADP+, 2.0 mm finasteride, and 30% isopropyl alcohol. Following transfer to a 32% Jeffamine solution and flash-cooling, these crystals yielded diffraction data to 1.70 Å resolution at the National Synchrotron Light Source (beamline X6A, λ = 1.00 Å, 100 K). Diffraction intensities measured from these crystals indicated that they belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters similar to those previously measured from crystals of AKR1D1 complexed with different steroids (15Di Costanzo L.

Two monomers occupy the asymmetric unit in this crystal form. Data reduction was achieved using the programs HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12531) Google Scholar) and built into the electron density map. Data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1. Finasteride, which is a mechanism-based inhibitor of 5α-reductase with subnanomolar affinity, is a competitive inhibitor of recombinant AKR1D1 with a Ki value of 2.1 μm when AKR1D1 is saturated with NADPH and testosterone is used as a varied substrate (Fig. 2). Knowing that finasteride is a mechanism-based inactivator of 5α-reductase type 2 and that the mechanism of inactivation has an obligatory requirement for NADPH, we conducted preincubation studies of AKR1D1 with finasteride in the presence and absence of added NADPH over 140 min. Upon dilution of aliquots into a standard AKR1D1 activity assay, we obtained no evidence for time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. Finasteride is bound with full occupancy to monomer B in the crystal structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex. The structure of this complex is very similar to the crystal structures of the ternary AKR1D1 complexes containing NADP+ and either cortisone or progesterone, with root mean square deviations of ∼0.20 Å for 324 Cα atoms (15Di Costanzo L. Drury J.E. Penning T.M. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16830-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The electron density envelope of finasteride is clear and unambiguous (Fig. 3a), showing that the steroid binds perpendicular to the NADP+ cofactor. The side chain of Trp-230 plays a key role in packing against the β-face of finasteride, which is oriented toward the re-face of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ such that the steroid C1–C2 double bond is too far away from the 4-pro-R-hydride of NADPH for double bond reduction to occur (Fig. 3a). The C3 carbonyl oxygen of finasteride accepts hydrogen bonds from the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-58 and the anti-oriented conformer of the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu-120. Additionally, the N4 group and the C20 carbonyl oxygen group of finasteride engage in hydrogen-bond interactions with water molecules (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, although the binding mode of finasteride is similar to that of progesterone, finasteride is rotated by ∼12° with respect to progesterone (Fig. 3b), and the segment Arg-226–Val-231 (which contains Trp-230) in loop B moves ∼1 Å away to accommodate finasteride binding in comparison with progesterone binding. In monomer A, continuous but uninterpretable electron density is observed, possibly indicating disordered or low occupancy binding of finasteride (supplemental Fig. S1). Accordingly, we have not built finasteride into this density in the final model. Finally, in both monomers, the backbone conformation of Thr-224 adopts a disallowed conformation on the Ramachandran plot. Notably, the electron density corresponding to Thr-224 is clear and continuous (data not shown). Because Thr-224 is adjacent to the substrate and cofactor binding sites (15Di Costanzo L. Drury J.E. Penning T.M. Christianson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16830-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is possible that its unfavorable backbone conformation is accommodated to optimize enzyme function. Herzberg and Moult (25Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) observe that regions of such steric strain in refined enzyme structures are located overwhelmingly in or near active sites, concluding that the precision required for substrate binding and catalysis occasionally outweighs the requirement for optimal protein folding. To validate that AKR1D1 is unable to reduce a Δ1-2-ene double bond, 1,4-androstadien-17β-ol-3-one was examined as a substrate; co-chromatography with authentic standards was used to identify the product of the reaction. The reaction has three possible product outcomes: testosterone from reduction of the Δ1-2-ene; 5β-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one from reduction of the Δ4-5-ene; or 5β-DHT from reduction of the Δ1,4-diene. The product does not co-migrate with either testosterone or 5β-DHT, suggesting that the enzyme is unable to reduce the Δ1-2-ene. The kcat and Km for this reaction are 1.8 min−1 and 3.2 μm, respectively. AKR1D1 is inhibited by the 5α-reductase type 2 selective inhibitor finasteride by acting solely as a reversible competitive inhibitor. The Ki value of 2.1 μm is considerably higher than that observed for either the competitive inhibition or time-dependent inactivation of 5α-reductase type 2. By contrast, the Ki value of 2.1 μm is less than an order of magnitude greater than that observed for the inhibition of 5α-reductase type 1 (Ki value of 300 nm) (26Jenkins E.P. Andersson S. Imperato-McGinley J. Wilson J.D. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both AKR1D1 and 5α-reductase type 1 play important roles in the hepatic clearance of steroid hormones, suggesting that high dose finasteride may have an adverse effect on hepatic steroid metabolism. Inhibition of AKR1D1 by high dose finasteride would also deprive PXR of its natural 5β-pregnane ligands, resulting in diminished CYP3A4 induction. This could result in significant drug-drug interactions. Importantly, finasteride itself is metabolized by CYP3A4, suggesting that high dose finasteride might prevent its own metabolism (27Huskey S.W. Dean D.C. Miller R.R. Rasmusson G.H. Chiu S.H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1126-1135PubMed Google Scholar). Finasteride does not act as a mechanism-based inactivator of AKR1D1, in contrast with its mode of inhibition against 5α-reductase type 2. Although both AKR1D1 and 5α-reductase type 2 reduce the 4-5 double bond of Δ4-3-oxosteroids in a similar manner, i.e. hydride transfer to C5 followed by enolization, the structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex (Fig. 3a) shows that it is not possible to reduce the Δ1-2-ene of finasteride because this double bond is not proximal to the NADPH cofactor. The similarity in the binding orientations of finasteride and progesterone to AKR1D1, however, account for the competitive inhibition of 5β-reductase by the drug. It is noteworthy that finasteride forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr-58 and Glu-120, which are part of the catalytic tetrad of AKR1D1.The inability to reduce a Δ1-2-ene is validated by using 1,4-androstadien-17β-ol-3-one as a substrate. No structural information currently exists for 5α-reductase type 2. However, based on the structure of the AKR1D1·NADP+·finasteride complex, it is anticipated that the cofactor must be aligned for Δ1-2-ene reduction. It will also be intriguing to see whether there is conservation in catalytic mechanism. We have previously proposed with the aid of site-directed mutagenesis that double bond reduction requires both a catalytic tyrosine (Tyr-58) and a superacidic glutamic acid residue (Glu-120) (15Di Costanzo L.

Future x-ray crystallographic studies will determine whether such a mechanism operates for 5α-reductase type 1 and type 2. We thank Dr. Yi Jin for contributions to structure interpretations.

https://openalex.org/W2021749614,"A purified system comprised of MutSalpha, MutLalpha, exonuclease 1 (Exo1), and replication protein A (RPA) (in the absence or presence of HMGB1) supports 5'-directed mismatch-provoked excision that terminates after mismatch removal. MutLalpha is not essential for this reaction but enhances excision termination, although the basis of this effect has been uncertain. One model attributes the primary termination function in this system to RPA, with MutLalpha functioning in a secondary capacity by suppressing Exo1 hydrolysis of mismatch-free DNA (Genschel, J., and Modrich, P. (2003) Mol. Cell 12, 1077-1086). A second invokes MutLalpha as the primary effector of excision termination (Zhang, Y., Yuan, F., Presnell, S. R., Tian, K., Gao, Y., Tomkinson, A. E., Gu, L., and Li, G. M. (2005) Cell 122, 693-705). In the latter model, RPA provides a secondary termination function, but together with HMGB1, also participates in earlier steps of the reaction. To distinguish between these models, we have reanalyzed the functions of MutLalpha, RPA, and HMGB1 in 5'-directed mismatch-provoked excision using purified components as well as mammalian cell extracts. Analysis of extracts derived from A2780/AD cells, which are devoid of MutLalpha but nevertheless support 5'-directed mismatch repair, has demonstrated that 5'-directed excision terminates normally in the absence of MutLalpha. Experiments using purified components confirm a primary role for RPA in terminating excision by MutSalpha-activated Exo1 but are inconsistent with direct participation of MutLalpha in this process. While HMGB1 attenuates excision by activated Exo1, this effect is distinct from that mediated by RPA.

https://openalex.org/W2055725868,"The process of salvaging sugars released from extracellular matrix, during plant cell growth and development, is not well understood, and many molecular components remain to be identified. Here we identify and functionally characterize a unique Arabidopsis gene encoding an alpha-d-galacturonic acid-1-phosphate kinase (GalAK) and compare it with galactokinase. The GalAK gene appeared to be expressed in all tissues implicating that glycose salvage is a common catabolic pathway. GalAK catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of alpha-d-galacturonic acid (d-GalA) to alpha-d-galacturonic acid-1-phosphate (GalA-1-P). This sugar phosphate is then converted to UDP-GalA by a UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase as determined by a real-time (1)H NMR-based assay. GalAK is a distinct member of the GHMP kinase family that includes galactokinase (G), homoserine kinase (H), mevalonate kinase (M), and phosphomevalonate kinase (P). Although these kinases have conserved motifs for sugar binding, nucleotide binding, and catalysis, they do have subtle difference. For example, GalAK has an additional domain near the sugar-binding motif. Using site-directed mutagenesis we established that mutation in A368S reduces phosphorylation activity by 40%; A41E mutation completely abolishes GalAK activity; Y250F alters sugar specificity and allows phosphorylation of d-glucuronic acid, the 4-epimer of GalA. Unlike many plant genes that undergo duplication, GalAK occurs as a single copy gene in vascular plants. We suggest that GalAK generates GalA-1-P from the salvaged GalA that is released during growth-dependent cell wall restructuring, or from storage tissue. The GalA-1-P itself is then available for use in the formation of UDP-GalA required for glycan synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2076002269,"Adaptor proteins for the various growth factor receptors play a crucial role in signal transduction through tyrosine phos pho ryl a tion. Several candidates for adaptor proteins with potential effects on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated signaling pathway have been identified by recent phosphoproteomic studies. Here, we focus on a novel protein, GAREM (Grb2-associated and regulator of Erk/MAPK) as a downstream molecule of the EGF receptor. GAREM is phos pho ryl a ted at tyrosine 105 and 453 after EGF stimulation. Grb2 was identified as its binding partner, and the proline-rich motifs of GAREM are recognized by the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2. In addition, the tyrosine phos pho ryl a tions of GAREM are necessary for its binding to Grb2. Because the amino acid sequence surrounding tyrosine 453 is similar to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, Shp2, a positive regulator of Erk, binds to GAREM in this phos pho ryl a tion-dependent manner. Consequently, Erk activation in response to EGF stimulation is regulated by the expression of GAREM in COS-7 and HeLa cells, which occurs independent of the presence of other binding proteins, such as Gab1 and SOS, to the activated EGF receptor. Furthermore, the expression of GAREM has an effect on the transformation activity of cultured cells. Together, these findings suggest that GAREM plays a key role in the ligand-mediated signaling pathway of the EGF receptor and the tumorigenesis of cells.

The interactions between receptor tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins are crucial for the transduction of intracellular growth signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus: these signals are propagated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of each molecule (1Pawson T.

This complex can also regulate the activity of downstream protein kinases such as Erk and Akt, which are known regulators of various cellular functions (3Gu H. Neel B.G.

A great deal of excellent work on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has established the EGF signaling pathway as a paradigm for growth factor-mediated signal transduction (10Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The EGF receptor is known for being involved not only in normal cell proliferation but also in the origin or development of various human cancers (11Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev.

The functions in the growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathway of any molecule identified by phosphoproteomic studies must be deciphered by performing the appropriate biochemical and cell biological experiments. To identify the proteins acting downstream of the EGF receptor, we isolated all the proteins by column chromatography. The column was packed with three different anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies from the lysate of EGF-stimulated A431 cells. Over 150 proteins were detected by mass spectrometric analysis, including well studied proteins and several previously unidentified ones. Recently, we reported the functions of three unique adaptor proteins that were identified by this proteome analysis (18Konishi H. Tashiro K. Murata Y. Nabeshi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. J. Biol.

FLJ21610 has been identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in our phosphoproteomic study. This protein and one of its phosphorylation sites (tyrosine 453) have also been studied by phosphoproteomic experiments performed by several research groups (12Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat.

Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 356-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although FLJ21610 has been hypothesized to function in the EGF signaling pathway, there has been no biological evidence of its role thus far. In this study, we found that Grb2 is one of the binding partners of FLJ21610, and that it has a regulatory effect on the Erk activity associated with SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp2) (21Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) in response to EGF stimulation. Therefore, this protein has been named Grb2-associated and regulator of Erk/MAPK (GAREM). A functional analysis demonstrates the crucial role of GAREM as an adaptor protein in the activated EGF receptor complex. COS-7, A431, 293T, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For maintaining the NIH3T3 cells, fetal bovine serum was substituted with 10% calf serum. Plasmid transfection into COS-7 cells was carried out by electroporation by using Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad). Prior to EGF stimulation, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h, and 100 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) dissolved in a serum-free medium was added. GAREM (FLJ21610) cDNA, provided by the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Japan, was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV6a to be expressed as an N-terminal FLAG-tagged protein. Point mutations or internal deletions were introduced by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Grb2 and Shp2 cDNAs were cloned from a HeLa cDNA library by PCR and inserted into a pCMV-3Tag-2 vector (Stratagene) and expressed as 3× Myc-tagged proteins at the N terminus. The dominant negative construct of the Shp2 fragment containing residues 1–220 (22Chang Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and inserted into a pFLAG-CMV6 vector. All the nucleotide sequences were determined and verified using an ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 3100-Avant genetic analyzer. An anti-GAREM rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a GAREM fragment containing residues 391–488, which was bacterially produced as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein by using the pGEX4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). This antibody was purified by using HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with an immunizing antigen. An anti-EGF receptor rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the protein. The following other antibodies were obtained commercially from various companies: anti-FLAG M2, anti-β-actin (Sigma); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotech Inc.); anti-Grb2, anti-Gab1, anti-SHP2, and anti-SOS1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (Cell signaling Technology); anti-GST (Nacalai Tesque); anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (BD Transduction); and anti-myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science). To assess the relative expression levels of the GAREM transcripts, reverse transcription-PCR was performed on each panel of eight different human culture cell and tissue cDNAs cultures (human tissue and cell line MTC panel, Clontech) by using the primers 5′-GTTTAAGCTTCAGGACTCTGGAGATAGT-3′ and 5′- GAAATCTAGATTACGTCTTTTGTCTAGGGTA-3′. The mammalian expression vector pSUPER-Retro-puro (Oligoengine) was used for expressing siRNA in HeLa cells. The targeted sequence of human GAREM was 5′-AAGAGAAACTGCCCAGCACCTTT-3′ (from nt 1981 to nt 2003) and 5′-AAGTCACTACGGTTCATTGGTTT-3′ (from nt 2449 to nt 2471). Each resulting plasmid for the knockdown of GAREM was named as pSuper-GAREM 1 or 2, respectively. The empty pSuper vector was used as the control. The following procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The transfected cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to produce a total cell lysate (TCL). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, the total cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with either the primary antibody or an anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the resulting mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were subsequently washed three times with the lysis buffer. The processed samples were performed as described previously (18Konishi H. Tashiro K. Murata Y. Nabeshi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28919-28931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells or 293T cells (1 × 108 cells) transiently expressing FLAG-tagged GAREM or ΔP-rich were lysed with the lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with a FLAG-affinity gel (bed volume: 50 μl) for 2 h. The gel was applied to an empty mini column (Bio-Rad) and washed several times with the lysis buffer. FLAG-GAREM was eluted with the FLAG-peptide. GST pulldown assays were performed as described previously (18Konishi H. Tashiro K. Murata Y. Nabeshi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28919-28931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 1% skim milk and TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was incubated with 500 ng/ml GST or GST-Grb2 in TBST for 30 min. Then the membrane was washed, incubated with anti-GST antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Primary focus-formation assays were performed in NIH3T3 cells exactly as described (23Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cell lines that stably transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-GAREM, or pcDNA3- GAREMΔP-rich were generated. Following transfection, cells were selected after 14 days in a growth medium supplemented with G418. Cells were then fixed in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol and stained with crystal violet. These NIH cell lines or HeLa cells stably transfected with pSUPER vector or pSUPER-GAREM (2.0 × 105 cells) were suspended in 3 ml of 0.3% agarose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium onto a semisolid 0.6% agarose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium layer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum) in a ∼60-mm dish and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 2 weeks to form colonies. Colonies of 50 cells or more were counted from at least four randomly selected fields per triplicate well. In proliferation assays, NIH3T3 cell lines were seeded onto 6-well plates, and cell numbers were directly counted. The GAREM protein was originally identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein by phosphoproteomic studies performed by three independent research groups. The researchers found that Tyr-453 is one of the phosphorylation sites of GAREM (12Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat.

Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 356-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By using a similar strategy, we independently identified GAREM from the lysate of EGF-stimulated A431 cells. The GAREM protein comprises 875 amino acid residues and contains typical proline-rich motifs for interaction with SH3 domains (Fig. 1A). GAREM cDNA has been cloned in full-length human cDNA-sequencing projects in Japan and has been stored as FLJ21610 or FAM59A (gi 12232415). However, the function of GAREM in the EGF-signaling pathway remains to be elucidated. At first, we focused on the physical association between GAREM and the EGF receptor. Endogenous GAREM and Grb2 were found to co-immunoprecipitate with the activated EGF receptor in the lysate from the EGF-stimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, endogenous GAREM and Grb2 formed a complex in EGF-stimulated 293 cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that GAREM might regulate the EGF receptor by binding to Grb2. According to Scan-site, the proline-rich motif in GAREM was speculated to be a suitable binding site for the SH3 domains of various signaling molecules (intersectin, Crk, phospholipase Cγ, Src, Grb2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and cortactin). Specifically, we focused on the APPVPPRSAKPLS and PSIPPR (amino acid residues: 532–544 and 547–552, respectively) sequences in GAREM, which matched well with the XXPXXXRXXKPXX and the PXXPXR (where X is any amino acid residue) sequences that have been identified as the targets of the C-terminal and N-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2, respectively (Fig. 2A) (24Lewitzky M. Kardinal C. Gehring N.H. Schmidt E.K. Konkol B. Eulitz M. Birchmeier W. Schaeper U. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To analyze the binding mechanisms of GAREM and Grb2 in detail, several constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells and their interaction was assessed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). Endogenous Grb2 was found in the immune complex of anti-FLAG antibody obtained from the lysate of EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells expressing wild-type FLAG-GAREM. The substitution of the proline 547 and 550 residues by alanine and deletion of amino acid residues from proline 533 to arginine 538 did not abolish the binding ability to Grb2 in mutants. Furthermore, the combination mutant in this region (P547/550A+ΔP-rich) also bound to small amounts of Grb2. The obtained results revealed that the proline-rich region of over 50 amino acid residues (amino acid residues: 498–550) is required for the binding of GAREM to Grb2. Furthermore, binding to the activated EGF receptor was not observed in this mutant (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the Grb2 protein may be necessary for indirect association of GAREM and the EGF receptor. Next, we analyzed the effect of the tyrosine phosphorylation of GAREM on its binding to Grb2. Three research groups have reported that Tyr-453 in GAREM is phosphorylated by growth factor stimulation (12Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 16Thelemann A. Petti F. Griffin G. Iwata K. Hunt T. Settinari T. Fenyo D. Gibson N. Haley J.D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 356-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, precise analysis for detecting the phosphorylation sites of GAREM by using point mutants revealed that the Y453F mutant of GAREM replaced the tyrosine with phenylalanine continued to be phosphorylated in COS-7 cells upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2D). From further analysis using various truncated mutants of GAREM, we found that other tyrosine phosphorylation sites might exist in the N-terminal domain of GAREM (data not shown). In addition to the Tyr-453 mutant, a single mutant of Y105F led to a slight reduction in the phosphorylation level as compared with the level detected in the wild-type GAREM. Furthermore, in a double mutant in which both Tyr-105 and Tyr-453 were replaced with Phe, EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was abolished (Fig. 2D). Therefore, in addition to Tyr-453, the Tyr-105 residue of GAREM is also phosphorylated after EGF stimulation. Interestingly, the ΔP-rich mutant, which contained both Tyr-105 and Tyr-453, was not phosphorylated. Grb2 binding to the Y105F mutant was lower than that to wild-type GAREM. Furthermore, the Y105F/Y453F mutant of GAREM did not bind to Grb2 (Fig. 2E). To clarify whether the SH3 domains of Grb2 directly bind to GAREM, GST overlay (Fig. 3B), and pulldown (Fig. 3C) assays were carried out for each isolated functional domain of Grb2 indicated in Fig. 3A. Although each fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of Grb2 was able to bind directly to the purified FLAG-GAREM protein but not in the ΔP-rich mutant, the binding affinity of the C-terminal SH3 domain to GAREM was higher than that of the N-terminal SH3 domain. Next, to determine the function of Tyr-105 phosphorylation in GAREM, we performed a GST pulldown assay with the total cell lysate of COS-7 cells expressing GAREM protein derivatives from EGF-stimulated cells. The amino acid sequence surrounding Tyr-105 in GAREM is YFNS. This sequence is a good match to the SH2 domain binding site of Grb2: YXNX (where X is any amino acid residue) (25Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, small amounts of wild-type and Y453F but not Y105F mutants of GAREM associated with the SH2 domain of Grb2. In contrast, the binding efficiency of the EGF receptor to the SH2 domain of Grb2 was apparently higher than that of GAREM under the same conditions (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the interaction between GAREM and Grb2 depends on the activation of the EGF receptor and may be mainly mediated by the proline-rich domains of GAREM and the SH3 domain of Grb2. Although the Tyr-105 and Tyr-453 phosphorylation sites of GAREM may not be direct binding sites for Grb2, they may be necessary for the association of GAREM and Grb2 in the EGF-stimulated cells. To understand the function of GAREM in the activated EGF receptor complex, we investigated the effect of the GAREM expression on Erk and Akt activation, which are known to be downstream protein kinases in the signaling pathway of the EGF receptor (3Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Letters. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 27: 4-14Google Scholar). For this purpose, we established a GAREM-knockdown HeLa cell line by using a retrovirus gene transfer system. Then, the activation of each protein kinase in response to EGF stimulation was measured using the phospho-specific antibody of each kinase. GAREM knockdown inhibited Erk activation but not Akt activation after EGF stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). If GAREM knockdown suppresses Erk activation, overexpression of the GAREM protein should reverse this effect. We found that Erk activation is enhanced after EGF stimulation in cells overexpressing FLAG-GAREM but not in cells transfected with mock or expression plasmid for ΔP-rich mutant (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the Y105F/Y453F mutant could not enhance Erk activation (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that GAREM has a positive effect on Erk activation. To understand the mechanism of the regulation of Erk by GAREM, we focused on the amino acid sequence of the region surrounding the phosphorylation site Tyr-453:LPphosphoYEEL region. This motif is a good match to the consensus sequence of the binding site of Shp1 and Shp2, (I/V/L)XphosphoYXX(I/V/L) (where X is any amino acid residue). The Shp family protein is known to be required for the full activation of Erk (21Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the endogenous GAREM and Shp2 proteins associate in an EGF stimulation-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), and that this association depends on the phosphorylation of the Tyr-453 amino acid of GAREM (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the enhancement of Erk activation by the expression of recombinant GAREM was abolished in cells expressing the dominant negative construct of Shp2-(1–220) (22Chang Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Sreejayan N. Hassid A. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, C and D). Therefore, GAREM may up-regulate Erk activity by binding to Shp2 downstream of the EGF receptor. On the other hand, Gab1 is known as a Grb2-binding protein (3Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Letters. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 27: 4-14Google Scholar), and the binding properties of Gab1 to Grb2 are similar to those of GAREM. Therefore, GAREM might have a competitive effect on the interaction between Gab1 and Grb2. However, we found that the expression of FLAG-GAREM had no effect on the association of the EGF receptor and Gab1. The amounts of Gab1 in the immunoprecipitated EGF receptor did not change in the EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-GAREM (Fig. 5E). Moreover, the suppression of GAREM expression had no effect on the Grb2-Son of sevenless (SOS) complex (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the enhancement of Erk activation might be dependent on the binding of Shp to GAREM. Our observations suggest that GAREM might have the potential to regulate the growth and transformation of the cells through the pathways between receptor tyrosine kinases and Erk. Transformed HeLa cells grow and form colonies in soft agar, which is one of the hallmarks of transformation (26Freedman V.H. Shin S.I. Cell. 1974; 3: 355-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). To further examine the involvement of GAREM in cellular transformation, HeLa cell lines infected with an siRNA vector were assayed for anchorage-independent growth when suspended in soft agar. Although the number of colonies formed in soft agar was similar for each cell line, the cells in which the expression of GAREM was suppressed by siRNA formed smaller colonies than the vector-infected cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, we performed conventional focus- and colony-formation assays in NIH3T3 cells. Focus and colony formation was observed for the stable cell line expressing wild-type GAREM but not for cells transfected with an empty vector or an expression plasmid for GAREMΔP-rich (Fig. 6, C and D). Furthermore, GAREM expression positively regulated cell proliferation (Fig. 6E). Therefore, the expression level of GAREM may be one of the critical factors for transformation or malignancy of the cells. In addition, we have noticed that the internal deleted form of GAREM (GAREM(S)), which was recorded in the NCBI data base during this study, lacks the proline-rich region (gi 111307706) (Fig. 7A). To assess the expression of two GAREM mRNA species, we performed semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR by using a wide variety of cDNA libraries derived from human tissues and cultured cells. The mRNA of wild-type GAREM was expressed ubiquitously. However, only a small population of cells expressed the small transcript of GAREM as compared with wild-type GAREM (Fig. 7B). We have obtained the cDNA of GAREM(S) and expressed it as a FLAG-tagged recombinant protein in COS-7 cells. Similar in behavior to the ΔP-rich mutant of GAREM, the small form did not associate with Grb2 (Fig. 7C). Thus, the expression level of GAREM and GAREM(S) in tumor cells may have a role in malignancy. Members of the Gab family are known Grb2-binding proteins and regulators of downstream protein kinases such as Erk and Akt (3Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Letters. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 27: 4-14Google Scholar). Unlike Gab1, GAREM does not have multiple phosphorylation sites or other functional domains such as PH domains; instead, it has proline-rich sequences that enable its binding to N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2 in response to EGF stimulation (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Several phosphoproteomics studies have identified Tyr-453 to be one of the phosphorylation sites of GAREM (12Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 15Rush J. Moritz A. Lee K.A. Guo A. Goss V.L. Spek E.J. Zhang H. Zha X.M. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 16Thelemann A. Petti F. Griffin G. Iwata K. Hunt T. Settinari T. Fenyo D. Gibson N. Haley J.D. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 356-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to this site, we identified that the Tyr-105 phosphorylation occurs upon EGF stimulation. Although both tyrosine phosphorylation sites of GAREM were crucial for its binding to Grb2, neither Tyr-105 nor Tyr-453 is an effective direct binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2. From these results, we speculate that the tyrosine phosphorylations might contribute to the conformational alteration of GAREM into its active form to facilitate interaction between the proline-rich motif of GAREM and SH3 domain of Grb2 in the EGF-stimulated cells. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of Tyr-453 in GAREM plays an important role in the biological function of protein. The amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site Tyr-453 is LPphosphoYEEL: this site is a good match to the consensus sequence of the Shp binding site present in the Gab or the insulin receptor substrate-1 family (27Case R.D. Piccione E. Wolf G. Benett A.M. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10467-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also called an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (29Pinheiro da Silva F. Aloulou M. Benhamou M. Monteiro R.C. Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 366-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Ravetch J.V. Lanier L.L. Science. 2000; 290: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the phosphorylation of Tyr-453 and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory-like sequence surrounding GAREM may be necessary for the binding of GAREM to Shp2. Therefore, this binding might be directly caused by the enhanced activation of Erk in response to EGF stimulation. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs normally exist in some receptor proteins. GAREM may provide an extra binding site for Shp2 on the plasma membrane. It may be involved in the formation of the activated EGF receptor complex, or it may indirectly associate with the EGF receptor via Grb2. In general, Gab1 was translocated to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on the PH domain and the phospholipids generated by the stimulation of several growth factors (31Maroun C.R. Moscatello D.K. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31719-31726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to Gab1, GAREM localized at the plasma membrane with or without EGF stimulation (data not shown). GAREM cDNA has been cloned as a gene coding for the SAM domain-containing protein at its extreme C terminus. Recently, SAM domains have been shown to play a role in homotypic or heterotypic protein-protein interactions (32Qiao F. Bowie J.U. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : RE7Google Scholar, 33Zhuang G. Hunter S. Hwang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2683-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not have any experimental evidence to show that a portion of the C-terminal region of GAREM could function as a SAM domain. Further study will be required to determine the mechanism of cellular localization of GAREM. An interesting aspect of this complex is the question of whether or not the Gab family is included. However, GAREM may be able to bind the complex of Grb2 and Shp2 downstream of the EGF receptor independent of Gab1 and SOS. Consequently, a new independent pathway, Grb2-GAREM-Shp2, may be functionally generated for Erk activation in addition to the previously known pathways such as Grb2-SOS, Shc-Grb2-SOS, and Grb2-Gab-Shp2 at the plasma membrane. The precise relationship between GAREM and other binding proteins to the EGF receptor remains to be elucidated. In addition to the EGF receptor, the signaling pathways of the receptor tyrosine kinases are closely linked to the transformation of mammalian cells (11Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). We have shown the relationship between the expression level of GAREM and the transformation of the cells may be important. Although NIH3T3 cells have been known to be devoid of endogenous EGF receptor (34Honegger A. Dull T.J. Bellot F. Van Obberghen E. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the effect of GAREM on tumorigenesis could be observed in NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells without adding EGF. Thus, GAREM may function as a downstream molecule for not only the EGF receptor but also other receptor tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, a GAREM mutant lacking the proline-rich domain has been identified, and this mutant was not able to bind to Grb2 (Fig. 7). Because this mutant is not a splice variant of the wild-type GAREM, it may be difficult to generate it by simple gene mutation. The expression levels of this mutant protein in cultured cells or animal tissues are not yet clear. In our study, only a single protein band of GAREM was detected in the lysate of certain types of cultured cells such as COS-7, HeLa, 293, and A431 cells (data not shown). The expression of the GAREM gene (FLJ21610) has been identified by microarray analysis of multiple myeloma cells (35Claudio J.O. Masih-Khan E. Tang H. Gonçalves J. Voralia M. Li Z.H. Nadeem V. Cukerman E. Francisco-Pabalan O. Liew C.C. Woodgett J.R. Stewart A.K. Blood. 2002; 100: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Further, this gene is hypomethylated in various human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (36Frigola J. Ribas M. Risques R.A. Peinado M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e28Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The function of GAREM at physiological levels in normal cells or at abnormal levels in various tumor cells remains to be elucidated. We are currently analyzing the amount of GAREM protein and the level of Tyr-453 phosphorylation in various carcinoma cells to help understand the relationship between GAREM expression and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, screening of other interacting molecules in various cell lines, and the analysis of the function of SAM-like domains in the C-terminal of GAREM will help achieve a detailed understanding of its physiological functions. In conclusion, we have identified GAREM, a novel adaptor protein in the growth factor-mediated signaling pathway. This protein may serve a crucial role in the regulation of the downstream molecules of the growth factor receptor as well as the Gab or insulin receptor substrate-1 family proteins. We thank Dr. T. Horiuchi and T. Morinaga for the microscopic analysis. We also thank Dr. Ryan K. Louie for the helpful discussions."

We explored the possibility that receptor sensitization may arise from down-regulation of an intracellular signal negatively controlling receptor function. In view of the structural modeling between the Src region phosphorylated by the C-terminal Src inhibitory kinase (Csk) and the intracellular C terminus domain of the P2X3 receptor, we investigated how Csk might regulate receptor activity. Using HEK cells and the in vitro kinase assay, we observed that Csk directly phosphorylated the tyrosine 393 residue of the P2X3 receptor and strongly inhibited receptor currents. On mouse trigeminal sensory neurons, the role of Csk was tightly controlled by the extracellular level of nerve growth factor, a known algogen. Furthermore, silencing endogenous Csk in HEK or trigeminal cells potentiated P2X3 receptor responses, confirming constitutive Csk-mediated inhibition.

The present study provides the first demonstration of an original molecular mechanism responsible for negative control over P2X3 receptor function and outlines a potential new target for trigeminal pain suppression. ATP-activated P2X3 receptors are expressed almost exclusively by mammalian sensory neurons to play an important role in the transduction of painful stimuli to the central nervous system (1Souslova V. Cesare P. Ding Y. Akopian A.N. Stanfa L. Suzuki R. Carpenter K. Dickenson A. Boyce S. Hill R. Nebenuis-Oosthuizen D. Smith A.J. Kidd E.J. Wood J.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 1015-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Activation of P2X3 receptors by ATP released during acute and chronic pain is thought to send nociceptive signals to central pain-related networks (2Burnstock G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 575-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In view of the multitude of environmental stimuli normally reaching sensory terminals, the question then arises how inappropriate activation of P2X3 receptors is normally prevented. This process may contribute to suppression of continuous pain sensation in conjunction with central synaptic inhibition. The molecular pathways triggered by algogenic substances and responsible for modulating P2X3 receptor structure and function remain incompletely understood. This topic is of particular interest because it can provide original clues for novel approaches related to treat pain. The nerve growth factor, NGF, 2The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorα,Β-meATPα,Β-methylene-ATPAUarbitrary unitsCskC-terminal Src inhibitory kinaseFSKforskolinODGn-octyl Β-d-glucopyranosidePKCprotein kinase CTrkAtyrosine kinase receptorwtwild typePKAcAMP-dependent kinasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAHEKhuman embryonic kidney cells. is one of the most powerful endogenous substances which elicit pain and inflammation via the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA (3Pezet S. McMahon S.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 507-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This neurotrophin stimulates an intracellular cascade that elicits PKC-dependent P2X3 receptor phosphorylation with ensuing facilitation of receptor currents. Conversely, suppression of NGF signaling powerfully down-regulates P2X3 receptor function (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8190-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the raised NGF levels in acute or inflammatory pain conditions (3Pezet S. McMahon S.B.

All these receptors are involved in mediating various types of pain in the spinal cord and sensory ganglia. There is, however, no available data on the role of tyrosine phosphorylation on P2X3 receptor function. The fundamental regulator of Src signaling is the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) that blocks it via tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr-527, Refs. 10Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 11Levinson N.M. Seeliger M.A. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2008; 134: 124-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We explored whether tyrosine phosphorylation might regulate P2X3 receptors of sensory neurons by focusing on the P2X3 C-terminal domain Tyr-393 residue, which is included in a region with significant similarity with the Csk-phosphorylating region of Src. Our data demonstrate that Csk activation induced an increased tyrosine (Tyr-393 residue) P2X3 receptor phosphorylation with decreased receptor function, observed both in mouse trigeminal sensory neurons as well as a cell expression system. We, thus, propose that Csk-mediated P2X3 receptor inhibition is a novel mechanism to limit overactivation of P2X3 receptors. pCDNA3-P2X3 (rat sequence, NCBI accession number: CAA62594) was provided by Dr. A.

Transient transfection of pCDNA3-P2X3 receptors in HEK293T cells was carried out with calcium/phosphate method. Mock transfection was obtained with co-transfected with pEGFP plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). C-terminal P2X3 peptides (amino acid residues 346–397) were used for in vitro kinase assay. Reactions were performed using 1 μg of substrate peptide and 1 μg of recombinant kinase GST-Csk (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. pGEX-P2X3 peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (GE Healthcare, Uppsala Sweden) and purified with a GST SpinTrap Purification module (GE Healthcare). The quality and quantity of input target peptides were checked with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Activity of the commercial recombinant Csk was determined by the Supplier (Cell Signaling) using a radiometric method in a kinase dose-dependent assay based on Csk HTScanTM kit (Cell Signaling). Trigeminal cultures were lysed in ODG buffer (2% n-octyl Β-d-glucopyranoside, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm orthovanadate) plus protease inhibitors mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). For phosphorylation studies, proteins were extracted in ODG buffer, immunopurified in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA plus 100 mm NaF, 20 mm orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) with rabbit anti-P2X3 or anti-Csk antibodies (0.5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and pull down with protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. For co-immunoprecipitation, proteins were extracted in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Membrane protein biotinylation experiments were performed as previously described (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R.

To avoid detection of immunoglobulin heavy chains in Western blot, a mouse anti-rabbit IgG-HRP-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK) was used as secondary antibody. Quality and correct reactivity of anti-Csk, anti-Src-p527 and anti-Src-p416 antibodies were tested analyzing with Western immunoblotting HEK protein lysates after Csk overexpression cells (not shown, 15Zhang S.Q.

Loading controls were performed processing total lysates with Western immunoblotting or stripping (RestoreTM, Pierce) and successive probing. Western blot signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence light ECL (GE Healthcare). For quantification, band density was measured using Scion Image software. Paraformaldehyde fixed trigeminal neurons were processed with a guinea pig anti-P2X3 antibody (1:400, Neuromics, Edina, MN) and a rabbit anti-Csk antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit anti-phospho-Src527 antibody (1:50, Cell Signaling). Immunofluorescence reactions were visualized using suitable AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies, or, for triple immunofluorescence reactions, with biotinylated antibody and streptavidin-AlexaFluor647-conjugated (1:500, Invitrogen). Cells stained with secondary antibodies only, showed no immunostaining. Membrane in vivo labeling was obtained with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) AlexaFluor488-conjugated (1:200, Invitrogen). Specimens were observed with a confocal Leica TCS SP5 microscope (Ar-He, Ne laser). Quantitative analysis was obtained with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Data are the mean of at least five independent experiments where an average of 260 cells was analyzed. For siRNA experiments, trigeminal neurons (from 2 mouse) or HEK293 cells (5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plate) were transfected, respectively, with mouse or human Csk siRNA SmartPools (100 nm, Dharmacon RNAi Technology, Lafayette, CO) using the DharmaFECTTM-1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). For transfection efficiency control, cells were transfected with scramble RNA and siGLO RISC-Free siRNA (Dharmacon). Efficiency of Csk silencing was tested with Western immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. 24 h after silencing HEK cells were transfected with pEGFP or pCDNA3-P2X3 plasmids and analyzed 48 h later. Trigeminal neurons or HEK cells were recorded in whole-cell configuration as described (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J.

Intracellular solution of recording pipette contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 2 Mg2ATP, 2 GTP, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA (pH 7.2). Cells were continuously superfused (2 ml/min rate) with physiological solution containing (in mm): 152 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Responses to selective P2X3 receptor agonist α,Β-methylene-ATP (α,Β-meATP, resistant to ectoATPase hydrolysis, Sigma) were measured in terms of peak amplitude. To express agonist potency in terms of concentration producing 50% of the maximum response (EC50 values), dose-response curves for α,Β-meATP were constructed by applying different agonist doses to the same cells and fitting them with a logistic equation (Origin 6.0, Microcal, Northampton, MA). The onset of desensitization was estimated by calculating the first time constant of current decay (τfast) in the presence of agonist in accordance with our previous reports. Recovery from desensitization was assessed by paired-pulse experiments (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J.

To perform the sequence alignment, 346–397 amino acid residues of C-terminal portion of the rat P2X3 receptor (CAA62594) were aligned with the C-terminal amino acid residues 478–533 of Src (Q9JJ10) involved in Csk/Src interaction. To this aim, we used ClustalW and T-COFFEE algorithms (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar, 17Lesk A.M. Introduction to Bioinformatics. Oxford, NY2002: 160-215Google Scholar). After this step, computational homology modeling, in silico P2X3-Csk docking and alanine scanning were performed to identify candidate residues suitable for mutagenesis within the putative Csk-docking site of the P2X3 domain. Details are provided as supplemental information. Accordingly to computational predictions, we mutated potential residues (Gln-380 and Glu-384) in P2X3 sequence that might destabilize Csk-P2X3 C-terminal complex and we explored the consequences using Csk in vitro kinase assays. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of experiments in molecular biology/immunocytochemistry or the number of investigated cells in electrophysiology. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test or the ANOVA test, as appropriate. A p value of ≤0.05 was accepted as indicative of a statistically significant difference. The tyrosine kinase Src is negatively controlled by the C-terminal Src kinase, Csk, via its docking to the Src C-terminal residues 504–518 (Fig. 1; 11Levinson N.M. Seeliger M.A. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2008; 134: 124-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure. 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). By exploring the C-terminal region of the P2X3 receptor, we could identify a sequence homologous to the C-terminal portion of Src specifically binding Csk (40% homology, 33.3% identical residues and 6.7% strongly similar residues, Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). In particular, the P2X3 C-terminal Tyr-393 residue, a residue specific for the P2X3 subtype and is not conserved in the other P2X family members, appeared fully aligned with the target of Csk, Src Y527. Furthermore computational modeling (19Mager P.P. Weber A. Illes P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1657-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) suggested also similar accessibility of these residues to the solvent, rendering them suitable targets to a similar kinase. These observations prompted us to examine if P2X3 Tyr-393 was a target for Csk activity. Hence, we performed a cell-free in vitro kinase assay plus a Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies. Using recombinant Csk and GST-P2X3 C-terminal domain purified from E. coli, we observed P2X3 tyrosine phosphorylation (n = 5; Fig. 2A, lane 1). This signal was not detectable when the same assay was run in the presence of a P2X3 antibody recognizing the P2X3 peptide 383–397 (n = 3, Fig. 2B, lane 2) or when GST-P2X3Y393F mutant was tested as substrate (n = 5, Fig. 2B, lane 3), demonstrating thus that P2X3 Tyr-393 was a target for Csk phosphorylation in vitro. Furthermore, following our computational modeling data, we performed mutagenesis of the specific P2X3 residues Q380A and E384A within the P2X3 region compatible with putative Csk docking (residues 371–386, see Fig. 1). This approach should help to explore Csk docking to the P2X3 subunits as suggested by the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). These experiments demonstrated a significantly reduced phosphorylation of mutants Q380A and E384A (50.2 ± 6.6%; and 51 ± 8.1% respectively, taken 100% wt signal, n = 3, Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3) in comparison with wt (lane 1), thus, supporting the existence of a Csk docking site on the P2X3 receptor C-terminal domain. Co-expression of full-length P2X3 receptors together with Csk in HEK cells was therefore carried out to investigate functional consequences of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Csk and P2X3 co-transfection led to robust co-expression of both proteins (Fig. 2D, lane 2) with a significant increase in P2X3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2D, lane 2; n = 5). In accordance with the notion that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Csk is essential to enable this kinase activity (20Abrahamsen H. Vang T. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we observed that, in HEK cells, the PKA inhibitor H89 (10 μm; 30 min) prevented P2X3 tyrosine phosphorylation (10 μm; 30 min; Fig. 2D, lane 3, n = 4). It is noteworthy that basal adenylyl cyclase in these cells was sufficient to trigger activation of endogenous Csk, since H89 suppressed basal P2X3 tyrosine phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S2A). In basal condition, a small portion of Csk and P2X3 receptor interacted at cellular level, as observed by weak P2X3/Csk co-immunoprecipitation in HEK cells (Fig. 2E, lane 3). However, the co-immunoprecipitation signal was strongly detected when using the Y393F mutant (Fig. 2E, lane 2) despite the lack of phosphorylation (see Fig. 2A, lane 2). These data suggested that Csk and P2X3 receptors are part of a complex; however, highly dependent by phosphorylation state and conformation. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments on HEK cells co-transfected with Csk and P2X3 indicated that P2X3 receptor-mediated currents evoked by the selective agonist α,Β-meATP (≥10 μm) were significantly (p = 0.02 for 100 μm, p = 0.05 for 10 μm) smaller than those recorded from cells expressing the P2X3 alone (Fig. 2G; n = 10), although this effect was not associated with a significant variation in membrane receptor expression (n = 3, p > 0.05; Fig. 2F). Such smaller receptor responses were not accompanied by changes in the agonist EC50 value (indicative of drug receptor affinity, Table 1), in the Hill coefficient (indicative of the stoichiometry of drug receptor interaction, Table 1) or in the time constant of current decay (indicative of desensitization onset, 101 ± 8 ms for control versus 126 ± 10 ms for P2X3/Csk co-expression; n = 17 and 13, respectively). Likewise, no significant changes were observed in terms of P2X3 current recovery from desensitization (tested with a double agonist pulse application, 4) in the presence (58 ± 5% of the previous response; n = 8) or in the absence of Csk (60 ± 4% of the previous response, n = 18).TABLE 1Characteristics of P2X3 receptors and its Tyr-393 mutantsReceptorEC50Hill coefficientNaN indicates the number of neurons tested for these analyses.μmP2X3 wt2.05 ± 0.471.06 ± 0.1110Wt/Csk1.74 ± 0.511.05 ± 0.1310Y393A1 ± 0.211.24 ± 0.1613Y393F1.56 ± 0.660.89 ± 0.166Y393A/Csk1.02 ± 0.251.23 ± 0.1412Wt siRNA mock2.44 ± 0.921.10 ± 0.426Wt siRNA Csk1.67 ± 0.341.21 ± 0.4210a N indicates the number of neurons tested for these analyses. Open table in a new tab Globally, our results suggest that Csk phosphorylated P2X3 receptors in cells and in vitro that was associated with decreased receptor function, when tested with high agonist concentrations, without concomitant alteration in receptor kinetic properties. Because Tyr-393 appeared to be the Csk target in the in vitro assays, we mutated this residue to explore its functional consequences with patch clamp recording from transfected HEK cells. Despite similar expression observed with immunofluorescence microscopy and membrane biotinylation assay (Fig. 3, A and B), the current amplitude evoked by α,Β-meATP (100 μm) was larger in the P2X3 Y393A and Y393F mutants than in wt receptors (see examples and average data in Fig. 3C). The agonist dose response curves for P2X3 mutants displayed enhanced maximal effect, even though similar EC50 values suggested analogous agonist affinity (Table 1). Co-expression of the P2X3 mutants with Csk did not showed significant changes either in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (n = 3, Fig. 3D) or current amplitude (Fig. 3E, n = 13). These data suggest that Tyr-393 was important to exploit the Csk modulation of P2X3 receptor functional response in an in vitro expression system. To understand the physiological implications of the interaction between Csk and P2X3 receptors, we studied mouse trigeminal sensory neurons that constitutively express P2X3 receptors potently modulated by NGF: indeed, NGF neutralization decreases trigeminal pain in vivo and P2X3 receptor currents in neuronal cultures (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8190-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It seemed, therefore, interesting to investigate the potential contribution by Csk signaling to the action of NGF. On trigeminal sensory neurons cultured in the presence of anti-NGF antibodies (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8190-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), membrane expression of Csk was significantly enhanced by NGF neutralization (Fig. 4A) together with a stronger Csk activity as demonstrated by concomitant Src inhibition (see anti-phospho-Src527 antibody and Fig. 4A). To further validate Csk activation we examined, as a reliable index of this process, Csk translocation to the neuronal membrane (21Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy showed, after NGF neutralization, redistribution of Csk to membrane (Fig. 4B). Quantification of microscopy experiments showed a significantly larger number of P2X3 receptor expressing neurons with a ring-like distribution of Csk (Fig. 4B, p = 0.009). Conversely, rapid disappearance of membrane-bound Csk was induced when exogenous NGF (100 ng/ml for 5 or 15 min) was applied to anti-NGF antibody-treated mouse trigeminal neurons (p = 0.02 n = 3, Fig. 4C), indicating a close relation between extracellular NGF levels and Csk location at the membrane level. Following neutralization of extracellular endogenous NGF with anti-NGF antibodies (24 h, 4), mouse trigeminal neurons showed a large increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of their P2X3 receptors (p = 0.03, Fig. 4D). The effects of NGF deprivation on P2X3 phosphorylation in culture were even more evident following tyrosine phosphatase inhibition with pervanadate (250 μm; 25 min; 0.79 ± 0.1 AU in control versus 2.24 ± 0.58 AU after pervanadate; n = 3; p < 0.001), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation rather than dephosphorylation was an important mechanism for the action by Csk on P2X3 receptors. On mouse trigeminal neurons, application of H89 (10 μm; 30 min) induced a slight increase of the constitutive N-terminal threonine phosphorylation of P2X3 receptors (0.24 ± 0.02 absolute gray levels for control and 0.26 ± 0.003 after H89 treatment, n = 3; supplemental Fig. S2B) previously described as attributed PKC activity (4D’Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M. Fabbro A. Nair A. Nistri A. Fabbretti E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8190-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results cannot exclude that, on trigeminal neurons, PKC or PKA should exert, at least partially, distinct and contrasting effects of the threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation state of P2X3 receptors. We tested the hypothesis that endogenous Csk exerts a constitutive control over P2X3 receptor function. Because transgenic mice lacking Csk are not vital (22Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we examined our hypothesis by silencing Csk in HEK cells as well as in mouse trigeminal neurons (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence and Western blotting demonstrated efficient silencing of Csk in HEK and in trigeminal ganglion cultures (n = 3, Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S2B). Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that, in P2X3-expressing-HEK cells, there was no increase in P2X3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation after silencing endogenous Csk (Fig. 5B), together with a significant rise in the maximal amplitude of the α,Β-meATP-evoked current with respect to responses measured from mock silenced cells (p = 0.04 for 10 μm and p = 0.02 for 100 μm α,Β-meATP, Fig. 5C). To explore any potential activity of residual Csk left after silencing in HEK cells, we decided to maximize the cAMP/PKA-mediated stimulation of endogenous residual Csk with forskolin application (10 μm, 5 min; known to be a strong Csk activator; Ref. 23Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Taskén K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) to either mock or siRNA-transfected HEK cells. Under these conditions, no significant change in P2X3 receptor phosphorylation or receptor current was found (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting efficient silencing of endogenous Csk. We next tested the consequences of Csk silencing on the responses of P2X3 receptors of trigeminal neurons (Fig. 5D). Under these conditions, controlled experiments run in parallel with neurons treated with siRNA Csk or control non-targeting siRNA showed that the current amplitude evoked by 10 μm α,Β-meATP was significantly larger after Csk silencing (n = 29 in control and n = 24 cells for Csk siRNA; p = 0.04; Fig. 5D). These data indicate that endogenous Csk was essential to curtail constitutive, functional overactivation of P2X3 receptors in an expression system and in trigeminal neurons. The principal finding of the present study is the demonstration that the kinase Csk exerted a powerful inhibitory control on the function of P2X3 receptors via phosphorylation of the P2X3 Tyr-393 residue. These data shed light on a new mechanism that controls the efficiency of signaling by pain-sensing P2X3 receptors. It is tempting to sp"
https://openalex.org/W2090566935,"In a previous investigation, we demonstrated that after CD95/Fas triggering, raft-associated GD3 ganglioside, normally localized at the plasma membrane of T cells, can be detected in mitochondria, where they contribute to apoptogenic events. Here, we show the association of the glycosphingolipid GD3 with microtubular cytoskeleton at very early time points following Fas ligation. This was assessed by different methodological approaches, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer, immunoelectron microscopy, and coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, docking analysis also showed that GD3 has a high affinity for the pore formed by 4 tubulin heterodimers (type I pore), thus suggesting a possible direct interaction between tubulin and GD3. Finally, time-course analyses indicated that the relocalization of GD3 to the mitochondria was time related with the alterations of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Hence, microtubules could act as tracks for ganglioside redistribution following apoptotic stimulation, possibly contributing to the mitochondrial alterations leading to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1967825024,"Background Theta rhythm in the hippocampal formation is a main feature of exploratory behaviour and is believed to enable the encoding of new spatial information and the modification of synaptic weights. Cyclic changes of dentate gyrus excitability during theta rhythm are related to its function, but whether theta epochs per se are able to alter network properties of dentate gyrus for long time-periods is still poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We used low-frequency stimulation protocols that amplify the power of endogenous theta oscillations, in order to estimate the plasticity effect of endogenous theta oscillations on a population level. We found that stimulation-induced augmentation of the theta rhythm is linked to a subsequent increase of neuronal excitability and decrease of the synaptic response. This EPSP-to-Spike uncoupling is related to an increased postsynaptic spiking on the positive phases of theta frequency oscillations. Parallel increase of the field EPSP slope and the population spike occurs only after concurrent pre- and postsynaptic activation. Furthermore, we observed that long-term potentiation (>24 h) occurs in the dentate gyrus of freely behaving adult rats after phasic activity of entorhinal afferents in the theta-frequency range. This plasticity is proportional to the field bursting activity of granule cells during the stimulation, and may comprise a key step in spatial information transfer. Long-term potentiation of the synaptic component occurs only when the afferent stimulus precedes the evoked population burst, and is input-specific. Conclusions/Significance Our data confirm the role of the dentate gyrus in filtering information to the subsequent network during the activated state of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1974588099,"Whole genome sequence analysis of prokaryotes is fundamentally important in understanding human infections, development of diagnostics and vaccines, biodefense studies, antimicrobial target identification and drug design. Rapid advances in sequencing technology have provided the capability to quickly and cheaply produce several hundreds of prokaryotic genomes each year.

The next generation sequencing platforms (454 from Roche, Solexa of Illumina, and SoLiD from ABI) hold promise to further reduce time and cost of whole genome sequencing. Multiple species of bacteria and hundreds of strains thereof are being sequenced every year, thanks to cutting edge approaches such as re-sequencing wherein genome sequence of a reference organism is used as a scaffold to direct analysis of several different strains [1]. Using this method, multiple whole-genome bacterial sequencing projects can now be completed in less than two weeks instead of months. The total number of completed genomes (including reference and strain re-sequencing projects) is consistently doubling every 16 months [2] by adding about 20 new genomes every month [3]. By the end of March 2009, a total of 1775 prokaryotic genome sequences and draft assemblies were available in the NCBI genome database. At this pace of sequencing output, study of a single bacterial genome has become almost pedestrian while the comparisons of multiple strains of a single species is within the relatively easy reach.

Comparison of genomic sequences has revealed mechanism of changes in bacterial lifestyles. We have learned how species have evolved strategies to survive and compete as part of adaptation to their preferred hosts, habitats or niches. Genomic comparison of multiple species and strains has facilitated insights into adaptive mechanisms leading to host or tissue tropism. Such inferences however need to be tested functionally and thus the need for integration of genome data with cues obtainable from downstream ‘omic’ experiments that have sampled a variety of conditions or treatments. New informatic approaches are emerging which are capable of integrating genomic and functional datasets and also making use of data available through published resources. The emergence of e-Science, Semantic Web, and Science 2.0 approaches hold a lot of promise for holistic data integration and meaningful interpretation of community genomics and microarray experiments in an interactive and collaborative fashion. The present overview discusses some of these issues and ideas in relation to the ‘PLoS ONE prokaryotic genomes collection’."
https://openalex.org/W2071499433,"Toxin production in Clostridium perfringens is controlled by the VirSR two-component signal transduction system, which comprises the VirS sensor histidine kinase and the VirR response regulator. Other studies have concentrated on the elucidation of the genes controlled by this network; there is little information regarding the phosphorelay cascade that is the hallmark of such regulatory systems. In this study, we have examined each step in this cascade, beginning with autophosphorylation of VirS, followed by phosphotransfer from VirS to VirR. We also have studied the effects of gene dosage and phosphorylation in vivo. We have used random and site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues in VirS that are important for its function and have identified a region in the putative sensory domain of VirS that appeared to be essential for function. In vitro phosphorylation studies showed that VirSc, a truncated VirS protein that lacked the N-terminal sensory domain, was capable of autophosphorylation and could subsequently act as a phosphodonor for its cognate response regulator, VirR. Conserved residues of both VirS and VirR, including the D57 residue of VirR, were shown to be essential for this process. By use of Targetron technology, we were able to introduce a single copy of virR or virRD57N onto the chromosome of a virR mutant of C. perfringens. The results showed that in vivo, when virR was present in single copy, the production of wild-type levels of perfringolysin O was dependent on the presence of virS and an unaltered D57 residue in VirR. These results provide good evidence that phosphorylation is critical for VirR function."
https://openalex.org/W2022789167,"Borrelia garinii, a causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in Europe and Asia, is naturally maintained in marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles, which primarily involve birds, including seabirds and migratory passerines. These bird groups associate with, correspondingly, Ixodes uriae and Ixodes ricinus ticks, of which the latter species may bite and transmit the infection to humans. Studies of the overlap between these two natural cycles of B. garinii have been limited, in part due to the absence of representative collections of this spirochete's samples, as well as of the lack of reliable measure of the genetic heterogeneity of its strains. As a prerequisite for understanding the epidemiological correlates of the complex maintenance of B. garinii, the present study sought to assess the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of this species' strains from its natural hosts and patients with Lyme borreliosis from subarctic Eurasia. We used sequence typing of the partial rrs-rrl intergenic spacer (IGS) of archived and prospective samples of B. garinii from I. uriae ticks collected predominantly on Commander Islands in North Pacific, as well as on the islands in northern Sweden and arctic Norway. We also typed B. garinii samples from patients with Lyme borreliosis and I. ricinus ticks infesting migratory birds in southern Sweden, or found questing in selected sites on the islands in the Baltic Sea and Lithuania. Fifty-two (68%) of 77 B. garinii samples representing wide geographical range and associated with I. ricinus and infection of humans contributed 12 (60%) of total 20 identified IGS variants. In contrast, the remaining 25 (32%) samples recovered from I. uriae ticks from a few islands accounted for as many as 10 (50%) IGS types, suggesting greater local diversity of B. garinii maintained by seabirds and their ticks. Two IGS variants of the spirochete in common for both tick species were found in I. ricinus larvae from migratory birds, an indication that B. garinii strains are exchanged between different ecological niches. Notably, B. garinii variants associated with I. uriae ticks were found in each of the six clusters, representing two phylogenetic lineages of this species identified among the studied samples. Our findings suggest that B. garinii in subarctic Eurasia comprises two partially overlapping populations with different levels of genetic heterogeneity, presumably, due to distinctive selective pressures on the spirochete in its marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles."

Thus, BRCA1 interaction of Nlp might be required for the successful mitotic progression, and abnormalities of Nlp lead to genomic instability. The successful mitosis requires the assembly of a strictly bipolar mitotic apparatus that will ensure that chromosomes equally distribute to the daughter cells. This process is controlled by the centrosomes that are required for spindle formation and function (1Doxsey S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E105-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Abnormalities of centrosome have been demonstrated to cause chromosomal missegregation and generation of aneuploidy, consequently leading to cell malignant transformation and tumorigenesis (2Salisbury J.L.

Most recently, BRCA1 was reported to be required for mitotic spindle assembly through its interaction with three spindle pole proteins, TPX2, NuMA, nuclear mitotic apparatus protein; and XRHAMM, Xenopus homolog to human RHAXX (35Joukov V.

These findings strongly suggest that BRCA1 is involved in the mitotic machinery. However, the importance of BRCA1 in the control of mitotic progression still remains to be further defined.In this report, we demonstrate that BRCA1 physically interacts and colocalizes with Nlp. Nlp centrosomal localization and its protein stability are likely dependent on normal cellular BRCA1 function. Suppression of Nlp using the siRNA approach disturbs the process of chromosomal segregation and results in aberrant spindle formation, failure of chromosomal segregation, and aneuploidy.DISCUSSIONThe physiological importance of BRCA1 is greatly determined by its interactions with many important cellular proteins (21Scully R.

It is thought that BRCA1 may serve as a platform for some important cellular proteins to interact, and therefore, that it plays its controlling roles over cellular functions. In the current study, a series of direct biochemical data strongly demonstrate that Nlp is a BRCA1-interacting protein and that its C terminus is required for Nlp interaction with BRCA1 (Fig. 1), which suggests that the interaction between Nlp and BRCA1 might bridge the roles of BRCA1 in the control of mitotic progression. Strikingly, the findings in this report indicate that BRCA1 is likely required for Nlp centrosomal localization. In addition to the observations that normal Nlp centrosomal localization correlates to functional BRCA1 status, disruption of endogenous BRCA1 using the siRNA approach or deletion of the BRCA1-binding region of Nlp abrogate the property of Nlp localizing to the centrosome (Fig. 2). However, BRCA1 is also able to participate in the mitotic machinery through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. BRCA1 forms complexes with spindle pole proteins including TPX2, NuMA, and XRHAMM and specifically attenuates XRHAMM function, thereby ensuring the normal concentration of TPX2 on spindle poles and proper spindle pole assembly. However, this function of BRCA1 is independent of centrosome (35Joukov V. Groen A.C. Prokhorova T. Gerson R. White E. Rodriguez A. Walter J.C. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that Nlp stability might be associated with its centrosomal localization. When it departs from the centrosome, Nlp would undergo protein degradation (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the BRCA1 regulation of Nlp centrosome localization would be important for the maintenance of Nlp stability. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that Nlp expression is dependent on normal cellular BRCA1 function. In cells with abnormal BRCA1 status, Nlp expression displays extremely low or undetectable levels. Suppression of endogenous BRCA1 via the siRNA approach or disruption of Nlp association with BRCA1 using C-terminal fragment results in enhanced degradation of Nlp (Fig. 3).We have recently shown that Nlp is a fast turnover protein and expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Its degradation is regulated by APC/c (37Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is thus speculated that disruption of the interaction between BRCA1 and Nlp might cause abnormal or unphysiological displacement of Nlp from the centrosome, and in turn, leads to fast degradation of Nlp by APC-mediated ubiquitination. Taken together, BRCA1 interaction of Nlp is critical for the maintenance of Nlp centrosome localization and protein stability. Because the Nlp centrosomal localization is important for centrosome maturation and spindle formation, Nlp interaction with BRCA1 appears to be a vital event in the regulation of mitotic progression.Our findings are consistent with the idea that BRCA1 is a key molecule involved in the control of mitotic events. Despite its association with γ-tubulin (29Hsu L.C. Doan T.P. White R.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7713-7718PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sankaran S. Starita L.M. Groen A.C. Ko M.J. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8656-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Starita L.M. Machida Y. Sankaran S. Elias J.E. Griffin K. Schlegel B.P. Gygi S.P. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8457-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and spindle pole proteins including TPX2, NuMA, and XRHAMM (35Joukov V. Groen A.C. Prokhorova T. Gerson R. White E. Rodriguez A. Walter J.C. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the BRCA1 interaction with Nlp is of great importance. Given the facts that Nlp centrosome localization and stability are controlled by both BRCA1 and Plk1 (Fig. 2), the dynamic interactions among BRCA1, Plk1, and Nlp are critical for mitotic machinery. This can be emphasized by the following facts. First of all, Nlp is important for spindle formation (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis (Fig. 5). Its is likely that the fine levels of Nlp appear to be required for its physiological function because suppression of Nlp causes aberrant mitotic spindle structure and leads to failures of chromosomal segregation (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Secondly, BRCA1 interaction of Nlp regulates Nlp centrosomal localization and Nlp stability. Disruption of BRCA1 abrogates Nlp localization at the centrosome (Fig. 2) and promotes Nlp degradation (Fig. 3). Thirdly, Plk1 phosphorylation of Nlp causes Nlp displacement from the centrosome, and in turn, regulates Nlp protein stability (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, the data presented in this study and by others (12Blagden S.P. Glover D.M. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggest that BRCA1 can serves as a negative regulator for Plk1 expression (Fig. 3).Thus, it can be reasonably interpreted (Fig. 6) that in mammalian cells, BRCA1 and Plk1 might work together to build up a delicate machinery to maintain a fine level of Nlp protein and precisely regulate Nlp dynamics of centrosomal localization to ensure successful spindle formation and chromosomal segregation. During the normal cell cycle progression, BRCA1 functions in balancing Plk1 activity and enabling Nlp to play a role in mitotic machinery. However, loss of BRCA1 may result in unbalanced and overpowered Plk1 activity, which causes “abnormal Nlp displacement” from the centrosome and Nlp degradation, and in turn, abrogates spindle formation and chromosomal segregation. This is in line with the observations that disruption of endogenous Nlp exhibited similar phenotypes (such as chromosomal abnormalities) to that seen with abrogated BRCA1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the proper “switch on/off” of Nlp centrosomal localization is apparently vital machinery in the process of mitotic progression and mainly controlled by BRCA1 and Plk1. Abnormalities of this machinery via either loss of BRCA1 or amplified Plk1 activity will lead to aberrant mitotic spindle and chromosomal instability, and subsequently, result in tumorigenesis.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts with Nlp. Several lines of evidence in our study indicate that Nlp interaction with BRCA1 is required for the maintenance of Nlp centrosomal localization and protein stability and is essential for mitotic progression. Therefore, these findings provide a novel link that connects BRCA1 with mitotic machinery, further supporting the notion that BRCA1 is an important regulator of cell cycle progression. The successful mitosis requires the assembly of a strictly bipolar mitotic apparatus that will ensure that chromosomes equally distribute to the daughter cells. This process is controlled by the centrosomes that are required for spindle formation and function (1Doxsey S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E105-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Abnormalities of centrosome have been demonstrated to cause chromosomal missegregation and generation of aneuploidy, consequently leading to cell malignant transformation and tumorigenesis (2Salisbury J.L. Whitehead C.M. Lingle W.L. Barrett S.L. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Marx J. Science. 2001; 292: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The machinery that controls centrosome stability involves multiple important cellular proteins, including p53 (4Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. Vande Woude G.F.

The precise coordination among those regulators maintains centrosome duplication and stability. Prior to mitosis, centrosomes undergo maturation (10Rieder C.L. Faruki S. Khodjakov A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which is characterized by centrosome enlargement, recruitment of γ-tubulin, and an increased microtubule nucleation activity (11Khodjakov A.

Centrosome maturation is regulated by several mitotic kinases (13Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Hagan I.M. Nigg E.A. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2357-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) (14Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), Aurora-A (15Goepfert T.M. Brinkley B.R. Curr. Top. Dev.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Recently, a Plk1-regulated ninein-like protein, termed Nlp, has been characterized as an important molecule involved in centrosome maturation (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Nlp interacts with γ-tubulin ring complex and stimulates microtubule nucleation in the interphase. Upon the G2/M transition, Nlp is subjected to phosphorylation by Plk1 and Nek2 (17Casenghi M.

BRCA1 forms complexes with spindle pole proteins including TPX2, NuMA, and XRHAMM and specifically attenuates XRHAMM function, thereby ensuring the normal concentration of TPX2 on spindle poles and proper spindle pole assembly. However, this function of BRCA1 is independent of centrosome (35Joukov V. Groen A.C. Prokhorova T. Gerson R. White E. Rodriguez A. Walter J.C. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that Nlp stability might be associated with its centrosomal localization. When it departs from the centrosome, Nlp would undergo protein degradation (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the BRCA1 regulation of Nlp centrosome localization would be important for the maintenance of Nlp stability. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that Nlp expression is dependent on normal cellular BRCA1 function. In cells with abnormal BRCA1 status, Nlp expression displays extremely low or undetectable levels. Suppression of endogenous BRCA1 via the siRNA approach or disruption of Nlp association with BRCA1 using C-terminal fragment results in enhanced degradation of Nlp (Fig. 3).We have recently shown that Nlp is a fast turnover protein and expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Its degradation is regulated by APC/c (37Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is thus speculated that disruption of the interaction between BRCA1 and Nlp might cause abnormal or unphysiological displacement of Nlp from the centrosome, and in turn, leads to fast degradation of Nlp by APC-mediated ubiquitination. Taken together, BRCA1 interaction of Nlp is critical for the maintenance of Nlp centrosome localization and protein stability. Because the Nlp centrosomal localization is important for centrosome maturation and spindle formation, Nlp interaction with BRCA1 appears to be a vital event in the regulation of mitotic progression.Our findings are consistent with the idea that BRCA1 is a key molecule involved in the control of mitotic events. Despite its association with γ-tubulin (29Hsu L.C. Doan T.P. White R.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7713-7718PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sankaran S. Starita L.M. Groen A.C. Ko M.J. Parvin J.D. Mol. Cell.

Walter J.C. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the BRCA1 interaction with Nlp is of great importance. Given the facts that Nlp centrosome localization and stability are controlled by both BRCA1 and Plk1 (Fig. 2), the dynamic interactions among BRCA1, Plk1, and Nlp are critical for mitotic machinery. This can be emphasized by the following facts. First of all, Nlp is important for spindle formation (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis (Fig. 5). Its is likely that the fine levels of Nlp appear to be required for its physiological function because suppression of Nlp causes aberrant mitotic spindle structure and leads to failures of chromosomal segregation (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Secondly, BRCA1 interaction of Nlp regulates Nlp centrosomal localization and Nlp stability. Disruption of BRCA1 abrogates Nlp localization at the centrosome (Fig. 2) and promotes Nlp degradation (Fig. 3). Thirdly, Plk1 phosphorylation of Nlp causes Nlp displacement from the centrosome, and in turn, regulates Nlp protein stability (17Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, the data presented in this study and by others (12Blagden S.P. Glover D.M. Nat Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) suggest that BRCA1 can serves as a negative regulator for Plk1 expression (Fig. 3).Thus, it can be reasonably interpreted (Fig. 6) that in mammalian cells, BRCA1 and Plk1 might work together to build up a delicate machinery to maintain a fine level of Nlp protein and precisely regulate Nlp dynamics of centrosomal localization to ensure successful spindle formation and chromosomal segregation. During the normal cell cycle progression, BRCA1 functions in balancing Plk1 activity and enabling Nlp to play a role in mitotic machinery. However, loss of BRCA1 may result in unbalanced and overpowered Plk1 activity, which causes “abnormal Nlp displacement” from the centrosome and Nlp degradation, and in turn, abrogates spindle formation and chromosomal segregation. This is in line with the observations that disruption of endogenous Nlp exhibited similar phenotypes (such as chromosomal abnormalities) to that seen with abrogated BRCA1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the proper “switch on/off” of Nlp centrosomal localization is apparently vital machinery in the process of mitotic progression and mainly controlled by BRCA1 and Plk1. Abnormalities of this machinery via either loss of BRCA1 or amplified Plk1 activity will lead to aberrant mitotic spindle and chromosomal instability, and subsequently, result in tumorigenesis.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts with Nlp. Several lines of evidence in our study indicate that Nlp interaction with BRCA1 is required for the maintenance of Nlp centrosomal localization and protein stability and is essential for mitotic progression. Therefore, these findings provide a novel link that connects BRCA1 with mitotic machinery, further supporting the notion that BRCA1 is an important regulator of cell cycle progression. The physiological importance of BRCA1 is greatly determined by its interactions with many important cellular proteins (21Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T.

It is thought that BRCA1 may serve as a platform for some important cellular proteins to interact, and therefore, that it plays its controlling roles over cellular functions. In the current study, a series of direct biochemical data strongly demonstrate that Nlp is a BRCA1-interacting protein and that its C terminus is required for Nlp interaction with BRCA1 (Fig. 1), which suggests that the interaction between Nlp and BRCA1 might bridge the roles of BRCA1 in the control of mitotic progression. Strikingly, the findings in this report indicate that BRCA1 is likely required for Nlp centrosomal localization. In addition to the observations that normal Nlp centrosomal localization correlates to functional BRCA1 status, disruption of endogenous BRCA1 using the siRNA approach or deletion of the BRCA1-binding region of Nlp abrogate the property of Nlp localizing to the centrosome (Fig. 2).

These structures reveal a unique kinase fold and a novel nucleotide-binding mode that are conserved among members of the GHMP kinase family. Members also contain three common sequence motifs consisting of about 10–15 contiguous amino acids (9Hartley A. Glynn S.E. Barynin V. Baker P.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Verhees C. de Geus D. van der Oost J.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Motif I is at the N-terminal region, and its function is uncertain. Motif II is the most conserved with a typical sequence of Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala. This region is involved in nucleotide binding and distinguishes the GHMP family from other protein kinase families. Motif III is near the C terminus and contains a small glycine-rich loop that appears well positioned to interact with substrate that is phosphorylated by ATP (24Andreassi 2nd, J.L. Leyh T.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14594-14601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, there are highly divergent sequences outside these three motifs, and modes of oligomerization, substrate binding, and catalytic mechanism vary among different GHMP family members (14Krishna S.S.

Based on structural and biochemical data, members of the GHMP family are subdivided into two groups depending on their catalytic mechanisms. In the first group, which includes rat mevalonate kinase, the crystal structure shows an aspartate residue in the active site positioned to act as a catalytic base that abstracts a proton from the substrate hydroxyl group. In addition, there is a lysine residue that is thought to reduce the pKa of the substrate hydroxyl group and to stabilize the pentacoordinated γ-phosphoryl group of ATP (18Fu Z. Wang M. Potter D. Miziorko H.M. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18134-18142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the second group, such as Escherichia coli homoserine kinase, there appears to be no suitable residue positioned to act as a catalytic base. Consequently it has been hypothesized that homoserine kinase achieves catalysis through transition state stabilization alone (14Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the catalytic mechanism of PduX by a series of kinetic studies and mutational analyses of 10 invariant serine/threonine and aspartate/glutamate residues. Results indicate a steady-state Ordered Bi Bi mechanism in which ATP binds first. We also identified several amino acids critical to substrate binding and catalysis.

For removal of the N-terminal His8 tag and purification of the non-tagged PduX protein, we used TAGZyme DAPase Enzyme (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. This procedure produced native PduX lacking the N-terminal methionine. The activity of PduX was measured by using an ADP Quest assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (DiscoverRx, Fremont, CA) as described previously (6Fan C. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11322-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To minimize background fluorescence, 96-well black microplates were used (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). For kinetic studies, the concentrations of certain assay components were varied as indicated in the text. The data addressing the kinetic mechanism were analyzed by double reciprocal plots. Km and Vmax values for PduX variants were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting using the program GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd.). Mutations were introduced into the His8-PduX-pTA925 (6Fan C. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11322-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) construct using the QuikChange II-E Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly PCR was used to amplify the entire plasmid from two complementary primers that both contained the desired mutation. The template plasmid was then digested with DpnI and transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue. Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants, and the plasmids were purified. Clones with the expected DNA sequence were used for further study. All mutant PduX proteins were produced and purified by the same method as used for the wild type. CD spectra of the mutants used in this study were collected using a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter (cell length = 1 cm). The samples contained enzyme (4.0 μm) and K2HPO4 (10 mm). CD data were collected from 190 to 250 nm with a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, resolution of 0.2 nm, bandwidth of 1.0 nm, sensitivity of 20 millidegrees, and response of 8 s at room temperature. CD data were analyzed by the program JFIT. Protein unfolding by urea was measured by steady-state fluorescence with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 320 nm. Protein samples having an absorbance of 0.05 at 295 nm were used for the unfolding studies. Aliquots of 10 m urea were added to the samples. After correction for dilution of the sample, the fluorescence data were fitted with the following equations assuming the linear dependence of ΔGUN0(d) on denaturant concentration (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Kautz R.A. Fox R.O. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): F(d) = [1 − fU(d)][FN,0 − SN[d]] + fU(d)[FU,0 − SU[d]] where fU(d) = exp(−ΔGUN0(d)/RT)/[1 + exp(−ΔGUN0(d)/RT)] and ΔGUN0(d) = ΔGUN0 − m[d]. ΔGUN0 is the unfolding free energy. m is an index of responsiveness of the protein to unfolding by the denaturant. SN and SU are the slopes of the fluorescence intensity versus [d] for the native and unfolded states, respectively. FN,0 and FU,0 are the fluorescence intensities of the native and unfolded states, respectively, in the absence of denaturant. fu is the percent unfolded protein. A nonlinear least squares approach was used to obtain ΔGUN0. The minimal medium used was no-carbon E medium (27Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD), 1 mm MgSO4, 50 μm ferric citrate, 1 μm 5,6-dimethylbenzimidizole, and 3 mm each valine, isoleucine, leucine, and threonine. To prepare the inocula, 2-ml cultures were made using Luria-Bertani medium. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in growth curve medium. Media were inoculated to a density of 0.15 absorbance units, and the cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a BioTek Synergy microplate reader and 48-well flat bottom plates (Falcon) as described previously (28Liu Y. Leal N.A. Sampson E.M. Johnson C.L. Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by Iowa State University (DNA facility of Iowa State University Office of Biotechnology) using automated sequencing equipment from Applied Biosystems Inc. For a bisubstrate reaction, there are two classes of kinetic mechanisms: one involves a ternary complex of both substrates and the enzyme, and the other is the “ping-pong” mechanism (29Taylor K.B. Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 66-121Google Scholar). In the ping-pong model, one substrate binds to the enzyme, and then a chemical change occurs such as covalent modification of the enzyme. Next the first product is released, and the second substrate binds, often receiving the chemical group from the enzyme. A diagnostic feature of this mechanism is that when the concentration of one substrate is fixed and the other is varied double reciprocal plots of rate versus concentration of the variable substrate will be parallel for different fixed substrate concentrations (29Taylor K.B. Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 66-121Google Scholar, 30Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 117-208Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of His8-PduX showed that such lines were not parallel but converged, arguing against the ping-pong mechanism (Fig. 2). The data in Fig. 2 also exclude the rapid equilibrium Ordered Bi Bi mechanism because in this case lines would intersect at the y axis for plots of 1/v versus 1/B (l-Thr) at fixed various fixed concentrations of the first substrate to bind (31Fromm H.J. Initial Rate Enzyme Kinetics. 1st Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1975: 121-160Google Scholar). Hence the PduX reaction most likely proceeds via a ternary complex mechanism in which the enzyme binds to both substrates before a chemical reaction occurs. There are three possible ternary complex mechanisms, one random and two ordered. In a random mechanism, either of the substrates may bind first, and the binding of one may or may not influence the binding of the other. In an ordered mechanism, binding of the first substrate is a prerequisite for binding of the second substrate (30Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 117-208Google Scholar). A number of kinetic methods have been used over the past 50 years to distinguish between random and ordered kinetic mechanisms. These protocols include the use of isotope exchange (32Boyer P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), dead-end competitive inhibitors (33Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Fromm H.J. Zewe V. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and product inhibition experiments (35Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1777-1782Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Fromm H.J. Nelson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here the latter two methods were used to investigate the kinetic mechanism of PduX. AMP-PMP and l-Val were used as competitive dead-end inhibitors versus ATP and l-Thr, respectively. AMP-PNP was found to be a competitive inhibitor of ATP and a noncompetitive inhibitor of l-Thr (Fig. 3). On the other hand, l-Val was a competitive inhibitor of l-Thr and an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP (Fig. 4). These findings serve to eliminate the rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism as a pathway for substrate interaction in the PduX reaction. In the random mechanism, a competitive inhibitor for either substrate is a noncompetitive inhibitor for the other substrate. For the Ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism, a similar inhibition pattern is observed for a dead-end competitive inhibitor for the first substrate to bind. On the other hand, a competitive inhibitor for the second substrate to add to the enzyme will exhibit uncompetitive inhibition relative to the first substrate. The latter pattern is precisely the type of inhibition observed with the PduX l-Thr kinase as illustrated in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4. Thus, an ordered mechanism in which ATP binds first is indicated. The unique rate equation for the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism using a competitive inhibitor for substrate B is depicted in Equation 1. where v, Vm, Ka, Kb, Kia, Ki, A, B, and I represent initial velocity, maximal velocity, Michaelis constant for substrate A, Michaelis constant for substrate B, dissociation constant for substrate A, inhibition constant for the dead-end complex (enzyme-ATP-l-Val), substrate A, substrate B, and competitive inhibitor for substrate B, respectively.FIGURE 3Kinetic analysis of dead-end inhibition by the ATP analog AMP-PNP. A, AMP-PNP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of l-Thr in the PduX reaction. ATP concentration was held at 2 mm. B, AMP-PNP is a competitive inhibitor of ATP in the PduX reaction. l-Thr concentration was held at 5 mm. The reaction conditions were the same as those for the standard assay. The values and error bars shown are based on three replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Kinetic analysis of dead-end inhibition by the l-threonine analog l-valine.

B, l-Val is an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP in the PduX reaction. l-Thr concentration was held at 300 μm. The reaction conditions were the same as those for the standard assay. The values and error bars shown are based on three replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Information about the order of substrate binding (as well as the formation of abortive complexes) can also be obtained by product inhibition studies (29Taylor K.B. Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 66-121Google Scholar, 33Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Fromm H.J. Nelson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of l-Thr-P on the PduX reaction over a range of concentrations (Fig. 5). l-Thr phosphate was noncompetitive versus both ATP and l-Thr. If the reaction proceeded by a random mechanism, l-Thr-P would be a competitive inhibitor of both substrates. If a ping-pong mechanism was used, l-Thr-P would be a competitive inhibitor versus the first substrate to bind (ATP). Hence random ternary complex and ping-pong mechanisms are inconsistent with the observed pattern of product inhibition that supports an ordered mechanism. Competitive inhibition is also observed in an ordered mechanism between the final product released and the first substrate to bind because both interact with the same form of the enzyme (30Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 117-208Google Scholar). Because l-Thr-P was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both l-Thr and ATP as shown, we conclude that l-Thr-P is the first product released. This means that ADP must be the second product to be released, and symmetry suggests that ATP is the first substrate bound supporting the dead-end inhibitor studies described above. Slope and intercept replots of l-Thr-P inhibition were linear versus ATP and l-Thr indicating that abortive complexes were not significant under the assay conditions used (not shown). Thus, both dead-end inhibitor and product inhibition studies indicate that the PduX l-Thr kinase uses a steady-state Ordered Bi Bi mechanism (Fig. 6). The effects of the other product of the PduX reaction (ADP) as an inhibitor could not be assessed using the coupled enzyme assay system as ADP is a substrate for the coupling enzyme.FIGURE 6Kinetic mechanism of PduX l-Thr kinase. The kinetic mechanism of PduX is an ordered ternary complex mechanism with ATP binding first.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The choice of the appropriate amino acid targets for site-directed mutagenesis was based on sequence comparisons among related enzymes and previous mutation analysis on other members of GHMP family (37Potter D.

Highly conserved residues in all members of the GHMP family are likely to participate in the common steps of catalysis, whereas residues that are conserved within one family but are different in others are candidates for specific interactions with the substrates. The amino acid sequences of 18 PduX homologues, which are predicted to function in B12 synthesis based on their location in operons involved in B12 synthesis or use (7Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41148-41159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), were aligned by using the ClustalX program. Four highly conserved motifs were identified (Fig. 7). Motif I of PduX occurs in approximately the same place as the non-ATP substrate-binding site in the other family members, but the sequence is quite different. Therefore, motif I of PduX may form part of the l-Thr-binding site. Motif II is well conserved throughout the GHMP family and interacts with the phosphates of ATP. Motif III is also well conserved across the GHMP family and is close to the substrate-binding sites. Motif IV (which is located between motifs II and III of the GHMP family) is unique to PduX. Because it is near the ATP-binding motif, it is possible that this motif forms part of the active site or ATP-binding site. To investigate the mechanism of PduX, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of these four conserved motifs. Given that catalytic and substrate-binding functions of carboxylate side chains are well documented for several GHMP family enzymes (37Potter D. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Krepkiy D. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we chose to investigate two conserved glutamates (Glu-24 and Glu-132) and two invariant aspartates (Asp-103 and Asp-135) that are located in the highly conserved motifs (Fig. 7). Each residue was replaced with alanine and its isosteric substitution (glutamine replaces glutamate and asparagine replaces aspartate). There is also precedent for participation of hydroxyl groups from serine or threonine in substrate binding and/or catalysis in GHMP family members (14Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A.

Here we report on the conformational dynamics of a model Y-family polymerase Dpo4 from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange in tandem with mass spectrometry was used to monitor changes in Dpo4 structure as a function of time and the presence or absence of specific substrates and ligands. Analysis of the data revealed previously unrecognized structural changes that accompany steps in the catalytic cycle leading up to phosphoryl transfer. For example, the solvent accessibility of the αB-loop-αC region in the finger domain decreased in the presence of all four dNTP insertion events, but the rate of deuterium exchange, an indicator of conformational flexibility, only decreased during an accurate insertion event. Of particular note is a change in the region surrounding the H-helix of the thumb domain. Upon binding DNA and Mg2+, the H-helix showed a decrease in solvent accessibility and flexibility that was relaxed only upon addition of dCTP, which forms a Watson-Crick base pair with template dG and not during mispairing events. The current study expands upon a previous report from our group that used a fluorescent probe located near the thumb domain to measure the kinetic properties of Dpo4 conformational changes.

The mechanisms utilized by DNA polymerases to catalyze replication and/or repair of genomic material provide a fascinating example of how an enzyme can select a single substrate from multiple candidates, all with similar structural and chemical properties. DNA polymerases inside the cells of every living organism select from a pool of (four) dNTP substrates to catalyze phosphoryl transfer and then extend from a nascent primer strand opposite a DNA template. It has been emphasized that the endpoint of each nucleotide selection event cannot be determined solely by the thermodynamics of a given base pair (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 2Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Instead, the molecular features intrinsic to DNA polymerases are generally thought to guide the free-energy landscape of phosphoryl transfer toward the selection of “Watson-Crick” pairs (3Joyce C.M.

It is now apparent that individual DNA polymerases use variations upon a general mechanism to determine nucleotide selectivity (4Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A.

Like most other DNA polymerases, the Y-family pols have three domains: the finger for dNTP selection, the palm for catalysis, and the thumb for double strand DNA contact/orientation, which together form a structure that has been likened to a right hand. The Y-family polymerases also possess a unique domain that has been called the little finger or palm-associated domain. Most of the additional domains beyond these four core domains are involved in a complex web of protein-protein interactions and cellular localization events, although there are clearly exceptions to this rule (e.g. the N-clasp of pol κ and the N-digit of REV1) (10Lone S.

It is clear that, upon binding DNA, the little finger of Dpo4 probably undergoes a dramatic translation/rotation through space (20Wong J.H. Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Ling H. J. Mol.

The lack of obvious conformational rearrangements has led to the proposal that the Y-family DNA polymerases possess a “pre-formed” active site (22Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, there is substantial kinetic evidence in support of the view that a non-covalent step or steps occur in the Dpo4 reaction cycle prior to nucleophilic attack upon (what is assumed to be) a deprotonated 3′-hydroxyl group at the primer terminus, at least during formation of Watson-Crick geometry (23Fiala K.A.

The temporal and structural resolution provided by HDX-MS can serve as an effective bridge between kinetic analysis, which provides evidence of changes but cannot identify locations, and the inherently static nature of crystal structures. Our results provide new insight into Y-family polymerase catalysis, which may lead to a better understanding of how these enzymes select nucleotide substrates and, ultimately, how they contribute to mutagenesis.

Following storage in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol (v/v), the enzyme was dialyzed against 500 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol (v/v) overnight. The concentration of the enzyme following dialysis was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 24,100 m−1 cm−1). The dialyzed protein was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe tip filter and aliquoted into 100-μl samples (160 μm final concentration), flash-frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at −80 °C. Samples were thawed and used for HDX experiments on the same day. Pepsin was purchased from Worthington Biochemicals (Lakewood, NJ) and dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) just prior to performing the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions. All unlabeled dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All oligonucleotides used in this work were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified by the manufacturer using high-performance liquid chromatography, with analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight MS. The 13-base primer sequence used in the analyses was 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′. A dideoxy-terminated 13-mer primer of identical sequence was used in all experiments that included a dNTP. The template DNA sequence was 5′-TCACGGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′. All of the MgCl2, dNTP, and DNA stock solutions used in the HDX analysis were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in D2O (100%, Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). Dpo4 was diluted 10-fold in deionized H2O prior to addition of potassium phosphate (pH 2.3, to a final concentration of 0.1 m), and then pepsin (10 molar equivalents) was added. Dpo4 was digested with pepsin for 15 min on ice prior to LC injection. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), operating in the ESI positive ion mode. An Acquity UPLC BEH octadecylsilane (C18) column (1.7 μm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm) was kept at 30 °C with the following LC conditions: buffer A contained 98% H2O/2% CH3CN/0.01% CF3CO2H (v/v), and buffer B contained 2% H2O/98% CH3CN/0.01% CF3CO2H (v/v). For peptide sequencing the following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 50 μl min−1: 0–10 min, linear gradient from 100% A to 95%A/5% B (v/v); 10–20 min, linear gradient to 85% A/15% B (v/v); 20–60 min, linear gradient to 47%A/53% B; 60–64 min, linear gradient to 5%A/95% B; 64–68 min, hold at 5% A/95% B; 68–70 min, linear gradient to 100% A. ESI conditions were as follow: source voltage, 4 kV; source current, 100 μA; auxiliary gas flow rate setting, 20; sweep gas flow rate setting, 5; sheath gas flow setting, 34; capillary voltage, −49 V; capillary temperature, 350 °C; and tube lens voltage, −90 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 30 ms. Data-dependent spectral acquisition with dynamic exclusion and charge-state monitoring was used to obtain fragmentation patterns for peptides as they eluted from the column. HDX experiments were performed by diluting 2.5 μl of Dpo4 (160 μm) into 22.5 μl of deuterated solution. For experiments with DNA, MgCl2, and/or dNTPs, the ligands were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in D2O. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. After the indicated time the exchange was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.3), and the reaction tube was placed on ice. Next, 10 molar equivalents of pepsin was added to the quenched solution and allowed to digest for 15 min on ice prior to injection. A zero time control (m0%) was performed to assess the amount of deuterium incorporated after acidification and during the pepsin digestion. The zero time control was prepared by adding 2.5 μl of Dpo4 (160 μm) to 25 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 2.3) on ice prior to adding 22.5 μl of deuterated solution. The amount of deuterium incorporated during each time course was corrected for deuterium loss during digestion and UPLC separation (i.e. “back-exchange”) by using a 6-h time point (m100%) as a reference for each experimental condition, which should take into account experimental variability from one run to the next. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed as described above with the following distinctions. For HDX experiments the autosampler was cooled to 5 °C and the injector bypassed so that the UPLC column could be packed in ice. Solvents were kept on ice during the analysis. The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 50 μl min−1: 0–3 min, linear gradient from 100% buffer A (see above) to 97%A/3% B (v/v); 3–4.5 min, linear gradient to 80% A/20% B (v/v); 4–5.5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 5–5.5 min, hold at 100% B; 5.5–6.5 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 6.5–9.5 min, hold at 100% A. The column was placed in ice for the duration of the experiment. ESI conditions were as described above. Data sets were analyzed in Matlab (Mathworks) using a modified version of the DoGEX software developed by our group (30Sanchez-Ponce R. Guengerich F.P. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3355-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peaks defining the isotopic envelope in a given m/z and time range were detected. A weighted average was used to deconvolute the peptide envelope (supplemental Fig. S1). The deconvolution was calculated by summing all the isotopic intensities in the envelope and multiplying them by their respective m/z values. The m/z intensity sum was divided by the sum of all the intensities. Each deconvoluted m/z value corresponded to a different degree of deuterium incorporation corresponding to a particular time in the reaction for a given peptide. The deuterium content of each peptide was adjusted for gain or loss during the experiment using Equation 1,D=[(mt-m0%)/(m100%-mt)×N](Eq. 1) where D is the deuterium content in a given peptide and mt, m0%, and m100% are the weighted average m/z values calculated for a peptide at a given time (mt), for the exchange-in experiment (m0%), and for a maximally deuterated sample (m100%), respectively. The total number of amide protons (N) depends upon the peptide sequence (N = [length of peptide − (N terminus) − (any prolines)]). The number of deuterons incorporated was plotted as a function of time, and individual data sets were fit using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) to the sum of first-order rate terms (Equation 2).D=N-∑i=1Nexp(-kit)(Eq. 2) The structural representations were prepared using Pymol (44DeLano W.L. The PyMol Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Dpo4 was initially incubated with pepsin and H2O to identify the peptides generated during the digestion step. A long chromatographic step was coupled with data-dependent fragmentation of the resulting peptides. The resulting MS/MS spectra were submitted to the Mascot server (Matrix Science) to identify Dpo4 peptides based on their fragmentation patterns. The resulting map gave 96% coverage of the 352 amino acids that comprise the Dpo4 polypeptide (supplemental Table S1). However, during the HDX analysis a shorter chromatographic gradient was used to minimize loss of deuterium prior to MS analysis. The shorter gradient effectively reduced the working coverage to ∼69% of the Dpo4 sequence (Fig. 1A). The working peptide map consisted of 28 ions and covered all four domains of the polymerase (supplemental Table S2). For any peptide of length N analyzed by MS, the amide hydrogens in that peptide will exchange with variable rates that are primarily dependent upon hydrogen bond participation. Changes in the measured rates of HDX for a peptide may represent changes in either the stability/identity of hydrogen bonding patterns, which may include spatial rearrangements. Either of these events is indicative of changes in the structure of the protein. A qualitative picture of the number of rapidly exchanging hydrogens (k > 4 min−1) can be obtained by measuring the amount of HDX at a relatively short time scale (e.g. 15 s). It seems intuitive that the exposure to solvent would be reflected in the rate of rapid HDX, and if this were true then identifying regions that have rapidly exchanging hydrogens would be indicative of solvent exposure. However, there is evidence in the literature that HDX is largely insensitive to the degree of solvent exposure for backbone hydrogens (31Englander S.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A “rapid exchange map” is therefore a very rough estimate of solvent accessibility at best. Moreover, although a single time point is inextricably linked to the kinetics, it is not necessarily predictive of either the rates obtained when fitting a time course to multiple exponential equations or the final amplitudes of HDX observed in time course experiments. In the case of Dpo4, the rapid exchange map is largely confirmatory in nature because of the large amount of structural information already present in the literature. These so-called “rapid exchange” maps therefore provide an initial overview of deuterium exchange occurring under a given set of experimental conditions (i.e. with or without DNA and/or dNTPs). The rapid exchange map for Dpo4 in isolation indicated that, unsurprisingly, the palm domain exhibited the least amount of exchange in the first 15 s of the reaction (Fig. 1B, and supplemental Table S1). Portions of the finger and thumb domains exhibited the highest amounts of deuterium incorporation for the apoenzyme (Fig. 1B). The addition of primer/template DNA and MgCl2 reduced the fraction of rapid exchange by >5% for 12 peptides (Fig. 2 and Table 1). One peptide located in the linker region between the thumb and little finger domains (residues 229–239) exhibited a 12% increase in the amount of rapid exchange observed (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Overall, the protected regions aligned well with what is observed in the ternary crystal structures of Dpo4 bound to primer/template DNA (Fig. 2). For example, helices H, J, and K (represented by peptides that contain residues 180–202, 210–218, and 215–229, respectively) all exhibited a decrease in rapid exchange upon addition of primer/template DNA and MgCl2. The loop region located between helices B and C in the finger domain (residues 48–63) was protected from deuterium exchange upon addition of DNA substrate, as are residues 272–293 in the little finger domain (Fig. 2 and Table 1).TABLE 1Peptide sequences that exhibit changes in the rapid phase of HDX upon addition of primer/template DNA, MgCl2, and/or dCTPSequenceResiduesFraction of amide hydrogens exchanged in 15 s:Dpo4+DNA/Mg2++DNA/Mg2+/dCTPVFSGRF32–370.300.11aBoldface type indicates peptides that exhibited > 5% change in deuterium content upon addition of the indicated substrates.0.12VATANY43–480.190.210.08YEARKFGVKAGIPIVE48–630.190.140.06EARKFGVKAGIPIVE49–630.280.150.05VYLPMRKEVYQQVS72–850.220.040.07VYLPMRKEVYQQVSS72–860.170.100.11VYQQVSSRIMNLLR80–930.380.280.21AKIAADMAKPNGIKVIDDEE151–1700.120.080.01IADVPGIGNITAEKLKKLGINKL180–2020.190.080.14FDKLKGMIG210–2180.100.040.03GMIGEAKAKYLISLA215–2290.240.170.26ARDEYNEPIRT229–2390.20.320.14SYYKLDKRIPKAIHVVA272–2880.130.030.02VTEDL289–2930.150.080.07a Boldface type indicates peptides that exhibited > 5% change in deuterium content upon addition of the indicated substrates. Open table in a new tab The addition of dCTP resulted in changes of >5% of the maximal deuterium incorporation for eight peptides, but these were not the same set of peptides noted following addition of primer/template DNA and MgCl2 (Fig. 2 and Table 1). It should be mentioned again that 2′,3′-dideoxy-terminated primers were used in all experiments that contain dNTP in the reaction mixture. The lack of a 3′-hydroxyl moiety prohibited phosphodiester bond formation from occurring in the HDX experiment. Six of the peptides that changed upon addition of dCTP showed a decrease in the rapid phase of exchange, but two peptides in the thumb domain (residues 180–202 and 215–229) showed an increase in rapid exchange upon addition of dCTP. With the exception of one peptide in the palm domain (residues 151–170 comprising the F-helix), the peptides that exhibited changes in the rapid HDX phase upon addition of dCTP are found in the finger and thumb domain. Separate HDX time courses were performed with either Dpo4 alone, with DNA/Mg2+, or with DNA/Mg2+/dNTP (supplemental Fig. S2 and Tables S3–S5). In the sequence context used for the HDX experiments, dCTP would represent a normal Watson-Crick pairing mode for insertion, and binding of dGTP would most likely result in formation of a “Type II” mode of binding (14Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) where the incoming nucleotide skips the template base at position 0 and pairs with the base at position +1 (5′ to position 0). Inclusion of either dATP or dTTP in the HDX experiment is expected to yield such mispairing events. The majority of the protein did not exhibit changes in HDX during dCTP binding (supplemental Fig. S2 and Tables S3–S5), but some notable changes were observed in the Dpo4 HDX kinetics following addition of individual dNTPs. First, the loop region between helix B and C in the finger domain (residues 48–63) exhibited changes in both the amount and rate of deuterium incorporated when an incoming dNTP was present (Fig. 3, A and B). All four dNTPs caused reductions in the amount of deuterium incorporated, which could indicate decreased solvent accessibility and/or a decrease in the number of hydrogen bonding interactions. A decrease in the HDX rate was only observed when dCTP was included in the experiment, decreasing roughly 2- to 3-fold relative to the rate observed when only DNA and Mg2+ was present (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The decreased rate of HDX was observed for two ions that mapped peptides 48–63 and 49–63 in the finger domain, respectively, and can be interpreted as resulting from increased hydrogen bond stability in this region upon binding of dCTP.TABLE 2HDX kinetics for selected ionsResiduesSubstratesA1k1A2k2deuteronsmin−1deuteronsmin−1 × 10342–481.2 ± 0.16.2 ± 2.1DNA/Mg2+1.2 ± 0.16.1 ± 1.7DNA/Mg2+/dCTP0.7 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.9DNA/Mg2+/dTTP1.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.6DNA/Mg2+/dATP0.9 ± 0.14.9 ± 1.6DNA/Mg2+/dGTP0.7 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.448–635.5 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.48.3 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.6DNA/Mg2+4.7 ± 0.40.50 ± 0.128.5 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.8DNA/Mg2+/dCTP3.2 ± 0.40.28 ± 0.099.7 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.6DNA/Mg2+/dTTP2.4 ± 0.30.95 ± 0.3411.2 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.7DNA/Mg2+/dATP2.6 ± 0.30.62 ± 0.1911.0 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.4DNA/Mg2+/dGTP2.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.349–634.4 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.58.5 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.8DNA/Mg4.3 ± 0.60.94 ± 0.308.3 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.9DNA/Mg2+/dCTP2.9 ± 0.30.30 ± 0.099.2 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.5DNA/Mg2+/dTTP2.7 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.39.9 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.7DNA/Mg2+/dATP2.4 ± 0.30.63 ± 0.1910.1 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.4DNA/Mg2+/dGTP2.4 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.6151–1702.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.514.1 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.7DNA/Mg2+2.1 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.514.7 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.2DNA/Mg2+/dCTP2.3 ± 0.20.58 ± 0.1114.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1DNA/Mg2+/dTTP2.7 ± 0.30.52 ± 0.1414.6 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.4DNA/Mg2+/dATP1.4 ± 0.30.50 ± 0.2515.5 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.2180–2026.4 ± 0.53.5 ± 0.614.5 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.3DNA/Mg2+3.4 ± 0.40.68 ± 0.2216.9 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.3DNA/Mg2+/dCTP4.1 ± 0.63.0 ± 0.916.7 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.3DNA/Mg2+/dTTP4.1 ± 0.30.65 ± 0.21DNA/Mg2+/dATP3.4 ± 0.30.45 ± 0.14DNA/Mg2+/dGTP3.8 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.3215–2293.5 ± 0.112.8 ± 6.6DNA/Mg2+2.3 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.8DNA/Mg2+/dCTP3.8 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.6DNA/Mg2+/dTTP2.9 ± 0.19.6 ± 2.6DNA/Mg2+/dATP2.3 ± 0.110.0 ± 6.6DNA/Mg2+/dGTP2.1 ± 0.13.8 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab The loop region containing residues 48–63 is in contact with what has been termed the “roof” of the Dpo4 active site (β-sheet 3), which includes residues 40–48. The ion representing residues 43–48 showed the largest reduction in deuterium content for both the dCTP and dGTP binding events (Fig. 3C and Table 2). A modest decrease in the rate of HDX for residues 43–48 was also observed upon addition of all four dNTPs. The decreased amplitude of deuterium incorporation in the presence of dCTP is consistent with the results obtained for residues 48–63 and may represent more stable interactions between β-sheet 3 and αB-loop-αC when the nascent base pair is dCTP:dG (Fig. 3D). Another ion that exhibited decreased rapid exchange upon addition of dCTP was identified as a peptide containing residues 151–170, which comprise the F-helix in the Dpo4 palm domain. The rate constant that defines the first exponential phase of HDX for the F-helix decreased ∼3-fold upon addition of dCTP, indicating that conformational flexibility in this region is diminished during formation of the nascent base pair. However, the addition of other dNTPs also elicited a similar change in HDX rate, indicating that the decreased flexibility observed in the F-helix is a general phenomenon associated with formation of a ternary complex but one that is insensitive to nucleotide identity (Fig. 4). Two peptides in the thumb domain revealed quite unique HDX kinetics during the binding of dNTPs. A peptide containing residues 180–202, which comprises α-helix H in the thumb, displayed increased HDX in the rapid exchange map upon addition of dCTP. Inspection of the HDX kinetic profiles revealed that the H-helix exhibits more stable and/or numerous hydrogen bonding interactions upon binding to DNA·Mg2+ an"

(Biochem Biophys Res Commun 334: 1159). In this study, bladders from rats subjected to surgical SCI were obtained at 3, 7 or 25 days post-surgery, and Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome U34A arrays were used for cRNA hybridizations. In the present study, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) of differentially expressed genes was performed. Analysis of focus genes in networks, functional analysis, and canonical pathway analysis reinforced our previous findings related to the presence of up-regulated genes involved in tissue remodeling, such as lysyl oxidase, tropoelastin, TGF-beta1, and IGF-1. This analysis also highlighted a central role for inflammation and infection, evidenced by networks containing genes such as CD74, S100A9, and THY1.Our findings suggest that tissue remodeling, infection, inflammation, and tissue damage/dysfunction all play a role in the urinary bladder, in the complex response to SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2010706007,"It has recently been demonstrated that the anti-herpetic drug acyclovir (ACV) also displays antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The triphosphate form of ACV is accepted by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), and subsequent incorporation leads to classical chain termination. Like all approved nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs), the selective pressure of ACV is associated with the emergence of resistance. The V75I mutation in HIV-1 RT appears to be dominant in this regard. By itself, this mutation is usually not associated with resistance to currently approved NRTIs. Here we studied the underlying biochemical mechanism. We demonstrate that V75I is also selected under the selective pressure of a monophosphorylated prodrug that was designed to bypass the bottleneck in drug activation to the triphosphate form (ACV-TP). Pre-steady-state kinetics reveal that V75I discriminates against the inhibitor at the level of catalysis, whereas binding of the inhibitor remains largely unaffected. The incorporated ACV-monophosphate (ACV-MP) is vulnerable to excision in the presence of the pyrophosphate donor ATP. V75I compromises binding of the next nucleotide that can otherwise provide a certain degree of protection from excision.

ACV-TP binds to the nucleotide binding site, and the incorporated ACV-MP causes DNA chain termination after the release of pyrophosphate (PPi). Like most other nucleoside analogues (14Sarafianos S.G.

This reaction can reduce the overall inhibitory effect; however, the removal of the chain terminator can be blocked through formation of a DEC (17Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc.

Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). High concentrations (>100 μm) of the next nucleotide are required to form a DEC with a primer terminated with zidovudine (AZT), whereas submicromolar concentrations are often sufficient to form a DEC with ddNTPs (16Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). ACV-MP shows a behavior in the middle of the spectrum; ∼25 μm concentrations of the next nucleotide inhibits excision by 50% (10Lisco A. Vanpouille C. Tchesnokov E.P. Grivel J.C. Biancotto A.

In vitro selection experiments revealed that ACV drug pressure is linked to the emergence of mutation V75I in the RT gene (11McMahon M.A. Siliciano J.D. Lai J. Liu J.O. Stivers J.T. Siliciano R.F. Kohli R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31289-31293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A similar change, i.e. V75T, has earlier been associated with resistance to stavudine (19Lacey S.F. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mutations M184V and T69N are other previously known resistance-conferring mutations that emerged under the selective pressure of ACV; however, V75I outgrew the culture over protracted periods of time, suggesting that this mutation is strongly associated with ACV resistance. HIV variants containing V75I showed marked increases in 50% effective antiviral concentrations (EC50), which confirms the selection experiments (11McMahon M.A. Siliciano J.D. Lai J. Liu J.O. Stivers J.T. Siliciano R.F. Kohli R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31289-31293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we studied the underlying biochemical mechanism of HIV resistance to ACV associated with V75I. Two major mechanisms of resistance to nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described (20Goldschmidt V. Marquet R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1687-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Götte M. Expert Rev. Anti-Infect. Ther. 2004; 2: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Menéndez-Arias L. Virus Res. 2008; 134: 124-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1408-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Basavapathruni A. Anderson K.S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3795-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The first mechanism is based on substrate discrimination. In this case the mutant enzyme can selectively diminish binding and/or incorporation of the nucleotide analogue, whereas the properties of the natural counterpart remain largely unaffected. M184V that confers high level resistance to 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine is a prominent example in this regard. The second major resistance mechanism associated with NRTIs is based on excision. In this case, the mutant enzyme can increase the rate of excision of the incorporated inhibitor. Thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs) were shown to be able to recruit ATP as a PPi donor and increase excision of incorporated AZT-MP (17Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that V75I discriminates against ACV-TP at the level of incorporation. Excision of the incorporated nucleotide is also increased when compared with wild type RT; however, the effect is less pronounced, as seen with the excision of ACV-MP against a background of TAMs. V75I does not provide further protection from excision through DEC formation. Collectively, the data suggest that ACV is vulnerable to both major resistance mechanisms. Heterodimeric reverse transcriptase p66/p51 was expressed and purified as described (25Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes were generated through site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. TAM2 refers to HIV1-RT containing the following substitutions: D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219Q. Oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were chemically synthesized and purchased from Invitrogen and from Integrated DNA Technologies. The following sequence was used as template T50A6: 5′-CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGATGAAACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC. The underlined nucleotides are the portion of the templates annealed to the primer. The following primer was used in this study: P1, 5′-GAGTGGTATAGTGGAGTGAA. ACV (1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 200 μl of dry 1,3-dimethyl-2-oxohexahydropyrimidine N,N′-dimethylpropylene urea with 12–15 molecular sieves under nitrogen and stirred for 24 h. The mixture was chilled with an ice-water bath and stirred for 1 h followed by slow addition of 3 eq of phosphorus oxychloride and stirring for an additional 25 min. A solution of tributylammonium pyrophosphate (4 eq) in 200 μl of N,N′-dimethylpropylene urea and tributylamine (15 eq) was simultaneously added to the reaction. After 45 min the reaction was quenched with ice-cold water, and then it was slowly brought to the room temperature. The reaction was washed with chloroform, and the aqueous layer was collected and co-evaporated with deionized water three times. The residue was resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water and purified on an ion-exchange column by high performance liquid chromatography λ(max) = 253. To reduce the amount of excess salt, the final product was co-evaporated with water 5 times, giving total yield of ACV-TP (NH3)4 of 18% with purity ≥95%. The molecular weight of the ACV-TP was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; m/z (M+1) 466→152 (26Burgess K. Cook D. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The ACV prodrug CF2648 was prepared by the coupling of suitably base-protected ACV with the appropriate phosphorochloridate reagent under anhydrous conditions followed by base deprotection, according to procedures we have previously reported (27McGuigan C. Derudas M. Bugert J.J. Andrei G. Snoeck R. Balzarini J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 4364-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was monitored with 5′-end-labeled primers unless otherwise indicated. 150 nm DNA/DNA (T50A6/P1) was incubated with 30 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, constant concentrations of dGTP (1 μm) and ddTTP (2 μm) or dNTP mix (1 μm) and increasing concentrations of ACV-TP. Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 reaction volumes of formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were then subjected to 15% denaturing PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. Inhibitory concentrations of ACT-TP required to inhibit DNA synthesis at position +2 by 50% (IC50) was determined by normalizing the product fraction formed at position +2 in the presence of ACV-TP to the corresponding value in the absence of inhibitor. Data points were fit to a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) function using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0). The T50A6/P1 DNA/DNA substrate was extended by a single nucleotide to generate an oligonucleotide with ACV-MP at the 3′-end. The extended primer was gel-purified and annealed with template T50A6. 50 nm substrate was then incubated with 500 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3.5 mm ATP (pyrophosphatase-treated). Aliquots were taken at different time points and analyzed as described. In preparation of the footprinting experiments, template T50A6 was 5′-end-labeled and heat-annealed with primer P1. 50 nm DNA/DNA hybrid was incubated with 750 nm HIV-RT for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing sodium cacodylate, pH 7 (120 mm), NaCl (20 mm), DTT (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and 25 μm ddGTP or 5 μm ACV-TP in a final volume of 15 μl. In control reactions ddGTP and ACV-TP were either omitted or substituted with 100 μl phosphonoformic acid (PFA or foscarnet). After complete complex formation and/or nucleotide incorporation, increasing concentrations of dTTP were added to the reactions followed by an incubation of 5 min at 37 °C. For the actual footprinting, complexes were treated with 0.1 mm ammonium iron (II) sulfate hexahydrate (28Marchand B. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min and were processed and analyzed as described. DNA synthesis at template position +1 was conducted in a similar fashion as described above except that a chain terminator (ddGTP, 25 μm or ACV-TP, 2.5 μm) was incorporated at this position. A time course of incorporation of the chain terminator at position +1 in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of the nucleotide at the following position, +2, was monitored. The reactions were processed and analyzed as described. Slopes of the linear portion of product formation illustrate the velocities of the reaction, which when normalized to the enzyme concentration, determine the turnover number (kcat). Inhibition of DNA synthesis by DEC formation is illustrated by a decrease in kcat. Nucleotide incorporation under single-turnover conditions was monitored using a rapid quench-flow instrument (KinTek RQF-3). Reactions involved rapid mixing of a solution containing preincubated 100 nm DNA/DNA template/primer hybrid with 500 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C with a solution of the same buffer composition except that template/primer and RT were substituted with a given concentration of dGTP or ACV-TP. Nucleotide incorporation was monitored at time points of 0.015, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 s. The reactions were processed and analyzed as described. Data points from time courses were fit by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0)) to a single exponential equation, [product] = A(1−exp(−kobservedt)), where A represents the amplitude, and kobserved is the first order rate constant for dGTP or ACV-TP incorporation. kobserved were replotted versus increasing concentrations of dGTP or ACV-TP to determine the respective kobserved. Data points were fit to a hyperbolic function, kobserved = kpol[dNTP]/(Kd,dNTP+ [dNTP]), where kpol is the maximum first-order rate constant for dGMP or ACV-MP incorporation, and Kd,dNTP is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of dGTP or ACV-TP with the RT-template/primer complex. MT-4 cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program and infected with HIV-1LAI.04 in the absence or presence of CF2648. Every 3–5 days, 3% of the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh cells. Cultures were maintained in the absence or presence of gradually escalating concentrations of CF2648. HIV-1 replication in infected cultures was assessed by measuring p24gag from culture supernatants, as previously described (10Lisco A. Vanpouille C. Tchesnokov E.P. Grivel J.C. Biancotto A. Brichacek B. Elliott J. Fromentin E. Shattock R. Anton P. Gorelick R. Balzarini J. McGuigan C. Derudas M. Götte M. Schinazi R.F. Margolis L.

Phenotypic resistance of viruses serially passed in the absence or in the presence of the CF2648 was evaluated in MT-4 cell cultures using drug concentrations ranging from 0 to 150 μm. The effective concentration that inhibits 50% replication was calculated by fitting the data points to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using GraphPad Prism (Version 4.0). Viral RNA was extracted from plasma using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HIV-1 RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and a 2878-bp nucleotide fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase was amplified in an outer PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen) and outer primers AV190-1 and CR1 (29Snoeck J. Riva C. Steegen K. Schrooten Y. Maes B. Vergne L. Van Laethem K. Peeters M. Vandamme A.M. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; 128: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A 2853-bp nucleotide fragment was amplified using Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) and the inner primers AV190-2 and CR2. Amplification products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were purified with Microspin S-400 (GE Healthcare). Sequencing was performed using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.1 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing kit as described before (29Snoeck J. Riva C. Steegen K. Schrooten Y. Maes B. Vergne L. Van Laethem K. Peeters M. Vandamme A.M. J. Virol. Methods. 2005; 128: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reactions were run on an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer, and analysis was performed using Sequence Analysis Version 3.7 and SeqScape version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d Ijssel, The Netherlands). The V75I mutation in HIV-1 RT was shown to emerge rapidly under the selective pressure of ACV (11McMahon M.A. Siliciano J.D. Lai J. Liu J.O. Stivers J.T. Siliciano R.F. Kohli R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31289-31293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The poor production of ACV-MP and, in turn, the poor production of ACV-TP is a possible factor that diminishes the efficacy of ACV and facilitates the selection of resistance. It is currently unknown whether monophosphorylated prodrugs can prevent or significantly delay the development of resistance. To address this problem, we attempted to select for resistance with the monophosphorylated prodrug CF2648. HIV-1 was propagated in MT-4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CF2648. The antiviral activity of CF2648 after 39 serial passages (∼120 days) in the presence of the compound was reduced relative to the control propagated in the absence of the drug. Sequencing of HIV-1 RT revealed the emergence of V75I, and phenotypic resistance measurements revealed a 15-fold increase in the EC50 value (Table 1). Overall, the data suggest that the selection of V75I in the RT enzyme may not be prevented with prodrugs that bypass the first phosphorylation step. Given the potential relevance of this mutation in clinical settings, we studied the underlying biochemical mechanisms.TABLE 1Inhibitory activity of ACV ProTide CF2648 against HIV-1Lai.04 in MT-4 cellsWTCF2648-selected virus-Fold increaseEC50 ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab We initially studied substrate discrimination as a possible mechanism for resistance. Classic protocols that address this problem include steady-state kinetics that measure efficiencies of incorporation of the inhibitor and its natural counterpart in separate experiments. However, with this approach we were unable to detect significant differences between purified wild type (WT) RT and the mutant enzyme containing V75I (data not shown). We considered two potential problems associated with this assay. First, incorporation of the inhibitor was measured in the absence of the natural counterpart dGTP. Therefore, we devised an assay that monitors incorporation of ACV-MP in the presence of both ACV-TP and dGTP (Fig. 2A). The primer/template was designed to monitor incorporation of ACV-MP at the next template position (n + 1) after the 3′-end of the primer (n). Incorporation of ACV-MP causes chain termination, whereas incorporation of dGMP allows the addition of a second nucleotide that is provided as a “stop nucleotide,” which limits DNA synthesis and reduces complexity of the assay. The natural dGTP was provided at a constant concentration of 1 μm, and ACV-TP was provided at varying concentrations (Fig. 2B). We found that the concentrations required to diminish dinucleotide extensions by 50% were significantly higher with the mutant enzyme, which suggests that the V75I mutant increases discrimination against the inhibitor (Fig. 2C). We obtained essentially the same result with a different primer/template sequence that allowed us to monitor ACV-MP incorporation at template position +7 (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Competition between ACV-TP and dGTP during later stages of DNA synthesis.

Dotted lines point to 50% product formation; however, we were unable to accurately determine IC50 values under these conditions. Incorporation of ACV-MP is generally diminished when compared with the sequence used in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A second common problem associated with classic steady-state kinetics is that the multiple turnovers can mask differences in substrate binding or catalysis (30Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To address this problem we measured kinetic parameters under pre-steady-state conditions, which provides at the same time mechanistic insight (Table 2). WT RT binds ACV-TP and dGTP with similar affinity as evidenced by Kd values of 2.2 and 1.3 μm, respectively. However, the rate of incorporation is significantly higher for dGMP (kpol = 66 s−1) as compared with ACV-TP (kpol = 14 s−1), which translates to an 8-fold selective advantage of the natural nucleotide over the inhibitor with regard to the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation (kpol/Kd).TABLE 2Pre-steady state parameters for nucleotide incorporation by WT and V75I mutant RTEnzymeSubstrateSELaSEL, selectivity, is calculated as a ratio of kpol/Kd for dGTP over kpol/Kd for ACV-TP.RESbRES, resistance, is calculated as a ratio of selectivity of WT over the selectivity of V75I mutant RT.dGTPACV-TPkpolKdkpol/KdkpolKdkpol/Kds−1μms−1μmWT66 ± 3.0cErrors reported represent the deviation of points from the curve fit generated by GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0).1.3 ± 0.165114 ± 0.392.2 ± 0.186.48.01.0V75I114 ± 2.93.7 ± 0.18311.5 ± 0.0713.8 ± 0.430.40789.8a SEL, selectivit"
https://openalex.org/W2133938877,"The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1965336119,"The synaptic form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in skeletal muscle ColQ-AChE derives from two separate genes encoding the catalytic and the non-catalytic collagenic tail (ColQ) subunits, respectively. ColQ-AChE expression is regulated by muscle activity; however, how this regulation takes place in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. In this study, we overexpressed or knocked down ColQ expression in skeletal muscle and found that the level of this non-catalytic component by itself was sufficient to change the levels of total AChE activity by promoting assembly of higher order oligomeric forms including the collagen-tailed forms. These results initially suggested that ColQ could be limiting in the assembly of synaptic ColQ-AChE during development and differentiation. We then determined the levels of ColQ protein and ColQ mRNA during primary quail muscle cell development and differentiation in culture (QMCs) and as a function of muscle activity. Surprisingly, we found dissociation between transcription and translation of the non-catalytic subunit from its assembly into ColQ-AChE. Furthermore, we found that the vast majority of the steady state ColQ molecules in mature quail muscle cultures are not assembled into ColQ-AChE, suggesting that they are either rapidly degraded or have alternative function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2036755526,"Background Here we continue our efforts to use methods developed in the folding mechanism community to both better understand and improve structure prediction. Our previous work demonstrated that Rosetta's coarse-grained potentials may actually impede accurate structure prediction at full-atom resolution. Based on this work we postulated that it may be time to work completely at full-atom resolution but that doing so may require more careful attention to the kinetics of convergence. Methodology/Principal Findings To explore the possibility of working entirely at full-atom resolution, we apply enhanced sampling algorithms and the free energy theory developed in the folding mechanism community to full-atom protein structure prediction with the prominent Rosetta package. We find that Rosetta's full-atom scoring function is indeed able to recognize diverse protein native states and that there is a strong correlation between score and Cα RMSD to the native state. However, we also show that there is a huge entropic barrier to folding under this potential and the kinetics of folding are extremely slow. We then exploit this new understanding to suggest ways to improve structure prediction. Conclusions/Significance Based on this work we hypothesize that structure prediction may be improved by taking a more physical approach, i.e. considering the nature of the model thermodynamics and kinetics which result from structure prediction simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2022723054,"Background An open problem in clinical chemistry is the estimation of the optimal sampling time intervals for the application of statistical quality control (QC) procedures that are based on the measurement of control materials. This is a probabilistic risk assessment problem that requires reliability analysis of the analytical system, and the estimation of the risk caused by the measurement error. Methodology/Principal Findings Assuming that the states of the analytical system are the reliability state, the maintenance state, the critical-failure modes and their combinations, we can define risk functions based on the mean time of the states, their measurement error and the medically acceptable measurement error. Consequently, a residual risk measure rr can be defined for each sampling time interval. The rr depends on the state probability vectors of the analytical system, the state transition probability matrices before and after each application of the QC procedure and the state mean time matrices. As optimal sampling time intervals can be defined those minimizing a QC related cost measure while the rr is acceptable. I developed an algorithm that estimates the rr for any QC sampling time interval of a QC procedure applied to analytical systems with an arbitrary number of critical-failure modes, assuming any failure time and measurement error probability density function for each mode. Furthermore, given the acceptable rr, it can estimate the optimal QC sampling time intervals. Conclusions/Significance It is possible to rationally estimate the optimal QC sampling time intervals of an analytical system to sustain an acceptable residual risk with the minimum QC related cost. For the optimization the reliability analysis of the analytical system and the risk analysis of the measurement error are needed."
