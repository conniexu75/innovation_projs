However, the initial step or steps in sulfide oxidation occur in the animal tissue, and mitochondria isolated from both gill and symbiont-free foot tissue of the clam coupled the oxidation of sulfide to oxidative phosphorylation [adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis]. The ability of Solmya reidi to exploit directly the energy in sulfide for ATP synthesis is unprecedented, and suggests that sulfide-habitat animals that lack bacterial symbionts may also use sulfide as an inorganic energy source."
https://openalex.org/W2090695557,"A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) event is popularly viewed as the flip of a single spin in a magnetic field, stimulated by the absorption or emission of only one quantum of radio-frequency energy. Nevertheless, resonances between nuclear spin states that differ by more than one unit in the Zeeman quantum number also can be induced in systems of coupled spins by suitably designed sequences of radio-frequency pulses. Pairs of states excited in this way oscillate coherently at the frequencies of the corresponding multiple-quantum transitions and produce a response that may be monitored indirectly in a two-dimensional time-domain experiment. The pattern of multiple-quantum excitation and response, influenced largely by the concerted interactions of groups of coupled nuclei, simplifies the NMR spectrum in some instances and provides significant new information in others. Applications of multiple-quantum NMR extend to problems in many different areas, ranging from studies of the structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids in solution to investigations of the arrangements of atoms in amorphous semiconductors. The specific spectroscopic techniques are varied as well and include methods designed, for example, to simplify spectral analysis for liquids and liquid crystals, eliminate inhomogeneous broadening, study interatomic connectivity in liquid-state molecules, identify clusters of atoms in solids, enhance the spatial resolution in solid-state imaging experiments, and probe correlated molecular motions."

https://openalex.org/W1964585347,A mathematical proof shows that a surface with a cusp-shaped singularity can arise from minimizing an anisotropic surface free energy for a portion of a crystal surface. Such cusps have been seen on crystal surfaces but usually have been interpreted as being the result of defects or nonequilibrium crystal growth. Our result predicts that they can occur as equilibrium or near-equilibrium phenomena. It also enriches the mathematical theory of minimal surfaces.
