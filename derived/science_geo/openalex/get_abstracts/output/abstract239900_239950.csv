https://openalex.org/W2032147770,"In theory, quantum computers offer a means of solving problems that would be intractable on conventional computers. Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called ‘gates’. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called ‘fault-tolerant quantum computing’ is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented."

https://openalex.org/W2040504641,"The phenomenon known as single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) has been the focus of intense investigation since it was discovered 15 years ago, leading to predictions that extreme temperatures are reached within the cavity at extreme compression. Conditions, some have controversially claimed, that could even lead to nuclear fusion. The lack of features in the typical SBSL spectrum has made it difficult to establish what is happening within the bubble. But now, using concentrated sulphuric acid as the medium subjected to acoustic treatment, Flannigan and Suslick have obtained the most intense sonoluminescence yet seen. This provides plenty of spectral information — most importantly, evidence for temperatures as high as 15,000 K — indicating that the collapsed bubble has a hot plasma core. Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL1,2,3,4,5) results from the extreme temperatures and pressures achieved during bubble compression; calculations have predicted6,7 the existence of a hot, optically opaque plasma core8 with consequent bremsstrahlung radiation9,10. Recent controversial reports11,12 claim the observation of neutrons from deuterium–deuterium fusion during acoustic cavitation11,12. However, there has been previously no strong experimental evidence for the existence of a plasma during single- or multi-bubble sonoluminescence. SBSL typically produces featureless emission spectra13 that reveal little about the intra-cavity physical conditions or chemical processes. Here we report observations of atomic (Ar) emission and extensive molecular (SO) and ionic (O2+) progressions in SBSL spectra from concentrated aqueous H2SO4 solutions. Both the Ar and SO emission permit spectroscopic temperature determinations, as accomplished for multi-bubble sonoluminescence with other emitters14,15,16. The emissive excited states observed from both Ar and O2+ are inconsistent with any thermal process. The Ar excited states involved are extremely high in energy (>13 eV) and cannot be thermally populated at the measured Ar emission temperatures (4,000–15,000 K); the ionization energy of O2 is more than twice its bond dissociation energy, so O2+ likewise cannot be thermally produced. We therefore conclude that these emitting species must originate from collisions with high-energy electrons, ions or particles from a hot plasma core."

https://openalex.org/W2163344049,"Hydrogenosomes are simple organelles found in anaerobic protists and fungi. They are double-membraned and produce ATP and hydrogen, hence suggestions that they are anaerobic derivatives of mitochondria. An alternative view suggests that mitochondria and hydrogenosomes arose from a common ancestor, a facultatively anaerobic bacterium. The discovery of a novel hydrogenosome in Nyctotherus ovalis, a ciliate that lives in the gut of cockroaches, further complicates this debate. It is unique among known hydrogenosomes because, just like a mitochondrion, it retains its own genome. This ‘missing link’ between hydrogenosomes and mitochondria also has remnants of an electron transport chain characteristic of an aerobic lifestyle. Hydrogenosomes are organelles that produce ATP and hydrogen1, and are found in various unrelated eukaryotes, such as anaerobic flagellates, chytridiomycete fungi and ciliates2. Although all of these organelles generate hydrogen, the hydrogenosomes from these organisms are structurally and metabolically quite different, just like mitochondria where large differences also exist3. These differences have led to a continuing debate about the evolutionary origin of hydrogenosomes4,5. Here we show that the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis, which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches, have retained a rudimentary genome encoding components of a mitochondrial electron transport chain. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that those proteins cluster with their homologues from aerobic ciliates. In addition, several nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial proteome, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and complex II, were identified. The N. ovalis hydrogenosome is sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and produces succinate as a major metabolic end product—biochemical traits typical of anaerobic mitochondria3. The production of hydrogen, together with the presence of a genome encoding respiratory chain components, and biochemical features characteristic of anaerobic mitochondria, identify the N. ovalis organelle as a missing link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2129953433,"Previous studies have indicated an intimate linkage between gap junction and adherens junction formation. It was suggested this could reflect the close membrane-membrane apposition required for junction formation. In NIH3T3 cells, we observed the colocalization of connexin43 (Cx43α1) gap junction protein with N-cadherin, p120, and other N-cadherin-associated proteins at regions of cell-cell contact. We also found that Cx43α1, N-cadherin, and N-cadherin-associated proteins were coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies to either Cx43α1, N-cadherin, or various N-cadherin-associated proteins. These findings suggest that Cx43α1 and N-cadherin are coassembled in a multiprotein complex containing various N-cadherin-associated proteins. Studies using siRNA knockdown indicated that cell surface expression of Cx43α1 required N-cadherin, and conversely, N-cadherin cell surface expression required Cx43α1. Pulse-chase labeling and cell surface biotinylation experiments indicated that in the absence of N-cadherin, Cx43α1 cell surface trafficking is blocked. Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of p120, an N-cadherin-associated protein known to modulate cell surface turnover of N-cadherin, reduced N-cadherin cell surface expression without altering Cx43α1 expression. These observations suggest that in contrast to the coregulated cell surface trafficking of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin, N-cadherin turnover at the cell surface may be regulated independently of Cx43α1. Functional studies showed gap junctional communication is reduced and cell motility inhibited with N-cadherin or Cx43α1 knockdown, consistent with the observed loss of both gap junction and cadherin contacts with either knockdown. Overall, these studies indicate that the intracellular coassembly of connexin and cadherin is required for gap junction and adherens junction formation, a process that likely underlies the intimate association between gap junction and adherens junction formation.

Overall, these studies indicate that the intracellular coassembly of connexin and cadherin is required for gap junction and adherens junction formation, a process that likely underlies the intimate association between gap junction and adherens junction formation. Gap junctions are specialized cell junctions containing hydrophilic channels that mediate intercellular communication. They play an essential role in electrical and metabolic coupling by regulating the movement of ions and small molecules between cells (1Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are comprised of two hemichannels, each consisting of a hexameric assembly of transmembrane proteins known as the connexins (2Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). In the mouse genome, there are 20 connexin genes and each generate gap junction channels with different gating and regulatory properties that are likely dictated by the intracellular domains of the proteins (3Sohl G. Willecke K. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The gap junction gene, Gja1, is one of the most widely expressed connexin genes. It encodes a 43-kDa protein known as connexin43 or α1 connexin, referred to here as Cx43α1. 1The abbreviations used are: Cx43α1, connexin43; N-cadherin, neuronal cadherin; p120, p120-catenin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CT, cytoplasmic terminus; NP, nonphosphorylated. Cx43α1 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the trans-Golgi network, where it is oligomerized (4Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This is followed by trafficking to the cell surface and incorporation of the hexameric arrays into gap junction plaques at regions of cell-cell contact (5Yeager M. Unger V.M. Falk M.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Cx43α1 protein has a half-life of only 1–5 h (for review, see Ref. 6Berthoud V.M. Minogue P.J. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and is turned over through the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (7Musil L.S. Le A.C. VanSlyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic terminus (CT) of Cx43α1 is subject to modification by a variety of protein kinases (10Herve J.C. Plaisance I. Loncarek J. Duthe F. Sarrouilhe D. Eur. Biophys. J.,. 2004; 33: 201-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In Western blots, there is typically a faster migrating species of Cx43α1 that co-migrates with nonphosphorylated Cx43α1 (NP), and one or more slower migrating bands containing phosphorylated isoforms. The NP form is intracellular, whereas the phosphorylated P2 form is localized in gap junction plaques (12Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 13Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 14Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Various studies have indicated that gap junction formation is dependent on the assembly of adherens junctions. This was first indicated by studies in which antibody-mediated disruption of cadherin-containing cell adhesion contacts were shown to block gap junction formation (15Frenzel E.M. Johnson R.G. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Keane R.W. Mehta P.P. Rose B. Honig L.S. Loewenstein W.R. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Meyer R.A. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). More recent studies showed that N-cadherin knockout cardiomyocytes are Cx43α1 gap junction-deficient (18Luo Y. Radice G.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas expression of a dominant-negative N-cadherin construct in cardiomyocytes was shown to disrupt Cx43α1 gap junctions (19Hertig C.M. Eppenberger-Eberhardt M. Koch S. Eppenberger H.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reciprocal requirement for gap junctions in adherens junction formation also has been noted. For example, when gap junction antibodies were injected into 2-cell mouse embryos, the embryos failed to undergo compaction, a process regulated by cadherins (20Lee S. Gilula N.B. Warner A.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 851-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In Xenopus embryos, expression of a dominant negative Cx32β1/Cx43α1 chimeric construct inhibited gap junction communication, and led to the extrusion of cells from the embryo because of a loss of cell adhesion contacts (21Paul D.L. Yu K. Bruzzone R. Gimlich R.L. Goodenough D.A. Development. 1995; 121: 371-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In another study, treatment of cells with Fab fragments targeting Cx43α1 or Cx32β1 blocked both gap junction as well as adherens junction formation (17Meyer R.A. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Together these findings indicate that formation of gap junction and adherens junction are intimately linked. It was previously suggested that this might reflect the close membrane-membrane apposition required for gap junction and adherens junction formation (17Meyer R.A. Laird D.W. Revel J.P. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We previously showed that Cx43α1 gap junctions also can modulate cell motility. Thus altered neural crest cell motility was shown to contribute to the cardiac phenotype of the Cx43α1 knockout mouse (22Li W.E. Waldo K. Linask K.L. Chen T. Wessels A. Parmacek M.S. Kirby M.L. Lo C.W. Development. 2002; 129: 2031-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Huang G.Y. Cooper E.S. Waldo K. Kirby M.L. Gilula N.B. Lo C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Xu X. Li W.E. Huang G.Y. Meyer R. Chen T. Luo Y. Thomas M.P. Radice G.L. Lo C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found in migrating neural crest cells, the colocalization of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin at many regions of cell-cell contact (24Xu X. Li W.E. Huang G.Y. Meyer R. Chen T. Luo Y. Thomas M.P. Radice G.L. Lo C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To further examine the interactions between Cx43α1 and N-cadherin, and investigate their role in regulating gap junction communication and cell motility, in this study we used NIH3T3 cells as a model system. NIH3T3 cells are reminiscent of neural crest cells, as they are a highly motile mesenchymal cell type, and express both Cx43α1 and N-cadherin. Analyses by immunohistochemistry, and coimmunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting indicated that Cx43α1 and N-cadherin are coassembled in a large multiprotein complex. Consistent with this, siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Cx43α1 or N-cadherin resulted in the apparent loss of both proteins from the cell surface. Surface biotinylation and pulse chase experiments showed that cell surface trafficking of Cx43α1 is blocked with siRNA-mediated N-cadherin knockdown. However, siRNA knockdown of p120, a N-cadherin-associated protein known to modulate cell surface turnover of N-cadherin (25Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), eliminated cell surface expression of N-cadherin without affecting Cx43α1 expression. This suggests that the cell surface turnover of N-cadherin may be regulated independently of Cx43α1. We also found with either N-cadherin or Cx43α1 knockdown, not only was gap junctional communication reduced, but cell motility was inhibited. This is consistent with the observed loss of both gap junction and cell adhesion contacts with either knockdown. Overall, these studies indicate that the intracellular coassembly of connexin and cadherin is required for gap junction and adherens junction formation. This process of coassembly likely accounts for the intimate linkage between gap junction and adherens junction formation, a process that is also functionally important in the modulation of cell motility. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal Cx43α1 antibodies used for coimmunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting were from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (P2C4), and from Chemicon. Rabbit polyclonal Cx43α1 antibody used for immunoblotting was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal Cx43α1 antibody (18A-8) used for immunofluorescence microscopy was a generous gift from Dr. Elliot Hertzberg (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to N-cadherin, ZO-1, GST, and rabbit polyclonal antibody to ZO-1 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against His tag, β-catenin, p120, N-cadherin, FAK, and paxillin were purchased from BD Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to α- and β-catenin were purchased from Sigma. Secondary antibodies used included mouse monoclonal, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Biosciences), anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), and FITC- or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Normal mouse or rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Immunohistochemistry—NIH3T3 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min or 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.15% Triton X-100 for 10 min, then washed and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation in FITC- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. Epifluorescence was carried out on a Leica DMRE microscope with a ×63 PL oil objective and imaged using an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu). Z stacks comprised of 0.2-μm optical slices were obtained and deconvolved using Volocity iterative deconvolution algorithm (Improvision, Ltd.). All images shown in this study are derived from merging 3 deconvolved optical sections. Immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblotting—NIH3T3 cells were harvested and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing complete protease inhibitors (no. 8140, Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Lysates were precleared using protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with desired antibodies (10 μg) bound to protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for overnight, washed extensively with cold RIPA buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was electroblotted and processed for chemiluminescence detection using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For some experiments, cells were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 24 h prior to lysis in RIPA buffer, followed by immunoblotting analysis. Construction and Purification of His- and GST-tagged Fusion Proteins—To generate His-tagged Cx43α1 CT-expressing vector, cDNA encoding the CT domain of Cx43α1 (amino acids 227–382) was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CCGGAATTCGCGCTCTTCTATGTCTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAATCTCCAGGTCATCAGGC-3′, and ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pET28a vector (Novagen). The recombinant vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS, and the fusion protein was purified as previously described (26Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12725-12731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To generate GST-tagged fusion containing the CT domain of N-cadherin (amino acids 753–904), the cDNA for mouse N-cadherin (kindly provided by Dr. Glenn L. Radice, University of Pennsylvania) was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CCGGAATTCATGCGCCAAGCCAAGCAGCTTTTAATTGAC-3′and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTCGTCACCACCGCCGTACATGTCCGC-3′, and the resulting PCR fragment was inserted into the EcoR I/XhoI sites of pGEX-T4–1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). After expression in E. coli DH5α, GST-tagged fusion proteins was purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Binding Assay—Purified GST-tagged N-cadherin CT (GST-N-cad-CT, bait) was immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce), and after extensive washing, was incubated with previously purified His-tagged Cx43α1-CT (His-Cx43α1-CT, prey) for 2 h at 4 °C. His-Cx43α1-CT was also incubated with the glutathione beads as prey control, and GST-glutathione beads were used as bait control. Bound GST or GST-N-cad-CT fusion proteins was eluted in elution buffer (50 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a GST antibody. siRNA-mediated Knockdown—For siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin, siRNAs (Dharmacon, Inc.) were synthesized containing nucleotides 143–163 (AACAGTCTGCCTTTCGCTGTA) and 859–879 (AAGCTGGTCACTGGTGACAGA) of the mouse Cx43α1 coding sequence, and nucleotides 139–159 (AAGGATGTGCACGAAGGACAG) and 1049–1069 (AAGCCACAGACATGGAAGGCA) of the mouse N-cadherin coding sequence. Scrambled siRNAs contained the same sequences except for 3 mismatched nucleotides (for Cx43α1: AACAGTATGCCGTTCGCCGTA, and AAGCTGTTCGCTGGGGACAGA; for N-cadherin: AAGGATGGGAACGCAGGACAG, and AAGCCACGGCCATAGAAGGCA). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used to transfect NIH3T3 cells with the siRNAs for immunofluorescence microscopy and Western immunoblotting. For time lapse videomicroscopy, cells were electroporated with siRNAs and a GFP expression vector, pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Inc.), using Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R (Amaxa Biosystems). Alternatively, siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed using a mammalian expression vector directing intracellular synthesis of siRNA-like transcripts (27Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). They were made by inserting into pSuper.neo+gfp vector (OligoEngine), an oligonucleotide sequence corresponding to mouse Cx43α1 (CAGTCTGCCTTTCGCTGTA), p120 (CGAAGTTATCGCTGAGAAC), or N-cadherin (GCCACAGACATGGAAGGCA). We also generated control plasmids with 3 nucleotide mismatches in the 19-nucleotide targeting sequences. Dye Coupling Assay—NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with Cx43α1 or N-cadherin siRNAs and a pDsRed2-N1 expression vector (Clontech, Inc.), and used 48 h after transfection. Prior to microelectrode impalements, cells were transferred to L-15 medium (with l-glutamine, Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C on the heated stage of Leica DM-LFSA microscope equipped with a ×40 objective. Dark field Cy3 imaging was used to locate DsRed-containing cells, and these were dye-injected while being monitored using a FITC filter. Micropipettes were backfilled with 2% 6-carboxyfluorescein, and ionotophoretic injection was carried out using 1 nA current pulses of 0.5-s duration at 1 Hz for 1 min. Following injection, a post-impalement DIC image was collected, and passive dye spread was recorded for another 2 min. Dye spread was quantitated by counting total number of dye filled cells and calculating percentage of dye-filled primary neighbors (directly adjacent to injected cell), secondary neighbors (adjacent to primary neighbors), and ternary neighbors (adjacent to secondary neighbors). Pulse Chase and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Pulse chase experiments were performed as described with minor modifications (28Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with Cx43α1 or N-cadherin siRNAs were plated on 6-cm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 40 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine for 30 min, followed by labeling with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min before chase. Biotinylation of cell surface Cx43α1 was performed by incubating cells with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cx43α1 was precipitated from cell lysates using Cx43α1 antibody and biotinylated Cx43α1 was recovered by streptavidin-coated agarose beads (25Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Time Lapse Videomicroscopy and Motion Analysis—For time lapse videomicroscopy, cells were maintained at 37 °C in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and visualized using Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope with a ×63 objective. Images were captured every 2 min over a 1-h interval using an ORCA-ER camera. Motion analysis was carried out using Dynamic Image Analysis Software (Solltech, Inc.) to compute: area, perimeter, roundness (100× 4π (area/perimeter2)) (29Stites J. Wessels D. Uhl A. Egelhoff T. Shutt D. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 31-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), speed, directionality (net path length divided by total path length), positive flow (percentage cell area in later images not overlapping earlier image), and negative flow (percentage cell area in earlier image not overlapping later image). Data were analyzed using Student's t test with Prism 3 (GraphPad). Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we examined the distribution of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin in NIH3T3 cells. As expected, both proteins are localized in punctate spots at cell-cell contact sites along cell processes. Double immunolabeling with antibodies to Cx43α1 and N-cadherin showed regions of cell surface colocalization (Fig. 1 panel a). A similar pattern of colocalization was observed for Cx43α1 and p120, β-catenin, and ZO-1 (Fig. 1, panels b–d). These results indicate a close association between Cx43α1, N-cadherin, and N-cadherin-interacting proteins in NIH3T3 cells. This is consistent with the results of previous studies in other cell types (24Xu X. Li W.E. Huang G.Y. Meyer R. Chen T. Luo Y. Thomas M.P. Radice G.L. Lo C.W. J.

Immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting experiments were carried out to further characterize the interactions between Cx43α1 and N-cadherin (Fig. 1, panels e and g). Immunoprecipitations with a Cx43α1 antibody followed by Western immunoblotting with a Cx43α1 antibody yielded a predominant 43-kDa band, the molecular mass expected for Cx43α1 (Fig. 1, panel g). Immunodetection using antibodies to N-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, and p120 showed that each of these proteins also coimmunoprecipitated with Cx43α1 (Fig. 1, panel e). In contrast, immunoblot analysis of Cx43α1 immunoprecipitates with antibodies to paxillin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), two proteins found at focal complexes, showed neither proteins were associated with Cx43α1 (Fig. 1, panel f). To further examine the specificity of the interactions detected in the Cx43α1 immunoprecipitates, reciprocal experiments were carried out involving immunoprecipitations using antibodies to either N-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, p120, or ZO-1. This was followed by Western immunoblotting using a Cx43α1 antibody (Fig. 1, panel g). These studies showed that Cx43α1 was indeed coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies to N-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, p120, or ZO-1. Together these results indicate that Cx43α1 is localized in a large multiprotein complex containing N-cadherin and many N-cadherin-interacting proteins. GST and His-tagged Fusion Protein Analyses—To investigate if there is a direct protein-protein interaction between Cx43α1 and N-cadherin, we generated fusion proteins for affinity protein binding assays consisting of GST-tagged CT domain of N-cadherin (GST-N-cad-CT) and His-tagged CT domain of Cx43α1 (His-Cx43α1-CT) (Fig. 1, panel h). We focused our analysis on the CT domain of Cx43α1, as this region is known to mediate Cx43α1 binding of ZO-1 and β-catenin (26Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol.

Investig. 2000; 105: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose beads loaded with GST-N-cad-CT bait were incubated with His-Cx43α1-CT prey (Fig. 1, panel h, lane 6). Protein bound to the beads were eluted and examined by Western immunoblotting using a His tag antibody. As bait control, His-Cx43α1-CT was incubated with glutathione beads loaded with GST (Fig. 1, panel h, lane 5), whereas prey control consisted of glutathione beads incubated with His-Cx43α1-CT alone (Fig. 1, panel h, lane 4). Additional controls consisted of the glutathione beads alone or glutathione beads incubated with bovine serum albumin (Fig. 1, panel h, lanes 2 and 3). Although we found that the GST-N-cad-CT-loaded beads did pull-down a small amount of His-Cx43α1-CT fusion protein (Fig. 1, panel h), this was also observed in the prey and bait controls (Fig. 1, panel h, lane 6 versus lanes 4 and 5). Three independent experiments showed no consistent difference between the experimental versus control samples, suggesting that there is little or no specific interaction between the CT domains of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin. To investigate this further, we carried out pull-down assays performed in reverse, i.e. with GST-N-cad-CT serving as prey, and His-Cx43α1-CT as bait. These studies also showed no direct interaction between the CT domains of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin (data not shown). We also performed GST-Cx43α1-CT affinity binding assays using total cell lysates as prey, and again found no evidence for N-cadherin binding (data not shown). Finally, Far-Western blotting was carried out using total protein extracts prepared from adult mouse heart, a tissue containing Cx43α1 and N-cadherin in abundance. The heart extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, then incubated with GST-Cx43α1-CT. Immunodetection with a GST antibody showed no band in the position corresponding to N-cadherin (data not shown). Overall, these experiments suggest no direct interaction between the CT domains of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin. siRNA Knockdown of Cx43α1 and N-cadherin—We used siRNA knockdown approaches to further evaluate interactions between Cx43α1 and N-cadherin. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with two siRNAs targeting different regions of N-cadherin. Such transfected cells showed virtually no detectable N-cadherin when immunostained with an N-cadherin antibody (Fig. 2A). Western immunoblotting showed >80% decrease in N-cadherin protein abundance (top row in Fig. 2B). In contrast, scrambled siRNAs had no effect when compared with control mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Double immunostaining showed that cells depleted of N-cadherin had little or no cell surface Cx43α1 immunolabeling, but this was accompanied by a striking intracellular accumulation of Cx43α1 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this, immunoblotting analysis using either a monoclonal antibody (P2C4) that detected predominantly the nonphosphorylated form of Cx43α1 (NP) (Fig. 2B, upper panel), or a polyclonal antibody (Sigma) that detected both phosphorylated (PO) and nonphosphorylated Cx43α1 (Fig. 2B, lower panel), showed no change in the overall abundance of Cx43α1 after N-cadherin siRNA treatment (Fig. 2B). To determine if the loss of Cx43α1 may reciprocally perturb N-cadherin cell surface expression, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with two siRNAs targeting different regions of Cx43α1. Immunostaining showed a marked reduction in Cx43α1 expression (Fig. 3A), with >80% reduction in Cx43α1 protein abundance indicated by Western immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 3B). In contrast, two scrambled siRNAs had no effect (Fig. 3, A and B). When Cx43α1 siRNA-treated cells were double-immunostained with Cx43α1 and N-cadherin antibodies, N-cadherin was observed predomi"

Recently, PI(4,5)P2 was shown to form microdomains in the plasma membrane. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the spatial organization of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and exocytotic machineries in clonal rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Both PI(4,5)P2 and syntaxin, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein essential for exocytosis, exhibited punctate clusters in isolated plasma membranes. The number of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains colocalizing with syntaxin clusters and large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) was decreased after catecholamine release. Alternatively, the expression of type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5KI) increased the number of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains at syntaxin clusters with docked LDCVs and enhanced exocytotic activity, possibly by increasing the number of release sites. About half of the PI(4,5)P2 microdomains were not colocalized with Thy-1, a specific marker of lipid rafts, and the colocalization of transfected PIP5KI with syntaxin clusters was observed. These results suggest that the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains at syntaxin clusters with docked LDCVs is essential for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.

These results suggest that the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains at syntaxin clusters with docked LDCVs is essential for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis is a cellular mechanism for the secretion of various bioactive substances such as neurotransmitters and hormones. In response to intracellular Ca2+ elevation, fusion of the secretory vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane causes a release of its contents into the extracellular space (1Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that the complex formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins, syntaxin and 25-kDa synaptosome-associated protein, in the plasma membrane and vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 in the secretory vesicle membrane, are essential for exocytosis (2Chen Y.A.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological and biochemical studies showed that the Ca2+-dependent exocytotic process could be dissected into multiple steps, and different sets of proteins are likely to be involved in each step (4Bittner M.A. Holz R.W.

ATP-dependent priming was recognized as an essential step prior to Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion to acquire Ca2+ sensitivity of the fusion step (7Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Peppers S.C. Senter R.A.

Overexpression of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase Cδ, which binds to PI(4,5)P2 with a high affinity (12Balla T. Bondeva T. Varnai P. Trends Pharmacol.

Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), markedly inhibited the exocytosis of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in adrenal chromaffin cells, possibly by reducing PI(4,5)P2 availability in the plasma membrane (14Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the overexpression of constitutive active Arf6, an activator of PIP5KI, induced the accumulation of PIP5KI in the endosomal membrane and in turn the depletion of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane, resulting in the inhibition of exocytosis (15Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). All of these results suggest that the generation of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane is crucial for the step preceding Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion. It has become generally accepted that lipids in the plasma membrane are not homogeneously distributed and form various microdomains. The most well characterized lipid microdomain is a detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-dependent microdomain, termed a lipid raft. The lipid raft might play important roles in a variety of biological functions by accumulating various sets of proteins to facilitate the efficacy of signal transduction, focal regulation of cytoskeleton, and membrane traffic (16Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 17Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 18Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently, Laux et al.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) showed that PI(4,5)P2 also formed microdomains in the plasma membrane, and at least part of these microdomains was colocalized with the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a protein enriched in the lipid raft, and involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Biochemical studies also revealed that about half of cellular PI(4,5)P2 was recovered in lipid raft-enriched fractions in discontinuous sucrose density gradient fractionation, suggesting that part of PI(4,5)P2 was concentrated in lipid raft microdomains (20Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Casey L. Pike L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to exocytosis, PI(4,5)P2 is also essential for diverse cellular functions, including the production of second messengers, endocytosis, and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Since these phenomena are likely to occur in a distinct region in the plasma membrane, PI(4,5)P2 might be localized in various distinct microdomains to participate in different cellular functions (22Janmey P.A. Xian W. Flanagan L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Czech M.P.

In this study, we investigated the spatial correlation between PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and exocytotic machineries in the isolated and intact plasma membrane of PC12 cells. We found that PI(4,5)P2 was accumulated in syntaxin clusters with docked LDCVs, and exocytotic activity was well correlated with the accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 in the exocytotic machinery. Plasmids—A DNA fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of mouse PIP5KIβ was amplified by PCR from the mouse brain cDNA library using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATAGGATCCATGGCGTCCGCCTCCTCAGGG-3′ and 5′-ATACTCGAGGTGGGTGAACTCTGACTCTGC-3′. The fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), named pBS-PIP5KIβ. The single amino acid substitution mutant K178A was constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (pBS-K178A) according to the instruction manual using the sense primer, 5′-CTTCAAGATAATGGCCTACAGCCTGTTGATG-3′ (mutation site underlined). pBS-PIP5KIβ and pBS-K178A were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to construct the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3-PIP5K and pcDNA3-K178A, respectively. To generate the construct of PH-EGFP, the PH domain of phospholipase Cδ was isolated from the PC12 cDNA library by PCR with specific primers (5′-CCGATTCGGGCATGGACTCGGGTAGGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCCTTCAGGAAGTCCTTCAGCTCC-3′) and subcloned into pEGFP (Promega, Madison, WI). A DNA fragment corresponding to the human growth hormone (hGH) gene was isolated from the pXGH5 vector and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen), known as hGH-myc. A DNA fragment corresponding to murine Arf6, generously provided by J. Rettig (Universität des Saarlandes, Hombrug/Saar, Germany), was subcloned into pBluescript, and a point mutation (Q67L) was introduced to generate the constitutive active Arf6 mutant (Arf6(QL)) (26Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) by the GeneEditor method (Promega) using the sense primer, 5′-GATGTGGGCGGCCTGGACAAGATCCGG-3′ (mutation site underlined). It was subcloned into pcDNA4-HisMax (Invitrogen) and used as the mammalian expression vector. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the identity with a designed sequence. Antibodies—An anti-PIP5KI antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide of the sequence (C) KEAEFLQKLLPGYYMNLNQ, equivalent to a common region of mouse PIP5KIα, -β, and -γ. The antibody was purified from the antiserum by affinity chromatography on antigen-conjugated Sepharose as described (27Iwasaki S. Kataoka M. Sekiguchi M. Shimazaki Y. Sato K. Takahashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sources of the antibodies were as follows: anti-PI(4,5)P2 (28Miyazawa A. Umeda M. Horikoshi T. Yanagisawa K. Yoshioka T. Inoue K. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); anti-syntaxin 1 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel); anti-chromogranin B and anti-GAP43 (BD Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY); anti-Thy-1 (Serotec, Oxford, UK); anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG3, Alexa594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab-fragmented anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cell Culture—PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 5% heat-inactivated precolostrum newborn calf serum (Mitsubishi Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. Transfection—PC12 cells were plated on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated 35-mm culture dishes at a density of 2.08 × 105 cells/cm2 or on PEI-coated coverslips at a density of 1.05 × 105 cells/cm2. After 18–24 h, cells were transfected with various vectors using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) in the presence of serum according to the instruction manual. Imaging of Membrane Sheets—For the preparation of membrane sheets, PC12 cells were plated on PEI-coated coverslips at a density of 1.05 × 105 cells/cm2 and disrupted as previously reported (29Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) using a sonicator in ice-cold sonication buffer (120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). Membrane sheets were fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and washed three times in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS) for 5 min each. They were then blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum in CMF-PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer at 4 °C. After washing three times with CMF-PBS for 5 min each, they were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer at room temperature for 1.5 h, washed three times with CMF-PBS, and then mounted with Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). For neomycin treatment, blocking buffer including 3 mm neomycin (Sigma) was used for blocking and dilution of first antibodies. Membrane sheets were observed using confocal laser microscopy, the Zeiss LSM510 with a ×100 1.4 numerical aperture plan achromate objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena GmbH, Germany). Images were captured in multitrack mode. To image living PC12 cells transfected with PH-EGFP, we employed total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (or evanescent field microscopy) as described previously (30Tsuboi T. Kikuta T. Sakurai T. Terakawa S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 172-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Quantitative Image Analysis of Colocalization—To determine the colocalization of signals corresponding to LDCVs with syntaxin or PI(4,5)P2, we used a procedure previously reported (31Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Circles were centered around the individual spots in the channel of chromogranin B or hGH-myc and then transferred to the other channel(s). If the fluorescence intensity maximum of a corresponding spot in the other channel was within 300 nm of the spot in the channel of chromogranin B or hGH-myc, it was rated as colocalized. To correct for accidental colocalization, the images of syntaxin and PI(4,5)P2 were superimposed with a mirror image of chromogranin B or hGH-myc, and colocalization was determined according to the methods of Lang et al. (31Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Background correction was performed according to the following formula: corrected colocalization = (measured colocalization – mirror image colocalization)/(1 – mirror image colocalization/100). All images were analyzed with the program written by us in Visual C++ (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Release Assay—Dopamine release from PC12 cells was determined as described (32Aoyagi K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). hGH release from PC12 cells was determined essentially as described previously (32Aoyagi K. Takahashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Ohnishi H. Yamamori S. Ono K. Aoyagi K. Kondo S. Takahashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10930-10935Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed five times with a low K+ solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, and 15 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). After washing, cells were incubated with low K+ solution for 2 min, and then the buffer was changed every 2 min with ionomycin-containing low K+ solution to stimulate Ca2+ influx or high K+ solution, which raised the KCl concentration as mentioned in the figure legends to induce depolarization and decreased NaCl concentration to maintain the osmolarity. At the end of the experiment, cells were sonicated on ice in 1 ml of chilled 1% Nonidet P-40. Secreted hGH and the content of hGH were measured using an hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Floatation Analysis—A detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-dependent raft fraction was isolated following a previous report (21Liu Y. Casey L. Pike L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were plated on PEI-coated 100-mm dishes at a density of 1.59 × 106 cells/cm2. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold CMF-PBS and once with MBS (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5), and four dishes were scraped into 2 ml of chilled lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, MES-NaOH, pH 6.5). Lysate was passed through a 23-gauge needle 10 times and then mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MBS. Two ml of the mixture were transferred into two centrifuge tubes and overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose in MBS and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C and fractionated into 1-ml fractions. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of MBS. The amount of cholesterol in each fraction was measured using a Cholesterol E-test kit (WAKO). The fractions were mixed with one-third volume of 3× sample buffer (6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.006% bromophenol blue, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 20 mm dithiothreitol and used for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on 7.5 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel equipped with 5% stacking gel. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following standard procedures with a semidry transblotting apparatus. The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST at 4 °C. After washing in TBST, membranes were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG + A + M antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk. After washing, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by SuperSignal™ (Pierce) and a luminescence image analyzer with an electronically cooled charge-coupled device camera system (LAS-1000; Fuji Photo Film Co.). PI(4,5)P2 Microdomains in the Plasma Membrane of PC12 Cells—To study the distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane of PC12 cells, membrane-sheet preparation was used as the inside-out layer of the plasma membrane with exocytotic activity (29Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown on coverslips and subjected to brief sonication to disrupt the upper part of cells, resulting in the generation of membrane sheets on the coverslips. We confirmed that membrane sheets consisted of intact lipid bilayers by staining with DiI, a lipid-soluble fluorescent dye, and were devoid of all other organelles except for docked vesicles by scanning electron microscopy (data not shown). The distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane sheets was investigated using a specific antibody to PI(4,5)P2 (AM-212) (28Miyazawa A. Umeda M. Horikoshi T. Yanagisawa K. Yoshioka T. Inoue K. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Membrane sheets were fixed with 4% PFA and then immunostained using the standard protocol with an anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody and a fluorescently labeled Fab fragments of a secondary antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, the anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody yielded numerous small clusters that were scattered over the membrane sheets. Although the specificity of anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody used in this study (AM-212) has been established in several systems (28Miyazawa A. Umeda M. Horikoshi T. Yanagisawa K. Yoshioka T. Inoue K. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we confirmed whether the AM-212 specifically recognized PI(4,5)P2 in membrane sheet preparation using neomycin, which strongly binds PI(4,5)P2 with high affinity (14Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of membrane sheets using AM-212 and anti-syntaxin antibody in the presence of neomycin demonstrated that neomycin selectively eliminated the signals derived from AM-212, clearly indicating the specificity of AM-212 for PI(4,5)P2 in membrane-sheet preparation (Fig. 1B). To further ascertain the availability of membrane sheet preparation for studying the distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane, we examined the effects of overexpression of constitutive active Arf6 mutant (Arf6(QL)), which was shown to reduce the amount of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane (15Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since the efficiency of transfection was not very high, we co-transfected myc-tagged human growth hormone (hGH-myc) to label LDCVs in Arf6(QL)-transfected PC12 cells (35Wick P.W. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, signals derived from the anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody were remarkably decreased in the membrane sheets of PC12 cells transfected with hGH-myc and Arf6(QL). Quantitative analysis revealed that PI(4,5)P2 immunoreactivity was selectively reduced in Arf6(QL)-transfected membrane sheets (Fig. 1D). These results, consistent with the previous results in intact and cracked PC12 cells (15Aikawa Y. Martin T.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicated that membrane sheet preparation was suitable to investigate the distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane. The punctate pattern of PI(4,5)P2 immunoreactivity could be detected in PFA-fixed membrane sheets; however, there remained a possibility that lipids, sphingolipid, and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins formed large aggregates in the plasma membrane due to cross-linking by the antibodies (19Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 36Mayer S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R.

To exclude such an artificial capping effect, the distribution of PI(4,5)P2 was further examined by transient transfection of EGFP-tagged PH domain of phospholipase Cδ (PH-EGFP), which selectively binds to PI(4,5)P2 in 1:1 stoichiometry (38Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 39Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, PH-EGFP also exhibited a punctate pattern similar to that observed by the anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibody over the membrane sheets of PH-EGFP-expressing PC12 cells. PI(4,5)P2 clusters existed not in LDCVs but in the plasma membrane, since no significant PI(4,5)P2 immunoreactivity was detected in the immunoisolated LDCVs (data not shown), corresponding to a previous report (14Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether these PI(4,5)P2 clusters could be observed in living PC12 cells. PH-EGFP-expressing PC12 cells on the coverslips were observed by evanescent microscopy enabling the illumination of a thin layer immediately adjacent to the coverslips (30Tsuboi T. Kikuta T. Sakurai T. Terakawa S. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 172-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Stout A. Axelrod D. Appl. Optics. 1989; 28: 5237-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Evanescent microscopy revealed that PH-EGFP could be detected as a footprint image and punctate pattern in living PC12 cells (Fig. 1F) despite the high background fluorescence possibly due to a certain amount of cytosolic PH-EGFP. These results clearly demonstrated that PI(4,5)P2 was concentrated in a specialized microdomain, termed the PI(4,5)P2 microdomain, in the plasma membrane of PC12 cells. Distribution of PI(4,5)P2 Microdomains and Exocytotic Machinery—Several studies have revealed that PI(4,5)P2 plays an important role in exocytosis, but the spatial relationship between exocytotic sites and PI(4,5)P2 microdomains is largely unknown. To examine this relationship, we investigated whether PI(4,5)P2 microdomains were colocalized with exocytotic machinery in the membrane sheets by immunostaining. Since an exocytotic reaction occurred at syntaxin clusters (29Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 41Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nishiwaki C. Kikuta T. Kumakura K. Nakamichi Y. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), membrane sheets were immunostained with specific antibodies against PI(4,5)P2 and syntaxin. LDCVs were visualized using an antibody against chromogranin B accumulated within LDCVs of PC12 cells (42Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, a number of LDCVs docked on the membrane sheets were colocalized with PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and/or syntaxin clusters. Quantitative analysis revealed that 47.6 ± 2.9% of LDCVs were colocalized with syntaxin clusters, whereas 18.0 ± 3.3% and 12.3 ± 2.5% were colocalized with PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and both PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and syntaxin clusters, respectively. Significant colocalizations of LDCVs with syntaxin clusters and PI(4,5)P2 microdomains were still obvious after correcting the overestimation due to the accidental colocalization according to the methods of Lang et al. (31Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B; 32.4 ± 3.0, 7.8 ± 1.9, and 10.3 ± 2.5% for syntaxin clusters, PI(4,5)P2 microdomains, and PI(4,5)P2 microdomains and syntaxin clusters, respectively). Although this procedure tends to underestimate the colocalization, we used it throughout this study to completely exclude the possibility of accidental colocalization. These results suggest that syntaxin clusters were not essential for the docking of LDCVs with the plasma membrane, and a significant number of LDCVs docked on syntaxin clusters were colocalized with PI(4,5)P2 microdomains. PC12 cells release dopamine in response to high K+ depolarization, but the releasing activity gradually declines during prolonged stimulation. In one typical experiment, 7.1 ± 0.1% of dopamine was released during the first 2-min stimulation, whereas 3.3 ± 0.1 and 2.7 ± 0.1% of dopamine was released during the subsequent second and third 2-min stimulations, respectively (data not shown), possibly due to the depletion of fusion-competent secretory vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W2153117162,"Mutation S218L in the Ca(V)2.1 alpha(1) subunit of P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels produces a severe clinical phenotype in which typical attacks of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) triggered by minor head trauma are followed, after a lucid interval, by deep (even fatal) coma and long lasting severe cerebral edema. We investigated the functional consequences of this mutation on human Ca(V)2.1 channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in neurons from Ca(V)2.1 alpha(1)(-/-) mice by combining single channel and whole cell patch clamp recordings. Mutation S218L produced a shift to lower voltages of the single channel activation curve and a consequent increase of both single channel and whole cell Ba(2+) influx in both neurons and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Compared with the other FHM-1 mutants, the S218L shows one of the largest gains of function, especially for small depolarizations, which are insufficient to open the wild-type channel. S218L channels open at voltages close to the resting potential of many neurons. Moreover, the S218L mutation has unique effects on the kinetics of inactivation of the channel because it introduces a large component of current that inactivates very slowly, and it increases the rate of recovery from inactivation. During long depolarizations at voltages that are attained during cortical spreading depression, the extent of inactivation of the S218L channel is considerably smaller than that of the wild-type channel. We discuss how the unique combination of a particularly slow inactivation during cortical spreading depression and a particularly low threshold of channel activation might lead to delayed severe cerebral edema and coma after minor head trauma."

In this study, a Triton X-100/phosphatidylcholine (PC) mixed micelle assay was utilized to determine the kinetics and specificity of this lipid-enzyme interaction. Using this assay, the addition of C-1-P induced a dramatic increase in the activity of cPLA2α (>15-fold) with a Ka of 2.4 mol % C-1-P/Triton X-100 micelle. This activation was highly specific as the addition of other lipids had insignificant effects on cPLA2α activity. Studies using surface-dilution kinetics revealed that C-1-P had no effect on the Michaelis-Menten constant, KmB, but decreased the dissociation constant (K As) value by 87%. Thus, C-1-P not only increases the membrane affinity of cPLA2α but also may act as an allosteric activator of the enzyme. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the C-1-P/cPLA2α interaction verified a decrease in the dissociation constant, demonstrating that cPLA2α bound PC vesicles containing C-1-P with increased affinity (5-fold) compared with PC vesicles alone. The effect on the dissociation rate of cPLA2α was also found to be lipid-specific with the exception of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which caused a modest increase in vesicle affinity (2-fold). Lastly, the binding site for C-1-P was determined to be within the C2-domain of cPLA2α, unlike phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These data demonstrate a novel interaction site for C-1-P and suggest that C-1-P may function to recruit cPLA2α to intracellular membranes as well as allosterically activate the membrane-associated enzyme.

However, the specific membrane lipids that regulate the association of this domain with membranes, especially at low cellular calcium concentration (e.g. submicromolar), have yet to be defined (4Clark J.D.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar).One possible candidate for an activator of cPLA2α was hypothesized from an unlikely source. The main component of the venom from Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider) is the enzyme sphingomyelinase D (11Kurpiewski G. Forrester L.J. Barrett J.T. Campbell B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to produce ceramide 1-phosphate (C-1-P). The pathology of a wound generated from the bite of this spider consists of an intense inflammatory response mediated by AA and prostaglandins (12Carbonaro P.A. Janniger C.K. Schwartz R.A. Cutis. 1995; 56: 256-259PubMed Google Scholar, 13Arnold R.E. JACEP. 1976; 5: 262-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 14Rees R.S. Gates C. Timmons S. Des Prez R.M. King Jr., L.E. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the production of endogenous C-1-P by the action of sphingomyelinase D correlated with phospholipase A2 activation, suggesting that C-1-P may act as an endogenous and proximal activator of a PLA2 species.C-1-P is a new addition to a growing group of bioactive sphingolipids, which include ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate. C-1-P is generated in mammalian cells by the phosphorylation of ceramide at the 1-position by the enzyme ceramide kinase, and recently, our laboratory reported (15Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Spiegel S. Roddy P. Hannun Y.A. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38206-38213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that ceramide kinase is an upstream mediator of calcium ionophore- and IL-1β-induced AA release. In a separate study, the mechanism by which C-1-P induced AA release was determined. Our laboratory showed that C-1-P activated cPLA2α in cells inducing the translocation of the enzyme to the Golgi apparatus and perinuclear membranes (1Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Subramanian P.

C-1-P was found to specifically and dramatically enhance the activity of cPLA2α, acting as a positive allosteric activator. Surface dilution kinetics coupled with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology also demonstrated that C-1-P regulated the association of cPLA2α with PC-rich micelles/vesicles. Furthermore, the presented study clearly shows that C-1-P interacts with cPLA2α via a previously undescribed binding site, thereby validating C-1-P as a novel activator of cPLA2α.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (POPA), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), cardiolipin, cholesterol, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P), and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. The purity of the lipids used was >99%. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns-5-P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 were a kind gift from Dr. Karol S. Bruzik and synthesized as described elsewhere (16Kubiak R. Bruzik K.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 2415-2418Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Triton X-100, octyl glucoside, and CHAPS were from Sigma and Pierce. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by a modified Bartlett analysis (17Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 114-115Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases and enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Ceramide 1-phosphate was prepared according to the published method by direct phosphorylation of d-erythro-C18:1-ceramide in 37% yield and >95% purity as determined by thin layer chromatography, 1H NMR, 31P NMR, and mass spectrometry analysis (18Byun H.S. Erkulla R.K. Bittman R. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 6495-6498Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Recombinant Expression of cPLA2α—Recombinant human cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) was expressed in Sf9 cells with a His6 tag using a baculovirus expression system and purified using a modified protocol as previously described (19Das S.

Sf9 cells were grown in suspension culture and infected with high titer recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and 72 h post-infection. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 1160 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a hand-held homogenizer. The cells were broken by 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 85,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was batch-bound to 80 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 60 min. The resin was captured over a Buchner funnel and suspended in 80 ml of Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 m KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and packed in a 5.0-cm-diameter column at 8.0 ml/min. The column was washed with 455 ml of Buffer 1 at 8.0 ml/min followed by wash with 360 ml of Buffer 2 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 15 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) at 8 ml/min and a final wash with 270 ml of Buffer, 3 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) at 8 ml/min. The column was then eluted with 200 ml of Buffer 4 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) at 8 ml/min. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing significant amounts of cPLA2α were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 30% glycerol). The dialyzed material was then centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 30 min to remove precipitate and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and dispensed in 5-ml aliquots.Mixed Micelle Assay for cPLA2α—cPLA2α activity was measured in a PC-mixed micelle assay in a standard buffer composed of 80 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm free Ca2+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The assay also contained 0.3 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphotidylcholine (PAPC) with 250,000 dpm of [14C]PAPC, 2 mm Triton X-100, 26% glycerol, and 500 ng of purified cPLA2 protein in a total volume of 200 μl. To prepare the substrate, an appropriate volume of cold PAPC in chloroform, indicated phospholipids, and [14C]PAPC in toluene/ethanol 1:1 solution were evaporated under nitrogen. Triton X-100 was added to the dried lipid to give a 4-fold concentrated substrate solution (1.2 mm PAPC). The solution was probe sonicated on ice (1min on, 1 min off for 3 min). The reaction was initiated by adding 500 ng of the enzyme and was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of Dole reagent (2-propanol, heptane, 0.5 m H2SO4; 400:100:20, v/v/v). The amount of [14C]AA produced was determined using the Dole procedure as previously described (21Ulevitch R.J. Watanabe Y. Sano M. Lister M.D. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3079-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the assays were conducted for 45 min at 37 °C with the exception of those presented for various times in Fig. 1. Statistical and kinetic analysis was performed using Sigma-Plot Enzyme Kinetics software, version 1.1, from SYSSTAT software, Inc.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—All of the SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C. A detailed protocol for coating the L1 sensor chip has been described elsewhere (22Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After washing the sensor chip surface, 90 μl of vesicles containing various phospholipids were injected at 5 μl/min to give a response of 6000 resonance units (RU). An uncoated flow channel was used as a control surface. Under our experimental conditions, no binding was detected to this control surface beyond the refractive index change for either the C2 domain or cPLA2α (24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH three times at 100 μl/min. Typically, no decrease in lipid signal was seen after the first injection. Kinetic SPR measurements were done at the flow rate of 30 μl/min. 90 μl of protein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl and varying [Ca2+] was injected to give an association time of 90 s, whereas the dissociation was monitored for 500 s or more. The lipid surface was regenerated using 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH. After sensorgrams were obtained for five different concentrations of each protein within a 10-fold range of Kd, each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. The association and dissociation phases of all of the sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein binding site on vesicle) ↔ (complex) using BIAevalutation 3.0 software (Biacore) as described previously (22Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Stahelin R.V.

The dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated from the equation, Kd = kd/ka. Equilibrium (steady-state) SPR measurements were performed with the flow rate of 5 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the R values of the association phase to reach saturating response values (Req). Req values were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the Kd value was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation, Req = Rmax/(1 + Kd/C). Mass transport (27Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 28Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was not a limiting factor in our experiments, because change in flow rate (from 2 to 60 μl/min) did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation. After curve fitting, residual plots and χ2 values were checked to verify the validity of the binding model. Each data set was repeated three times to calculate a standard deviation value. The interaction of cPLA2 with PC and PC/C-1-P was independent of the His6 tag as determined by SPR (see Supplemental Table I).RESULTSCeramide 1-Phosphate Is a Potent Activator of cPLA2α—Our laboratory has previously shown that C-1-P activated cPLA2α in vitro using a mixed vesicle-based assay (1Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Subramanian P. Wijesinghe D.S. Maceyka M. Leslie C.C. Evans J.H. Freiberg J. Roddy P. Hannun Y.A. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A main problem with this mixed vesicle-based assay was the complexity of kinetics that hampered the robust determination of kinetic parameters in the absence and presence of C-1-P. Therefore, it was difficult to quantitatively assess the effect of C-1-P on cPLA2α activity. To overcome this problem, we employed a mixed micelle assay in this study. There are several other rationales for now using the detergent mixed micelle assay. First, Triton X-100 micelles provide an inert surface for cPLA2 containing an average of 140 molecules/micelle, Mr = 95,000. The size of the micelles is relatively independent of ionic strength and temperature within the physiological range (29Lichtenberg D. Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 30Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Accts. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 251-258Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Robson R.J. Dennis E.A.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixed micelles up to 20 mol % phospholipids are similar in structure to pure Triton X-100 micelles but proportionally larger (29Lichtenberg D. Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 30Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Accts. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 251-258Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, pure Triton X-100 micelles do not co-exist with mixed micelles. Lastly, a clear advantage of this kinetic system is that cPLA2α activity remains linear for at least 60 min (Fig. 1). The introduction of 5 mol % d-e-C18:1 ceramide 1-phosphate into the Triton X-100 micelles induced a dramatic increase in cPLA2α activity (>15-fold) without affecting the linearity of the mixed-micelle assay (Fig. 1). Thus, ceramide 1-phosphate is a potent activator of cPLA2α, dramatically increasing the catalytic activity of the enzyme.The Stoichiometry of the cPLA2α/Ceramide 1-Phosphate Interaction—A mixed micelle assay also has another advantage over mixed-vesicle assays in that mixed micelles provide a homogeneous, physically defined system to investigate stoichiometry and specificity of cPLA2α activation by lipids. Taking advantage of this system, Fig. 2 demonstrates that the activation of cPLA2α by ceramide 1-phosphate was saturatable and significant activation was observed with as little as 0.5 mol % d-e-C18:1 ceramide 1-phosphate. Maximal activation of cPLA2α was observed with micelles containing >4.0 mol % d-e-C18:1 ceramide 1-phosphate (>5.6 molecules of C-1-P/micelle) with a Ka of 2.4 mol % (3.4 molecules of C-1-P/micelle). Comparing the number of micelles to the number of molecules of cPLA2α in the reaction revealed a ratio of 1 micelle/2 molecules of cPLA2α. This implies that cPLA2α interacts with two or more molecules of ceramide 1-phosphate to achieve full activation.Fig. 2The stoichiometry of the activation of cPLA2α by C-1-P. Recombinant cPLA2α (0.5 μg) was assayed in the presence of various mol % d-e-C18:1 ceramide 1-phosphate ([C-1-P]/[Triton X-100 + PC + C-1-P]) for 45 min at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mol % PC was fixed at 15 mol% [Triton X-100 + PC + C-1-P].

Cell Biol. 1998; 40: 171-182Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 can cleave Bid to form truncated (t)Bid that then translocates from the cytosol to mitochondrial membranes causing cytochrome c release (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R.

Furthermore, like various other apoptotic stimuli, including CD95, UV light activates acid as well as neutral sphingomyelinases (15Komatsu M. Takahashi T. Abe T. Takahashi I. Ida H. Takada G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the activation of sphingomyelinases (SMases) by apoptotic stimuli is well established and evidence has been accumulated for their role in apoptosis (16Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J.

Acta. 2002; 1585: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), the precise molecular mechanisms of SMase pro-apoptotic action remained ill-defined and in dispute (20Hofmann K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Despite this variety of established UV light-induced signaling pathways, there are gaps in our understanding of the rapid induction of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic function that appears to be an important hallmark of the UV light response (21Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondria is known to be regulated by the family of Bcl2 proteins (22Kroemer G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Reed J.C. Jürgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The Bcl2 family consists of anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl2 but also includes pro-apoptotic members such as Bax. Bax can induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and represents an important relay of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and subsequent activation of caspases (24Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In apoptotic cells, Bax is translocated from the cytosol to the mitochondria, undergoes a conformational change, oligomerizes, and inserts into the mitochondrial outer membrane by which it triggers the cytochrome c release and gains its pro-apoptotic activity (25Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 26Gross A. Jockel J. Wie M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic action of Bax is antagonized by Bcl2 and Bcl-XL, which inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (23Reed J.C. Jürgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, Bax is a soluble monomeric protein present in the cytosol or loosely associated with mitochondria (27Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 271-278Crossref Google Scholar). On isolated mitochondria, Bax monomers do not trigger the release of cytochrome c, whereas Bax oligomers do (27Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 271-278Crossref Google Scholar). In order to oligomerize, Bax is suggested to undergo first a conformational change, which can be demonstrated in cell lysates using detergents like Triton X-100 (28Hsu Y.T. Youle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis with conformationally sensitive antibodies revealed conformational change of Bax in apoptotic cells stimulated by different apoptotic agents including CD95 ligand (29Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), TNF (30Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 1: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (177) Google Scholar), protein kinase C inhibitors like staurosporine (STS) (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 7: 750-757Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), anti-microtubule agents like Epothilon B analogues (32Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar), and fludarabine/dexamethasone (33Bellosillo B. Villamor N. Lopez-Guillermo A. Marce S. Bosch F. Campo E. Montserrat E. Colomer D. Blood. 2002; 100: 1810-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of Bax conformational change is viewed as a key regulatory step initiating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Upon apoptotic induction, Bax conformational change takes place as an early event and is suggested to be a result of the action of BH3 (Bcl2 homology)-only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins such as Bim (32Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar), Bid (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), and Bad (34Tafani M. Minchenko D.A. Serroni A. Farber J.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2459-2466PubMed Google Scholar). Although BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl2 members induce the conformational change of Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins like Bcl2, Bcl2 homolog adenovirus-encoded gene products E1B 19K, and Bcl-XL are known to inhibit this process (26Gross A. Jockel J. Wie M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar).The precise UV light-mediated pro-apoptotic mechanisms acting upstream of and targeting mitochondria are less well understood. Here we provide evidence that UV light rapidly induces Bax conformational change, which is accompanied by the mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and Smac. We show that the UV light-induced Bax activation pathway can be dissected from that triggered by CD95 ligation or STS. UV light-induced Bax activation is not sensitive to inhibition of either caspases-8 and -3 or cathepsin D. By using two types of ASMase-deficient cells from Niemann Pick disease type A patients, we found that ASMase is indispensable for UV light-induced Bax activation. In these genetically defined ASMase-deficient cells, Bax activation is restored by stable or transient expression of human ASMase as well as by exogenous ceramide. The activation of Bax by ceramide is abrogated in Bcl2-overexpressing cells, indicating that ceramide itself does not exert direct mitochondrial release activity. Finally, Bax activation by ASMase and ceramide was observed in isolated mitochondria but not in cytosolic fractions, localizing the critical step of UV light-induced Bax conformational change at the mitochondrial membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Materials—HeLa, Bcl2-HeLa, and NPD fibroblasts (provided by Dr. Sandhoff, Bonn, Germany, 35) were cultured in DMEM and Jurkat, MS1418, and ASM-MS1418 lymphoblasts (originally obtained from Dr. D. Green, San Diego) (36Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D.R. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar); cells were cultured in VLE RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin, and 100 units ml-1 penicillin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Apoptosis was induced by exposing cells to 10 mJ cm(2)-1 UV light (253-255 nm) or by incubating cells with 0.5 μm STS (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany) or 20 ng ml-1 CD95 antibody (clone CH11) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Eching, Germany). Caspase activity was blocked by a 1-h pretreatment of cells with 20 μm Z-VAD(Ome)-FMK and/or 2 μm DEVD-CHO (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany). C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine, d-erythro), C6-ceramide (N-hexanoylsphingosine, d-erythro), C8-ceramide (N-octanoylsphingosine, d-erythro), and C16-ceramide (N-palmitoylsphingosine, d-erythro) were obtained from Biomol (Germany). Dihydro-C16-ceramide (N-palmitoyl,d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine) (dh-C16) was purchased from Sigma. Ceramides were suspended in dodecane/ethanol (2:98, v/v; 0.05% final concentration), and cells were treated with 50 μm C16-ceramide or dh-C16-ceramide, and mitochondria were treated with ceramide analogues at 2 μm (37Paris F.

MitoTracker (RedCMXRos) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for human caspase-9 and -8, human Bax, Bid, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Bax (clone 6A7 and clone 3) (28Hsu Y.T. Youle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), cytochrome c, Smac, and Bcl2 were obtained from BD Biosciences. Goat anti-ASMase antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase conjugates of anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies, and signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Fractionation and Cell-free Systems—The subcellular fractionation was performed as described (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar, 31Kashkar H. Krönke M. Jürgensmeier J.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 7: 750-757Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold cytosolic buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μm cytochalasin B, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors; complete mixture, Roche Diagnostics), and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cells were then cracked by passing through a 27-gauge needle or by Dounce homogenizer with 20 strokes, and cell breakage was verified microscopically using trypan blue exclusion. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets contain nuclei, cellular debris, and intact cells, whereas the supernatants contain the cytosol, including mitochondria. Supernatants were centrifuged for an additional 10 min at 800 × g and at 4 °C to remove any residual cellular debris. Mitochondria were separated by spinning at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then washed by pre-chilled cytosolic buffer. The supernatant was additionally centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any residual mitochondria, and the resulting cytosolic fraction was recovered. Mitochondria were then lysed by CHAPS and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and supernatants (mitochondrial fraction) were stored at -20 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing 107 cells in 1 ml of CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, protease inhibitors; complete mixture) on ice for 30 min. The crude lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. The purity of mitochondria was monitored by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, cytochrome c, cathepsin D, and actin.Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell extract (107 cells ml-1) and mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions derived from 5 × 107 cells were used for immunoprecipitation. The KCl concentration of the lysates was adjusted to 150 mm, and all samples were brought to a final volume of 500 μl of CHAPS lysis buffer with a 1% final concentration of CHAPS. Samples were rotated for 12 h at 4 °C with 6 μg of monoclonal anti-Bax 6A7 antibody (Pharmingen). Antigen-antibody complexes were immobilized by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The complexes were pelleted (1 min, 14,000 × g) and the supernatant removed. The complexes were then washed three times with the same buffer used for the immunoprecipitation (CHAPS lysis buffer, 150 mm KCl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above.Immunofluorescence—Cells were either exposed to UV light (10 mJ cm(2)-1) or incubated with 0.5 μm STS or ceramide (20 μm) and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% sodium azide, 4 μlml-1 gelatin (45% Teleostean gelatin), and 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min. For immunostaining, cells were incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 h, washed with 0.1% saponin in PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 and/or Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μgml-1 PBS), mounted on glass slides, and examined using a fluorescence microscope.SMase Assays—Activation of neutral and acidic SMase after UV treatment was measured as described recently (39Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in two distinct buffer systems as described, and equal amounts of protein (between 15 and 50 μg) were added to 52.25 μl of reaction buffer (250 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 5.0)) for ASMase measurements. [N-methyl-14C]Sphingomyelin (56 mCi mmol-1) was added (1.1 μCi ml-1 final concentration), and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. SMase activity was quantified by counting released [14C]phosphorylcholine using a β-counter.DNA Constructs and RNA Interference—Open reading frames of genes encoding human Bcl2 and Smac were amplified by PCR using Bcl2 primers containing HindIII/ApaI restriction sites and Smac primers containing XhoI/BamHI restriction sites and HeLa cDNA library as template. PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes, and the digested DNA fragments were ligated to pEGFP-C3 (N-terminal fusion of GFP to Bcl2, GFP-Bcl2) and pEGFP-N3 (C-terminal fusion of GFP to Smac, Smac-GFP), respectively, using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli (one shot, Invitrogen), and transformants were selected, and isolated recombinant DNA plasmids were examined by DNA sequence analysis. Double-stranded (ds) small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of ASMase (ASM-siRNA1, ID 8725; ASM-siRNA2, ID 8630) and control (scrambled) siRNA were obtained from Ambion (Ambion Europe, Huntingdon, UK). Each siRNA (final concentration, 10 nm) was transiently transfected into 1 × 106 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.DNA Fragmentation—For DNA fragmentation assays, 107 Jurkat cells were pelleted at 1000 × g, lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v-1)SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mg ml-1 proteinase K), and incubated for 30 min at 56 °C. After two successive extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1, pH 8.8), polynucleotides were precipitated with 1:10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The DNA precipitate was washed once with 70% ethanol (v/v) and air-dried for 5 min and resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). RNA was removed by addition of 0.2 mg ml-1 RNase A and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA of ∼5 × 105 cells was loaded with 10% Ficoll onto a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light.RESULTSUV Light Induces Bax Conformational Change in HeLa Cells—The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria has been reported as an early event in the apoptotic process induced by UV light treatment (7Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 21Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms causing cytochrome c release, the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling cascade induced by UV light was analyzed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Bax activation/conformational change was detected as an immediate-early event within 0.5 h following UV light exposure (Fig. 1A). Bax conformational change was detected by combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis of Bax using a conformation-specific antibody (clone 6A7 specific for the N-terminal epitope 12-24 of Bax) that recognizes Bax only in its active conformation (28Hsu Y.T. Youle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The total amount of Bax protein remained unchanged, suggesting that the increasing fraction of active Bax protein does not correspond to newly synthesized protein. Concomitantly, pro-apoptotic proteins like cytochrome c were released from mitochondria into the cytosol after 60 min, which was paralleled by diminished levels of cytochrome c detected in mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 1A).To determine the precise subcellular site of UV light-induced Bax conformational change, we performed combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis of Bax in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. In accordance to previous reports (14Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), Bax is found in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of untreated HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). After UV light treatment, Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria occurred only after 120 min, indicating that Bax conformational change precedes Bax translocation. Activated Bax, however, could be discerned in the mitochondrial but not in cytosolic fractions 15 min after UV light treatment by 6A7 antibody. These results indicated that UV light induces the conformational change of only that fraction of Bax that is already sequestered by mitochondrial membranes. This notion could be confirmed by immunofluorescence-based co-localization studies. 30 min after UV light exposure, HeLa cells co-stained with Alexa 488-conjugated 6A7 anti-Bax antibody (conformation specific) (green) and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-cytochrome c antibody (red) showed colocalization of activated Bax and cytochrome c in a distinct punctated mitochondrial pattern (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that UV light-induced Bax activation only occurs at mitochondrial membranes but not in the cytosol.UV Light Induces Bax Conformational Change Independent of Caspases-8 and -3—In general, apoptotic stimuli can activate Bax through caspase-dependent and -independent signaling cascades. CD95-induced Bax conformational change is mediated through tBid previously cleaved by caspase-8 (29Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas STS activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway independent of caspase activity (40Johansson A.C. Steen H. Ollinger K. Roberg K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In order to examine the role of caspases in UV light-induced Bax activation, Jurkat cells were stimulated with UV light, STS, and anti-CD95. All three stimuli induced caspase-8 processing, Bid cleavage, Bax conformational change, and efflux of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and Smac into the cytosol (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4). Pretreatment of Jurkat cells with caspase inhibitors completely blocked both caspase-8 activation and the generation of tBid induced by any of the three stimuli (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). Bax conformational change induced by CD95 was abrogated after caspase inhibition. In contrast, UV light- and STS-induced Bax conformational change remained unaffected (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). Likewise, CD95-induced cytochrome c and Smac release was blocked by caspase inhibition, whereas UV light- and STS-induced release of cytochrome c and Smac was not impaired by Z-VAD-FMK and DEVD-CHO (Fig. 2A, compare lane 8 with lanes 6 and 7). Proper action of caspase inhibitors is demonstrated by the lack of DNA fragmentation in response to all three stimuli (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 5-8). These results indicate that UV light-induced Bax conformational change is a caspase-8 and -3 independent event, and it is not specific to HeLa cells.Fig. 2UV light induces Bax conformational change independent of caspases. Jurkat cells left untreated or pretreated for 4 h with Z-VAD-FMK (20 μm) and DEVD-CHO (2 μm) were stimulated with either agonistic anti-CD95 antibody (clone CH11, 20 ng ml-1), 0.5 μm staurosporine, or UV light (20 mJ cm(2)-1). A, caspase-8, Bid, Bax, and activated Bax were detected in total cell lysates by respective specific antibodies. Cytochrome c was detected with anti-cytochrome c antibody in cytosolic extracts. Re-probing for actin ensured equal loading of cytosolic extracts. B, DNA of ∼5 × 105 cells was loaded with 10% Ficoll onto a 1.8% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)UV Light-induced Acid Sphingomyelinase Activity Is Associated with Bax Conformational Change, Cytochrome c Release, and Cell Death—SMases have been suggested to play a role in apoptosis induced by UV light (15Komatsu M.

https://openalex.org/W2013036363,"The fragmentation of Pangaea as a consequence of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is documented in the Alpine–Mediterranean region by the onset of widespread pelagic sedimentation1. Shallow-water sediments were replaced by mainly pelagic limestones in the Early Jurassic period, radiolarian cherts in the Middle–Late Jurassic period, and again pelagic limestones in the Late Jurassic–Cretaceous period1. During initial extension, basin subsidence below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is thought to have triggered the transition from Early Jurassic limestones to Middle–Late Jurassic radiolarites1. It has been proposed that the transition from radiolarites to limestones in the Late Jurassic period was due to an increase in calcareous nannoplankton abundance when the CCD was depressed below the ocean floor1. But in modern oceans, sediments below the CCD are not necessarily radiolaritic. Here we present palaeomagnetic samples from the Jurassic–Cretaceous pelagic succession exposed in the Lombardian basin, Italy. On the basis of an analysis of our palaeolatitudinal data in a broader palaeogeographic context, we propose an alternative explanation for the above facies tripartition. We suggest that the Lombardian basin drifted initially towards, and subsequently away from, a near-equatorial upwelling zone of high biosiliceous productivity. Our tectonic model for the genesis of radiolarites adds an essential horizontal plate motion component to explanations involving only vertical variations of CCD relative to the ocean floor.

To determine the mechanism underlying regulation of the insulin gene by Pdx-1, we performed a kinetic analysis of insulin transcription following adenovirus-mediated delivery of a small interfering RNA specific for pdx-1 into insulinoma cells and pancreatic islets to diminish endogenous Pdx-1 protein. insulin transcription was assessed by measuring both a long half-life insulin mRNA (mature mRNA) and a short half-life insulin pre-mRNA species by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Following progressive knock-down of Pdx-1 levels, we observed coordinate decreases in pre-mRNA levels (to about 40% of normal levels at 72 h). In contrast, mature mRNA levels showed strikingly smaller and delayed declines, suggesting that the longer half-life of this species underestimates the contribution of Pdx-1 to insulin transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the decrease in insulin transcription was associated with decreases in the occupancies of Pdx-1 and p300 at the proximal insulin promoter. Although there was no corresponding change in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the proximal promoter, its recruitment to the insulin coding region was significantly reduced. Our results suggest that Pdx-1 directly regulates insulin transcription through formation of a complex with transcriptional coactivators on the proximal insulin promoter.

This complex leads to enhancement of elongation by the basal transcriptional machinery. Insulin is produced almost exclusively by the β cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. This restriction of insulin production derives primarily from constraints imposed at the level of transcription of the gene encoding preproinsulin (the insulin gene), rather than at the level of translation of the nascent mRNA (1Melloul D.

Studies of the rodent insulin genes indicate that ∼400 base pairs (bp) of DNA 5′ of the transcriptional start site (the insulin promoter) are sufficient to confer cell type-specific expression of insulin (3Dandoy-Dron F.

Multiple discrete sequence elements within the proximal promoter region contribute to both the specificity and magnitude of insulin expression, and these elements are believed to serve as binding sites for several islet transcription factors, including Pdx-1, MafA, and BETA2/Neu-roD (see Ref. 8Chakrabarti S.K. Mirmira R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar for a review). In the prevailing hypothesis of insulin transcription, the association of these transcription factors with the promoter and their subsequent interaction with ubiquitously expressed factors (e.g. E47 and p300) (9Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) leads to the recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery to the insulin gene. This hypothesis, however, has never been rigorously tested for the endogenous insulin gene in islet β cells. The Hox-like homeodomain protein Pdx-1 is perhaps the most extensively studied β cell transcription factor. Much of the evidence implicating Pdx-1 in the regulation of insulin transcription is circumstantial, and is derived from studies of interaction of Pdx-1 with insulin promoter elements in vitro, reporter gene expression studies in non-β cell lines, and loss-of-function studies in animals (11Liberzon A.

It is unknown from these experiments whether Pdx-1 might control insulin transcription by a direct mechanism involving interaction with upstream promoter elements or an indirect one via regulation of other genes. In this regard, Pdx-1 is known to regulate a complex genetic hierarchy, because its disruption in both mice and humans results not only in the absence of insulin production, but also in arrested development of the early pancreatic anlage (12Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 14Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V.

More recent studies involving functional or physical attenuation of Pdx-1 protein in late mouse development or in cell lines (through targeted gene knock-out, anti-sense, or dominant negative strategies) have suggested a potentiating effect of Pdx-1 on the endogenous insulin gene (16Peshavaria M.

On the one hand, these latter studies provide evidence for the overall positive regulation of insulin transcription by Pdx-1; on the other, many of these studies employed use of dominant negative proteins (which may have squelching effects on gene expression) and/or involved long-term functional knock-down of Pdx-1 (days to weeks), where its impact on a wide range of islet genes (glut2, glucokinase, pdx-1, nkx6.1, glucagon, and others) may have indirectly influenced insulin expression. Few of these studies have quantitatively examined the effect of physical knock-down of endogenous Pdx-1 in the short term (2–4 days); those that have reveal widely conflicting results on insulin transcription, from virtually no effect (24Kajimoto Y. Watada H. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Miyazaki J. Yamasaki Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1840-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to near-complete ablation (23Wang H. Maechler P.

To address definitively the role of Pdx-1 in the regulation of insulin transcription, we delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; AdsiLuc, adenovirus encoding siRNA against luciferase mRNA; Ad-siPdx, adenovirus encoding siRNA against pdx-1 mRNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming unit. into mouse β cell lines and islets to diminish endogenous Pdx-1 protein; we subsequently measured transcription by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and quantitated transcription factor occupancy at the insulin promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). To assess precisely the transcription of the insulin gene by RT-PCR, we employed a unique strategy whereby we measured total mouse insulin I and II mRNA (which reflects primarily fully processed or mature mRNA) and a mouse insulin II pre-mRNA species containing intron 2 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrate here that intron 2-containing transcripts possess short half-lives (9–30 min) in both mouse β cell lines and islets, whereas mature mRNA transcript displays substantially extended half-life (perhaps in excess of 24 h). We show that Pdx-1 knock-down in β cell lines and islets results in a coordinate decline in insulin transcription as measured by insulin pre-mRNA, but not as measured by mature mRNA. This decline in insulin transcription is accompanied by a fall in the association of Pdx-1 and its interacting coactivator p300 with the insulin gene, and a fall in the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the insulin coding region. Our results suggest a model whereby Pdx-1 directly regulates insulin transcription through formation of a complex with transcriptional coactivators on the proximal insulin promoter. This complex appears to lead to enhancement of transcriptional elongation by components of the basal transcriptional machinery.

Islets were cultured in RPMI medium containing 25 mm glucose overnight, then plated in 6-well tissue plates at a density of 150 islets/well.

Resulting adenoviruses were purified using the AdenoX® purification kit (BD Biosciences). Infectious titers of virus, as determined by end point dilution assay in HEK293 cells, were on the order of 1010–1011 pfu/ml. For adenoviral transduction of insulinoma cell lines, βTC3 and MIN6 cells were cultured overnight at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates as described above, followed by addition of recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of ∼2500 pfu/cell. After 5 h, virus-containing medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS and cultured in fresh medium. At the times indicated, cells were processed for isolation of total RNA or whole cell extracts, as described above. Islets were transduced with adenoviruses as described previously (29Bain J.R.

These corrections were verified by quantitation of total RNA in each sample by fluorescence using RiboGreen® dye (Molecular Probes). Primers for mature mRNA and pre-mRNA displayed equal efficiency for amplification of target DNA as determined in the following manner: total genomic DNA from βTC3 cells was used as a template for PCR using each primer set. Because the mature mRNA primers recognize both mouse insulin I and insulin II (total = 4 copies in genomic DNA), whereas pre-mRNA primers recognize only mouse insulin II (total = 2 copies in genomic DNA), it would be expected that CT values would occur 1 cycle sooner for mature mRNA primers than for pre-mRNA primers (assuming both primer sets amplified with equal efficiency). We observed amplification of mature mRNA with a CT of ∼17, and amplification of pre-mRNA with a CT of ∼18. This difference of 1 cycle was reproducible across a range of dilutions of genomic DNA. Mathematical Modeling of RNA Decay—RNA decay curves shown in Fig. 2 were optimized (by a modified Gauss-Newton nonlinear least squares algorithm) (33Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G.

Data in Fig. 6 are presented as percent of input DNA recovered. Forward and reverse primer sequences, respectively, used for PCR were: proximal insulin promoter: 5′-TACCTTGCTGCCTGAGTTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCATTTTCCACATCATTCCCC-3′; insulin coding sequence: 5′-TGGCTTCTTCTACACACCCAAG-3′ and 5′-ACAATGCCACGCTTCTGCC-3′. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts from cell lines and islets were prepared as described above. Aliquots of 5 μg of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Pdx-1 or anti-actin antibodies (both at 1:5000 dilution). Western blots were visualized using the ECL-Plus® system (Amersham Biosciences), and quantitated by densitometry using 1D® software (Kodak). Quantitation of Mature insulin mRNA and insulin Pre-mRNA and Determination of Their Biologic Half-lives in β Cells—In most mammals (including the human), the gene encoding preproinsulin (insulin) exists as a single gene containing two introns. However, in rats and mice the gene has undergone a duplication event during evolution, resulting in two homologous non-allelic genes (insulin I and insulin II) (1Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Ohneda K. Ee H. German M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similar to other mammals, the rodent insulin II gene contains two introns (see Fig. 1A), whereas the insulin I gene lacks the second intron. Prior studies have suggested very long half-lives (up to perhaps 80 h) of many spliced and unspliced forms of insulin mRNAs in mouse islets and β cell lines (34Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D.

Because both insulin genes appear to be coordinately regulated in the β cell (39Giddings S.J. Carnaghi L.R. J. Biol.

To measure insulin mRNA species, we designed two primer sets (shown in Fig. 1A) for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The primer set Tf/Tr was designed to amplify a 130-bp sequence in exon 2 of the mouse insulin I and II genes, and therefore targets both spliced and unspliced mRNA (total mRNA). Because unspliced insulin mRNA represents a very small fraction of total insulin mRNA (37Wang J. Shen L. Najafi H. Kolberg J. Matschinsky F.M. Urdea M. German M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4360-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), this primer set can be viewed as representing primarily mature (or fully spliced) mRNA. The primer set Pf/Pr was designed to amplify an 82-bp fragment spanning the exon 2/intron 2 boundary, thereby targeting only a specific unspliced mRNA (pre-mRNA) of insulin II containing intron 2. Fig. 1B shows that PCR amplification of both species of mRNA from reverse-transcribed total islet RNA results in homogenous products of expected molecular weight. Primers were subsequently used for SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR (27Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol.

Fig. 1C confirms, by melt curve analysis, that homogenous products were obtained following 50 cycles of PCR; Fig. 1, D and E, shows that the real-time PCR quantitation of both insulin pre-mRNA and mature mRNA was linear over the relatively narrow range of total RNA concentrations observed in our studies, thereby demonstrating the reproducibility and linearity of our real-time assay in distinguishing small differences in target mRNA quantities. Similar linearity data were obtained for the real-time amplification of β-actin message, and for all messages amplified from reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from two mouse β cell-derived insulinoma cell lines, βTC3 and MIN6 (data not shown). Table I shows the real-time PCR amplification threshold values for insulin mature mRNA and pre-mRNA in mouse insulinoma cell lines and islets maintained in 25 mm glucose. Interestingly, these data reveal no substantial differences in the relative amounts of mature insulin mRNA in these cells, but do show striking differences in pre-mRNA levels. Based on the calculated ratio of pre-mRNA to mature mRNA, the quantities of pre-mRNA are substantially lower than mature mRNA in all cell types. (Importantly, as noted under “Experimental Procedures,” both primer sets appeared to have identical amplification efficiencies based on a comparison of threshold values from genomic DNA.) However, although this ratio was similar for the two insulinoma cell lines, by comparison it was lower by 200–500-fold in islets. These data suggest that the cell lines produce initial transcripts in far greater quantity than islets, a finding consistent with their tumorigenic origin.Table IReal-time RT-PCR threshold cycles (CT) for mouse mature insulin mRNA and insulin II pre-mRNA in β cell lines and isletsInsulin II pre-mRNAaTo correct for variations in input RNA, threshold cycles were normalized to the actin mRNA threshold cycle in each sample, which was approximately 17 for all cell types.Mature insulin mRNAaTo correct for variations in input RNA, threshold cycles were normalized to the actin mRNA threshold cycle in each sample, which was approximately 17 for all cell types.Relative abundancebRelative abundanc"

It is a leucine zipper (bZip) DNA-binding protein and a regulatory factor for 8/7-bp AP-1-regulated genes, including HO-1 and ATF-2/CREB. Presently, small interference (si) RNA constructs were used to investigate the role of human BVR in sodium arsenite (As)-mediated induction of HO-1 and in cytoprotection against apoptosis. Activation of BVR involved increased serine/threonine phosphorylation but not its protein or transcript levels. The peak activity at 1 h (4–5-fold) after treatment of 293A cells with 5 μm As preceded induction of HO-1 expression by 3 h. The following suggests BVR involvement in regulating oxidative stress response of HO-1: siBVR attenuated As-mediated increase in HO-1 expression; siBVR, but not siHO-1, inhibited As-dependent increased c-jun promoter activity; treatment of cells with As increased AP-1 binding of nuclear proteins; BVR was identified in the DNA-protein complex; and AP-1 binding of the in vitro translated BVR was phosphorylation-dependent and was attenuated by biliverdin. Most unexpectedly, cells transfected with siBVR, but not siHO-1, displayed a 4-fold increase in apoptotic cells when treated with 10 μm As as detected by flow cytometry. The presence of BVR small interference RNA augmented the effect of As on levels of cytochrome c, TRAIL, and DR-5 mRNA and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The findings describe the function of BVR in HO-1 oxidative response and, demonstrate, for the first time, not only that BVR advances the role of HO-1 in cytoprotection but also affords cytoprotection independent of heme degradation.

BVR, an evolutionarily conserved enzyme with unique dual pH/cofactor-dependent activity profile, is primarily found in the mammalian species and is responsible for the production of bilirubin IXα. In most other animal species, biliverdin constitutes the end product of heme (Fe-protoporphyrin) macro-cycle cleavage. BVR catalyzes the reduction of biliverdin by incorporating two hydrogen atoms derived from pyridine nucleotides (NADH in acidic pH or NADPH in basic pH range) into the open tetrapyrrole ring structure (1Kutty R.K.

Biliverdin IXα in turn is a product of the mixed function oxidase activity of two forms of heme oxygenase proteins, HO-1 and HO-2 (7Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar); the HO enzymes are also known as the HSP32 family of stress/heat shock proteins (8Shibahara S.

HO-1 is the stress-responsive cognate and is induced by a wide array of stimuli that have in common the ability to cause oxidative stress (reviewed in Refs. 7Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar and 11Maines M.D. Heme Oxygenase: Clinical Applications and Functions.

Because of the noted activities of bile pigments, induction of HO-1 is now generally accepted to be a key component of anti-inflammatory/anti-apoptotic stress effector pathways. In addition, the recently ascribed functions to CO (19Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat.

Arsenite is a reported regulator of bZip factors (44Gong P. Stewart D. Hu B. Vinson C. Alam J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). BVR being a bZip transcription factor and activator of HO-1 could be among the list genes that are modulated by arsenite treatment. This is consistent with the observation that the reductase translocates from cytosol into the nucleus in response to HO-1 inducers, including free radicals of cyclic hydrocarbons, cytokines, and cGMP (34Maines M.D. Ewing J.F. Huang T.J. Panahian N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar).

Arsenite activation and increased binding of a complex of proteins, which includes the Jun protein, to the CRE/AP-1 site of the HO-1 promoter are essential for stress response of the oxygenase to this stimulus as well as to other oxidants. Furthermore, arsenic compounds are considered to be tumorigenic, and evidence points to their activity to disrupt normal control of apoptosis by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase and activating the NF-κβ signaling pathway (35Barchowsky A.

The effect arsenite has on cell death, however, is concentration-dependent and has been proposed to involve oxygen free radicals (47Bode A.M. Dong Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The features of BVR that communicate with other proteins known to have gene regulatory function in the cell together with above noted observations support the potential role of BVR in the stress response of HO-1.The present study was undertaken to define further the role of BVR in the response of HO-1 to arsenite and to examine whether BVR itself has input into the cellular anti-apoptotic effector pathways. We show, using arsenite as the stimulus, that BVR is a key component of HO-1 stress response and that this involves activity of the reductase as a kinase, transcription factor, and the inactivator of biliverdin. We further demonstrate for the first time that BVR offers cytoprotection against cell death independent of HO-1 expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstructs—siBVR and siHO-1 motifs were selected according to the amino acid Asn-19 rule by finding the pattern in human BVR and human HO-1 cDNA sequences (48Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Muller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The target sequence for hBVR is located 96 bp downstream of the start codon (nucleotides 96–116). For HO-1, the targeting sequence is 106–126 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. A retroviral based vector pSuper-Retro for siRNA expression was purchased from OligoEngine Co. (Seattle, WA). Retrovirus/siRNA-expressing vectors pSuper-Retro-siBVR and pSuper-Retro-siHO-1 were constructed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, oligos containing the sequence of 21-mer small interference RNA were synthesized as follows: BVR siRNA, 5′-GATCCCC (TCC TCA GCG TTC CTG AAC CTG) TTCAAGAGA (CAG GTT CAG GAA CGC TGA GGA) TTTTTGGAAA and 3′-GGG (AGG AGT CGC AAG GAC TTG GAC) AAGTTCTCT (GTC CAA GTC CTT GCG ACT CCT)AAAAACCTTTTCGA; HO-1 siRNA, 5′-GATCCCC (AAC TTT CAG AAG GGC CAG GTG) TTCAAGAGA (CAC CTG GCC CTT CTG AAA GTT) TTTTTGGAAA and 3′-GGG (TTG AAA GTC TTC CCG GTC CAC) AAGTTCTCT (GTG GAC CGG GAA GAC TTT CAA)AAAAACCTTTTCGA.Complementary oligos were gel-purified and annealed to form double-stranded DNA. To insert the oligos into the pSuper-Retro plasmid, BglII and HindIII were used to digest the vector, and the digested vector was gel-purified. The double-stranded oligos were phosphorylated by T4 kinase. Ligation of the vector and oligos was carried out by incubation of 10 μl of reaction containing 2 μl of vector, 1 μl of oligo, 2 μl of 5× ligation buffer, and 1 μl (1 unit) of T4 ligation buffer for 1 h at room temperature. 2 μl of the ligation reaction was then used to transform DH5α Escherichia coli. Clones containing the oligo inserts were identified by restriction digest analysis. Selected positive clones were further verified by DNA sequencing. The verified constructs were named pSuper-Retro-siBVR and pSuper-Retro-siHO-1. The retroviral vectors generating BVR siRNA and HO-1 siRNA were transfected into the 293A packaging cell line, and the supernatant containing the expressed siBVR or siHO-1 retrovirus was then titrated by using NIH3T3 cell line. The concentration of retrovirus expressing siRNA used to infect cells in further experiments was at a multiplicity of infection of 4 plaque-forming units/cell.Other constructs used in this study are as follows. The expression vectors pEGFP-FLAG-hBVR and pEGFP-FLAG-hHO-1 were generated by inserting full-length human BVR cDNA or full-length human HO-1 cDNA, respectively, into plasmid pEGFP (Clontech). The expression vectors generate an EGFP-FLAG-hBVR fusion protein or an EGFP-FLAG-hHO-1 fusion protein. The vectors used for luciferase reporter assay are as follows: a pGL3 luciferase-containing vector ligated with a c-jun promoter sequence (pGL3/c-jun) or with a mutant form of c-jun promoter (pGL3/c-jun–). (Both are kindly provided by Drs. McCance and Baglia, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.) A pCMV β-galactosidase vector was used as internal control for transfection efficiency.Arsenite Treatment of the Cells—Arsenite (Sigma) was freshly prepared for each experiment in PBS and added to the cell culture at a final concentration of 5 or 10 μm. Cells were treated for the durations indicated in appropriate figure legends. Thereafter, cells were harvested, washed with PBS twice, and then used for experiments.Cell Culture and Transfection of 293A Cells with hBVR and hHO-1 Expression Vectors—293A cell line (a human embryonic kidney cell line) was obtained from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in 10-cm plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-G/streptomycin for 24 h or until a 70% confluency was reached. Cells were subsequently transfected with 4 μg of plasmid in each 10-cm dish using Transfectin Reagent (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's protocol. This protocol was found to be optimal for overexpression of hBVR and hHO-1, resulting in ∼85% transfection efficiency as detected by fluorescent microscopy. 24 h after transfections, supernatant containing retrovirus expressing siRNA was added. This time point was designated as the “0” point. 4 and 16 h after the initial infection with retrovirus, additional virus was added at the same concentration. Samples were obtained at time points indicated in appropriate figure legends. 3 × 106 cells were used for RNA analysis and 1 × 106 for protein analysis.Isolation of Cytosolic Fraction—293 cells were washed with PBS and then homogenized in the extraction buffer (220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm Pipes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors). The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min; the resultant supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction for Western blot analysis of cytochrome c levels. The protein amount was determined with a Bradford protein assay.Western and Northern Blot Analyses—These analyses were carried out as before (33Kravets A. Hu Z. Miralem T. Torno M.D. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19916-19923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells infected as above were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). hBVR and hHO-1 fusion proteins were detected using mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (1: 1000, v/v, Sigma) as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, v/v, Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody. hBVR and hHO-1 proteins were visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining (Calbiochem) or ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c and rabbit polyclonal anti-TRAIL antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PARP antibody (C-2-10) was purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) from 293A cells. 10 μg samples were subjected to denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to Hybond membrane. Membranes were probed with a full-length hBVR cDNA (48Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb fragment of human β-actin cDNA was used as internal control for loading. pCDNA3 containing DR-5 cDNA was cut by EcoRI/HindIII and used as probe for DR-5. Probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP with the random primers labeling system (Invitrogen). Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and autoradiography were performed as described previously (50Miralem T. Avraham H.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).ELISA—HO-1 protein was measured by using an ELISA kit developed by Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Measurement of BVR Activity—Human 293A cells infected with pSuper-Retro-siBVR were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2,10mm MnCl2, 1% Nonidet-P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4). Noninfected 293A cells were used as control. BVR activity was measured at pH 6.7 as described previously (51Huang T.J. Trakshel G.M. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin was determined as the increase in absorbance at 450 nm at 25 °C. Specific activity is expressed as nanomoles of bilirubin/min/mg of protein.Luciferase Assay—Transfection of 293A cells in 24-well plates was performed by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with 0.4 μg of plasmid containing PGL31 c-jun promoter fragment (–225 to +150) (52Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), 0.4 μg of plasmid containing c-jun promoter mutant construct (pGL3/c-Jun–) and containing mutated AP-1 site (53Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 0.4 μg of either empty pcDNA3, pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid, or pGL3 vector (without the inserts). To test the role of BVR and HO-1 in arsenite-dependent c-jun induction, 293A cells were infected with retrovirus expression either siRNA for BVR or HO-1. After 24 h of infection, cells were treated with arsenite for an additional 8 h and then harvested, washed, and lysed. 5 μl of lysate from each sample was used for luciferase assay using a Promega kit (Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was used to assess transfection efficiency, and luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity.In Vitro BVR Protein Translation, Nuclear Extraction, λ-Phosphatase Treatment, and Gel Mobility Shift Assay—293A cells were treated or untreated with arsenite. 107 cells were harvested at 8 or 24 h after treatment; cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed with hypotonic buffer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation and used for extract preparation. In vitro BVR protein translation was performed using a TnT Quick Coupled Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, full-length hBVR cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. 2.0 μg of recombinant plasmid DNA obtained was used for protein translation with TnT Quick Master Mix in a 50-μl reaction volume for 90 min at 30 °C.To determine whether dephosphorylation of BVR impairs its binding to AP-1, the following experiment was carried out using λ-phosphatase (Sigma). 293A cells were transfected with pEGFP-FLAG-hBVR, using Lipofectamine Reagent (Bio-Rad). 24 h later, cells were treated with 5 μm arsenite for 8 h. Nuclear extract was isolated and was subsequently treated with λ-phosphatase at concentrations of 20–80 units/20-μl concentrations for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the samples were used for gel mobility shift assay for AP-1 binding.The in vitro translated protein and nuclear extract were analyzed in gel mobility shift assay for their DNA binding capability to an AP-1 consensus oligo (54Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). The sequences of oligonucleotides in double strands used in the present study were 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′. The oligos were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 kinase (Invitrogen). For DNA binding assay, 3 μl of in vitro translated protein or nuclear extract was preincubated with 2 μl of binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI):poly(dC)) in an 8-μl reaction volume for 10 min at room temperature. Then 2 μl of labeled oligo was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein binding complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel and processed for autoradiography. In order to identify BVR in the DNA-protein complex, supershift experiments were performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-human BVR antibodies (55Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times to ascertain the reproducibility of results.Detection of Apoptotic Cells—To detect apoptotic cells after arsenite treatment, 293A cells were treated with 10 μm arsenite for 12 h and subsequently harvested. Cells were washed and fixed with 75% ethanol and stained with 20 μm propidium iodide with 2 μg/ml of RNase A. The cells were further analyzed by flow cytometry for apoptosis based on the propidium iodide staining. 103 cells were analyzed fo"

We identified β-ketophosphonate 1 (JNJ-10311795; RWJ-355871) as a novel, potent dual inhibitor of neutrophil cathepsin G (Ki = 38 nm) and mast cell chymase (Ki = 2.3 nm). The x-ray crystal structures of 1 complexed with human cathepsin G (1.85 Å) and human chymase (1.90 Å) reveal the molecular basis of the dual inhibition. Ligand 1 occupies the S1 and S2 subsites of cathepsin G and chymase similarly, with the 2-naphthyl in S1, the 1-naphthyl in S2, and the phosphonate group in a complex network of hydrogen bonds. Surprisingly, however, the carboxamido-N-(naphthalene-2-carboxyl)piperidine group is found to bind in two distinct conformations. In cathepsin G, this group occupies the hydrophobic S3/S4 subsites, whereas in chymase, it does not; rather, it folds onto the 1-naphthyl group of the inhibitor itself. Compound 1 exhibited noteworthy anti-inflammatory activity in rats for glycogen-induced peritonitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced airway inflammation. In addition to a marked reduction in neutrophil influx, 1 reversed increases in inflammatory mediators interleukin-1α, interleukin-1β, tissue necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the glycogen model and reversed increases in airway nitric oxide levels in the lipopolysaccharide model. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to inhibit both cathepsin G and chymase with a single molecule and suggest an exciting opportunity in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The adverse effects of Cat G and chymase go beyond the breakdown of matrix proteins. Cat G is linked with activated macrophages, and chymase triggers the generation of cytokines and chemokines, which stimulate the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Thus, Cat G and chymase contribute in a major way to self-propagating, chronic inflammation. Since Cat G and chymase have structurally homologous catalytic clefts, we envisioned an opportunity to inhibit both proteases with a single molecule. Through structure-based drug design, we have discovered a novel, nonpeptide, small molecule inhibitor of both Cat G and chymase, represented by structure 1 (see Fig. 1). We report the three-dimensional structures for the Cat G and chymase complexes of 1, which define the molecular interactions of 1 in the active site of each enzyme and reveal two different binding modes relative to occupancy of the hydrophobic S3/S4 pocket. In addition, we have investigated the biological properties of this dual inhibitor and found that it has noteworthy anti-inflammatory activity in two animal models. Compound 1—Compound 1 (JNJ-10311795; RWJ-355871) was synthesized in our laboratories according to published methodology (22Greco M.N. Hawkins M.J. Powell E.T. Almond Jr., H.R.

Diethyl 1-naphthylmethylphosphonate was lithiated with butyllithium and then reacted with 2,3-naphthoic anhydride. The product was treated with N-(1-naphthoyl-4-piperidinyl)-N′-methylamine in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and then bromotrimethylsilane in pyridine. After the addition of 1 n HCl, 1 (as a racemate) was converted to a tromethamine (Tris) salt, which was purified by recrystallization from 2-propanol. Compound 1 is stereochemically labile at the α-phosphonyl carbon atom. In a 600-MHz 1H NMR study, deuterium exchange occurred at this stereocenter with a t½ of 18.5 h at 37 °C (MeOH-d4:D2O, 1:1; pD 6.7). Details for the synthesis and characterization of 1 can be found in the Supplemental Materials. Enzymes—Human neutrophil Cat G from Athens Research and Technology, Inc. (Athens, GA) was used in the enzyme inhibition and crystallography studies. This enzyme is a single protein species with variable glycosylation, having a molecular mass of 23.5 kDa. The material was supplied as a salt-free lyophilized solid (≥95% purity by SDS-PAGE). Human skin chymase from Cortex Biochem, Inc. (San Leandro, CA) was used in the enzyme inhibition studies. The material was supplied as a liquid in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with 1 m sodium chloride (>95% purity by SDS-PAGE and gel diffusion). The purified human chymase used in our crystallography studies was obtained from Prof. Norman M. Schechter (University of Pennsylvania) (23Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z-M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W.

This recombinant enzyme is a single protein species with two sugar-bearing glycosylation sites, having a molecular mass of 24.3 kDa. The material was supplied as a lyophilized solid (>95% purity by SDS-PAGE). Enzyme Inhibition Assays—Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis rates were measured for human neutrophil Cat G (Athens Research and Technology, Inc.) or human skin chymase (Cortex Biochem, Inc.) spectrophotometrically by using the chromogenic substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-(p-nitroanilide) (Bachem Bioscience Inc., King of Prussia, PA; Km Cat G = 3.0 ± 0.6 mm, Km chymase = 0.33 ± 0.09 mm) in aqueous buffer (Cat G, 100 mm Hepes, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; chymase, 450 mm Tris, 1800 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Changes in absorbance at 405 nm were monitored just after the addition of enzyme, with and without inhibitor present. Inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined under conditions for analysis of Michaelis-Menten kinetics (37 °C, monitored for 15 min; Cat G, 70 nm enzyme, 0.3–10 mm substrate; chymase, 10 nm enzyme, 0.1–3.0 mm substrate) (24Carter Jr., C.W. Carter C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12219-12223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ki values were obtained by using the program K-Cat (BioMetallics, Inc., Princeton, NJ). Crystallization—Human Cat G (Athens Research and Technology, Inc.) and human chymase (Prof. N. Schechter) were used in the crystallization studies without further purification. We screened for crystallization conditions with Hampton screen kits I and II (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and grew diffraction quality crystals by the sitting-drop method at 23 °C over 7 days. For 1·Cat G, the protein and inhibitor were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio, and the crystals were grown from 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 20 mm zinc sulfate, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5). For 1·chymase, the protein and inhibitor were mixed in a 1:4 molar ratio, and the crystals were grown from 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), and 0.01 m cobalt chloride.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar), employing all data to 3.0 Å resolution and the structure of human chymase (23Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z-M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M. Strobl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as the search molecule. The structures were refined by using CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). All reflections greater than zero (F /σ F > 0) were retained, and 5% of the reflections from each data set were randomly selected as a test set for the calculation of Rfree (29Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). After initial rigid body refinement, each structure was subjected to molecular dynamics refinement by simulated annealing (30Hodel A. Kim S-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). After refinement of atomic positions and individual isotropic thermal factors, including a bulk solvent correction, water molecules and inhibitor 1 were introduced. Model building based on the electron density difference maps was conducted manually with the program Turbo-Frodo (31Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 86. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo II workstation. The stereochemical quality of the structures was checked by using the program PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement data and model parameters are listed in Table I. Model Generation and Fitting of 1—A model for inhibitor 1 was generated by using the Builder module of Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Proper electrostatic potentials were assigned to all of the atoms of the molecule. The energy of the molecule was minimized by using the conjugate gradient algorithm in the Discover module of Insight II. Minimized 1 was then fitted to the difference electron density of the 1·chymase crystal first, then of the 1·Cat G crystal, with torsional rotations and the breaking and making bonds when necessary. The Discover module was used again to minimize the energy of the molecule in the new conformations. These steps were repeated several times until the molecule fit well into the electron density maps. Glycogen-Induced Peritonitis in Rats—A glycogen solution (25 ml, 1% w/v; Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally into male Sprague-Dawley rats (33Murohara T. Guo J.P. Lefer A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1246-1253PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vaporciyan A.A. DeLisser H.M. Yan H.C. Mendiguren I. Thom S.R. Jones M.L. Ward P.A. Albelda S.M. Science. 1993; 262: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Ascites fluid was collected from the peritoneum 4 h later. Aliquots were centrifuged (Beckman GS-6, 6000 rpm, 10 min, 23 °C), and supernatants were collected and frozen for analysis. The cytokines interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, and tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). The cell pellet was resuspended in saline for quantification of neutrophils with an automated cell counter (Bayer Advia 120 Hematology System). Compound 1 was dosed intravenously to four groups of rats (n = 6/group) at 30 min prior to glycogen as a bolus of 0.1, 0.25, 0.55, or 0.5 mg/kg (in saline) followed by an infusion of 0.2, 0.5, 2.1, or 10 mg/kg/h, respectively, which resulted in composite doses of 1, 2.5, 10, and 45.5 mg/kg, respectively, over the course of the experiment (4.5 h). In a control group, an equivalent volume of saline (vehicle) was infused intravenously into glycogen-treated rats (n = 18). In another group of rats (n = 12), the positive control dexamethasone (Sigma) was dosed intramuscularly at 1 mg/kg, 30 min prior to glycogen. Four hours after the administration of glycogen, the ascites fluid was drained from the peritoneum and the samples were centrifuged; the cell pellet was resuspended in saline, and the neutrophils were quantified as stated above. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Airway Neutrophilia in Rats—We exposed two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats to aerosolized saline (n = 24) or to an aerosolized solution of 1 (∼1 mg/kg; n = 17) followed 30 min later by the intratracheal instillation of 100 μg of LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma) (30Hodel A. Kim S-H. Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1992; 48: 851-858Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A third group of rats received inhaled saline as a baseline control (n = 5). At 24 h following LPS, the rats were euthanized, and their airways were immediately lavaged with 10 ml of heparinized saline. The bronchoalveolar lavage samples were centrifuged (Beckman GS-6, 1530 rpm, 10 min, 23 °C) to obtain a cell pellet, which was resuspended in 1 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro/Media Tech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and recentrifuged (2000 rpm) through 1 ml of Lympholyte (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Cells retained at the interface were collected, resuspended in 2% serum (2 ml), and centrifuged (1530 rpm). The cell pellet was resuspended in 2% serum (1 ml), and cell numbers were determined by using an automated counter (Bayer Advia 120). A separate study assessed the effects on nitric oxide levels under the LPS protocol. Expired gases were collected from conscious rats, one at a time, in a sealed chamber by constant, flow-through air sampling (with ambient NO being removed from the inlet air by passage through aqueous potassium permanganate and an activated carbon filter). The NO levels in the expired gases from the outlet were measured by a gas-phase chemiluminescent reaction between NO and ozone (Sievers nitric oxide analyzer NOA 280i, Ionics Instruments, Boulder, CO). The amount of NO in the LPS model was measured in the presence and absence of 1. Animal Regulations—We used all animals according to the guidelines for animal experiments in Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, LLC. Studies with animals were performed with the approval and oversight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with governmental regulations. Dual Inhibition of Cat G and Chymase—At the outset of our studies, we performed high throughput screening of the Johnson & Johnson proprietary compound library for inhibition of Cat G and identified prototype 2 (Fig. 1) as a moderately potent inhibitor (IC50 = 4.1 μm). An x-ray structure of 2·Cat G (3.0 Å) was used to guide structural modifications for optimizing potency (22Greco M.N. Hawkins M.J. Powell E.T. Almond Jr., H.R. Corcoran T.W. de Garavilla L. Kauffman J.A. Recacha R. Chattopadhyay D. Andrade-Gordon P. Maryanoff B.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3810-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated derivatives with functional groups that could project into the S3 and S4 subsites of Cat G, an inviting hydrophobic region not utilized by 2. This effort eventually led us to β-ketophosphonate 1, which exhibits potent inhibition of Cat G (Ki = 38 ± 8 nm, n = 7; IC50 = 82 ± 10 nm, n = 59). This compound showed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics as a reversible, competitive inhibitor with a rapid on-rate (kon = 4.8 ± 2.9 × 105 m-1s-1, n = 4) and a moderately slow off-rate (koff = 3.7 ± 0.5 × 10-2 s-1, n = 4). In profiling 1 for enzyme selectivity, we discovered that it also inhibits chymase, a serine protease that is homologous to Cat G, with exceptional potency (Ki = 2.3 ± 0.5 nm, n = 9; IC50 = 4.5 ± 0.7 nm, n = 37). We observed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (reversible, competitive chymase inhibition) with a rapid on-rate (kon = 1.4 ± 0.5 × 105 m-1s-1, n = 5) and a moderately slow off-rate (koff = 5.5 ± 3.0 × 10-2 s-1, n = 5). Compound 1 was found to possess excellent selectivity versus several other serine proteases: <50% inhibition at 100 μm for factor Xa, factor IXa, plasma kallikrein, urokinase plasminogen activator, tryptase, proteinase 3, and leukocyte elastase; Ki = 5.6 μm for thrombin; Ki = 11 μm for plasmin; Ki = 15 μm for trypsin; IC50 = 25 μm for tissue plasminogen activator. There was moderate inhibition of chymotrypsin (Ki = 490 ± 90 nm, n = 9). Structures of the Two Complexes—Suitable co-crystals of complexes of 1 (racemate) with human Cat G and chymase were obtained, and the structure of each was determined to resolutions of 1.85 and 1.90 Å, respectively (Table I). Complex 1·Cat G consists of 224 amino acid residues, 1 inhibitor molecule, 261 solvent molecules, and 5 sulfate anions. All of the residues from Ile-16 to Ser-244 were located in strong electron density except for residues Thr-36a to Pro-38, which form a surface loop (assigned zero occupancy). Complex 1·chymase crystal contains one protein molecule of 226 residues, one inhibitor molecule, one cobalt cation, eight sulfate anions, one molecule modeled as a MES anion, and three molecules modeled as N-linked N-acetylglucosamine. All of the residues from Ile-16 to Thr-245 were located in strong electron density. Electron density maps for 1 in each complex are depicted in Fig. S1, contained in the Supplemental Materials. Atomic coordinates for the two structures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank: 1·CatG, 1T32; 1·chymase, 1T31. Molecular Interactions of 1—Our results from the crystallography provide insight into the molecular basis of the potent enzyme inhibition of 1 by defining the molecular interactions in the enzyme active sites (Fig. 2). In both complexes, the active site is occupied by the R enantiomer of 1. For 1·Cat G (Fig. 2, A and C), many of the key interactions of the ligand within S1,S2, and the catalytic site are similar to those observed earlier for 2·Cat G (22Greco M.N. Hawkins M.J. Powell E.T. Almond Jr., H.R. Corcoran T.W. de Garavilla L. Kauffman J.A. Recacha R. Chattopadhyay D. Andrade-Gordon P. Maryanoff B.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3810-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 2-naphthyl group occupies S1 and the 1-naphthyl group occupies S2, the latter being involved in an aromatic-stacking interaction with the imidazole of His-57. One phosphonate oxygen is hydrogen-bonded with Nϵ of His-57 and Oγ of Ser-195, another oxygen is H-bonded to Nϵ of Lys-192, and a third is H-bonded to the NH of Gly-193 and Ser-195 Oγ, in the “oxyanion hole” (Fig. 2C). The unenolized ketone oxygen is H-bonded to Nϵ of Lys-192. In our structure-based drug design effort, we anticipated that the carboxamido-N-(naphthalene-2-carboxyl)piperidine segment of 1 would occupy the hydrophobic S3/S4 cavity, the surface of which is defined by the side chains of Tyr-215, Ile-99, and Phe-172. In fact, this binding mode, with the piperidine ring (chair conformation) orienting the third naphthyl in the S3/S4 pocket, was observed. Thus, the enhanced potency of 1 (IC50 = 82 nm) over 2 (IC50 = 4100 nm) can be largely attributed to these additional hydrophobic interactions (22Greco M.N. Hawkins M.J. Powell E.T. Almond Jr., H.R. Corcoran T.W. de Garavilla L. Kauffman J.A. Recacha R. Chattopadhyay D. Andrade-Gordon P. Maryanoff B.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3810-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of the close sequence homology (>50%) between Cat G and chymase and the homologous structure of their active sites (∼80%), we supposed that the binding mode for 1·chymase would be similar to that for 1·Cat G. Indeed, 1 occupies the S1 and S2 domains of chymase (Fig. 2, B and D) in a virtually identical manner to 1·Cat G, although there are small differences in the hydrogen-bonding network between the two complexes. In 1·chymase, one oxygen of the phosphonate is H-bonded to Lys-192"
https://openalex.org/W2160780655,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, controlling sexual maturation and fertility in diverse species from fish to humans. GnRH gene expression is limited to a discrete population of neurons that migrate through the nasal region into the hypothalamus during embryonic development. The GnRH regulatory region contains four conserved homeodomain binding sites (ATTA) that are essential for basal promoter activity and cell-specific expression of the GnRH gene. MSX and DLX are members of the Antennapedia class of non-Hox homeodomain transcription factors that regulate gene expression and influence development of the craniofacial structures and anterior forebrain. Here, we report that expression patterns of the Msx and Dlx families of homeodomain transcription factors largely coincide with the migratory route of GnRH neurons and co-express with GnRH in neurons during embryonic development. In addition, MSX and DLX family members bind directly to the ATTA consensus sequences and regulate transcriptional activity of the GnRH promoter. Finally, mice lacking MSX1 or DLX1 and 2 show altered numbers of GnRH-expressing cells in regions where these factors likely function. These findings strongly support a role for MSX and DLX in contributing to spatiotemporal regulation of GnRH transcription during development.

Proper sexual maturation and fertility are dependent upon the correct function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, initiated by a small, yet critical population of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; dpc, days postcoitum; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; DIG, digoxigenin; CNS, central nervous system. neurons. The GnRH gene is expressed in a complex spatiotemporal manner during embryonic development and into postnatal life with several populations of GnRH-expressing neurons originating at different developmental stages and locations. These populations include the classical, septohypothalamic neurons, as well as populations in the lateral septum, posterior bed nucleus stria terminalis (pBNST), and tectum (1Wu T.J. Gibson M.J. Silverman A.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Skynner M.J. Slater R. Sim J.A. Allen N.D. Herbison A.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5955-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of each of these populations of GnRH-producing neurons remains to be elucidated, the contribution of the septohypothalamic population is required for maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis and fertility (3Mason A.J.

The precursor cells of the septohypothalamic GnRH neurons have been reported to originate within the olfactory placode (4Dubois E.A. Zandbergen M.A. Peute J. Goos H.J. Brain Res. Bull. 2002; 57: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 6Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H.

Biol. 2003; 257: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and begin to express the GnRH transcript in a discrete population of cells located in close proximity to the olfactory placode of the embryonic mouse by 11.5-days postcoitum (11.5 dpc). By 12.5 dpc, the full complement of septohypothalamic GnRH neurons (∼800) in the adult population is established (6Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and over the course of the next several days, these neurons migrate toward the CNS, closely associated with the established position of the peripherin-positive nerve bundle of the olfactory nerve (8Wray S. Key S. Qualls R. Fueshko S.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Livne I. Gibson M.J. Silverman A.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By 16.5 dpc the majority of the septohypothalamic neurons have reached their destination, scattered throughout the preoptic area, the diagonal band of Broca and the medial septum (5Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 10Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Jorgenson K.L. Bergen H.T. Weesner G.D. Pfaff D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Expression of GnRH during prenatal development actively contributes to the identity and migratory ability of the septohypothalamic population. Indeed, GnRH itself, is involved in furthering the commitment and migratory state of the GnRH neuronal precursor in an ultrashort, positive feedback loop by upregulating expression of the GnRH gene, stimulating axon growth, cytoskeletal remodeling and increasing the migration of neuronal precursors (11Romanelli R.G. Barni T. Maggi M. Luconi M. Failli P. Pezzatini A. Pelo E. Torricelli F. Crescioli C. Ferruzzi P. Salerno R. Marini M. Rotella C.M. Vannelli G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of GnRH during embryonic development likely promotes the characteristics of the maturing GnRH neuron that are essential for reproductive ability. Because of the limited number and dispersed nature of GnRH neurons, the difficulty in examining GnRH promoter expression in vivo is evident. The generation of immortalized GnRH neuronal cell lines, the GT1-7, GN11, and NLT cells, has provided cellular model systems in which to study GnRH (12Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 13Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nicols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler J. G B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Whereas the murine hypothalamic cell line, GT1-7, exhibits key characteristics of a mature, fully differentiated GnRH-expressing neuron, the GN11 and NLT cell lines are migratory in culture and suggested to represent immature GnRH neurons (12Mellon P.L.

Studies with these two models have been invaluable for identifying the protein transcription factor complexes that facilitate expression of GnRH. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that well defined promoter and enhancer regions of the GnRH gene, containing ATTA homeodomain-binding sites, are both necessary and sufficient for proper GnRH gene expression during embryonic development and in the adult (12Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 16Lawson M.A. MacConell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, these homeodomain-binding sites are essential for appropriate basal, as well as cell-specific expression of the GnRH promoter (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B.

A role for homeoproteins, such as MSX and DLX, in regulation of gene expression during development is well documented in vertebrate and invertebrate species (19Alappat S. Zhang Z.Y. Chen Y.P.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the MSX and DLX homeodomain transcription factor families have the appropriate expression patterns in the developing olfactory region and forebrain of the mouse to be considered as potential regulators of the GnRH gene (24Porteus M.H. Bulfone A. Liu J.K. Puelles L. Lo L.C. Rubenstein J.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6370-6383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These factors can also occupy homeodomain binding sites in a variety of upstream promoter regions (26Iler N. Rowitch D.H. Echelard Y. McMahon A.P. Abate-Shen C. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Iler N. Abate-Shen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here, we report the contribution of DLX and MSX family members to regulation of GnRH promoter expression in vivo and in vitro. We show that spatiotemporal expression of Msx and Dlx family members coincides with the migratory, septohypothalamic GnRH neuronal population. MSX and DLX family members are also expressed in the GnRH model cell lines, bind to upstream regulatory regions of the GnRH gene, and regulate promoter activity in vitro. In addition, analyses of mouse mutants revealed that DLX1 and -2 as well as MSX1 contribute to proper GnRH expression in the prenatal septohypothalamic areas. Therefore, we propose that MSX and DLX family members participate in developmental regulation of GnRH gene expression. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared according to Clark and Mellon (29Clark M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide probes were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Science Products) in a polynucleotide kinase reaction. Radiolabeled probes were then cleaned over MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). 1 fmol of probe was incubated with 2 μg from GT1-7 cells or 6 μg from NLT or GN11 cells of nuclear protein extract in binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm spermidine, 2% Ficoll, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, and 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min before loading on a 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel. Gels were run at 250 V for 2 h, then dried under a vacuum and exposed to film for 1-3 days. For supershift assays, 1 or 2 μl of anti-DLX1 (Chemicon AB5724), DLX2 (Chemicon AB5726), DLX5 (Chemicon AB5728), MSX1 (Covance MMS-261R), or MSX2 (Santa Cruz SC-15396) antibody was incubated in the reaction mix for 5 min before loading. Cell Culture and Transfection—GT1-7, GN11, and NLT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 4.5% glucose in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were split into 24-well plates for transfection. 400 ng of pGL3-GnRHe/p reporter or pGL3-mutant GnRHe/p reporter were co-transfected with 100 or 200 ng of pCB6+-Msx1, pCMV-Msx2, pCDNA3-Dlx5, pCAGGS-Dlx1, or pCB6+-Dlx2 expression vectors in addition to 200 ng of thymidine kinase-β-galactosidase reporter vector as an internal control using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). The mutant GnRHe/p reporter contained a linker-scanner mutation deleting the two homeodomain enhancer sites (-1636 to -1631 and -1623 to -1618) (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and two point mutations in each of the promoter sites, -55 to -50 and -42 to -38 (CAATTA to CAgTTg and CATTA to CgTTg). Transfections were harvested 24 h later in lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8; 0.2% Triton X-100) to yield cellular proteins. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as advised by the manufacturer (Tropix, Bedford, MA), and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To control for transfection efficiency, luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Values of the normalized expression vectors were compared with empty vector control or an RSVe/RSVp control. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—Mouse colonies were maintained in agreement with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Diego. The Dlx1&2-null, or Msx1-null embryos were produced by heterozygous intercrosses of Dlx1&2 (30Qiu M. Bulfone A. Ghattas I. Meneses J.J. Christensen L. Sharpe P.T. Presley R. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) or Msx1-nLacZ (31Houzelstein D. Cohen A. Buckingham M.E. Robert B. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and maintained in a C57BL/6J background. Fertilization was assumed to occur at midnight, and pregnant females were sacrificed at 12-16 dpc accordingly to harvest embryos (noon on the day after finding the plug is considered 0.5 dpc). Genotypes were confirmed by PCR as previously described (30Qiu M. Bulfone A. Ghattas I. Meneses J.J. Christensen L. Sharpe P.T. Presley R. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 31Houzelstein D. Cohen A. Buckingham M.E. Robert B. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos were fixed (10% acetic acid, 30% formaldehyde, 60% ethanol) overnight at 4 °C and then dehydrated in a series of ethanol/water washes before embedding in paraffin. Sections were cut ∼7-μm thick and then placed onto Superfrost Plus Slides (Fisher) and left at room temperature to dry overnight. Sections were then deparaffinized with xylene washes, hydrated in ethanol/water solutions and digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 7 min at 37 °C, followed by postfixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 2× SSC for 5 min. Antisense probes corresponded to sequences as previously reported for Dlx2 (25Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), Msx1 and Msx2 (32Reginelli A.D. Wang Y.Q. Sassoon D. Muneoka K. Development. 1995; 121: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Dlx1 and Dlx5 (33Bulfone A. Puelles L. Porteus M.H. Frohman M.A. Martin G.R. Rubenstein J.L. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 709-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GnRH antisense sequence corresponds to 325 bp of the cDNA from +1 to the endogenous BamHI site. Probes corresponding to the sense sequence were used as controls. Briefly, 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA was incubated with 10× digoxigenin (DIG) RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) as well as 5× transcription buffer (Promega) and an RNA polymerase T7, T3, or SP6 for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and probes were then cleaned over G-50 MicroSpin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The DIG-labeled probes, diluted in hybridization buffer (1× NaCl, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA, 1× Denhardt's solution) were added to slides and incubated overnight at 65 °C. Sections were washed three times at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 1× SSC, with 0.1% Tween-20 and then twice at room temperature in MABT (100 mm maleic acid, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). The slides were blocked with MABT plus 5% normal goat serum for 3-4 h. The hybridized DIG-labeled probe was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a dilution of 1:2000 and visualized with the chromogen combination 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT). The single probe in situ hybridization sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red (Vector). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed after in situ hybridization. These slides were soaked in immunogen stabilizing buffer (1 mm citric acid, 8 mm sodium citrate) for 20 min at 65 °C to retrieve the antigen. Immunohistochemistry was then carried out as previously described (16Lawson M.A. MacConell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The GnRH peptide was recognized with the LR-1 antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 (gift of R. Benoit) and visualized using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ABC kit (Vector). Counting of the GnRH-positive neurons was carried out by sectioning whole embryo heads (starting from the inner ear upon appearance of the cochlear partition) in sagittal orientation at ∼10-μm thickness and performing in situ hybridization on all sections as described above to identify GnRH-expressing cells. All sections were tallied to obtain the number of GnRH-positive cells. Approximately 150 sections were analyzed per embryo head for the earlier developmental stages, and 250 sections were analyzed per embryo head for the later developmental stage. Three or more embryos were examined at each time point with the exception of the Dlx1&2 embryos analyzed at 16.5 dpc, which represent two whole embryo heads. Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA extraction was carried out as described by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed according to the methods of Pernasetti et al. (36Pernasetti F. Vasilyev V.V. Rosenberg S.B. Bailey J.S. Huang H.-J. Miller W.L. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2284-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PCR analysis was done with 30 cycles of: 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at the proper annealing temperature for the primers, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by an elongation step for 10 min at 72 °C. Specific primers for Msx1-3, Dlx1-6, and β-actin were used in the PCR reaction. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Msx and Dlx Are Candidates for Regulating GnRH during Embryonic Development—Although ongoing research has examined the human and mouse GnRH gene promoters, the rat gene has been investigated most extensively. The two well characterized regulatory regions of the rat GnRH gene are a 300-bp enhancer located at -1863 to -1571 relative to the start site and an evolutionarily conserved 173-bp promoter just 5′ of the transcriptional start site. Within these regulatory regions, four conserved, consensus homeodomain sites (ATTA) have been identified (Fig. 1, panel A) (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1509-1522PubMed Google Scholar). These sites were extensively characterized and shown to be essential for appropriate basal and cell-specific expression of the GnRH promoter (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1509-1522PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, identifying the transcriptional regulators that occupy and function through these homeodomain sites is important for understanding the regulation of GnRH transcriptional activity. Several candidate homeoproteins were considered for their binding properties, developmental expression patterns, and transcriptional activity, among them the MSX and DLX families of transcriptional regulators. Given the previously described similarities in expression patterns of these transcription factors and the septohypothalamic population of GnRH neurons (24Porteus M.H. Bulfone A. Liu J.K. Puelles L. Lo L.C. Rubenstein J.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6370-6383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we sought to compare the expression patterns of Dlx1, Dlx2, Dlx5, Msx1, and Msx2 to that of GnRH in the embryonic forebrain and nasal region during development. Adjacent series of parasagittal sections were taken from mouse embryos at age 13.5 dpc, when the septohypothalamic population of GnRH neurons has been established. By RNA in situ hybridization, we observed a trail of GnRH-expressing neurons localizing from the olfactory placode, along the olfactory nerve and crossing the cribriform plate into the anterior forebrain, caudal to the olfactory bulb, in a region termed the primordium of the septum (Fig. 1, panels B, E, and H). Adjacent sections show strong expression of Msx1 and 2 (panels G and I, respectively) as well as Dlx1, 2, and 5 (panels C, D, and F, respectively) in the nasal region and anterior forebrain, consistent with their previously reported expression patterns. These results indicate that the spatial expression of these Msx and Dlx family members correlates with the developing septohypothalamic GnRH neuronal population. We then examined the expression of Msx and Dlx family members in the model GnRH neuronal lines, GT1-7 and NLT/GN11. Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed on RNA from the GT1-7, GN11, NLT, and NIH3T3 cell lines, as well as total olfactory bulb RNA to assess the Msx and Dlx family members being expressed. Msx1, 2, and 3, as well as Dlx2, 4, 5, and 6, were expressed in the GT1-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, NLT cells expressed Msx2 and 3 but not Msx1, and Dlx1 but not Dlx2 through 6. This same expression profile was seen in GN11 cells (data not shown). As expected, based on previous observations in vivo, Dlx family members were expressed in the olfactory bulb (37Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W. Yu G. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 414: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, the NIH3T3 cells served as a negative control for expression of Msx1 or Dlx2 (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct members of the Dlx and Msx families are expressed in the different GnRH model cell lines. Consistent with the RT-PCR studies in vitro, we found that both Msx and Dlx family members co-expressed with GnRH-positive neurons at embryonic stages. Using RNA probes for the Msx and Dlx family members and an antibody recognizing the GnRH peptide, we performed double in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry on sagittal sections of 13.5-dpc embryos. Fig. 2B shows expression of Msx1 in the olfactory epithelium and along the olfactory sensory neuron tracts in the nasal region and GnRH-immunoreactive neurons expressing Msx1 in this region (Fig. 2B, expanded panel). Msx2 exhibited a similar expression pattern to that of Msx1 and neurons co-expressing Msx2 and GnRH along the olfactory sensory neuron tracts in the nasal region were observed (Fig. 2C, expanded panel). Fig. 2D indicates GnRH neurons located along the cribriform plate and in the forebrain primordium of the septum that expressed Dlx1 (expanded panel). Dlx2 exhibited a similar expression pattern to that of Dlx1 and also was co-expressed with GnRH-positive neurons (Fig. 2E, expanded panel). Like Dlx1 and 2, Dlx5 was expressed in GnRH-positive cells in the forebrain. However, we also observed GnRH neurons in the nasal region expressing Dlx5 (data not shown). These results show that Msx and Dlx are expressed in the GnRH-positive neurons during embryonic development and are plausible candidates for regulating GnRH promoter activity through the conserved homeodomain binding sites. DLX and MSX Bind to Conserved ATTA Sequences in the GnRH Enhancer and Promoter—Previously, detailed analyses of the protein complexes binding to the ATTA homeodomain sites in the upstream region of the GnRH gene suggested that they are composed of Q50 homeodomain proteins (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1509-1522PubMed Google Scholar). MSX and DLX are members of the Antennapedia class of non-Hox homeodomain proteins that contain a glutamine residue at amino acid position 50 (Gln-50) of the homeodomain (38Gauchat D. Mazet F. Berney C. Schummer M. Kreger S. Pawlowski J. Galliot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MSX and DLX have been shown to mediate transcription by binding consensus ATTA sites in upstream regulatory regions (28Zhang H. Hu G. Wang H. Sciavolino P. Iler N. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2920-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that one or more members of the MSX and DLX families may regulate GnRH transcription by binding to ATTA sequences within the promoter and enhancer. To determine whether these proteins could directly bind to the ATTA sequences in the GnRH enhancer and promoter, we performed EMSA with antibody supershifts (Fig. 3). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the homeodomain sites of the GnRH enhancer and promoter were incubated with nuclear extracts from GT1-7 cells. As described previously (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1509-1522PubMed Google Scholar), a specific complex was formed in GT1-7 nuclear extracts incubated with probes containing the ATTA sequences of the GnRH enhancer or promoter. Interestingly, a faint complex of faster mobility than the major complex also formed. This minor complex had been observed previously but not characterized (17Kelley C.G. Givens M.L. Rave-Harel N. Nelson S.B. Anderson S. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2413-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Nelson S.B. Lawson M.A. Kelley C.G. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1509-1522PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of an antibody specific to MSX1 inhibited protein binding of the major complex (thick arrow). In contrast, an antibody against DLX2 supershifted the minor complex (thin arrow) on the probe representing the 5′-enhancer site, -1642/-1623 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) as well as the complex formed on the promoter element (data not shown). These results indicate that the complexes formed in GT1-7 cells on the ATTA sites within the GnRH enhancer and promoter contain DLX2 and MSX1. The EMSA binding pattern with the GT1-7 nuclear proteins on the DNA probe corresponding to the GnRH enhancer homeodomain binding site (-1642/-1623) is unique in comparison to many other patterns observed from non-GnRH producing cell li"

GHR is a target for inducible metalloprotease-mediated cleavage in its perimembranous extracellular domain, a process that liberates the extracellular domain as the soluble GH-binding protein and leaves behind a cell-associated GHR remnant protein containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. GHR metalloproteolysis can be catalyzed by tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM-17) and is associated with down-modulation of GH signaling. We now study the fate of the GHR remnant protein. By anti-GHR cytoplasmic domain immunoblotting, we observed that the remnant induced in response to phorbol ester or platelet-derived growth factor has a reliable pattern of appearance and disappearance in both mouse preadipocytes endogenously expressing GHR and transfected fibroblasts expressing rabbit GHR. Lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, did not appreciably change the time course of remnant appearance or clearance but allowed detection of the GHR stub, a receptor fragment slightly smaller than the remnant but containing the C terminus of the remnant (receptor cytoplasmic domain). In contrast, MG132, another (less specific) proteasome inhibitor, strongly inhibited remnant clearance and prevented stub appearance. Inhibitors of γ-secretase, an aspartyl protease, also prevented the appearance of the stub, even in the presence of lactacystin, and concomitantly inhibited remnant clearance in the same fashion as MG132. In addition, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1/2) knockouts recapitulated the γ-secretase inhibitor studies, as compared with their littermate controls (PS1/2 wild type). Confocal microscopy indicated that the GHR cytoplasmic domain became localized to the nucleus in a fashion dependent on PS1/2 activity. These data indicate that the GHR is subject to sequential proteolysis by metalloprotease and γ-secretase activities and may suggest GH-independent roles for the GHR.

It transduces signals in response to GH by coupling to activation of the STAT (1, 3, and 5b), mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways to affect the expression of various target genes, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, serine protease inhibitor 2.1 (Spi2.1), and c-fos, and other aspects of cellular function (4Frank S.J.

This cleavage also yields a soluble GHR form comprised of the extracellular domain of the receptor, which is referred to as the GH-binding protein (GHBP), in correspondence with the high affinity GH-binding protein found in the circulation of many species (16Baumann G. J. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 14: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In humans and rabbits (and likely in many other species), this process of proteolytic shedding of the GHR extracellular domain accounts for the generation of GHBP in vivo (16Baumann G. J. Pediatr. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 14: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By use of hydroxamate-based inhibitors and genetic reconstitution strategies, we have previously implicated metalloprotease activity as required for inducible GHR proteolysis in cell culture systems and have identified a particular transmembrane metalloprotease, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM-17), as a GHBP sheddase (13Alele J.

This was accomplished by purifying the remnant protein and performing N-terminal amino acid sequencing, confirming that the remnant contains the transmembrane domain and the remaining 8–9 (depending on species) extracellular domain residues, as well as the cytoplasmic domain. This pattern of ADAM-catalyzed metalloproteolytic cleavage in the proximal extracellular domain is similar to that observed for a number of cell surface proteins, including pro-tumor necrosis factor-α, pro-transforming growth factor-α, pro-heparin-binding-epidermal growth factor, the tumor necrosis factor receptors, type II interleukin-1 receptor, interleukin-2 receptor-α, interleukin-6 receptor, amyloid precursor protein (APP), Notch, p75NTR, and ErbB-4 (Refs. 20Black R.A.

Some proteins that undergo extracellular domain metalloprotease-mediated cleavage also exhibit a subsequent cleavage of their resultant transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain remnants within the transmembrane domain. For these proteins, which include, among others, APP, Notch, p75NTR, and ErbB-4, this intramembranous cleavage is mediated by a protein complex known as γ-secretase (22Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S.

Formation of an active γ-secretase complex depends upon four proteins: presenilin, APH-1, nicastrin (APH-2), and Pen-2 (32Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Coexpression of these proteins is sufficient for reconstitution of γ-secretase activity in yeast, which not only lacks this protease activity but also has no apparent orthologs of these proteins (33Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Of these four proteins, it is believed that presenilin itself forms the catalytic core by functioning as an aspartyl protease (32Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase-mediated cleavage of proteins creates soluble intracellular domains that have signaling functions; thus, this process, referred to as regulated intramembrane proteolysis, has attracted increasing interest as an important mechanism for modulating cellular responsiveness. In this report, we explored the fate of the metalloprotease-generated GHR remnant protein. Using both endogenous GHR-expressing cells and GHR reconstitution systems, we demonstrate that the remnant has a characteristic time course of degradation. Our results indicate that the remnant undergoes transition into a slightly smaller form (the “stub”; see Fig. 9) that is itself degraded in a proteasome activity-dependent fashion. This remnant-to-stub transition is inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors and does not occur in cells devoid of presenilins, suggesting that the GHR remnant is a direct substrate for presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage. Further, in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we detect γ-secretase-dependent accumulation of the GHR cytoplasmic domain in the nucleus. The parallels revealed by our studies between the GHR and other γ-secretase substrates, such as APP and Notch, suggest that a functional role(s) for metalloprotease/γ-secretase cleavage of GHR may exist.

For immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-GHRcyt-AL47 was purified as follows. An IgG fraction was purified using protein A-Sepharose (nProtein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences). Bound antibodies were acideluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and neutralized with one-tenth volume Tris-HCl (1 m), pH 9.0. NaCl was then added to 150 mm. The eluted antibodies were then adsorbed against Escherichia coli acetone powder, as described (49Harlow E. Lane M.D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Cell Stimulation, Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—Serum starvation of all cell lines was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Roche Applied Science) for serum in their respective culture media for 16–20 h prior to experiments. Stimulations were performed at 37 °C.

However, the TCR/CD3-initiated signaling events are increased in intensity compared with those in normal T cells (10Tsokos G.C. Nambiar M.P. Tenbrock K. Juang Y.T. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 259-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Specifically, cross-linking of the CD3-TCR complex in SLE T cells leads to increased free intracytoplasmic calcium levels (11Vassilopoulos D. Kovacs B. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2269-2281PubMed Google Scholar) and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins (7Liossis S.N. Ding D.Z. Dennis G.J. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1448-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This “overexcitability” of the SLE T cell has been attributed to the fact that the missing TCR ζ chain is replaced by the FcRγ chain (12Enyedy E.J. Nambiar M.P. Liossis S.N. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the surface membrane lipid rafts are aggregated (13Krishnan S. Nambiar M.P. Warke V.G. Fisher C.U. Mitchell J. Delaney N. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 7821-7831Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because replenishment of the TCR ζ chain in SLE T cells corrects signaling aberrations and increases interleukin-2 production (14Nambiar M.P. Fisher C.U. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Mitchell J.P. Delaney N. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1948-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is clear that the decreased TCR ζ chain expression is central in the disease process. The molecular mechanisms of diminished expression of the TCR ζ mRNA and protein in SLE T cells remain unknown. The TCR ζ gene spans at least 31 kb, and the transcript is generated as a spliced product of 8 exons that are separated by distances of 0.7 to more than 8 kb (15Pang M. Abe T. Fujihara T. Mori S. Tsuzaka K. Amano K. Koide J. Takeuchi T. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Jensen J.P. Hou D. Ramsburg M. Taylor A. Dean M. Weissman A.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2563-2571PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the TCR ζ gene showed increased frequency of alternatively spliced (AS) forms missing various exons as well as splice insertion in SLE T cells (17Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Wong H.K. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1336-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) showed a novel 344-bp AS form with a deletion of nucleotides from 672 to 1233 of exon VIII of the TCR ζ mRNA. Using a specific primer that spans either side of the newly identified alternatively spliced site, we recently reported that the AS form of TCR ζ mRNA with 344 bp 3′ UTR was predominantly expressed in SLE T cells compared with normal T cells (14Nambiar M.P. Fisher C.U. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Mitchell J.P. Delaney N. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1948-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In SLE T cells, defective TCR ζ protein expression inversely correlates with the level of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR (18Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and directly with WT 3′ UTR. Thus, a molecular switching of TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR to AS 3′ UTR in T cells contributes to the regulation of TCR ζ chain expression. Several AS isoforms of the TCR ζ mRNA with different nucleotide sequences of the 3′ UTR have been recently identified in murine T cells (19Nocentini G. Ronchetti S. Bartoli A. Testa G. D'Adamio F. Riccardi C. Migliorati G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1405-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The expression of these TCR ζ mRNA isoforms with alternatively spliced 3′ UTR can be modulated by exposure to pharmacologic agents (20Giunchi L. Nocentini G. Ronchetti S. Bartoli A. Riccardi C. Migliorati G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 195: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Ronchetti S. Nocentini G. Giunchi L. Bartoli A. Moraca R. Riccardi C. Migliorati G. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 178: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The regulation of mRNA decay rate is an important control point in determining the abundance of cellular transcripts (22Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The 3′ UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs are known to play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by modulating nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport, polyadenylation status, subcellular targeting, translation efficiency, stability, and rates of degradation (23Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Jacquier A. Brewer G. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20154-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Nishimori T. Inoue H. Hirata Y.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 2496-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Selective expression of TCR ζ mRNA with very short AS 3′ UTR in SLE suggests that it plays an important role in the down-regulation of TCR ζ chain expression in SLE T cells. Therefore, we conducted studies to determine the stability of TCR ζ mRNA with an AS 3′ UTR in SLE T cells and the transport and subsequent translation of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR in normal and SLE T cells. In this report we demonstrate that AS 3′ UTR confers instability to the TCR ζ mRNA, as it does to the mRNA of other genes, and thus contributes to decreased levels of TCR ζ mRNA. In addition, we show that the TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR displayed poor translation efficiency leading to the production of low amounts of protein. Therefore, the production of TCR ζ mRNA with short 3′ UTR represents a molecular mechanism that contributes to decreased expression of TCR ζ chain in SLE T cells. SLE Subjects and Controls—Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria for SLE (26Tan E.M. Cohen A.S. Fries J.F. Masi A.T. McShane D.J. Rothfield N.F. Schaller J.G. Talal N. Winchester R.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1982; 25: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12339) Google Scholar) were chosen for the study. Subjects who were on prednisone were asked not to take this medication at least 24 h before drawing the blood. Disease activity for the SLE patients was scored by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) system. Our studies included patients with SLEDAI scores ranging from 0 to 20. The protocol of the study was approved by the Human Use Committees of the involved institutes. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. Cells and Antibodies—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heparinized venous blood were obtained by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll. T cells were isolated by magnetic separation of non-T cells using a mixture of hapten-conjugated antibodies and MACS microbeads coupled to anti-hapten mAb as described earlier (17Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Wong H.K. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1336-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). In all cases, the percentage of T cells in the isolated subpopulation was >97% as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The TCR ζ chain mAb 6B10.2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) recognizing amino acids 31–45 of the polypeptide (N-terminal mAb) was purchased from BD Biosciences. The C-terminal TCR ζ chain mAb recognizing amino acids 145–161 (28Hall C.G. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Science. 1993; 261: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). CD3-PE was from Sigma. OKT3 was from Orthoclone Biotech (Raritan, NJ). CD4-PE, CD8-PE, and CD14-PE were from Immunotech (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL), CD16-PE was from BD Biosciences. Fluorescent isotype controls were purchased either from Sigma, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), or BD Biosciences. RT-PCR of TCR ζ mRNA with Wild-type and Alternatively Spliced 3′ Untranslated Region—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) from 5 million T cells from SLE or normal volunteers according to the supplier's directions. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using the AMV reverse transcriptase-based reverse transcription system from Promega (Madison, WI) and oligo(dT) primer as instructed by the manufacturer. The primers for the amplification were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The 5′ primer for the PCR amplification of WT and AS TCR ζ mRNA was 5′-AGC CTC TGC CTC CCA GCC TCT TTC TGA G-3′ (sense bp 34–62 according to the numbering of Weissman et al.; Ref. 2Weissman A.M. Hou D. Orloff D.G. Modi W.S. Seuanez H. O'Brien S.J. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9709-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Sigma-Genosys). The 3′ primer for the specific amplification of TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR was 5′-CAA CAG TCT GTG TGT GAA GGT TTG GAG-3′ (antisense bp 737–711). This primer is located in the splice-deleted region of the TCR ζ mRNA (Fig. 1) and is absent in TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR. TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR was specifically amplified by a primer that spans both sides of the AS site, making it non-complementary, and will not anneal with the WT TCR ζ mRNA. The sequence of this primer is 5′-CAT CTT CTG GCC CTT CAG TGG CTG AGA AGA GTG AA-3′ (antisense bp 1235–1234 and 671–649). β-actin was used as a control, and the primers were forward, 5′-CAT GGG TCA GAA GGA TTC CT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGC TGG TAG CTC TTC TCC A-3′. The reverse transcription product was diluted 2- to 5-fold and used for PCR amplification of TCR ζ mRNA or β-actin control. The amplification was carried out with a high fidelity PCR system from Roche Applied Science in a Biometra T-3 thermal cycler after initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, 33 cycles at 94 °C, 45 s; 67 °C, 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. 10–15 μl of the PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2–1.5% SeaKem-agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and visualized with ethidium bromide or SYBR green staining. Quantitation of the RT-PCR product was done using the software GEL-PRO (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Real-time Quantitative PCR of TCR ζ mRNA with Wild-type and Alternatively Spliced 3′ UTR—Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out with a Cepheid Smart Thermocycler by adding SYBR green to the reaction mixture. The SYBR green-based real-time quantitative PCR technique was used to detect the expression of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR. PCR beads were used for amplification (Amersham Biosciences), and the amplification was carried out in 25-μl tubes. Total RNA was prepared from normal and SLE T cells, and 1 μg of RNA was reversed transcribed into cDNA and diluted 10-fold for real-time quantitative PCR. The PCR mixture consists of 2 μl of diluted cDNA, 5 μl of SYBR green diluted (1:500) containing PCR master mixture, and 150 μm each primer in a total volume 25 μl. The specific primers for real-time quantitative PCR were designed as above by Sigma-Genosys. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out with a Cepheid Smart Thermocycler by adding SYBR green (1:500 dilution) to the reaction mixture. The condition for real-time quantitative PCR was initial denaturation of 94 °C for 60 s followed by cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 67 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 45 cycles, followed by a melting point determination that results in a single peak if the amplification is specific. Real-time quantitative PCR products were also separated on a 1.5% agarose gel to visualize the formation of correct PCR products. The expression level for each gene was shown by the cycle numbers needed for the cDNA to be amplified to reach a threshold. The cycle numbers were also converted into arbitrary amounts of DNA using standard curves generated for each pair of primers, and the results were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA in the same sample. The cycle threshold value was generated by ABI PRISM 7700 SDS software version 1.7 and then exported to an Excel spreadsheet where equations from the standard curve were generated. Using the cycle threshold values, concentrations of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR as well as GAPDH mRNAs were calculated from the equations. Each sample was analyzed at two different concentrations, and the result from the linear portion of the standard curve was presented. Samples were analyzed in triplicate at each concentration, and TCR mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR levels were normalized to the corresponding GAPDH. PCR Amplification, Cloning, and Expression of the Wild-type and Alternatively Spliced TCR ζ mRNA from T Cells—cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by oligo(dT) primer and AMV reverse transcriptase as described above. The full-length TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-AGC CTC TGC CTC CCA GCC TCT TTC TGA G-3′ (sense bp 34–62) and 5′-CCC TAG TAC ATT GAC GGG TTT TTC CTG-3′ (antisense bp 1472–1446). The amplification was carried out using a high fidelity PCR system from Roche Applied Science in a Biometra T-3 thermal cycler after initial denaturation at 94 °C for 6 min, 33 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min; 67 °C, 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products containing 1438 bp WT and 916 bp AS TCR ζ were ligated to unidirectional pcDNA 3.1 His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Minipreps were prepared from 12 recombinant clones, and the direction of the insert was verified by restriction mapping using BamHI 1. Wild-type and AS TCR ζ clones with proper orientation were subjected to DNA sequencing from both orientations on an ABI 377 sequencer using the ABI dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (ABI PRISM; Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Transfection of TCR ζ with WT and AS 3′ UTR to COS-7 cells—The day before transfection, COS-7 cells were subcultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin streptomycin at 37 °C ina5%CO2 incubator. For transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in 250 μl of Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). 15 μg of plasmid pcDNA 3.1 V5 HIS TOPO containing TCR ζ with WT or AS 3′ UTR was added and electroporated at 250 V, 960 μF in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were immediately washed in medium and cultured. Transfected cells were lysed at different time points after incubation with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), and the mRNA was isolated after lysis of the cell membrane by Nonidet P-40 (7Liossis S.N. Ding D.Z. Dennis G.J. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1448-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The WT and AS TCR ζ mRNA were transcribed and translated using the TNT T7 quick-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translational system as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). 10 μg of plasmids containing WT or AS TCR ζ was incubated with the transcription/translation system in the presence of Transcend Botin-Lysyl-tRNA for 60 min at 30 °C. The translated product was electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The incorporated biotinylated lysine was detected non-radioactively by blotting with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and developed using an ECL chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Construction and Transient Transfection—The full-length 3′ UTRs of WT and AS of TCR ζ mRNA were amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI site downstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-Basic and Enhancer vector(s) (Promega). Transcription from this construct is driven by an SV40 promoter. The correct orientations of the clones were verified by restriction mapping and sequencing. Plasmid DNA transfections of Jurkat cells, COS-7 cells, and T cells were carried out in 24-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The day before transfection, 6 × 104 COS-7 cells or 0.6 × 106 Jurkat cells were plated in 0.5 ml of medium/well. For each well, Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (2–3 μl) was mixed with plasmid DNA (1.5 μg) in serum-free Opti-MEM to allow DNA-Lipofectamine™ reagent complexes to form. The complexes were added to respective wells and mixed by gently rocking the plate back and forth. The transfected cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline three times. Luciferase Activity Assays—Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the transfected cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 18 h and then lysed with 60 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 rpm. Luciferase activity was assayed with 20 μl of lysate and 80 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) using a commercially available kit (Promega). Light output was measured over a 10-s time period in triplicate for each sample. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by averaging the readings. Transfection efficiency was established in all samples by cotransfection with 1 μg of a plasmid encoding the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase gene. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. The data are presented as -fold increase in luciferase activity compared with that obtained from cells transfected with vector alone. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—Densitometry analysis of the Western blot was performed with the software program GelPro (Media Cybernetics). Statistical analysis was done using the software Minitab Version 13 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA) by applying the Student's t test. Stability of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR in SLE T Cells— Cloning and sequence analysis of TCR ζ mRNA revealed the presence of a novel TCR ζ chain transcript with alternatively spliced 3′ UTR in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 1). Although the TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR was detected at low levels in normal human T cells, it was found to be predominantly expressed in SLE T cells (18Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because a vast majority of lupus patients display decreased expression of TCR ζ mRNA (7Liossis S.N. Ding D.Z. Dennis G.J. Tsokos G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1448-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 17Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Wong H.K. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1336-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we considered the TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR to be more unstable than the TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR. Accordingly, purified T cells were incubated with transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for different periods of time (0, 1, 2, and 4 h), and the levels of expression of WT and AS 3′ UTR TCR ζ mRNA were quantitated by semiquantitative RT-PCR using specific primers as described under “Materials and Methods.” By calculating the quantity of mRNA as a percentage of the amount at 0 h, we determined that the levels of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR were reduced compared with the WT ζ mRNA in SLE T cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We also compared the stability of the TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR to that with the AS 3′ UTR after calculating the ratio of the levels of each mRNA to β-actin mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2C, the stability of AS TCR ζ mRNA is decreased compared with the WT 3′ UTR in SLE T cells (Fig. 2C). Stability of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR in Normal T Cells—To address the question whether the decreased half-life of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR is restricted to SLE T cells, we analyzed the stability of TCR ζ mRNA in normal T cells. Purified normal T cells were incubated with transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for different periods of time, and the levels of TCR ζ mRNA expression with WT and AS 3′ UTR were measured in parallel. We observed that the mRNA stability of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR was also low in normal T cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Although the stability of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR was low in normal cells, it was not as prominent as it was recorded in SLE T cells. After 4 h of incubation with actinomycin D, the amount of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR was 17 and 33% in SLE and normal T cells, respectively (Figs. 2B and 3B). However, the rate of degradation of TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR was not significantly different between SLE and normal T cells. Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR in SLE and Normal T Cells—We used a quantitative real-time RT-PCR to measure the stability of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR in SLE T cells and normal T cells treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h to confirm the observed differences in the stability of the TCR ζ mRNA with WT or AS 3′ UTR. The mRNA from the samples were converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase. The reverse transcription product of cDNA was PCR amplified using TCR ζ WT- and AS 3′ UTR-specific primers in the presence of SYBR green in a Cepheid thermocycler as described under “Materials and Methods.” To validate the real-time quantitative PCR, the standard curves for TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR and GAPDH cDNA were constructed first (data not shown). The cycle threshold values for TCR ζ mRNA with WT/AS 3′ UTR and GAPDH mRNA in the sample were measured in triplicate by real-time quantitative PCR, and the amounts of these mRNA were determined from the standard curves. TCR ζ mRNA with WT or AS 3′ UTR was evaluated as the relative quantity against GAPDH mRNA in the cells before treatment with actinomycin D (Fig. 4). Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that WT 3′ UTR mRNA was more stable than AS 3′ UTR mRNA during the first 4 h. These results also show that TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR (AS mRNA: GAPDH mRNA = 0 h, p = 0.037; 4 h, p = 0.005) in SLE degraded to a greater extent compared with WT 3′ UTR (WT mRNA: GAPDH mRNA = 0 h, p = 0.017; 4 h, p = 0.009) after 4 h of incubation with actinomycin D in SLE T cells (WT 3′ UTR, p = 0.042 and AS 3′ UTR, p = 0.007) (Fig. 4A). The stability of TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR (WT mRNA: GAPDH mRNA = 0 h, p = 0.06; 4h, p = 0.03) and AS 3′ UTR (AS mRNA: GAPDH mRNA = 0h, p = 0.005; 4 h, p = 0.001) was also analyzed in normal T cell by real-time quantitative PCR (WT 3′ UTR, p = 0.05 and AS 3′ UTR, p = 0.015) (Fig. 4B). The results show that TCR ζ mRNA with WT 3′ UTR degraded to a lower extent compared with the TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR after 4 h of incubation with actinomycin D (Fig. 4). Stability of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR in COS-7 Cells— Next we studied the stability of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR transfected in COS-7 cells. TCR ζ with WT or AS 3′ UTR was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO, and transfected to COS-7 cells. After 18 h of transfection, the cells were incubated with actinomycin D for 0 or 4 h, and the mRNA were measured by RT-PCR analysis. Although in COS-7 cells there was no significant degradation of TCR ζ mRNA by 4 h, by 8 h we recorded a significant decrease in the level of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR compared with WT 3′ UTR (Fig. 5). To rule out that the difference was due to differences in export from nucleus or transport of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR from nucleus to cytoplasm as a result of alternative splicing, the transfected cells were lysed at different time points after incubation with actinomycin D and mRNA was isolated after lysis of the cell membrane by Nonidet P-40. Levels of TCR ζ mRNA with WT and AS 3′ UTR were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The data showed that the ratio of TCR ζ mRNA between the cytoplasm and nucleus was similar at different points, suggesting that alternative splicing of TCR ζ 3′ UTR does not affect the transport of the TCR ζ mRNA (data not shown). Translational Regulation of TCR ζ Expression in COS-7 Cells Transfected with TCR ζ Carrying WT and AS 3′ UTR—Our previous data showed that the down-regulation of TCR ζ protein in SLE T cells inversely correlated with the level of TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR (18Nambiar M.P. Enyedy E.J. Warke V.G. Krishnan S. Dennis G. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that, although the coding region is intact in TCR ζ mRNA with AS 3′ UTR, the transl"
https://openalex.org/W2012564453,"The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors regulates the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes involved in the regulation and function of the immune system. NFAT activity is regulated by the phosphatase calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates the NFAT N-terminal regulatory domain, a critical step required for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Here we show that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK activates NFATc2-dependent transcription. Mass spectrometry revealed that JNK phosphorylates at least six residues within the NFATc2 regulatory domain in vitro. Transfection of cells with a chimeric construct encoding the GAL-4 DNA binding domain linked to wild-type NFATc2 showed that JNK stimulates the NFATc2 transactivation domain in activated Jurkat T lymphocytes, an effect that is inhibited by dominant-negative versions of JNK. Likewise, the mutation of the phosphorylation sites identified revealed that Thr116 and Ser170 are critical for the transactivation of NFATc2 by JNK. In addition, clustered mutation of the SP-conserved motifs of NFATc2 showed that SP1 and SP2, but not SP3, are also important for the inducible transactivation of NFATc2. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of NFATc2-transfected cells indicated that the activation of the JNK pathway results in the in vivo phosphorylation of Thr116. Our results indicate that, unlike other NFAT members, the transcriptional activity of NFATc2 is up-regulated by JNK. JNK-mediated phosphorylation of NFATs thus appears to play a differential physiological role among NFAT family members.

JNK-mediated phosphorylation of NFATs thus appears to play a differential physiological role among NFAT family members. Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a common process in the regulation of most cellular functions.

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The major role of these enzymes is to amplify and integrate signals from a wide variety of extracellular stimuli, thereby allowing cells to respond and adapt to changes in their environment. MAPK signal transduction pathways control many processes, including gene expression, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, differentiation, transformation, and programmed cell death. The MAPK family comprises the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), the p38 MAPKs, and the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNK). All MAPKs are activated through the dual phosphorylation of conserved TXY motifs by upstream kinases termed MAPK kinases (MAPKK), which are themselves activated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation by the third component of the MAPK system, the MAPKK kinases (MAPKKK). Members of the SAPK/JNK family phosphorylate the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun and other transcription partners of AP-1 (2Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 3Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). There are at least three JNK MAPKs, called JNK-1, JNK-2, and JNK-3, and each is encoded by a different gene. Although the MAPKKs MKK4 and MKK7 have been established as specific activators of JNK, more than a dozen additional MAPKKKs are also known to activate this pathway (reviewed in Ref. 4Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). This huge diversity of activators allows a wide range of stimuli to activate JNK, although JNKs are more commonly activated in response to environmental stress or signaling through GTPases of the rho family, which can trigger the MAPKKK cascade pathway. Once activated, JNKs phosphorylate an array of different substrates ranging from transcription factors to apoptosis regulatory molecules, involving these kinases in regulation of cell viability, cellular stress, induction of apoptosis, and cell proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 4Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Unlike JNK-3, whose expression is restricted to brain, heart, and testis, isoforms 1 and 2 are ubiquitously expressed (reviewed in Ref. 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). Much attention has been paid, however, to their roles in T cell development and function (6Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In these cells, complete activation of JNK requires signals from both the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex and the costimulatory factor CD28. These signals, which can be replaced by combined treatment with the pharmacological agents phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore A23187 (Io), lead to T cell activation (7Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 8Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The transcription factors c-Jun and NFAT are JNK substrates, implicated in T cell function as effector molecules of JNK signaling in these cells. NFAT was initially identified in T cells as a transcription factor responsible for mediating Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent transcription of genes including IL-2 and other important cytokines involved in T cell activation (9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 10Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Further studies identified new members of the family that participate in many physiological processes in different cell types inside and outside of the immune system. The NFAT family of transcription factors contains five members, which are related to the Rel/NFκB family. Four of them NFATc1 (NFAT2/c), NFATc2 (NFAT1/p), NFATc3 (NFAT4/x), and NFATc4 (NFAT3) are regulated by calcineurin and share a highly homologous region located at their regulatory N-terminal domain (reviewed in Ref. 12Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Activation of these members is primarily regulated through the control of their subcellular localization. In the absence of Ca2+ signals, NFAT proteins are highly phosphorylated and remain in the cytoplasm of resting cells. When intracellular calcium levels rise, the phosphatase calcineurin is activated and dephosphorylates NFATs. This favors the exposure of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the masking of a nuclear export signal (NES), thus promoting the translocation of NFATs from the cytosol to the nucleus, their binding to target sequences, and therefore the transcription of different NFAT-dependent genes (12Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 13Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-dependent nuclear accumulation of NFAT is subject to further regulation by the activity of a number of serine/threonine kinases (14Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These either act in the nucleus to promote the export of nuclear NFAT, or, alternatively, in the cytosol to inhibit NFAT import. Many protein kinases, including the MAPK group (p38, JNK, and ERK), GSK3β, PKA, MEKK1, and CK1α, have been reported to phosphorylate different members of NFAT at different serine residues (15Chow C.W.

Biol. 2004; 24: 4184-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In most cases rephosphorylation is believed to facilitate NFAT inactivation and export to cytoplasm, there are data indicating that phosphorylation can also positively regulate NFAT transactivation. For example, Okamura et al. reported inducible phosphorylation within a functional site of the NFATc2 transactivation domain upon stimulation of T cells with PMA and Io (13Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In addition, Pim kinase 1 (25Rainio E.M. Sandholm J. Koskinen P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Cot kinase (26de Gregorio R. Iniguez M.A. Fresno M. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27003-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have been shown to phosphorylate NFATc1 and NFATc2, respectively, and to enhance their transactivation properties. Despite the importance of phosphorylation in the regulation of NFAT activity, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this process are little known. Particularly, it is still not clear which kinases phosphorylate NFATs under basal conditions and which ones mediate rephosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor after activation. Although proteomic analysis has allowed the identification of NFAT sites phosphorylated under basal conditions and after stimulation with PMA and Io (13Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the exact identification of sites dynamically phosphorylated by particular kinases upon cell activation using these techniques, are currently a technical challenge because of the implication of different kinases and phosphatases and the low stoichiometry of transient phosphorylation. We have previously shown that p38 and JNK MAPKs phosphorylate NFATc2 in vitro and interact with it in vivo. However, activation of the p38 pathway (but not JNK), results in the inhibition of NFATc2-driven transcription and nuclear accumulation (27Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this work we analyze the specific role of JNK pathway in the dynamic regulation of NFATc2 by phosphorylation, identifying by mass spectrometry amino acid residues of NFATc2 phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by JNK, and systematically addressing the physiological relevance of these sites. Our results show that activation of this pathway enhances the transcriptional activity of this factor, and that mutation of identified residues, located in conserved regions (Fig. 1) results in the inhibition of JNK-mediated NFAT transcriptional activity in Jurkat T cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa and Jurkat T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI medium respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and a penicillin-streptomycin mixture. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 (46Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) was purchased from Biomol, and PMA, Io, calcineurin, and calmodulin were purchased from Sigma. Expression Constructs and Transfections—Expression constructs for wild-type (wt) HA-tagged mouse NFATc2 (full-length), NFATLuc, MEKK1, JNK1, MKK6b(E), and p38α were as previously described (27Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GAL-DBD Luc was kindly provided by Rosario Perona, and JIP1, JBD, and JNK KR were kind gifts from Pura Muñoz. The empty vector pcDNA 3.0 was from Invitrogen. pAB GAL4-mouse NFATc2-(3–385) constructs were created by PCR from wt full-length HA-NFAT and subcloned into the pAB empty vector (47Baniahmad A. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) between the SalI and PvuII sites. Mutations were conducted with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, in accordance with the manufacturer's indications. Western blot experiments using extracts of HeLa cells transfected with 1 μg of each construct confirmed comparable expression levels (data not shown). Transfections in HeLa cells were performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were cotransfected at 60–70% confluence in OPTIMEM medium (Invitrogen). The transfection mixture consisted of 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid (one among NFAT Luc, IL-13 Luc, Ref. 32Macian F. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, or IL-4 Luc, Ref. 33Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the HA-mouse NFATc2 full-length expression plasmid (0.3 μg), and a kinase combination (0.3 μg each of constitutively active MKK6b (E) plus p38α, or constitutively active MEKK1 plus JNK1). In control experiments the empty vector pcDNA 3.0 (0.6 μg), from Invitrogen, was substituted for the kinase combination. Transfection took place over 3 h, and afterward cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h later, cells were split, and after one night of recovery were stimulated with PMA and Io. Luciferase was assayed with the luciferase kit from Promega. Jurkat T cells were also transfected with Lipofectamine reagent. In these experiments, 6 × 106 cells were cotransfected with 3 μg of total DNA distributed as follows: 0.1 μg of expression vector pAB GAL4 NFATc2 (wt or mutant); 1.2 μg of GAL-DBD Luc reporter plasmid; and either 1.8 μg of JIP1, JBD, or JNK KR, or 1.8 μg of pcDNA 3.0 empty vector, as indicated. For the JIP1 dose dependence experiment, the amounts of plasmid transfected were 1.8, 0.9, 0.45, and 0.2 μg, made up to 1.8 μg with pcDNA 3.0 empty vector as required. Transfections were performed for 4 h, and after that, cells were recultured in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. Stimuli were added 16 h post-transfection. Luciferase determination was as described for HeLa cells. When required, cells were stimulated with PMA and calcium ionophore at a concentration of 20 ng/ml and 1 μm, respectively, for 3–5 h. In the case of HeLa cells, we supplemented stimulation medium with 3 mm Ca2+ to obtain a strong NFAT dephosphorylation and activation. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 was added 1 h before stimulation, at a concentration of 20 μm. For in vivo phosphorylation experiments, HEK cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (48Rodriguez A. Flemington E.K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the constructs encoding the full-length FLAG-tagged NFATc2 (10 μg), MEKK1 (10 μg), and JNK1 (5 μg). In control experiments pcDNA 3.0 substituted the kinase combination. The total amount of DNA was completed up to 30 μg with pGL3 basic vector. Activation of JNK was determined by Western blot analysis using an antiphospho-JNK antibody purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (cat. 9251). In Vitro Calcineurin Binding Assay and Western Blot Experiments— The mouse NFAT N-terminal domain (amino acids 4–385) was HA-tagged and fused to GST. Mutants were based on this construct and were generated by using the Stratagene mutation kit. 1 μg of GST-NFAT (either wt or the indicated mutant), adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (from Amersham Biosciences), was incubated with 20 nm calcineurin and 600 nm calmodulin in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and a protease and phosphatase inhibitors mixture, in a final reaction volume of 60 μl. The reaction was incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 30 min. Beads were then washed five times with binding buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunodetection was done with purified mouse monoclonal anti-calcineurin antibody, acquired from Pharmingen (Pharmingen Europe), diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20. Western blot assays to check MAPK activation were performed on total extracts from 106 JK cells, lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm KCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and inhibitors (0.2 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed to sediment cellular debris. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunodetection. JNK activation was verified by c-Jun phosphorylation, using the monoclonal antiphospho-c-Jun antibody SC-822 purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology diluted 1:1000 in TBS-0.1% Tween. Phospho-Erk and phospho-p38 were detected with anti-ACTIVE™ MAPK from Promega (V6671), and antiphospho-p38 from Cell Signaling. Antibody binding was visualized in all cases using the enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL) system from Amersham Biosciences. In Vitro Kinase Assay and Proteolytic Digestions—1 μg of His-JNK2, kindly provided by Dr. J. Han (The Scripps Research Institute), and 2 μg of GST-HA-mouse NFATc2-(4–385) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction took place in the presence of 250 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP. Assays were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto a 7% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry and Phosphopeptide Mapping—The bands corresponding to phosphorylated proteins, were excised and digested with trypsin (Promega) or V8 (Sigma) proteases, as described (49Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Peptides extracted from radiolabeled bands were separated by reverse phase HPLC as described (50Ogueta S. Rogado R. Marina A. Moreno F. Redondo J.M. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectr. 2000; 35: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and analyzed by nanospray off-line with ion trap mass spectrometry as described (50Ogueta S. Rogado R. Marina A. Moreno F. Redondo J.M. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectr. 2000; 35: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 51Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectr. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using an LCQ Classic model (Finnigan, ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA). Peptides derived from the digestion of unlabeled NFAT bands, were alternatively analyzed by RP-HPLC-MS/MS using a 0.18 mm × 150 mm BioBasic 18 RP column (ThermoHypersil-Keystone), operating at ∼1.5 μl/min, connected to a Surveyor HPLC system on-line with a LCQ-DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Peptides were eluted using a 90-min gradient from 5 to 60% solvent B (solvent A: 0.5% acetic acid; solvent B: 0.5% acetic acid, 80% acetonitrile). Peptides were detected in survey scans from 400 to 1600 amu (8 μscans), followed by a ZoomScan and a MS/MS analysis, using an isolation width of 3 amu, a normalized collision energy of 35%. Phosphopeptides were mapped by two-dimensional separation on 20 × 20 thin layer cellulose plates purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis was carried out in a Hunter HTLE-7200 thin layer peptide mapping electrophoresis system (CBS Scientific Company, Del Mar, California). Gels were run for 45 min in pH 8.9 buffer containing 10% w/v ammonium carbonate. The chromatography dimension was performed overnight in standard phosphochromatography buffer composed of 3.7% n-butyl alcohol (v/v), 2.5% pyridine (v/v), and 0.75% (v/v) glacial acetic acid (52Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide signals were visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo Analysis of Phosphorylation—A minimum of 300 × 106 HEK cells were transfected as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, every 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and a combination of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors: leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Na3VO4, and NaF). The lysates were incubated at 4 °C on a rocking platform for 20 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g in a precooled centrifuge. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h with 10 μl of RIPA-equilibrated anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads to immunoprecipitate the FLAG-NFATc2 protein. Inmunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA and loaded onto a 6% gel for SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Sypro Ruby, and the band corresponding to NFATc2 was excised and trypsin digested. The mixture was then analyzed by RP-HPLC on-line with an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer, using the same HPLC setup and conditions as described above. Single ion reaction monitoring was programmed over selected ions along the entire gradient. JNK Activation Enhances NFAT-dependent Transcription— We have previously shown that activation of the p38, but not the JNK/MAPK pathway reduces NFATc2 nuclear accumulation upon cell stimulation and results in inhibition of NFAT-driven transcription. However, p38 and JNK both interact with NFATc2 in vivo (27Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For this reason, we decided to analyze the potential role of the JNK/MAPK pathway in the regulation of NFATc2. Fig. 1 shows the main regulatory sites in the regulatory domain of NFATc2 that are conserved among other NFAT family members, and indicates the positions of potential target sites for JNK-mediated phosphorylation analyzed in the experiments described here. We initially carried out transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells, in which NFATc2 has been shown to translocate to the nucleus in response to Ca2+/calcineurin stimulation (28Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 29Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We cotransfected cells with JNK and constitutively active MEKK1 to achieve complete activation of the JNK pathway, together with full-length NFATc2 and a luciferase reporter plasmid directed by a triple repeat of the NFAT/AP1 composite site from the interleukin-2 promoter (NFATLuc) (30Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activation of the JNK pathway led to an increase in NFAT-dependent transcription and further potentiated the activation provoked by pharmacological stimulation of cells with PMA and Io (Fig. 2A). In contrast, parallel cotransfections using constitutively active MKK6 and p38, to activate the p38 pathway, resulted in the predicted inhibition of NFAT-driven transcription (27Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Maldonado J.L. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13872-13878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the reporter construct used in these first experiments contains an NFAT/AP-1 composite site, the possibility exists that AP-1, not NFAT, could be the target of the JNK MAPK pathway (31Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2953) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a new set of experiments we examined the ability of JNK to activate NFAT-driven luciferase reporter plasmids, lacking NFAT:AP1 composite sites, such as those directed by the IL13 or the IL4 promoters (32Macian F. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Rao A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 33Szabo S.J. Gold J.S. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In both cases, the luciferase reporter activity was activated by JNK, which also potentiated the action of PMA and Io, and this activation was similar to that displayed by the composite NFAT/AP-1 (NFATLuc) reporter construct (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the JNK/MAPK pathway plays a role on the regulation of NFATc2. Mapping of the NFATc2 Residues Phosphorylated by JNK in Vitro.—To determine which of the NFATc2 residues phosphorylated by JNK could be responsible for the increased NFAT transcriptional activity we observed, we first performed in vitro phosphorylation experiments. We generated a recombinant construct containing the N-terminal part of NFATc2 protein (amino acids 4–385) fused to GST, and this construct was subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant His-JNK in the p"

In response to infection, IRF7 is activated by phosphorylation through the action of the non-canonical IκB kinases, IκB kinase-ϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1.

Phosphorylation patterns of these mutants were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and their transcriptional activity was monitored by reporter assays. Essential phosphorylation events were mapped to amino acids 437–438 and a redundant set of sites at either amino acids 429–431 or 441. IRF7 recovered from infected cells was heterogeneously phosphorylated at these sites, and greater phosphorylation correlated with increased transactivation.

Production of type I interferon in response to a wide variety of bacterial and viral infections is a major component of innate immunity and is essential to host defense against microbial invasion.

Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 805-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and transcriptionally activated in virus-infected cells. Transcriptional induction of the IFNα/β genes is a rapid biphasic process in most cell types; initial induction of IFNα4 and -β is dependent on the constitutively expressed transcription factor IRF3 and subsequent induction of the other members of the IFNα family (IRF7-dependent) is achieved after positive feedback resulting in IRF7 protein production and activation (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similar to many signaling pathways, the activating switch for transcription is achieved by phosphorylation of specific transcription factors. Transcription of the IFNβ gene is controlled by an enhanceosome composed of at least the AP1 transcription factor (c-jun-ATF2), phosphorylated by the c-Jun kinase, NFκB, released from its inhibitor IκB after phosphorylation-induced degradation through the action of the IκB kinase (composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ/NEMO), and IRF3 and IRF7, activated by phosphorylation. The kinases thought responsible for phosphorylating IRF3 and IRF7 have been recently identified as distant members of the IKK family, TBK1 and IKK-ϵ (or IKKi) (4Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M.

Similarly to IRF3 and IRF7, TBK1 is constitutively expressed, whereas IKK-ϵ is mainly induced by stress stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor α and lipopolysaccharide (6Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D.

Phosphorylation takes place on a stretch of serine/threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of the proteins. The primary structure of these two proteins is closely related, and, notably, an SSL motif, which has been shown to be essential for transcriptional activity, is conserved between IRF3 and IRF7 of every studied species. However, the IRF7 regulatory domain contains many more serine/threonine residues, and the exact phosphorylation sites have yet to be determined precisely. Although considerable work has been reported concerning the target sites of IRF3, much less has been done regarding the identification of IRF7 phosphorylation sites. As it has been described for IRF3, our previous observation showed that mutation of the proximal set of serine residues 425 and 426 of murine IRF7 into alanine abrogated virus-induced phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude the possibility that these residues were indispensable for proper conformation of the regulatory domain and that other residues were the bona fide targets of the virally induced kinases. Most recent work by Lin et al. (9Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Yang et al. (10Yang H.

However, Ser479, one residue believed to be a major target, is not conserved in murine IRF7 or IRF3. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of the proximal and distal sets of serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of IRF7. We show that multiple serine residues are target for phosphorylation. In particular, two distinct groups of serine, Ser425 and Ser426 and Ser437 and Ser438, are indispensable for virally induced activation of IRF7 in a partially redundant manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that secondary phosphorylation sites synergize with the primary targets, Ser437 and Ser438, to achieve maximal activation in response to viral infection. Moreover, we provide several lines of evidence that the essential nature of the proximal group of serine residues may not be mediated by phosphorylation. Instead, these residues are crucial for phosphorylation at distal sites possibly by maintaining the proper conformation of the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain or by serving as a recognition motif for the virally activated kinases. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells, monkey kidney COS cells, and murine TBK1-deficient immortalized embryo fibroblasts (a kind gift from W.-C. Yeh) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Transfections, Luciferase Assays, and Viral Infections—DNA transfections of 293T and COS cells were carried out by using standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation and DEAE-dextran methods, respectively. Transfection of TBK1-deficient fibroblasts was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates using commercial reagents as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega) and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity of a cotransfected CMV-lacZ plasmid measured on a luminescent substrate (Tropix). Each construct was tested in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Results shown are from a single experiment representative of results obtained. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Manhattan strain, was grown in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs (a kind gift from A. Garcia-Sastre), and viral infections were performed as previously described (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—FLAG-tagged full-length murine IRF7 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3 and IFNα6-luciferase constructs have been described previously (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged IKKϵ and FLAG-tagged IKKϵK38A expression vectors were kind gifts from T. Maniatis (7Peters R.T. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression constructs encoding different IRF7 point mutants (M1–M18) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) by using Pfu Turbo polymerase and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays for IKKϵ were performed after overexpression of the FLAG-tagged protein in 293T cells. After immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG (M2) beads (Sigma), the recovered protein was incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μl of WT or mutant peptide at a final concentration of 0, 50, 100, or 200 μm at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and quantification using a PhosphorImager. Peptides were custom synthesized at the Keck Foundation, Yale University, using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—Nuclear extracts for isoelectric focusing were prepared as described previously (11Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Extracts were loaded onto acrylamide gel strips containing 15 m urea, 3.5% Nonidet P-40, and 8% Pharmalyte™ 5-8 ampholins (Amersham Biosciences) and run at 200 V for 15 min, 300 V for 30 min, and 400 V overnight, followed by 800 V for 1 h. Gel strips were then equilibrated in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6,8, 1% SDS, and 20% glycerol for 1 h at room temperature prior to sealing on 7.5% SDS-PAGE for the second dimension electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and processed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG (M2) antibodies. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts of 293T transfected cells were prepared as previously described (11Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by incubating nuclear extracts of each sample (2 μg) with a 32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the IFN-stimulated response element sequence derived from the ISG15 gene (12Levy D.E. Methods. 1998; 15: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as described previously (13Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). IRF7 Is Phosphorylated on Multiple Serine Residues within Its Carboxyl-terminal Regulatory Domain—Virally induced phosphorylation is a prerequisite to initiate the presumed conformational changes responsible for unmasking the potent transactivation ability of IRF7. Previous work has mapped the phosphorylation events to a serine/threonine-rich domain in the carboxyl terminus of IRF7 and shown that a truncated mutant lacking the last 34 amino acids was unresponsive to viral infection (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sato M. Hata N. Asagiri M. Nakaya T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Targeted phosphorylation was further confirmed by phospho-amino acid analysis and phospho-peptide mapping of tryptic digests of IRF7. Virus infection led to an increase in IRF7 phosphoserine and the appearance of a single predominant novel V8 phosphopeptide. 2E. Smith and D. E. Levy, unpublished data. The 34-amino acid regulatory domain of IRF7 contains 8 serine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A). However, which of these residues becomes phosphorylated has not been determined. One of the assays commonly used to monitor IRF7 phosphorylation status is the appearance of a slower migrating band on SDS-PAGE. Although sensitive to qualitative changes in phosphorylation, this method cannot distinguish among multiple potential sites of phosphorylation. An alternative technique to detect different post-translational variants of the same protein is two-dimensional gel analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, WT IRF7 from uninfected cells can be resolved into three distinct electrophoretic subspecies. Although these different spots are very likely due to post-translational modifications, treatment with alkaline phosphatase did not affect their distribution, suggesting that phosphorylation is not the cause of the observed pattern. However, when a similar analysis was performed on extracts from NDV-infected cells, 4–5 additional spots were resolved. These additional isoforms of IRF7 were indeed due to phosphorylated species, because they disappeared after phosphatase treatment, collapsing into the basal pattern. This result shows that IRF7 can be phosphorylated at multiple distinct sites. It also indicates that virus infection does not achieve complete phosphorylation of the protein, leading to coexistence of several species bearing different degrees of phosphorylation. Interestingly, overexpression of either TBK1 or IKKϵ, kinases responsible for IRF7 phosphorylation, led to complete phosphorylation, shown by almost total disappearance of the pre-existing spots (Fig. 1B). This result showed that each of the three pre-existing species could be phosphorylated and that action of either kinase was sufficient to produce the same bulk phosphorylation pattern. Notably, overexpression of both kinases together did not lead to further alteration of the two-dimensional pattern (data not shown). Two Groups of Serine Are Necessary for Virally Induced Phosphorylation of IRF7—To determine the major targets of virally induced phosphorylation, we mutated each contiguous group of serine residues in the regulatory domain into alanine, a residue that cannot be phosphorylated. The status of phosphorylation of the different mutants was monitored by two-dimensional gel analysis before and after viral infection. This analysis revealed that loss of two distinct sets of serine residues, Ser425 and Ser426 and Ser437 and Ser438, rendered IRF7 unresponsive to viral infection. In contrast, mutation of the other two sets of serines, Ser429–Ser431 and Ser441, did not show a significant alteration in the overall phosphorylation pattern, although the efficiency of phosphorylation appeared to be reduced (Fig. 1C). We noted that leucine residues are associated with these serine residues, suggesting a potential phosphorylation motif. Specifically, each group of serine residues is either preceded or followed by a leucine residue. To address the importance of these leucine residues, we mutated individually Leu427 and Leu432 into alanines. As shown in Fig. 1C, mutation of Leu427 abrogated virally induced phosphorylation, whereas mutant L432A showed the same phosphorylation pattern as WT IRF7. Notably, this result is consistent with what was observed when the adjacent serine sets were altered, in other words, it seems that the motif SSL (amino acids 425–427) has a preponderant role in virally induced phosphorylation, whereas the next motif SSSL (amino acids 429–432) has a minor role, if any. Ser437 and Ser438 Are the Primary Targets of Phosphorylation—To better determine the respective roles of each group of serines, we undertook another series of mutations. The different sets of serine residues were altered to aspartate, a residue that mimics the charge of a phosphorylated serine and can often substitute for its function. Analysis by two-dimensional gel confirmed that these mutants had an altered charge. In addition, we observed that most mutants were still further phosphorylated in response to viral infection, as attested by the appearance of new spots toward the acidic end of the pH gradient (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the pattern of mutant M7 (S425D/S426D) was not modified after viral infection suggesting that either this mutation rendered the protein unresponsive to viral infection or that these two serines were the only targets for phosphorylation. It is unlikely that Ser425 and Ser426 are the only sites of phosphorylation given the multiple isoelectric species detected after phosphorylation of the wild type protein (Fig. 1B), indicative of more than two phosphorylated residues. Moreover, mutant M15, where all the serines except Ser425 and Ser426 were mutated into aspartate, showed a dramatic shift toward the acidic pH, resembling the fully phosphorylated protein and an unchanged pattern when analyzed from NDV-infected extracts. One hypothesis that reconciles these observations is that the distal serine residues are major targets for virus-induced phosphorylation, whereas Ser425 and Ser426 are necessary for kinase targeting but are either not themselves phosphorylated or their function is not correctly mimicked by aspartate substitution. Transcriptional Activity of IRF7 Mutants—Although informative, two-dimensional gel migration patterns were not sufficient to give an answer concerning the functionality of the different residues, especially considering the limitations of phosphomimetic mutants. To complement this study, it was essential to determine the level of activity of each mutant in control and infected cells. For this purpose, we cotransfected WT IRF7 and the different mutants in COS cells along with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the IFNα6 promoter, a typical target gene of IRF7 (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, WT IRF7 transactivation ability was greatly enhanced (over 8-fold) following viral infection (2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutation of Ser425 and Ser426 or Ser437 and Ser438 totally abrogated virally induced activity (Fig. 2A). Moreover, mutant M2 (L427A) also showed a complete loss of viral responsiveness. The other mutants, where Ser429–Ser431, Ser441, or Leu432 were mutated, were not significantly impaired in their viral sensitivity compared with WT. These results are fully consistent with what was observed with the phosphorylation status, reaffirming that virally induced phosphorylation is the key regulatory event to derepress transactivation ability. A more complicated situation was observed when the activity of the phosphomimetic mutants was measured. Consistent with the finding that mutation of Ser429–Ser431 to Ala did not have a noticeable effect on the virus-induced pattern or transactivation potential, mutation of the same residues into Asp, either individually or taken together (mutants M8, M9, and M10), did not render the mutants constitutively active. However, M10 reached a level of activity 4-fold higher than WT in the presence of virus (Fig. 2B). This acute sensitivity to viral infection suggests that these residues (Ser429–Ser431) are not, or at most very inefficiently, phosphorylated in response to viral infection. However, if they were to become phosphorylated, as mimicked by the aspartate mutation, they could cooperate with the residues that are primary targets for the virus-activated kinases, yielding higher transactivation potential. Again, as predicted by the phenotype observed after mutation into alanine, M14 (S437D/S438D) showed a significant constitutive activity in absence of virus, 7-fold higher than the WT level, consistent with these residues being the major targets for virally induced phosphorylation. Interestingly, additional mutation of serine residues 429–431 (M11) rendered the mutant highly constitutively active, reaching levels of activity in the range of the wild type protein following viral infection. Furthermore, when we generated a mutant (M15) where Ser441 was mutated into aspartate in addition to the five mutations present in M11, we obtained a protein that displayed even a greater activity, reaching levels 5-fold higher than WT IRF7 activated by viral infection. It is important to note that activity of both M11 and M15 was not further increased by viral infection, suggesting that no additional phosphorylation could take place. We conclude that phosphorylation of Ser437 and Ser438 is required for virus-induced transactivation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser429–Ser431 and/or Ser441 can augment transactivation and/or the efficiency of distal phosphorylation. This notion raised the question of the physiological role of the first set of serines, Ser425 and Ser426, that were previously found to be essential to virally induced phosphorylation and activity (Ref. 2Marié I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Figs. 1C and 2A). Surprisingly, when Ser425 and Ser426 were mutated into aspartate, the resulting mutant (M7) did not exhibit constitutive activity but rather became insensitive to viral infection. This phenotype is consistent with our previous finding that this mutant could not be phosphorylated in response to viral infection (Fig. 1D) and suggests that aspartate cannot mimic the essential role of these serine residues. Transactivation ability is the ultimate indication of IRF7 activity. Nevertheless, lack of or increased activity of the mutants could be because of alteration of other parameters that are a prerequisite to IRF7 transactivation ability, namely dimerization, retention in the nucleus, or DNA binding. We therefore tested the DNA binding ability of several mutants. As previously described (14Marié I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), DNA binding by WT IRF7 was dramatically increased in NDV-infected extracts. Interestingly, constitutively active mutants M14 and M15 showed highly increased DNA binding capabilities in control extracts compared with WT. Whereas the DNA binding ability of M14 was further enhanced after viral infection, M15 exhibited the same degree of DNA binding in control and NDV-infected extracts (Fig. 3). These findings are reminiscent of what was observed when we monitored IRF7 activity by luciferase assay, showing a strong correlation between stimulation of DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Essential Functions of Ser425 and Ser426—The fact that the mutation of Ser425 and Ser426 to aspartate did not confer increased activity suggested that these residues might not be targets of phosphorylation, although they played an essential role in IRF7 function. We considered whether their critical role impacted proper conformation of the regulatory domain or served as a recognition site for the virally activated kinases, IKK-ϵ and TBK1. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the proximal group of serines, Ser425 and Ser426 either to alanine or aspartate, in the context of the constitutively active phosphomimetic mutants M11 and M15. We reasoned that, if the only function of the proximal set of serines was to provide a docking site for the kinases that will subsequently phosphorylate the distal group of serine (437 and 438), their mutation in the context of constitutively active mutants would have a limited impact. Unexpectedly, as shown in Fig. 4A, these mutations partially impaired the activity of the constitutively active mutants (compare mutant M12 with M11 and mutants M16 and M17 with M15). These results indicated that Ser425 and Ser426 were critical, even when all other serine residues in the regulatory domain available for phosphorylation were already mutated into aspartate, suggesting either that these serines are obligatory phosphorylation targets or that they are mandatory for adequate folding of the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain. To determine whether these residues were phosphorylated in the context of M15, we compared the two-dimensional pattern of M15 with M17 where Ser425 and Ser426 are mutated into alanine. As shown in Fig. 4B, M17 lost the more acidic minor spot present in M15, suggesting that M15 may indeed be partially phosphorylated on residues Ser425 and Ser426. However, mutation of Ser425 and Ser426 into either Asp or Ala reduced but did not abrogate the constitutive activity of mutant M11 and M15. Mutants M12 and M17 still exhibited a transactivation ability 5–8-fold higher than WT IRF7 in control cells, reaching levels of activation close to that of viral activated WT IRF7 (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that although Ser425 and Ser426 are important to achieve maximal activity, these residues are not compulsory to obtain a constitutively active mutant. Nevertheless, this result did not definitively exclude the possibility that these residues also serve as a recognition motif in the context of the WT protein. To address this point, we designed a synthetic peptide encompassing the sequence surrounding the proximal SSL motif, i.e. amino acids 422–435, fused to the protein transduction domain (amino acid 47–57) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transactivator protein Tat (15Holzberg D. Knight C.G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Schneider H. Dorrie A. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40213-40223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As a control, we also synthesized a mutant peptide bearing the same sequence except that the SSL motif was mutated into triple alanine (Fig. 5A). The potential interaction between the peptides and the IRF7 kinase, IKK-ϵ, was tested by quantifying the level of IKK-ϵ autophosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay in presence or absence of the WT or mutant peptide (Fig. 5B). WT peptide strongly inhibited IKK-ϵ autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the kinase efficiently interacted with the peptide. The corresponding mutant peptide also showed some degree of inhibition, although this inhibition did not show a clear dose-response effect, suggesting that it was likely to be low affinity or nonspecific (Fig. 5B). Mori et al. (16Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) recently proposed that constitutive activity of IRF3-5D (analogous to mutant M15 in this study) was because of the constitutive phosphorylation of the equivalent proximal set of serine residues (Ser385 and Ser386 in IRF3). To examine the possibility of a similar phenomenon in IRF7, we assayed IRF7 WT and M15 transactivation ability in the IFNα6-luciferase reporter assay using cells that could be depleted of the kinase activity responsible for phosphorylating IRF7, namely TBK1 and IKK-ϵ. For this purpose, we used TBK1-deficient fibroblasts from gene-targeted mice and transfected them with a dominant negative form of IKK-ϵ, IKK-ϵK38A (6Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to impair its activity. In these cells virtually devoid of the relevant kinase activity capable of targeting IRF7 carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, WT IRF7 lost its low basal activity, whereas M15 retained robust constitutive activity (Fig. 5C). As a control, TBK1-deficient cells reconstituted with TBK1 showed a high constitutive activity of WT IRF7, reaching levels ∼1000-fold higher than in the absence of kinases. In contrast, M15 activity was only 4-fold greater in cells transfected with TBK1. This result strongly suggested that M15 activity was not because of constitutive phosphorylation of Ser425 and Ser426 by TBK1 or IKK-ϵ, whereas the basal activity of WT IRF7 is probably because of low levels of constitutive IKK catalytic activity. In another tactic to determine whether Ser425 and Ser426 were targets of phosphorylation, we designed a mutant, M18, derived from the phosphomimetic mutant M14 (S437D/S438D). As discussed above, M14 is weakly constitutively active but still strongly activated by virus. Moreover, our results indicated that Ser429–Ser431 and Ser441 were not essential residues to achieve viral-induced phosphorylation (Figs. 1C and 2A, M4 and M6). A mutant combining the mutations of M14, M4, and M6 only leaves Ser425 and Ser426 as potential phosphorylation targets in response to viral infection. We tested the ability of such a mutant to be activated in response to viral infection. As shown in Fig. 5, D and E, mutant M18 was not responsive to NDV infection, either by increased transcriptional activity or by altered electrophoretic mobility. Interestingly, however, M18 resolved as a major isoelectric species plus a minor, more acidic species (Fig. 5E) that was lost when Ser425 and Ser426 were mutated to Ala in M17, suggesting a degree of phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). This result is consistent with the conclusion that Ser425 and Ser426 are not primary targets for virally induced phosphorylation, although they may become secondarily phosphorylated and then contribute to the overall phosphorylation-dependent activity of IRF7. Furthermore, although the groups of Ser429–Ser431 and Ser441 seem dispensable when mutated individually, the combined mutation of both sets rendered IRF7 totally inactive. This result indicates that these serine residues are redundant with each other but that the presence of at least one set, Ser429–Ser431 or Ser441, is crucial for viral responsiveness of IRF7. Virally induced phosphorylation is the crucial event that stimulates the strong transactivation ability of IRF7. One of the characteristics of IRF7 is that it contains numerous potential phosphoacceptor sites clustered in its carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. To date, reports have been conflicting concerning which residues are essential for virally dependent IRF7 activity and whether this requirement necessarily implies that these residues are phosphorylated in vivo (9Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15495-15504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that Ser437 and Ser438 are the primary targets for phosphorylation but that additional phosphorylation on either some residues of the group of Ser429–Ser431 or on Ser441 is required to render IRF7 fully active in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the proximal group of Ser425 and Ser426 is essential for function, albeit not solely as phosphorylation targets but also for a different critical function during activation, which facilitates phosphorylation at the major distal sites. This function may be as a recognition motif for the virally activated kinases or as a critical determinant for proper conformation of IRF7 regulatory domain, presumably for dimer formation. Indeed, a non-phosphorylation-dependent critical role for Ser425 and Ser426 is supported by several lines of evidence. 1) The phosphomimetic mutant S425D/S426D is not constitutively active. 2) The mutant M15 that carries all of the remaining serines mutated in aspartate is strongly constitutively active, and its activity is not further enhanced by viral infection. 3) The mutant M15 still exhibits a strong constitutive activity in the absence of active IRF7 kinases, suggesting that its constitutive activity is not because of constitutive phosphorylation of Ser425 and Ser426, whereas the basal activity of the WT protein is dependent on these kinases. 4) The mutant M18, where the only targets left for phosphorylation are Ser425 and Ser426, cannot be activated in response to viral infection. Taken together, our data support a model in which phosphorylation of Ser425 and Ser426 is neither necessary nor sufficient for transcriptional activity, unlike the major phosphorylation targets, Ser437 and Ser438. However, it does not rule out the possibility that Ser425 and Ser426 become phosphorylated secondarily to the phosphorylation of Ser437 and Ser438 and contribute to the overall phosphorylation and therefore the overall transcriptional magnitude of activated IRF7. Nonetheless, these serine residues along with Leu427 are required for the TBK/IKK-mediated phosphorylation of the distal serine residues, possibly serving as a recognition motif for TBK1 and IKK-ϵ. Kinase interaction might lead to a subsequent conformational change, exposing the distal group of serines and allowing for phosphorylation of the primary targets Ser437 and Ser438 followed by phosphorylation of secondary targets among Ser429–Ser431 and Ser441, and possibly also Ser425 and Ser426. Interestingly, the serine residues analogous to Ser425 and Ser426 in IRF3 lie at an exposed apex at the dimer interface, as revealed in the recently solved IRF3 crystal structure, suggesting that these residues would be available to interact with other proteins (17Takahasi K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Mori M. Suhara W. Okabe Y. Fukuhara Y. Terasawa H. Akira S. Fujita T. Inagaki F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Qin B.Y.

Our findings are reminiscent of what has been reported for IRF3, with some striking differences. The major target of phosphorylation identified in this study is the distal group of Ser437 and Ser438. One of these residues, Ser438, is conserved between IRF3 and IRF7 in both the mouse and human. Nevertheless, this residue would correspond to Ser398 in human IRF3, which has been shown to play only a minor role, because mutant S398A still interacts with CREB-binding protein after viral stimulation and the phosphomimetic counterpart S398D interacts very inefficiently with CREB-binding protein and is consequently a poor constitutive transactivator of IRF3 target genes (19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Conversely, Ser396, which has been identified as the major target for in vivo phosphorylation of IRF3, is not present in IRF7 (19Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, these findings have been debated by Mori et al. (16Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), who support a model in which the proximal group Ser386 is the target of the IRF3 kinases. In either case, IRF3 and IRF7 would appear to be phosphorylated on distinct, non-homologous residues. One of the distinctive features of IRF7 compared with IRF3 is its basal activity when transfected, even in absence of viral infection. We show here that this activity is likely because of nonspecific activation of the IRF3/IRF7 kinases during the transfection process, possibly through a double stranded RNA-dependent pathway, because WT IRF7 does not display any activity when cotransfected along with dominant negative IKKϵ in TBK1-deficient cells (see Fig. 5C). Interestingly, under the same conditions, the activity of the phosphomimetic mutant M15 is only marginally decreased (4-fold difference over a 200-fold activation of the IFNα6 promoter). This observation suggests that M15 constitutive activity is not due to phosphorylation of the proximal group of serine, Ser425 and Ser426, unless phosphorylation of this set of serines is achieved by an unknown kinase distinct from TBK1 and IKKϵ. However, if phosphorylation of Ser425 and Ser426 by a yet to be identified kinase is the critical step for IRF7 activation, as argued by Mori et al. (16Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) for IRF3, the profound defect in IFNα induction displayed in TBK1-deficient cells would be difficult to explain (20Hemmi H.

Interestingly, an alternative mechanism for IRF7 action was recently proposed, in which its transcriptional activity is modulated by direct interaction with MyD88 and TRAF6 in response to Toll-like receptor stimulation (24Kawai T. Sato S. Ishii K.J. Coban C. Hemmi H. Yamamoto M. Terai K. Matsuda M. Inoue J. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 25Honda K.

In this case, however, TBK1/IKK-ϵ kinases appeared not to be required, and a role for carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation was not established. Moreover, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptor proteins are involved in the response of IRF7 to viral infection (26Levy D.E. Marie I.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, analysis of phospho-IRF7 by two-dimensional gel was performed for the first time. We have been able to determine that several species bearing different degrees of phosphorylation coexisted after viral infection in the cell. The data provided by the phosphomimetic mutants imply that IRF7 transcriptional activity is directly proportional to the degree of phosphorylation of the protein, with the final transcriptional activity of IRF7 resulting from the summation of the individual phosphorylation events. A striking prediction from our results is that the magnitude of responses mediated by IRF7 may be malleable, dependent on the extent of phosphorylation. We propose that the activity of IRF7 can be modulated as a function of its degree of phosphorylation as a way of adapting the host response, contingent on the severity of an ongoing viral infection as interpreted by the level and extent of kinase activity.

In general, such specificity is mediated by different ligands, similar but distinct receptors with integral serine/threonine kinase activity, and recruitment and phosphorylation of distinct subsets of receptor Smads (23Miyazono K.

TGF-β binding to the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) leads to recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of the type I receptor (TβRI). The activated TβRI kinase phosphorylates Smad2 or -3, enabling association with the universal common Smad, Smad4, prior to nuclear translocation. Heteromeric Smads then activate or suppress transcription in cooperation with other transcription factors, coactivators, or repressors (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr.

In addition, TAK1 cooperates with Smads to enhance transactivation by activating ATF-2 in response to either TGF-β or BMP (37Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J.

Importantly, TAK1 is also activated by the catabolic cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (41Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K.

Col2a1 gene expression is developmentally regulated by the HMG domain transcription factor Sox9 (43Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat.

This stimulation activated endogenous TAK1, was blocked by dominant-negative TAK1a, and was mimicked by adenoviral overexpression of TAK1a or TAK1a and TAB1 together. The response to TGF-β or TAK1a did not increase Col2a1 message and was not replicated by adenoviral expression of Smad3. Thus, stimulation of type II collagen synthesis represents a response shared by both TGF-β and BMP2 that does not require increased transcription or stability of Col2a1 message or cooperation with Smad3 signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Inhibitors—The following antibodies were used: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technologies); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (A5420; Sigma); goat anti-CTGF (sc-14939; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-PAI-1, anti-lamin A/C, and anti-Smad2/3 (catalog numbers 612024, 612162, 610842, respectively; BD Transduction Laboratories); and rabbit polyclonal anti-mTAK1 (whole molecule) (sc-7162; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit anti-mTAK1 antibodies were generated using peptides corresponding to amino acids 324–344 (TAK-m) and 561–579 (TAK-ct) coupled to diphtheria toxoid (Wako BioProducts) through N-terminal cysteines. Anti-TAB1 antibodies were similarly generated from an N-terminal acetylated peptide Cys191–Glu214. Isoform-specific TGF-β blocking antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems: chicken anti-TGF-β1 (catalog number AF-101-NA; 100 ng/ml), goat anti-TGF-β2 (catalog number AF-302-NA; 100 ng/ml), and goat anti-TGF-β3 (catalog number AF-243-NA; 2.5 μg/ml). These antibodies were mixed and used at the indicated concentrations, which were 5-fold higher than the lowest completely inhibitory dose (R&D Systems).Plasmids—Plasmids were obtained from the following sources: pGEX-MKK6 (R. Davis) (52Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), p800LUC (D. Loskutoff) (53Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pUC18 (ATCC), rabbit Col2a1 3′-untranslated region (E. Vuorio) (54Metsaranta M. Kujala U.M. Pelliniemi L. Osterman H. Aho H. Vuorio E. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and pNF-κB-Luc (Clontech). To create vectors for TAK1 and TAB1 expression, the adenoviral cosmid AxCAwt (55Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) (TakaRa; containing the chicken β-actin promoter, first intron enhancer, and the CMV enhancer (56Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar)) was cut with SalI and NcoI to remove adenoviral sequences and the CMV enhancer prior to ligation with a SalI-NcoI adapter. The first intron enhancer was then removed with HinfI and ClaI and resealed with a HinfI-NotI-ClaI adapter to produce pA3. A SalI site at the 3′-end of the CMV enhancer of pCMV6-X4 (Origene) was generated from a cryptic site by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The SalI-NotI fragment was inserted in the same site in pA3 to produce pC containing only the CMV promoter. The 376-bp SalI-NcoI fragment from AxCAwt containing the CMV enhancer was inserted in the same site in pA3 to generate pCEA3 containing the minimal β-actin promoter preceded by the CMV enhancer. An arrayed human heart cDNA library (Origene) was screened for full-length cDNA for hTAK1a and hTAB1 by PCR using primers designed from published sequences (29Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 57Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region was truncated, and KpnI, XbaI, and NotI sites were inserted 3′ to the wild type stop codon in the library clone pCMV6-X4-hTAK1a by Excite deletional mutagenesis (Stratagene). The resultant BspHI-Xba fragment was inserted into the unamplified library clone. Similarly, pCMV6-X4-hTAB1 was shortened, and a FLAG epitope was inserted using the following primers: forward, 5′-GACGGTACCAACTGATCTAGATTGCGGCCGCGGTCATAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTGGTACCGATCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCTTGTGCCGGTGCTGTCACCACGCTCTGC-3′. The PCR product was cut with KpnI and ligated prior to transfer of the BsrBI-XbaI fragment to the same site in the unamplified clone. The shortened TAK1a and TAB1 constructs where subcloned into NotI sites to yield expression vectors pC-hTAK1a and pCEA3-hTAB1. Cloning was monitored and verified by sequencing. A tandem vector was made by inserting the blunted SalI-PmeI pC-hTAK1a expression cassette into PmeI-cut pCEA3-hTAB1. Dominant negative mutants of TAK1 were generated by QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis using 40-bp complementary primers centered at the mutation site. Sequenced mutant fragments for K63A and K63W replaced the KasI-MluI fragment to produce pC-hTAK1a-KA and pC-hTAK1a-KW. Similarly, the S192A fragment replaced the RsrII-MluI fragment to create pC-hTAK1a-SA. The double mutant pC-hTAK1a-KWSA was generated sequentially.Adenoviral Vector Construction—The adenoviral vectors Ad-pC, Ad-pCEA3, Ad-pCEA3(pC), Ad-pC-hTAK1a, Ad-pCEA3-TAB-FL, and pCEA3-TAB-FL(pC-hTAK1a) (Tandem) were constructed using components obtained from TakaRa. Expression cassettes were excised with SalI and PmeI, blunted, and ligated to SwaI-cut promoterless transfer cosmid pAxcw (55Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Following λ packaging (Promega), recombinant cosmids were used to generate recombinant ΔE1 and ΔE3 adenoviruses by homologous recombination in 293 cells transfected with cosmid and restricted viral DNA-terminal protein complexes (58Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses were isolated by plaque purification and two rounds of dilution to 0.5 plaque-forming units/well and propagated in 293 cells. Viral stocks were stored as lysates or CsCl-purified particles in aliquots at –80 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% sucrose (59Nyberg-Hoffman C. Aguilar-Cordova E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Titers were determined in 293 cells by TCID50 assays and corrected to plaque-forming units/ml. The Adeno-X Rapid Titer protocol (BD Clontech) was recently used and produced titers 10-fold higher than paired analysis by TCID50; these were normalized to TCID50 values for data consistency. Ad-CMV-LacZ was obtained from Quantum. Adenovirus expressing wild type Smad3 was generously provided by Wei Shi (Children's Hospital Los Angeles) and repurified before use.Cell Culture and Collagen Synthesis—Chondrocytes were released from the articular cartilage of 7-week-old New Zealand White rabbits as previously described (60Benya P.D. Shaffer J.D. Cell. 1982; 30: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar), except that overnight enzymatic digestion was performed in a spinner flask. Cells were plated at 1.5–2 × 106 cells/T75 flask and cultured in 10% heat-inactivated (HIA; 55 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum or HIA-dialyzed fetal calf serum in DMEM (high glucose) for 10 days. Chondrocytes were washed in PBS and released by brief incubation with a film of 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA. Cells were plated for analysis of collagen synthesis in 10% HIA fetal calf serum/DMEM in 48-well plates at confluent density (5.5 × 104 cells/well) by layering beneath 5% HIA fetal calf serum/DMEM. Cells were conventionally plated at proportional densities in 60- and 100-mm dishes for RNA isolation. Typically, chondrocytes were allowed to attach for 24 h, washed with DMEM, and cultured or infected with viral vectors for 24 h in 0.125 ml of 0.3% ITS+/DMEM (BD Biosciences). The duration of viral exposure, referred to in the text and figure legends, includes this period of infection. Subsequently, cells were fed with the same medium, treated with recombinant human TGF-β1 or BMP2 (R&D Systems) for 24 h and then labeled in fresh medium with tritiated proline for 24 h. Labeling medium was 0.3% ITS+/DMEM, 62.5 μg/ml β-aminoproprionitrile, 25 μg/ml ascorbate, 40 μCi/ml [5-3H]proline (Amersham Biosciences), and growth factors. Cultures (medium and cell layer, together) were terminated by freezing, thawed, adjusted to 0.5 n acetic acid and 0.5 mg/ml pepsin, and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Following two cycles of lyophilization in the culture plate, samples were dissolved in 0.250 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer without reducing agent at 55 °C for 30 min before SDS-PAGE on gradient gels and fluorography (60Benya P.D. Shaffer J.D. Cell. 1982; 30: 215-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples were analyzed separately or as a physical pool by digital image analysis of α1(II) collagen bands. For analysis of the collagen phenotype, labeled collagen was precipitated in 80% acetone at 4 °C for 45 min, washed twice with 40% ethanol, digested with CNBr, and mapped in two dimensions as previously described (61Benya P.D. Coll. Relat. Res. 1981; 1: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 62Benya P.D. Brown P.D. Padilla S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Primary chondrocytes were released and plated beneath 5% HIA fetal calf serum/DMEM at 1.7 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plates. After 18–24 h, cells were washed with serum-free medium, fed with ITS+/DMEM, and transfected for 3 h with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Each well contained 1 μl of Plus reagent, 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine, 25 ng of p800Luc or 12.5 ng of pNF-κB, and test plasmids, and the DNA content was adjusted to 200 ng/well with pUC18. Cells were washed with ITS+/DMEM and fed this medium until termination 48 h later. Substrate buffer (50 μl) was used for lysis, and 10 μl were transferred to 20 μl of 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, followed by the addition of 10 μl of 2× Luclite substrate (Packard). Replicate wells (n = 4) were analyzed for luciferase activity using a scintillation counter and single photon counting (Beckman).RNA Isolation and Ribonuclease Protection Assays (RPAs)—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol-LS (Invitrogen) and stored in 100% formamide at –80 °C. Rabbit-specific probes were generated from chondrocyte or fibroblast RNA using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 55 °C. The resulting cDNA and plasmids were used as targets in PCRs using the following primers: Col2a1 (forward, 5′-GCACCCATGGACATTGGAGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGTTTTAAAAAATACAGAG-3), Aggrecan (forward, 5′-CTACGACGCCATCTGCTACA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGAGGTCCTCACTAGTGAAGG-3′), Sox9 (forward, 5′-AACGCACATCAAGACGGAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGTAGGTGAAGGTGGAGTAGAG-3′), CTGF (forward, 5′-CCTGTGCAGCATGGACG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTTGAACTCCACCGGCAG-3′), L32 (forward, 5′-GTGAAGCCCAAGATC"

The present results revealed the following. 1) p27Kip1 interacts with the CDX2 transcription factor. 2) In contrast to CDX2 mRNA levels, CDX2 protein expression levels significantly increased as soon as Caco-2/15 cells reached confluence, slowed their proliferation, and began their differentiation. The mechanism of CDX2 regulation is primarily related to protein stability, because inhibition of proteasome activity increased CDX2 levels. The half-life of CDX2 protein was significantly enhanced in differentiated versus undifferentiated proliferative intestinal epithelial cells. 3) Cdk2 interacted with CDX2 and phosphorylated CDX2, as determined by pull-down glutathione S-transferase and immunoprecipitation experiments with proliferating undifferentiated Caco-2/15 cell extracts. 4) Treatment of Caco-2/15 cells with MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) and (R)-roscovitine (a specific Cdk2 inhibitor) induced an increase in CDX2 protein levels. 5) Conversely, ectopic expression of Cdk2 resulted in decreased expression of CDX2 protein. 6) Of note, treatment of proliferative Caco-2/15 cells with (R)-roscovitine or leptomycin (an inhibitor of nuclear export through CRM1) led to an accumulation of CDX2 into the nucleus. These data suggest that CDX2 undergoes CRM1-dependent nuclear export and cytoplasmic degradation in cells in which Cdk2 is activated, such as in proliferative intestinal epithelial cells. The targeted degradation of CDX2 following its phosphorylation by Cdk2 identifies a new mechanism through which CDX2 activity can be regulated in coordination with the cell cycle machinery.

The targeted degradation of CDX2 following its phosphorylation by Cdk2 identifies a new mechanism through which CDX2 activity can be regulated in coordination with the cell cycle machinery. Although cell differentiation and growth arrest are two distinct processes occurring independently, they are generally intimately linked because cell cycle exit is a prerequisite for terminal differentiation. Mechanisms operating at the interface between growth arrest and differentiation programs play critical roles in establishing the differentiated states of various cell types. Such mechanisms are also likely to be important in maintaining the irreversibility of terminal differentiation, with their disruption having an important role in cell immortalization and tumorigenesis (1Brown G. Hughes P.J. Michell R.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium represents an attractive system in which to study the relationship between cell cycle and cytodifferentiation. Proliferating, differentiating, and functional cells are organized into well defined compartments in this polarized tissue, from which the entire sequence of developmental events is on display at any given moment in time (2Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Mysorekar I.U. Gordon J.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Karam S.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D286-D298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crypt compartment houses the proliferative cells that give birth to the four types of differentiated enterocytes (absorptive enterocytes, goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells) that, with the exception of Paneth cells, populate the villus compartment. The decision to differentiate is abruptly taken by committed crypt cells while in their most rapid state of proliferation (4Cairnie A.B. Lamerton L.F. Steel G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 39: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These newly differentiated cells acquire their distinctive ultrastructural features and cell surface markers upon leaving the proliferative cell cycle, at the top of the crypts or the base of the villus (3Karam S.M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D286-D298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Doell R.G. Rosen G. Kretchmer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A better understanding of the interaction between G1 phase regulators and transcription activators of intestinal differentiation is required to delineate the molecular mechanisms that coordinate cell growth arrest and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. Several cell cycle-associated proteins have been directly implicated in the growth arrest that precedes terminal differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, including the retinoblastoma proteins pRb and p130, p21Cip/Waf, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 (8Ding Q. Ko T.C. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1193-C1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tian J.Q. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1245-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ding Q. Wang Q.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are clearly important for cell cycle arrest, little is currently known about their potential functions during cell differentiation. By exploiting the use of a p27Kip1 antisense cDNA to specifically deplete the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2/15 of this particular inhibitor, we previously demonstrated that p27Kip1 is required for complete intestinal epithelial differentiation. Indeed, stable expression of a p27Kip1 antisense cDNA is sufficient to markedly block expression of several differentiation markers, namely sucrase-isomaltase, lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, and alkaline phosphatase (11Deschênes C. Vézina A. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Tian and Quaroni (9Tian J.Q. Quaroni A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1245-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that forced overexpression of p27Kip1 in the human intestinal epithelial crypt cell line HIEC, by infection with recombinant Adp27 adenovirus, resulted in induction of cell differentiation 6 days after infection. These authors suggested that p27Kip1 is more directly related to expression of differentiated traits in intestinal epithelial cells than p21Cip or other cell cycle inhibitors. However, the mechanisms by which p27Kip1 promotes intestinal epithelial cell differentiation remain to be elucidated. The demonstration that p27Kip1 is involved in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation also has potential important implications for development of cancer in this tissue. Indeed, several studies in humans have demonstrated abnormally low levels of p27Kip1 protein in carcinomas, correlating well with both histological aggressiveness and patient mortality (12Loda M. Cukor B. Tam S.W. Lavin P. Fiorentino M. Draetta G.F. Jessup J.M. Pagano M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that CDX2, a homeodomain protein related to the Drosophila caudal gene, is important both for pattern formation in the developing embryo and activation of intestine-specific genes, including sucrase-isomaltase and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, among others (13James R.

Additionally, CDX2 expression can negatively regulate the proliferation of intestinal epithelial and colon cancer cells in culture while promoting the acquisition of a mature enterocyte phenotype consisting of a polarized, columnar shape with apical microvilli and tight junctions (14Suh E.

Because CDX2 and p27Kip1 are both required for intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and could play an important role in colorectal cancer, we analyzed their potential molecular relationship in human intestinal epithelial cells. The present results demonstrate that CDX2 is associated with p27Kip1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk2, and is a substrate for Cdk2. In addition, results indicate that phosphorylation of CDX2 by Cdk2-associated complexes targets CDX2 for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The targeted degradation of CDX2 following its phosphorylation by Cdk2 identifies a new mechanism through which CDX2 activity can be regulated in coordination with cell cycle machinery.

The sucrase-isomaltase reporter construct used for luciferase assays contained the human sucrase-isomaltase promoter from residues -183 to +54 cloned upstream of the luciferase gene of the pGL2 reporter construct (25Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Authenticity of all DNA fragments generated by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. HEK293 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 1 μg of p27Kip1 or 1 μg of p57Kip2 or the relevant expression vectors and 1 μg of CDX3 or HA-CDX3 expression vectors per dish. Two days after transfection, immunoprecipitation-electrophoretic mobility shift assays (IP-EMSA) were performed as described previously (24Gheorghiu I. Deschenes C. Blais M. Boudreau F. Rivard N.

Immunoprecipitation—Briefly, lysates from Caco-2/15 cells or transiently transfected HEK293 were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 5% glycerol. Lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). Proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by incubation for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose complexes were washed three times in gel shift buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), treated with 32 μl of 0.8% deoxycholate for 15 min at 4 °C, and neutralized with 1% Nonidet P-40. Five μl of the supernatants were then used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. EMSAs—EMSAs were separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5% Tris borate buffer and 2% glycerol. The following sucrase-isomaltase promoter DNA-binding site was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays: SIF1, the CDX2 DNA-binding site, -58 to -33, 5′-AGGGTGCAATAAAACTTTATGAGTAG-3′ (25Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Hamster CDX3 wild type and mutated forms of CDX3 were ligated downstream of the glutathione S-transferase sequence in a pGEX plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3, and the fusion protein was produced by growing 500 ml of bacterial culture to an optical density between 0.9 and 1.1 and treating the culture with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were recovered and resuspended in SB buffer (16 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 1%. The bacterial lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were recovered and mixed with 55 μl of a 1:1 suspension of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed extensively in SB buffer and used for in vitro binding assays as described previously (26Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. 7.5 μg of GST-CDX3 fusion or GST proteins were coupled to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. The Caco-2/15 lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the immobilized fusion proteins by end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer after which Laemmli buffer was added and the mixture boiled for 5 min. Bound proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting as described below. In other experiments, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer followed by washing three times with ice-cold kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) before performing the kinase assay in the presence or absence of (R)-roscovitine. 7.5 μg of GST-CDX3 fusion or GST proteins were coupled to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. In some cases, p27Kip1 (150 ng) was first incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the immobilized fusion proteins by end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer after which the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (150 ng) was incubated for1hat 4 °C with the immobilized fusion proteins. Again the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. In other cases, the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex was first incubated with the immobilized fusion proteins, and p27Kip1 was added thereafter. Laemmli buffer was added to the beads and the ensuing mixture boiled for 5 min. Bound proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting as described below. Studies were conducted in agreement with the principles and procedures outlined in the Canadian Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Antibodies were raised in rabbits (New Zealand, female) by multisite injections of CDX3-GST protein, as described previously (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using CDX3-GST immobilized to an agarose gel. The column coupling CDX3-GST was performed using the AminoLink Plus kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were tested on intestinal mucosae, Caco-2/15 cells, and HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNAneo3/CDX3 construct for their specificity in Western blot and immunofluorescence by comparison with nonimmune sera and mouse monoclonal antibody against CDX2 provided by Biogenex (CDX2-Biogenex). Results obtained with CDX2/3-NR antibody were quite similar to those obtained with CDX2-Biogenex antibody. The best working concentration for the CDX2/3-NR antibody was established at 1:20,000 for immunoblot experiments and at 1:1000 for immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 1 mm PMSF). Proteins (20-40 μg for large gels or 5-10 μg for mini-gels) from whole-cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12.5% acrylamide gels. Proteins were detected immunologically after transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Protein and molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were localized by staining with Ponceau Red. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C in PBS-containing powdered milk followed by overnight incubation with the first antibody in blocking solution and then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:1000) IgG for 1 h, after determination of the best concentrations for each antibody. Blots were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry procedure with bovine serum albumin as standard (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar). Caco-2/15 cells grown on sterile glass coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cultures were then fixed with 30% methanol and 70% acetone for 15 min at -20 °C, permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton X-100 solution in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently immunostained for 1 h with the primary antibody (CDX2, p27Kip1, or CRM1) and for 30 min with the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit). In some experiments, nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments. Kinase assays were performed using the Cdk2 kinase buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, Cdk2 buffer was supplemented with 500 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg of GST-CDX3, and 1-40 ng of activated cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer. Radiolabeled GST-CDX3 was separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography. Cdk2, HA-CDX3, p27Kip1, or their relevant expression vectors were transfected in HEK293 cells. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 2 h in phosphate-depleted medium with 100 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). After labeling, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and 32P-phosphate-labeled CDX3 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with HA antibody. Incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate was detected by autoradiography. Total cellular RNAs were prepared from Caco-2/15 cells at subconfluence (day -2), confluence (day 0), and 6 and 15 days post-confluence by the guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol method (TRIzol, Invitrogen), as described previously (29Lemischka I.R. Farmer S. Racaniello V.R. Sharp P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). RNAs were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis with formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). Equal RNA loading was confirmed by hybridization to a ribosomal L32 gene probe. Hybridizations were performed with a random-primed 32P-labeled probe (Amersham Biosciences) of a PCR-amplified human CDX2 fragment from nucleotides 1102 to 1706. CD-1 mice (10-12 weeks) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), fed Purina chow ad libitum, and kept in a controlled temperature and light cycle environment (20 °C; 12 h light and 12 h darkness). All studies were conducted in agreement with the principles and procedures outlined in the Canadian Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Tissues from human fetuses varying in age from 18 to 20 weeks of gestation (post-fertilization fetal ages were estimated according to Streeter (30Streeter G.L. Contrib. Embryol. 1920; 11: 143-179Google Scholar)) were obtained from normal elective pregnancy terminations. No tissue was collected from cases associated with a known fetal abnormality or fetal death. Studies were approved by the Institutional Human Subject Review Board. Segments of human and mouse jejunum and colon were rinsed with 0.15 m NaCl, cut into small fragments, embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Canemco Supplies, St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada), and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections 2-3-μm thick were spread on silane-coated glass slides and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature before storage at -80 °C (11Deschênes C. Vézina A. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 423-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence, sections were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4; 45 min, 4 °C) prior to detection of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and CDX2 (CDX2/3NR) (1:1000, 2 h, room temperature). Secondary antibodies consisted of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-fluorescein isothiocyanate from Roche Applied Sciences. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments. Observations and acquisition of images were performed with a Leica DM-RXA fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetlar, Germany) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Micromax-5MHz-1300Y, Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ). Quantifications were performed on native images using the Metamorph Imaging System version 6.1 (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Segments of mouse jejunum were inverted onto polyethylene tubing, ligated at both extremities, and washed extensively with KRP buffer, pH 7.5, as described previously (31Ménard D. Pothier P. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1987; 6: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Segments were then incubated under agitation with ice-cold isolation buffer (2.5 mm EDTA and 0.25 mm NaCl) for 2 min. After each interval, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were then washed with ice-cold KRB buffer and lysed in chilled Triton lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Crypt or villus origin of the various cell fractions was determined by evaluation of the activities of several brush border enzymes as described previously (11Deschênes C. Vézina A. Beaulieu J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2013816574,"The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein promotes proliferation and transformation by binding cellular proteins, including members of the retinoblastoma protein family, the p300/CREB-binding protein transcriptional coactivators, and the p400-TRRAP chromatin-remodeling complex. E1A also promotes apoptosis, in part, by engaging the ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. We show that E1A induces ARF and p53 and promotes apoptosis in normal fibroblasts by physically associating with the retinoblastoma protein and a p400-TRRAP complex and that its interaction with p300 is largely dispensable for these effects. We further show that E1A increases p400 expression and, conversely, that suppression of p400 using stable RNA interference reduces the levels of ARF, p53, and apoptosis in E1A-expressing cells. Therefore, whereas E1A inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, it requires p400 to efficiently promote cell death. These results identify p400 as a regulator of the ARF-p53 pathway and a component of the cellular machinery that couples proliferation to cell death.

These results identify p400 as a regulator of the ARF-p53 pathway and a component of the cellular machinery that couples proliferation to cell death. Normal cells possess innate tumor suppressor mechanisms that couple proliferation to apoptosis, thereby limiting the transforming potential of oncogenic mutations (reviewed in Ref. 1Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of the c-myc oncogene or loss of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; cAMP-response element-binding protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. tumor suppressor deregulates cell cycle control but also can promote apoptosis. Consequently, cells with these lesions proliferate inappropriately but also become hypersensitive to apoptosis in response to survival factor depletion and DNA-damaging agents. Subsequent mutations that disable apoptosis allow proliferation to continue unabated, leading to oncogenic transformation or tumor progression. The ARF-p53 pathway is an important circuit in the signaling network that couples proliferation to cell death (2Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). ARF is the alternative reading frame product of the INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus, which also encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a. Several oncogenes, including c-Myc and E1A, induce ARF message and protein, which in turn activates p53 by interfering with its negative regulator Mdm2 (2Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). p53, in turn, increases the transcription of genes that ultimately target different components of the apoptotic machinery (3Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Although oncogenes can also promote apoptosis through ARF- and p53-independent mechanisms, apoptosis induced by Myc or E1A is severely compromised in cells lacking ARF or p53 (4Zindy F. Eischen C.M.

Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar and 6Lowe S.W. Sherr C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). How ARF senses hyperproliferative signals is poorly understood, but it can involve transcriptional control of the ARF promoter by E2F proteins as well as control of higher order chromatin structure by chromatin remodeling complexes (7Jacobs J.J.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein promotes uncontrolled cell cycle progression and apoptosis and has been widely used as a tool to identify cellular activities that function in both processes. E1A stimulates proliferation by physically associating with proteins that act at critical control points in the normal cell cycle (10Ben-Israel H. Kleinberger T. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1369-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best understood of these involve the Rb family, which interacts with the E1A protein through an LXCXE motif located in a central domain known as conserved region 2. As a consequence of this interaction, E1A inactivates the Rb family proteins, thereby releasing E2Fs to constitutively activate S phase genes. Notably, Rb inactivation is not sufficient for E1A action, and, in fact, N-terminal regions of E1A also contribute to promoting S phase entry and oncogenic transformation. For example, the N terminus of E1A binds and interferes with the function of p300 and CBP, two highly related transcriptional co-activators that stimulate the expression of genes involved in growth inhibition and differentiation (11Eckner R.

Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Also, E1A uses overlapping sequences to target p400 and TRRAP, two unrelated proteins that interact with each other and other additional proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (13Fuchs M.

The cellular proteins targeted by E1A to promote apoptosis are controversial, although many studies correlate apoptosis with the ability of E1A to bind p300/CBP (17Mymryk J.S. Shire K. Bayley S.T.

Indeed, consistent with the potential relevance of this interaction, p300 can directly control p53 stability. For example, p300-Mdm2 complexes can interact with p53, and contribute to its turnover, suggesting that E1A binding to p300 may lead to increased p53 stability by disrupting p53 degradation (22Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and E1A may block polyubiquitination of p53 by p300 and Mdm2 (23Grossman S.R. Deato M.E. Brignone C. Chan H.M. Kung A.L. Tagami H. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Science. 2003; 300: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Alternatively, E1A may stabilize p53 by inhibiting Mdm2 transactivation through a p300-dependent mechanism (24Thomas A. White E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1975-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, inactivation of p300 increases p53 levels and activity (25Iyer N.G. Chin S.F. Ozdag H. Daigo Y. Hu D.E. Cariati M. Brindle K. Aparicio S. Caldas C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, other studies suggest that additional E1A targets are important, either instead of or in combination with p300/CBP. These include certain Id transcription factors, the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, C-terminal binding protein, p400-TRRAP (27Hobom U. Dobbelstein M. J.

Although it is formally possible that E1A promotes apoptosis through multiple mechanisms that depend on context, most studies have examined the proapoptotic activity of E1A in immortalized or tumor-derived lines that may have defects in signaling pathways relevant to E1A action, thereby complicating the results (20Samuelson A.V. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12094-12099Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has studied the effects of following retrovirus-mediated delivery of E1A into nonimmortal cells, thereby allowing E1A functions to be examined in genetically normal cells outside the context of adenovirus infection. Using this approach, we previously showed that E1A uses at least two functional domains that act in trans to induce ARF and p53 and promote apoptosis (5de Stanchina E. McCurrach M.E. Zindy F. Shieh S.Y. Ferbeyre G. Samuelson A.V. Prives C. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 20Samuelson A.V. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12094-12099Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One domain includes conserved region 2, which promotes apoptosis by binding and inactivating Rb. Interestingly, whereas E1A targets all three Rb family members, the apoptotic defect of E1A mutants unable to bind Rb is reversed in cells lacking only Rb. A second region requires an N-terminal E1A domain that overlaps E1A sequences required to bind p300/CBP. However, the E1A mutants used in our study and in most others were not refined enough to exclude other targets. We therefore performed a more extensive analysis, which included RNA interference, to identify and validate N-terminal targets of E1A involved it apoptosis. Our results indicate that, in normal fibroblasts, the E1A-p300/CBP interaction is largely dispensable for E1A to induce ARF, p53, and apoptosis. Instead, E1A targets a p400-containing complex, which is essential for its proapoptotic activity. E1A Mutants and Retroviral Vectors—Ad5 E1A-12S mutants were cloned into both the pLPC and WZL vectors (32McCurrach M.E. Connor T.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Lowe S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The p400-EB mutant (which has a point mutation at residue 1086 that abolishes ATP binding) was subcloned into a Maloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector (pLPC). To make a pSIN vector, a self-inactivating short hairpin vector with a puromycin selection marker, a BglII-ClaI fragment from pMSCV-puro-GW (33Narita M. Nunez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar) was cloned into the BglII-EcoRV site in pQCXIX (Clontech), designated as pSIN-puro-GW. As SalI-EcoRI fragments, p400 short hairpin constructs with H1 promoter were subcloned from pSuper (34Chan H.M. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) into an XhoI-EcoRI site of pSIN-puro-GW, which flanks the GW cassette. As a control vector, the H1 promoter cassette was subcloned into the same site in the pSIN-puro-GW from the pSuper vector. All vectors were sequenced throughout the open reading frame or hairpin region. Cell Culture and Gene Transfer—IMR90 fibroblasts and U2-OS cells were obtained from ATCC. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from day 13.5 embryos and used between passages 2 and 4. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). Retroviruses were generated as described previously (35Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). IMR90s expressing an ecotropic receptor or MEFs were infected three times either with ecotropic or amphotropic retroviruses, and the infected populations were selected using either 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 75 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). Multiple constructs were introduced by simultaneous co-infection followed by sequential selection, with transduction efficiencies consistently >60% prior to selection and >95% after selection. For transfections, U-2OS cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate, transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science), and collected 48 h after transfection. For each transfection reaction, 10 μg of plasmid in 800 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 μl of Fugene 6 was used. In all experiments, a pBABE lacZ control was included to measure transfection efficiency, which was ∼40%. Immunoprecipitations and Protein Expression—For E1A immunoprecipitations, retrovirally transduced IMR90s and transfected U2OS cells were collected for co-immunoprecipitation analysis 1 day postselection or 2 days after transfection, respectively. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 170 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture with EDTA (Roche Applied Science), rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove nonsoluble debris. Protein levels were normalized using Bradford (Bio-Rad), antibodies were added, and lysates were incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibodies used in various immunoprecipitations were as follows: for E1A, 50 μlofM73 (36Harlow E. Franza B.J. Schley C. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 533-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for T Ag, 50 μl of Pab416 (37Harlow E. Crawford L.V. Pim D.C. Williamson N.M. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 861-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for p400, 20 μl of PO212 (13Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W.S. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); for p300, 50 μl of NM11 (38Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and for Rb, 25 μl of XZ55 and 25 μl of C36 (39Hu Q.J. Bautista C. Edwards G.M. Defeo-Jones D. Jones R.E. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5792-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The equivalent of 25 μl of drained beads of Protein A-Sepharose was added, and lysates were incubated with rotation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS reducing buffer (1× SDS reducing buffer: 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.02% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to activated nitrocellulose in 48 mm Tris, 390 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20% methanol for 13 h at 350 mA at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in TBS with Tween 20 (0.2%) and milk (5%). The antibodies used to probe membranes of various immunoprecipitations were anti-p400 (RW144 1:3 (11Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar)), anti-p300 (NM11 1:50 (38Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), anti-CBP (A-22 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), and anti-Rb (XZ55 1:100, C36 1:100, H14001A 1:1000 (39Hu Q.J. Bautista C. Edwards G.M. Defeo-Jones D. Jones R.E. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5792-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Pharmingen). For immunoblotting, cell pellets were lysed in 1× SDS reducing buffer (above) by boiling for 5 min. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Samples were normalized using a Bradford assay and was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to either nitrocellulose or activated polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P) membranes using one of two conditions: either for 90 min at 100 V at room temperature using a 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% MeOH transfer buffer or for 16 h at 350 mA at 4 °C using a 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol transfer buffer. Membranes were blocked as above. The antibodies used to probe membranes of various immunoblots were anti-E1A (sc-430 (13 S-5) 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p53 (DO-1 (human) or 505 (murine) 1:1000; Novocastra), anti-ARF (sc-8340 (human) 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); ab80 (murine) 1:1000 (Abcam); anti-p400 (above); anti-β-actin (ac-15 1:3500; Sigma); and anti-tubulin (B-512 1:5000; Sigma). Northern Blots—Northern blots were conducted using total RNA purified by Trizol (Invitrogen). Twenty μg of total RNA was fractionated on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 10× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C with 32P-labeled probes in 7% SDS, 0.5 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.1 mg/ml tRNA, and 10 mm EDTA. The membranes were washed twice at 65 °C in 2× SSC for 10 min, twice at 65 °C in 1× SSC for 10 min, and twice at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC for 10 min. Probes for ARF and 18 S rRNA were labeled by random priming (T7 QuickPrime; Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells plated on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C. Slides were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% normal goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a primary antibody in blocking solution. The antibodies used were anti-p19ARF (1:100; Novus Biologicals NB200-106) and anti-E1A (1:50; M58 + M73). Slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 min at room temperature in blocking solution containing 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindonle (Sigma), mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and viewed under a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope (Axioscop 50; Thornwood, NY). Cell Viability—Cells (1 × 105) were plated into 12-well plates 24 h before treatment. Twenty-four h following treatment with adriamycin or serum withdrawal, adherent and nonadherent cells were pooled and analyzed for viability by trypan blue exclusion. At least 200 cells were counted for each data point. Cell death was confirmed to be apoptosis by visualizing chromatin condensation with 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindonle (Sigma). All values represent data from at least three separate experiments. Relative apoptosis (see Fig. 1) was determined by comparing cell death 24 h after treatment with increasing doses of adriamycin (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μg/ml). Values ((percentage of apoptosis mutant/percentage of full-length E1A) × 100) were averaged for all doses and represent the average of at least three independent trials. Values were internally controlled by calculating relative apoptosis based on the values for full-length E1A in the same trial. In order to better understand the apoptotic activity of E1A, we conducted an extensive structure-function analysis to correlate the regions of E1A capable of binding specific cellular proteins with those required to engage the ARF-p53 pathway and to promote apoptosis. To do this, we cloned a panel of E1A mutants that altered or deleted various residues in the N-terminal 143 amino acids into a pLPC vector that also expressed a puromycin resistance gene. Since the 12 S form of E1A (which contains conserved regions 1 and 2 but not conserved region 3) is sufficient to induce p53 and apoptosis (40Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), all of the N-terminal mutants were studied in a 12 S E1A background. Each vector was then packaged into a retrovirus and introduced into IMR90 normal diploid human fibroblasts or early passage MEFs. The resulting populations were placed in puromycin (∼2 days) to eliminate uninfected cells, and all assays were conducted shortly thereafter to minimize selection for or against individual E1A mutants. Using this approach, we produced a series of polyclonal cell populations harboring full-length or mutant E1A. Interactions between E1A and Cellular Proteins in Normal Cells—Although the regions of E1A required for interacting with key transformation targets such as p300, CBP, and Rb have been previously identified, no study has examined these interactions in normal cells. Therefore, to rule out any differences between cell types, we examined the ability of key E1A mutants to interact with p300, CBP, and Rb when expressed in IMR90 fibroblasts. For p300/CBP and Rb, the results in normal human IMR90 fibroblasts were largely similar to what has been reported in other cell types, with only minor variations in requirements for binding p300 within the CR1 region (summarized in Fig. 1B and Refs. 41Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 42Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar)). For example, the RG2 and Δ2–11 mutants fail to interact with p300 and CBP but retain Rb binding. In contrast, the E1A ΔCR2 mutant interacts with p300 and CBP but not Rb, whereas the E1A Δ26–35 mutant interacts with p300, CBP, and Rb (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal region of E1A is also required for binding to p400-TRRAP chromatin-remodeling complexes, although this interaction has not been mapped comprehensively. Therefore, we tested the ability of our E1A mutants to interact with p400 in either IMR90 or U2OS cells by co-immunoprecipitation (summarized in Fig. 1B and examples shown in Fig. 2B; see also Ref. 13Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W.S. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)). Significantly, E1A requires amino acids 16–36 to interact with p400, a region that is distinct from those required for p300 or Rb interaction (Fig. 1D, top). The Δ26–35 mutant, which has been previously described (13Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W.S. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), is unique in that it only weakly binds p400-TRRAP yet retains its ability to interact with p300 and Rb (Fig. 2, A (compare lanes 5 and 8) and B (compare lanes 5 and 8)). Together, this analysis created a comprehensive map of the regions of E1A required to interact with p300, CBP, Rb, and p400 in normal cells that confirms and extends reports from immortal or tumor-derived lines (Fig. 1, A, B, and D, top). A p400-TRRAP Complex Is Important for E1A to Promote Apoptosis—We next identified the regions of E1A required to promote apoptosis. Whereas E1A can directly promote apoptosis in the context of adenovirus infection (43White E. Cipriani R. Sabbatini P. Denton A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2968-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44White E. Sabbatini P. Debbas M. Wold W.S. Kusher D.I. Gooding L.R. Mol. Cell.

A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), retrovirally transduced cells can tolerate E1A but become highly sensitized to apoptosis following treatment with DNA-damaging agents or upon growth factor depletion (46Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar, 47Lowe S.W. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Ruley H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, IMR90 and MEF cell populations expressing an empty vector, full-length E1A, or various E1A mutants were treated with adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent known to damage DNA, and analyzed for cell viability 24 h later by trypan blue exclusion (summarized in Fig. 1C, shown in Table I and Fig. 3). Importantly, we have previously shown that E1A-expressing cells undergo apoptosis under the conditions used in this study (adriamycin treatment and serum depletion) using DNA ladder analysis, annexin V staining, apoptotic chromatin condensation, caspase cleavage, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and electron microscopy (20Samuelson A.V.

Especially in photosynthetic organisms, the biochemical basis for the requirement for selenium is unclear because there is little information on selenoproteins.

However, no typical selenocysteine insertion sequence was found in the EhSEP2 cDNA. The EhSEP2 mRNA level was related to the abundance of selenium.

However, no typical selenocysteine insertion sequence was found in the EhSEP2 cDNA. The EhSEP2 mRNA level was related to the abundance of selenium. E. huxleyi possesses a novel PDI-like selenoprotein and may have a novel type of selenocysteine insertion machinery. Selenium is an essential micronutrient in the diet of many life forms, including humans and other mammals. In mammals, selenium functions primarily in selenoproteins as selenocysteine (Sec), 1The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; SECIS, Sec insertion sequence; TRX, thioredoxin; UTR, untranslated region. which is found in the active site of selenoproteins and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. Sec is inserted into proteins cotranslationally in response to the codon UGA, which is usually a stop codon, and the specific Sec insertion machinery. The machinery includes a cis-acting mRNA structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, and trans-acting factors, such as Sec tRNA, selenophosphate synthetase, Sec synthase, Sec-specific elongation factor, and a SECIS-binding protein (1Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The SECIS element is found in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of every eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNA. The eukaryotic SECIS element forms a structure with two loops and two helices in which the core quartet of non-Watson-Crick base pairs, a TGA_GA motif, is highly conserved (2Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Selenoproteins have been identified in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Most selenoproteins are oxidoreductase enzymes. Sec functions as an extraordinarily reactive cysteine (Cys) in selenoenzymes because of the greater nucleophilic power and lower pK of Sec versus Cys (3Fu L.H. Wang X.F. Eyal Y. She Y.M. Donald L.J. Standing K.G. Ben-Hayyim G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25983-25991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). More than 50 selenoproteins have been identified in eukaryotes, and their distribution across taxa varies greatly. For instance, 25 selenoproteins have been identified in the human genome but only one in worms and three in flies (2Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). When the genomes of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were sequenced, no selenoprotein genes or components of the Sec insertion pathway were found (4Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H. Kryukov G.V. Xiang Y. Weeks D.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In addition, there are some Cys-containing enzymes with reactivity compatible with Sec-containing homologs (5Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The variations in selenoproteins and the existence of homologs in which Sec is replaced by Cys raise the questions of why selenium is necessary and what the functions of selenium are in many life forms. The characterization of novel selenoproteins and Sec-insertion systems is important for elucidating the seemingly contradictory observations in the evolution of selenoproteins and their essential nature in some organisms. In photosynthetic organisms, the biochemical basis for the essential nature of selenium is unclear because there is little information on selenoproteins despite mounting evidence that selenium is required for the growth of algae (6Doblin M.A. Blackburn S.I. Hallegraeff G.M. J. Plankton Res. 1999; 21: 1153-1169Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, Novoselov et al. (4Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H. Kryukov G.V. Xiang Y. Weeks D.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) identified 10 selenoproteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, although the alga does not require selenium for growth. Sec-containing glutathione peroxidase is the only selenoprotein that has been found in Thalassiosira pseudonana, a selenium-requiring photosynthetic organism (7Price N.M. Harrison P.J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase may not be an essential enzyme for photosynthetic organisms because ascorbate peroxidase will eliminate H2O2 in plant systems, whereas glutathione peroxidase is necessary in mammalian systems (8Eshdat Y. Holland D. Faltin Z. Ben-Hayyim G. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 234-240Crossref Google Scholar). Coccolithophorids are unicellular algae in the division Haptophyta, which are characterized by exoskeletons of calcareous plates, known as coccoliths. It is important to identify the factors regulating their growth because of their significant environmental impact. We reported previously that a coccolithophorid, Emiliania huxleyi, has an obligatory growth requirement for nanomolar levels of selenium (9Danbara A. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 762-766Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and has a novel metabolic pathway that is efficiently functional for the synthesis of selenoproteins. In this process, extracellular selenite ions are incorporated into the cells by an ATP-dependent transport system. Then, selenium is immediately fixed and accumulated as low molecular mass selenium compounds and stored as a selenium pool. The selenium from the pool is used for the synthesis of selenium-containing proteins via the translation process (10Obata T. Araie H. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to the classification by Cavalier-Smith (11Cavalier-Smith T. Eur. J. Protistol. 2003; 39: 338-348Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), E. huxleyi belongs to the kingdom Chromista, which is considered to have arisen via secondary endosymbiosis, in which a eukaryotic host cell acquired its plastid from a eukaryotic algal symbiont. Phylogenetically, the alga is distinct from organisms possessing selenoprotein genes, such as mammals and green algae. Based on these phylogenetic characteristics and the existence of a novel metabolic pathway for selenium in E. huxleyi, it is anticipated that new types of selenoproteins and a novel Sec insertion system will be found in the analysis of the selenoproteins of this organism. As a result, we identified a novel eukaryotic selenoprotein in E. huxleyi for which Sec is encoded by TGA, but no SECIS-like element was identified. This selenoprotein showed homology to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and Sec was located in the active site of its thioredoxin (TRX) domain. Cell Growth and Metabolic Labeling—The organism studied was the coccolithophorid E. huxleyi (NIES 873). Cells were grown in artificial seawater (Marine Art SF; Senju Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan), enriched with Erd-Schreiber's medium in which the soil extract was replaced with 10 nm sodium selenite (MA-ESM) according to Danbara and Shiraiwa (9Danbara A. Shiraiwa Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 762-766Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained under constant illumination of 100 μmol m-2s-1 at 20 °C. For metabolic radioisotope labeling, the cells were grown until late linear growth phase for about 1 week in MA-ESM with 10 nm 75Se-selenite purchased from the Research Reactor Facility of the University of Missouri (167 GBq/mmol, Columbia, MO) or Isotope Products Laboratories (144 GBq/mmol, Burbank, CA). Detection of 75Se-labeled Proteins in E. huxleyi—75Se-labeled cells from a 4-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation (3,500 × g for 10 min at 20 °C) and suspended in 50 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3 mm EDTA (extraction buffer). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recentrifuged to obtain the “soluble fraction” as the supernatant. The pellet was washed five times with the extraction buffer and then suspended in extraction buffer containing 1% SDS. After incubation on ice for 1 h to solubilize proteins, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was obtained as the “insoluble fraction.” The samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE. For two-dimensional PAGE, the total proteins in the soluble fraction were treated using a two-dimensional clean-up kit (Amersham Biosciences). In the first dimension, IEF was performed with 7-cm IPG strips, pH 3-10 (Amersham Biosciences) in an IPGphore IEF system (Amersham Biosciences). In the second dimension, SDS-PAGE was performed on a 12.5% acrylamide gel. The gels were silver stained with two-dimensional silver stain·II DAIICHI (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). 75Se-Labeled proteins were visualized by radioluminography using a BAS5000 system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Purification of EhSEP2—The soluble fraction was passed through a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer A). The solution was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl (Toso, Tokyo, Japan) column that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer A, and the proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 0.1 m Na2SO4. The radioactivity in the fractions was measured using a γ-counter (COBRA II, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The radioactive fractions were applied to SDS-PAGE individually to detect the 75Se-proteins in each fraction. The fractions containing EhSEP2 were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep YM10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated fractions were subjected to gel filtration using a Diol-150 HPLC column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 with 0.2 m Na2SO4. The radioactive fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to SDS-PAGE to detect 75Se-labeled EhSEP2. For amino acid sequencing, nonradioactive EhSEP2 was prepared in parallel from a 40-liter culture using the same protocol used to purify 75Se-labeled EhSEP2. To confirm that the labeled and unlabeled selenoproteins were identical, samples were loaded in adjacent lanes of a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, and the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained and radioactive protein bands were compared. The unlabeled selenoproteins were extracted from the respective bands on the gel according to the method described by Hanawa et al. (13Hanawa Y. Iwamoto K. Shiraiwa Y. Jpn. J. Phycol. 2004; 52: 95-100Google Scholar). Lysyl endopeptidase (0.2 μg ml-1, Wako, Osaka, Japan) was added to the extracted EhSEP2 solution and incubated for 18 h. The digested and undigested peptides were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained peptide bands were used to analyze the N-terminal amino acid sequence by Edman degradation using a model 491 Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Gene Research Center, University of Tsukuba. Isolation of cDNA Encoding EhSEP2—Total RNA was extracted from E. huxleyi cells at exponential growth phase using the RNAgents Total RNA Isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the PolyATtract mRNA Isolation system (Promega). An RNA PCR kit (AMV) version 2.1 (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) with a poly(T) first strand synthesis primer was used to generate cDNA from mRNA. The sequences of the primers used in this study are shown in Table I. The primers used to amplify the initial fragment (see “Results”) were DS1 and DAS1. An RNA PCR kit (AMV) version 2.1 and the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (BD Biosciences) were used for 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR, respectively. The gene-specific primers used for 3′-RACE PCR were 3S1 and nested primer 3S2. Primer 5AS1 and nested primer 5AS2 were used as gene-specific primers for 5′-RACE PCR. Genomic DNA of E. huxleyi was extracted from the cells harvested at exponential growth phase using CTAB (14LoSchiavo F. Baldan B. Compagnin D. Ganz R. Mariani P. Terzi M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The primer sets used to amplify the genomic DNA were GS1/GAS1 and the nested primers GS2/GAS2. PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on a DNA sequencer model 310 (Applied Biosystems).Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimerSequenceDS15′-TIACICCIGAYAAYTTYGAYG-3′DAS15′-CCYTCYTCIACIGGIGGRTTRAA-3′3S15′-AGGCCATTGCAAAAAGATGA-3′3S25′-CTCATCGCTGACGTTGACTG-3′5AS15′-CAGTCAACGTCAGCGATGAGGACCTTCT-3′5AS25′-GGGCTTCATCTTTTTGCAATGGCCTCAC-3′GS15′-GCGACGTACAAGGAGTCGAT-3′GS25′-GATGGACAAGCTGGAGAAGC-3′GAS15′-GAATTCTGATTTATCGTGTTTAATTAAAGAGAS25′-TTAAAGACAGCTACGATCAACG-3′PS15′-GGATCCGGCGCAATCGAGCTGACCCCTGA-3′PS25′-GAATTCTCAAACCTCGTCCTTGGCGCCCTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Samples containing 15 μg of total RNA, extracted from E. huxleyi cells as described above, were electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and baked at 80 °C for 2 h. These RNA samples were probed with a 32P-labeled Ehsep2 open reading frame isolated by PCR using primers PS1 and PAS1. The probes were generated using a BcaBEST labeling kit (TaKaRa). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C according to Church and Gilbert (15Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). The radioactivity of the bands was determined using a BAS5000 with Image Gauge software (Fuji Film). E. huxleyi cells were incubated with 75Se-selenite for 1 week. The cells were disrupted by sonication and then fractionated by centrifugation into soluble and insoluble fractions. Then both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 75Se-Labeled proteins were detectable only in the soluble fraction but not in the insoluble one (data not shown). Further analysis by IEF/SDS-PAGE revealed that the soluble fraction contained four major 75Se-labeled proteins with molecular masses of 61, 27, 29, and 23 kDa (EhSEP1 to 4, respectively, Fig. 1B). The isoelectric points of EhSEP1 to 4 were approximately 6.6, 5.3, 5.9, and 5.4, respectively. The 27-kDa protein (EhSEP2) was the most abundant 75Se-containing protein (Fig. 1A). The 75Se radioluminographic pattern (Fig. 1B) did not match the amount of protein seen in the silver staining profile (Fig. 1A), suggesting the presence of specific 75Se-labeled Sec-containing proteins, rather than the labeling of general proteins through nonspecific 75Se incorporation. For further analysis to characterize the selenoprotein, EhSEP2 was subjected to a large scale purification. During anion-exchange chromatography, all the 75Se-labeled proteins were eluted using buffer containing 0.1 m Na2SO4. The fraction was concentrated and then applied to subsequent gel filtration. Most of the radioactivity was eluted into fractions 27, 28, 31, and 32 (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE analysis of these fractions revealed that EhSEP2 was present in fractions 27 and 28, along with EhSEP1. Fractions 31 and 32 did not contain EhSEP2, but contained EhSEP3 and 4 and two additional 75Se-labeled proteins (EhSEP5 and 6) (Fig. 2B). Although EhSEP5 and 6 were present in very small amounts, both might be detectable because of the condensation of proteins in the purification steps. EhSEP2 was finally purified by elution from the band cut from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The homogeneous purification was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 2C). The internal and N-terminal amino acid sequences of EhSEP2 were determined by Edman degradation of the undigested and lysyl endopeptidase-digested peptides (Table II). Both of the sequences showed homology to PDI-like proteins of Aspergillus niger, Neurospora crassa, and A. thaliana with expected values under 10. The regions showing homology with the N terminus of EhSEP2 were those of mature peptides in PDI-like proteins.Table IIDetermined partial amino acid sequences of EhSEP2Amino acid sequenceGAIELTPDNFDELVLKSGKAA (N-terminal sequence)YENPPVEEGGAYKAL Open table in a new tab To identify the gene encoding EhSEP2 (called Ehsep2 here), a 0.8-kb full-length cDNA sequence was obtained in three steps (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). In the first step, we determined a partial cDNA sequence using a set of degenerate primers based on both the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of EhSEP2. As a result, a 250-bp fragment was obtained. This PCR product encoded the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences obtained by Edman degradation, confirming that it corresponds to the EhSEP2 protein (enclosed area in Fig. 3A). Next, we cloned the 3′- and 5′-ends of the gene using RACE PCR and obtained 500- and 200-bp fragments by 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR, respectively. The sequence of the 5′-RACE product contained the ATG start codon. The 3′-RACE product contained a poly(A) tail, but part of the sequence in the 3′-UTR (the highlighted sequence in Fig. 3A) differed in every clone. This polymorphism might be the result of unsuccessful reverse transcription attributable to the secondary structure of the mRNA. In the third step, we determined the 3′-UTR sequence correctly by PCR using E. huxleyi genomic DNA as a template to avoid the influence of secondary structure on the mRNA. Then, a 200-bp fragment was obtained, and the 3′-UTR sequence was identified. Consequently, the full-length EhSEP2 cDNA was completed (Fig. 3A). It contained a 672-nucleotide open reading frame followed by a 95-nucleotide 3′-UTR. This open reading frame encoded 223 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25 kDa and a pI of 5.1. The open reading frame contained a TGA at codon position 47 in-frame with the first ATG. The EhSEP2 peptide that was encoded by the nucleotide sequence located downstream from the TGA codon was sequenced directly by Edman degradation (Table II and Fig. 3A), confirming that the TGA codon in this gene was read through without serving as a terminator signal. These observations, along with the fact that EhSEP2 contained selenium specifically, indicated that the TGA codon in the Ehsep2 gene encoded Sec. A homology search of the SWISS-PROT data base using the deduced amino acid sequence of EhSEP2 revealed that the amino acid sequence of EhSEP2 had strong sequence similarity to the PDI precursors of many organisms, such as A. thaliana (expected = 4 × e-25) and N. crassa (expected = 8 × e-23), especially around the TRX domain (Fig. 3B). The in-frame TGA codon occurred at the position corresponding to the active site Cys present in all TRX-containing proteins. Because no Sec-containing PDI-like protein has been reported, EhSEP2 is likely a novel eukaryotic selenoprotein. The results of the homology search and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of EhSEP2 protein suggest that the first 17 amino acid residues comprise a signal peptide. The calculated molecular mass and pI of mature EhSEP2 were 23 kDa and 5.0, respectively. EhSEP2 contained a “KDEV” motif at the C terminus, which is very similar to the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal sequence KDEL. These results suggest that EhSEP2 localizes in the ER, as does PDI. No SECIS element was found in the 3′-UTR of EhSEP2 mRNA in a computational search for SECIS elements using SECISearch 2.1 (2Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the secondary structure of the 3′-UTR in EhSEP2 mRNA drawn using the program RNAfold (16Hofacker I.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3429-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). There is no conserved UGAN... NGAN sequence, which forms the core (quartet) of non-Watson-Crick interacting nucleotides. EhSEP2 mRNA contains two helix-loop-helix-loop structures, although the lengths of the SECIS-like structures differ from those of known SECIS elements (Fig. 4). The helices in the structure immediately downstream from the stop codon were mostly composed of G and C (Fig. 4). The extremely high GC content indicates that the helices have a rigid structure. This assumption is supported by the unsuccessful reverse transcription-PCR. The SECIS-like structure in the 3′-UTR of Ehsep2 resembles the archaeal SECIS element rather than the eukaryotic one because of the GC-rich nature of the helices (17Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amounts of Ehsep2 transcripts under selenium-sufficient and -deficient conditions were analyzed using Northern hybridization (Fig. 5). To induce selenium deficiency in the experimental culture, cells were precultured for 1 week in medium containing only 1 nm selenite, which is 1/10 the concentration of the standard culture medium. Cells were harvested during the linear growth phase and resuspended in fresh selenium-free medium. Half of the suspension was cultured under selenium-depleted conditions (-Se cells), and the other half was grown in selenium-sufficient conditions (+Se cells) by adding 10 nm (final concentration) selenite at the start of the experiment. The growth rates of both cells were maintained at the same level for the first 25 h. Thereafter, only the division of the -Se cells was arrested (Fig. 5A), showing the onset of selenium deficiency. A few Ehsep2 transcripts were detected in the cells at the start of the experimental culture (0.5 h in Fig. 5, B and C), and the low level of transcripts was maintained in the -Se cells during the experiment (-Se in Fig. 5, B and C). By contrast, the level of transcripts increased up to five times on adding 10 nm selenite to the medium (+Se in Fig. 5, B and C). We found four major (Fig. 1, A and B) and two minor (Fig. 2B) selenium-containing proteins in E. huxleyi. The dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina (18Osaka T. Beika A. Hattori A. Kohno Y. Kato K.H. Mizutani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the green alga C. reinhardtii (4Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H. Kryukov G.V. Xiang Y. Weeks D.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3681-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) each possess four major selenium-containing proteins. Similar numbers of selenoproteins may be common in microalgae, in contrast to the lack of selenoproteins in land plants. Of the E. huxleyi selenium-containing proteins, EhSEP2 is the first selenoprotein to exhibit homology to PDI, which is a very abundant oxidoreductase protein that catalyzes the formation, reduction, and isomerization of protein disulfide bonds in the ER. PDI assists in the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (19Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and may be involved in the quality control system, whereby misfolded proteins are destined for degradation in the cell (20Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, PDI constitutes ∼2% of the protein in the ER and is recognized as indispensable. Its essential role in this organism is the isomerization (21Laboissière M.C.A. Sturley S.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28006-28009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and oxidation of disulfide bonds in proteins (22Solovyov A. Xiao R.Y. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34095-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional PAGE profile revealed that EhSEP2 is abundant in E. huxleyi cells (Fig. 1A). EhSEP2 seems to be glycosylated as many other PDIs because the values of molecular mass and pI determined by two-dimensional PAGE are different from those estimated from its amino acid sequence (see “Results”). Furthermore, the KDEV motif in the C terminus of EhSEP2 protein suggests that EhSEP2 resides in the ER (Fig. 3A). This implies a PDI-like function for EhSEP2, although the enzyme activity of EhSEP2 remains to be determined. If EhSEP2 functions as a PDI localized in the ER, selenium deficiency would result in dysfunction of the Sec-containing PDI, causing a critical delay in the maturation of newly synthesized proteins, which would then arrest cell division; this is a reasonable answer to the question of why a photosynthetic organism, such as E. huxleyi, requires selenium. PDI-like proteins contain one, two, or three active redox TRX domains, each of which contains the active site motif -CGHC-. Most PDI-like proteins catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds in vitro and in vivo (23Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and the multidomain structure contributes to high catalytic efficiency (24Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). EhSEP2 contains only one TRX domain (Fig. 3A). In EhSEP2, Sec is located in a -UGHC-motif at the position corresponding to the active site motif in PDI-like proteins (Fig. 3B). Because the activity of PDI is dependent on the reactivity of the N-terminal Cys residue in the active site motif (23Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the N-terminal Cys residue is replaced by Sec at the active site of EhSEP2 to increase the catalytic efficiency of this PDI-like protein with a single domain structure. The position of Sec in EhSEP2 matches that in the TRX of Treponema denticola, which was shown recently to be a selenoprotein in a computational analysis (17Kryukov G.V. Gladyshev V.N. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This suggests the evolutionary relationship between EhSEP2 and archaeal TRX. Ehsep2 transcripts increased with the addition of selenium to the medium (Fig. 5, B and C). Transcripts were maintained at a low level before the arrest of cell division (Fig. 5, A and C), suggesting that this did not occur as a result of a disorder in the cells but was regulated directly by the abundance of selenium in the cells. The selenium-dependent regulation of EhSEP2 mRNA is an important criterion for establishing EhSEP2 as a selenoprotein. Such selenium-dependent regulation of selenoprotein mRNA levels has been reported in many selenoproteins (25Sun X. Maquat L.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When UGA is not translated as Sec and premature termination of translation occurs, the selenoprotein mRNA is degraded by the mRNA surveillance pathway in a process called nonsense-mediated decay. In the selenium-deficient condition, selenoprotein mRNA is not translated completely because of the absence of Sec, and the frequency of nonsense-mediated decay increases, decreasing the amount of selenoprotein mRNA (25Sun X. Maquat L.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Weiss S.L. Sunde R.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reduction in EhSEP2 mRNA during selenium deprivation suggests the participation of a Sec insertion machinery in the synthesis of EhSEP2 because such selenium-dependent regulation is closely related to the Sec insertion machinery. However, neither eukaryotic nor prokaryotic SECIS elements, important components of the Sec insertion machinery, were found in the EhSEP2 mRNA (Fig. 4). The TGA at codon position 47 certainly serves as a Sec-encoding codon despite the lack of a typical SECIS element, suggesting that E. huxleyi has a novel SECIS element or Sec insertion system. We demonstrated previously that selenium is inserted into proteins cotranslationally in E. huxleyi (10Obata T. Araie H. Shiraiwa Y.

These facts suggest the existence of a functioning eukaryote-type Sec insertion machinery and a novel SECIS element in E. huxleyi. The novel eukaryotic SECIS element will be identified by comparing the genes encoding the other five 75Se-labeled proteins of E. huxleyi. Novoselov et al. (4Novoselov S.V. Rao M. Onoshko N.V. Zhi H.

Our study suggests a greater diversity of eukaryotic SECIS elements than expected and the existence of another origin of SECIS in eukaryotes. In conclusion, we identified Ehsep2, a gene encoding a PDI-like selenoprotein, from the haptophyte alga E. huxleyi. Ehsep2 contains no known SECIS element. These results have important implications for the presence of novel selenoproteins and SECIS elements in eukaryotes. Although many unicellular photosynthetic organisms belonging to the kingdom Chromista require selenium (6Doblin M.A. Blackburn S.I. Hallegraeff G.M. J. Plankton Res. 1999; 21: 1153-1169Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), only a few studies have focused on their selenoproteins. The selenoproteins in chromists should be characterized further to reveal general features of the requirement for selenium and the evolution of selenoproteins, namely the evolution of the use of selenium in all organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2033395349,"Although water is only present in trace amounts in the suboceanic upper mantle, it is thought to play a significant role in affecting mantle viscosity, melting and the generation of crust at mid-ocean ridges. The concentration of water in oceanic basalts has been observed to stay below 0.2 wt%, except for water-rich basalts sampled near hotspots and generated by 'wet' mantle plumes. Here, however, we report unusually high water content in basaltic glasses from a cold region of the mid-ocean-ridge system in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. These basalts are sodium-rich, having been generated by low degrees of melting of the mantle, and contain unusually high ratios of light versus heavy rare-earth elements, implying the presence of garnet in the melting region. We infer that water-rich basalts from such regions of thermal minima derive from low degrees of 'wet' melting greater than 60 km deep in the mantle, with minor dilution by melts produced by shallower 'dry' melting--a view supported by numerical modelling. We therefore conclude that oceanic basalts are water-rich not only near hotspots, but also at 'cold spots'."
https://openalex.org/W2023462182,"About 30 different nucleoporins (Nups) constitute the nuclear pore complex. We have affinity-purified 28 of these nuclear pore proteins and identified new nucleoporin interactions by this analysis. We found that Nup157 and Nup170, two members of the large structural Nups, and the Gly-Leu-Phe-Gly nucleoporin Nup145N specifically co-purified with members of the Nup84 complex. In addition, Nup145N co-enriched during Nup157 purification. By in vitro reconstitution, we demonstrate that Nup157 and Nup145N form a nucleoporin subcomplex. Moreover, we show that Nup157 and Nup145N bind to the heptameric Nup84 complex. This assembly thus represents approximately one-third of all nucleoporins. To characterize Nup157 structurally, we purified and analyzed it by electron microscopy. Nup157 is a hollow sphere that resembles a clamp or a gripping hand. Thus, we could reconstitute an interaction between a large structural Nup, an FG repeat Nup, and a major structural module of the nuclear pore complex."

The properties and molecular identity of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels in non-excitable cells is a focus of intense investigation. In the previous studies we used patch clamp electrophysiology to describe the properties of Ca2+ influx channels in human carcinoma A431 cell lines. Now we extend our studies to human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. By using a combination of Ca2+ imaging and whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings we discovered that: 1) HEK293 cells contain four types of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels: ICRAC, Imin, Imax, and INS; 2) ICRAC channels are highly Ca2+-selective (PCa/Cs > 1000) and ICRAC single channel conductance is too small for single channel analysis; 3) Imin channels in HEK293 cells display functional properties identical to Imin channels in A431 cells, with single channel conductance of 1.2 pS for divalent cations, 10 pS for monovalent cations, and divalent cation selectivity PBa/K = 20; 4) Imin channels in HEK293 cells are activated by InsP3 and inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but store-independent; 5) when compared with Imin, Imax channels have higher conductance for divalent (17 pS) and monovalent (33 pS) cations, but less selective for divalent cations (PBa/K = 4), 6) Imax channels in HEK293 cells can be activated by InsP3 or by Ca2+ store depletion; 7) INS channels are non-selective (PBa/K = 0.4) and display a single channel conductance of 5 pS; and 8) INS channels are not gated by InsP3 but activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores.

Activation of SOC Ca2+ influx pathways requires depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Functional properties and molecular identity of channels supporting ROC and SOC Ca2+ influx pathways is a focus of intense investigation.

Properties of ROC channels are much less understood due to the difficulty in separating direct effects of PLC activation from effects resulting from depletion of intracellular InsP -sensitive Ca2+3 stores. Most of the functional studies of ROC and SOC Ca2+ influx pathways have been performed using Ca2+ imaging or whole cell current recordings. We reasoned that single channel patch clamp recordings provide unique and precise information about functional properties of individual types of channels supporting Ca2+ influx in non-excitable cells.

Obtained results also provide interesting insights into similarities and differences between Ca2+ influx pathways in A431 and HEK293 cells. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells (Cell Culture Collection, Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C with humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. For patch clamp and Ca2+ imaging experiments cells were seeded onto coverslips and maintained in culture for 1–3 days before use. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Ad-InsP3R-N adenovirus was generated using the AdEasy system according to published procedures (31He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, an amino-terminal fragment of rat InsP3R1 (32Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (M1-K604) was amplified by PCR (with addition of 5′-untranslated region Kozak sequence and carboxyl-terminal His6 tag) and subcloned into KpnI/XhoI sites of pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector. Resulting pAdTrack-CMV-InsP3R-N plasmid was linearized by PmeI and cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells together with pAdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid. Recombinants were selected by kanamycin resistance and confirmed by PCR analysis. Recombinant adenoviral plasmid pAd-InsP3R-N was isolated, linearized by PacI, and transfected into HEK293 cells for packaging. Transfected cells were monitored for GFP expression, collected 10 days after transfection, and lysed by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing in methanol/dry ice bath. Collected viral lysate (P1) was clarified by centrifugation and high titer (P3) stock of Ad-InsP3R-N adenovirus was obtained by repetitive rounds of HEK293 cell infection. Obtained high titer stock of Ad-InsP3R-N adenovirus was aliquoted, frozen at –70 °C and transported on dry ice from Dallas, TX, to St. Petersburg, Russia for experiments. Ca2+ Imaging—HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM in the presence of 0.025% Pluronic for 20–30 min. Loaded cells were illuminated by alternating 340 and 380 nm excitation light at 2-Hz frequency. Emission fluorescence intensity was measured at 510 nm with the use of an InCyt Basic I/P dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). The change of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in cells was expressed as the ratio of emission fluorescence intensity at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths (340/380 ratio). In experiments with recombinant adenovirus HEK293 cells were infected using high titer stock of Ad-InsP3R-N 2–3 days prior to Ca2+ imaging experiments. The efficiency of infection was close to 100% based on GFP fluorescence. Whole Cell Recordings—Whole cell recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) with a conventional 10-GΩ feedback resistance in the head stage. Resistance of Sylgard-coated, fire-polished glass microelectrodes was 3–5 mΩ. Series resistance was not compensated. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 N-methyl-d-glutamine aspartate, 10 Cs-EGTA (or 12 Cs-BAPTA), 10 Cs-HEPES, pH 7.3, 1.5 MgCl2, and either 4.5 CaCl2 (pCa 7.0) or no CaCl2 added (pCa > 9). Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140 N-methyl-d-glutamine aspartate, 10 BaCl2, 10 Cs-HEPES, pH 7.3. During recording the currents were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered digitally at 500 Hz. pClamp6 software suite (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. In all whole cell experiments the holding potential was 0 mV. Periodically (once every 4–30 s) the membrane potential was stepped to –100 mV (for 30 ms), and a 170-ms voltage ramp to +70 mV was applied. Traces recorded before current activation were used as a template for leak subtraction. The recorded currents were normalized to the cell capacitance. The mean value of cell capacitance was 40 ± 5 picofarads (n = 41). Single Channel Recordings—Single channel recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier and glass pipettes with 8- to 15-MΩ resistance. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 105 BaCl2 or 140 NaCl as indicated and 10 Tris-HCl (pH 7.3). In cell-attached (c/a) experiments, the bath solution contained 140 mm KCl and 2 mm CaCl2 to nullify the resting potential of the cell. In store depletion experiments 1 mm TPEN or 100 μm BAPTA-AM and 1 μm thapsigargin were added to the bath solution containing (in mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 10 K-Hepes, and 2 EGTA (pH 7.4). In inside-out (i/o) experiments the intracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 potassium glutamate, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 K-EGTA, and 1.13 CaCl2 (pCa 7.0), with or without InsP3 as indicated. The drugs were applied to the patches by bath perfusion. The time required for a complete change of solution around the patch was less than 1 s. The single channel recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 100 Hz for analysis and presentation. pClamp6 software suite (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Unitary current amplitude was determined from current records and all-point amplitude histograms. The experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). PBa/K permeability ratio was calculated according to the GHK equation (33Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 448Google Scholar) (Equation 1), PBa/K=[Kin]/4[Baout]exp(ErevF/RT)[exp(ErevF/RT)+1] (Eq. 1) where [Kin] is intracellular K+ concentration (140 mm), [Baout] is Ba2+ concentration in the pipette (105 mm), Erev is the measured or extrapolated reversal potential, and RT/F = 25 mV for experiments performed at room temperature. NPo was determined by using the following equation: NPo = {I}/i, where {I} and i are the mean channel current and unitary current amplitude, respectively. {I} was estimated from the time integral of the current above the baseline, and i was determined from current records and all-point amplitude histograms. Data were collected from current records after channel activity reached steady state. Because channel activity was transient and displayed significant fluctuations, we used NPo collected during 30 s of maximal activity (NPo(30)) as a standard way to compare open channel probability among different experiments. Chemicals—HEPES, EGTA, BAPTA-AM, N-methyl-d-glutamine, and TPEN were from Sigma-Aldrich; UTP and InsP3 were from Calbiochem; and Fura-2AM and Pluronic were from Molecular Probes. Store-operated and Receptor-operated Ca2+Influx Pathways in HEK293 Cells—Application of 100 μm UTP to Fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells maintained in Ca2+-free media resulted in transient cytosolic Ca2+ elevation due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (Fig. 1A). Subsequent re-addition of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ resulted in second elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ due to Ca2+ entry via plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (Fig. 1A). Application of membrane-permeable low affinity Ca2+ chelator TPEN leads to rapid and reversible reduction of intraluminal Ca2+ concentration without disturbing cytosolic Ca2+ levels. We found that depletion of Ca2+ stores in HEK293 cells by 1 mm TPEN in Ca2+-free solution induces activation of Ca2+ influx following Ca2+ readdition (Fig. 1B). Ca2+ influx induced by depletion of intraluminal Ca2+ (Fig. 1B) is a signature of store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels, which have been previously described in many non-excitable cells (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J.

Thus, Ca2+ influx in response to UTP (Fig. 1A) can be mediated by plasma membrane receptor-operated Ca2+ (ROC) channels as a direct result of P2Y2 receptor activation or as result of SOC activation following depletion of InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. To determine if depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores is required for UTP-induced Ca2+ influx, we infected HEK293 cells with an adenovirus encoding the InsP3-binding amino-terminal region of rat InsP3R1 (Ad-InsP3R-N). Consistent with published observations (34Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), UTP-induced Ca2+ release was abolished in Ad-InsP3R-N-infected cells (Fig. 1C), presumably due to ability of InsP3R-N fragment to function as the “InsP3 sponge” (34Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite absence of Ca2+ release from InsP3-sensitive stores, addition of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in Ca2+ influx in Ad-InsP3R-N-infected cells exposed to UTP (Fig. 1C). Thus, we concluded that depletion of intracellular stores is not required for UTP-induced Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells, which appear to be at least in part mediated by ROC channels. Whole Cell Analysis of Ca2+Influx Pathways in HEK293 Cells—In the next series of experiments we measured whole cell Ca2+ currents activated in HEK293 cells by extracellular UTP. We found that in some HEK293 cells (2 out of 8) application of UTP induced highly Ca2+-selective current with strong inward rectification (Fig. 2A). In other HEK293 cells (6 out of 8) the currents induced by UTP displayed linear currentvoltage relationship with significant outward current at test potentials more positive than +30 mV (Fig. 2B). To characterize Ca2+ currents activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, we repeated whole cell recordings with addition of 12 mm BAPTA into pipette. We found that in some cells (2 out of 12) depletion of Ca2+ stores induced highly Ca2+-selective current with strong inward rectification (Fig. 2C). In other cells (5 out of 12) less Ca2+ selective linear current was induced by store depletion (Fig. 2D). In our previous whole cell experiments with A431 cells we observed activation of highly Ca2+-selective (ICRAC) and moderately Ca2+-selective (ISOC) currents by extracellular UTP and intracellular BAPTA (19Gusev K.

It appears that similar currents are also present in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A–D). In addition, some HEK293 cells (5 out of 12) express non-selective outwardly rectifying current activated by store depletion (Fig. 2E). This type of current was also rarely observed in whole cell experiments with A431 cells (data not shown). Imin Channels Act as ROC Channels in HEK293 Cells—In the previous studies we utilized single channel patch clamp recordings to characterize Ca2+ influx channels in A431 cells (13Mozhayeva G.N.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). What are the channels supporting Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells? To answer this question, we performed patch clamp recordings with HEK293 cells using 105 mm Ba2+ in the pipette as a current carrier. We found that application of 100 μm UTP to external surface of plasma membrane in cell-attached (c/a) patch evoked the activity of small conductance channels in 56 out of 118 attempts (Fig. 3A). Channels with similar properties were activated by application of 2.5 μm InsP3 to cytosolic surface of inside-out (i/o) patches (Fig. 3B) in 18 out of 80 experiments. The unitary current-voltage relationship of UTP-activated (in c/a experiments) and InsP3-activated (in i/o experiments) channels is shown on Fig. 3C. The linear fit to the current-voltage relationship resulted in a slope conductance of 1.2 pS for both UTP-activated (Fig. 3C, filled symbols) and InsP3-activated (Fig. 3C, open symbols) channels. The extrapolated reversal potential of these channels was equal to +50 mV (Fig. 3C), which corresponded to PBa/K = 20 (Equation 1) for ionic conditions used in our patch clamp experiments. Single exponential fit to the open dwell time distribution of UTP-activated channels yielded a mean open time of 9 ms (Fig. 3D). In our previous studies with A431 cells (13Mozhayeva G.N. Naumov A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2061381239,"The functional relationships between phosphoinositides and sphingolipids have not been well characterized to date. ISP-1/myriocin is a potent inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis and induces severe growth defects in eukaryotic cells because of the sphingolipid deprivation. We characterized a novel multicopy suppressor gene of ISP-1-mediated cell death in yeast, <i>MSS4</i>. <i>MSS4</i> encodes a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase that synthesizes phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>). We demonstrate here that ISP-1 treatment of yeast causes defects both in the activity and subcellular localization of Mss4. The effect of the Mss4 defect on the downstream signaling was examined, because interaction between the Mss4 product, PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>, and the pleckstrin-homology domain of Rom2 mediates recruitment of Rom2 to the membrane, which is the crucial step for subsequent Rho1/2 activation. Indeed, failure of Rom2 recruitment was observed in ISP-1-treated cells as well as in <i>csg2</i>-deleted cells, which have reduced mannosylated inositolphosphorylceramide. These data suggested that proper sphingolipids are required for the signaling pathway involving Mss4."

Previous structural studies have revealed that the αC-helix, located in the small lobe of the kinase domain of PDK1, is a key regulatory element, as it links a substrate interacting site termed the hydrophobic motif (HM) pocket with the phosphorylated Ser-241 in the T-loop. In this study we have demonstrated by mutational analysis that interactions between the phosphorylated Ser-241 and the αC-helix are not required for PDK1 activity or substrate binding through the HM-pocket but are necessary for PDK1 to be activated or stabilized by a peptide that binds to this site. The structure of an inactive T-loop mutant of PDK1, in which Ser-241 is changed to Ala, was also determined. This structure, together with surface plasmon resonance binding studies, demonstrates that the PDK1(S241A)-inactive mutant possesses an intact HM-pocket as well as an ordered αC-helix. These findings reveal that the integrity of the αC-helix and HM-pocket in PDK1 is not regulated by T-loop phosphorylation. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylates the T-loop of several AGC (cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, protein kinase C) family protein kinases, resulting in their activation.

The recent determination of the structure of the PDK1 PH domain has revealed the molecular basis for its interaction with phosphoinositides (5Komander D. Fairservice A. Deak M. Kular G.S.

The only PDK1 AGC kinase substrates to also possess a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2 binding PH domain are isoforms of PKB (also known as Akt) (1Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M.F.F. Alessi D.R. Sem. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Much evidence indicates that the mutual binding of PKB and PDK1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2 at the plasma membrane co-localizes these enzymes and is necessary for PKB to be activated by PDK1 (6Brazil D.P.

J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the other PDK1 AGC kinase substrates, including p70 ribosomal S6-kinase (8Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serum- and glucocorticoid-responsive kinase (9Lang F. Cohen P. Sci.

Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), do not bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2 or possess PH domains. Instead, these kinases possess conserved PDK1 docking sites located in a C-terminal region known as the hydrophobic motif (HM). Growth factors and hormones lead to the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of these AGC kinases, significantly enhancing their ability to interact with PDK1 (4Balendran A. Currie R.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1054-1060PubMed Google Scholar). The region on PDK1 that interacts with the hydrophobic motif of its substrates is termed the HM-pocket and is located on the N-terminal smaller lobe of the catalytic domain (13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The structure of the PDK1 catalytic domain revealed that the HM-pocket consisted of a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to a positively charged phosphate binding pocket (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). PDK1 itself is also an AGC kinase member and, like its substrates, requires to be phosphorylated at its T-loop (Ser-241) to be activated (16Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, PDK1 is capable of autophosphorylation at Ser-241 by an intermolecular reaction and is thus constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-241 (17Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The structural analysis of the PDK1 kinase domain has revealed that, similar to what has been observed in other kinases, the phosphorylated Ser-241 residue forms key interactions coordinating and aligning important catalytic motifs such as the αC-helix of the N-terminal lobe. The αC-helix plays a key role in all kinases as it contributes crucial residues to coordinating ATP. In PDK1 it positions the conserved Glu-130 residue such that it coordinates the conserved Lys-111, which interacts with the α-phosphate of ATP. This hydrogen bonding network is conserved in most protein kinases and is required for phosphoryl transfer. Many kinases are regulated by controlling the position and/or formation of the αC-helix. For example, the binding of cyclins to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) induces a rotation of the αC-helix, leading to CDK activation (18De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 19Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P.

More recently the structure of PKBβ in the unphosphorylated, inactive state was reported to possess a completely disordered αC-helix (21Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of PKBβ and interaction of PKBβ with its own hydrophobic motif (HM) led to ordering of this helix, resulting in PKB activation (22Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This suggested a new regulatory αC-helix-dependent mechanism in PKB and posed the question of whether other AGC family members would be regulated in a similar manner. In PDK1, phosphorylated Ser-241 interacts with 2 residues on the αC-helix (Tyr-126 and Arg-129) (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas PKBβ and PKA only possess a single interaction between the T-loop and the αC-helix (22Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 23Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the αC-helix also contributes hydrophobic as well as phosphate binding residues to the HM-pocket (Fig. 1A) (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Likewise, in active PKBβ the formation of the αC-helix leads to the creation of a pocket resembling the HM-pocket of PDK1. This pocket binds intramolecularly to the phosphorylated hydrophobic motif of PKBβ, and this interaction is required for maximal activation. Similarly, occupancy of the HM-pocket of PDK1 with peptides encompassing the phosphorylated HM docking residues of its substrates activates PDK1 4–6-fold and also stabilizes the enzyme (13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These observations have been interpreted as implying that PDK1 is activated through interaction with its substrates. In this study we explored the role of T-loop phosphorylation of PDK1 in regulating enzyme structure, activity, stability, and interaction with substrates. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—PDK1(S241A) (residues 51–359) was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf-21 cells as described previously for the 51–359 wild type PDK1 catalytic domain (15Biondi R.M.

For crystallization experiments, 50 μl of PDK1(S241A) at 6.8 mg/ml were mixed with 5 μl of ATP and incubated on ice for 1 h. The protein crystallized at 20 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of mother liquor (2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5). Prior to data collection, the crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data on the PDK1(S241A)·ATP complex were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID14-EH1 (Grenoble, France) to 1.95 Å.

For the thermal stability experiments shown in Fig. 2, prior to assay 150 ng of wild type GST·PDK1 or indicated mutant GST·PDK1 in the presence or absence of 100 μm HM-PRK2 in a volume of 25 μl was placed in a 96-well PCR plate. Following incubation for 2 min on a 40–60 °C step temperature gradient in a PCR machine (MJ Research PTC-200 Gradient Cycler), PDK1 activity was assayed as described above employing T308tide. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Binding was analyzed in a BiaCore 3000 system (BiaCore AB, Stevenage, UK) according to Ref. 13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A.

The biotinylated 24-residue peptide HM-PRK2 (Biotin-C12-REPRILSEEEQEMFRDFDYIADWC) was bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA) (25 response units). 30 μl of the indicated concentration of wild type or mutant GST·PDK1 were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in buffer HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate-20) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Specific interactions between HM-PRK2 and PDK1 proteins were obtained between the concentration range of 2.5–2000 nm PDK1. Steady state binding was determined at each concentration. Dissociation of PDK1 from the HM-PRK2 was monitored over a 1-min period. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed with 10-μl injections of 0.05% SDS. The Kd of interaction was calculated as described previously (13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R.

Mutation of Residues on PDK1 That Interact with Phosphorylated Ser-241—The crystal structure of PDK1 (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) revealed that the phosphorylated Ser-241 makes hydrogen bond interactions to 4 residues, Arg-204 and Lys-228 from the C-terminal lobe and Tyr-126 and Arg-129 from the αC-helix in the N-terminal lobe. The highly conserved Arg-204 immediately precedes the catalytic Asp-205, and the presence of this RD motif places PDK1 in the group of RD kinases (31Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 32Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Arg-204 is directly connected to the catalytic machinery because of its position within the catalytic loop and controls the fold of the activation loop after interaction with the phosphorylated Ser-241. Lys-228 may also play a role in aligning catalytic site residues, such as the Mg2+ interacting residue Asp-223 in the DFG motif. This is similar to the suggested role of the corresponding residues Arg-165 and Lys-189 in PKA (33Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the RD Arg in both Ser/Thr and Tyr protein kinases has confirmed its importance (34Leon B.C. Tsigelny I. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10078-10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D. Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the residue equivalent to PDK1 Arg-204 in PKBβ (Arg-274) was recently found to be mutated in a human family with severe diabetes and insulin resistance (37George S. Rochford J.J. Wolfrum C. Gray S.L. Schinner S. Wilson J.C. Soos M.A. Murgatroyd P.R. Williams R.M. Acerini C.L. Dunger D.B. Barford D. Umpleby A.M. Wareham N.J. Davies H.A. Schafer A.J. Stoffel M. O'Rahilly S. Barroso I. Science. 2004; 304: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Arg-204 and Lys-228 in PDK1, these residues were mutated to Ala. The effect that this had on PDK1 catalytic activity was assessed with an assay employing a peptide substrate (T308tide). In addition, the ability of these mutants to be activated by a peptide encompassing the hydrophobic motif of the PKC-related kinase-2 (PRK2), termed HM-PRK2, was also measured. In these assays HM-PRK2 was utilized at 1 μm, which maximally activates wild type PDK1, and at 10 μm, so activation could be detected if the affinity of the PDK1 mutant for the peptide were reduced. The ability of wild type and PDK1 mutants to interact directly with biotinylated HM-PRK2 peptide was also assessed, using a quantitative surface plasmon resonance assay. As expected, the PDK1(R204A) mutant possessed negligible catalytic activity in the presence or absence of HM-PRK2, similar to that of a previously characterized catalytically inactive PDK1 mutant, PDK1(K111A) (Fig. 1B). However, the PDK1(R204A) mutant still interacted with HM-PRK2 (Kd 478 ± 10 nm), albeit with reduced affinity compared with wild type PDK1 (Kd 72 ± 5nm) but with significantly greater affinity than two HM-pocket mutants of PDK1, PDK1(Q150E) and PDK1(K115A), that do not show detectable binding to HM-PRK2 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, PDK1(K228A) was normally active, could be further activated by 1 μm HM-PRK2, and bound HM-PRK2 in the surface plasmon resonance assay with high affinity (Kd 270 ± 7 nm). In PKA, mutation of the residue Lys-189 equivalent to PDK1 Lys-228 was similarly observed to have no effect on catalytic activity (38Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Next, Tyr-126 and Arg-129 were mutated either individually or together to Ala to disrupt the connection of phosphorylated Ser-241 with the αC-helix. In the absence of HM-PRK2, these PDK1 mutants possessed similar activity as wild type PDK1. However, the PDK1(Y126A) and PDK1(R129A) mutants were activated only 2-fold, at either 1 and 10 μm HM-PRK2, compared with 5-fold activation for wild type PDK1 (Fig. 1B). As similar activation was observed at both concentrations of HM-PRK2, this indicates that the affinity of these mutants for HM-PRK2 is similar to that of wild type PDK1 but the transmission of binding to the catalytic residues is impaired. Consistent with this notion, the double PDK1(Y126A,R129A) mutant was barely activated by HM-PRK2 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the PDK1(Y126A) (Kd 380 ± 3 nm), PDK1(R129A) (Kd 365 ± 5 nm), and PDK1(Y126A,R129A) (Kd 410 ± 8 nm) still interacted with significant affinity with HM-PRK2 (Fig. 1C). In PKA and PKBβ there is only a single interaction of the αC-helix with the phosphorylated T-loop, mediated by a His residue. Mutation of His-87 in the αC-helix of PKA that interacts with the phosphorylated Thr-197 at the T-loop impairs the catalytic activity of PKA (39Cox S. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16203-16209Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in contrast to what is observed for PDK1. To our knowledge the effect of mutating the equivalent residue on PKBβ (His-196) has not been investigated. It has previously been shown, using thermal denaturation studies, that binding of HM-PRK2 to PDK1 also significantly thermostabilized PDK1 (13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the interaction of the αC-helix of PDK1 with the phosphorylated T-loop was required for HM-PRK2 to stabilize PDK1. Wild type PDK1 and mutant PDK1(Y126A), PDK1(R129A), and PDK1(Y126A,R129A) were incubated for 2 min at temperatures ranging from 40 to 60 °C prior to assay at 30 °C. Consistent with our previous work (13Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), wild type PDK1 was inactivated in temperature-dependent manner and was significantly stabilized in the presence of HM-PRK2 (Fig. 2). However, although the PDK1(Y126A), PDK1(R129A), and PDK1(Y126A,R129A) mutants showed similar stability to wild type PDK1 in the absence of HM-PRK2, they were not stabilized following the addition of HM-PRK2. These results indicate that the ability of HM-PRK2 to stabilize PDK1 through binding to the HM-pocket requires the interaction of the αC-helix with the phosphorylated T-loop. Structure of the Inactive PDK1(S241A) Mutant Kinase Domain in Complex with ATP—The finding that the double PDK1(Y126A,R129A) mutant still interacted with HM-PRK2 (Kd 410 ± 8 nm) suggested that formation of the αC-helix of PDK1 was independent of Ser-241 phosphorylation. This notion was confirmed by the finding that the inactive PDK1(S241A) still interacted with HM-PRK2 with high affinity (Kd 67 ± 4 nm) (Fig. 1C). To investigate this further, the PDK1(S241A) mutant (residues 51–359) was crystallized in the presence of ATP without Mg2+ ions, employing similar conditions described for the wild type PDK1 kinase domain complexes. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the previously determined PDK1 kinase domain structure (Protein Data Bank accession number 1h1w) (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the PDK1(S241A) mutant is similar to the wild type PDK1·ATP complex (root mean square deviation 0.19 Å), with most of the larger deviations observed in the T-loop region introduced by the mutation (Fig. 3, A and D). One molecule of ATP is present at the nucleotide-binding site, which shows no structural deviations from the ATP molecule in the wild type PDK1·ATP complex (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (maximum atomic shift 0.4 Å). In contrast to the wild type PDK1 kinase domain structure in which several T-loop residues (residues 233–236) were disordered, electron density for these residues is clearly defined in the PDK1(S241A) structure (Fig. 3C). The region of the T-loop surrounding Ser-241 (residues 230–245, yellow in Fig. 3, C and D) in the PDK1(S241A) structure adopts a markedly different conformation compared with wild type PDK1 (Fig. 3D). The Cβ carbon of Ala-241 is shifted by 10.1 Å compared with the Cβ carbon of Ser-241 in the wild type structure and is buried in a hydrophobic pocket lined by Leu-254, Val-249, Phe-291, and Leu-253 of the C-lobe. Moreover, the movement of Ser-241 in the PDK1(S241A) structure displaces Asn-240, Phe-242, and Val-243 by several Å compared with the wild type structure, resulting in a shift of the whole T-loop by a distance equivalent to 2 residues so that the carbonyl function of Arg-238 in the PDK1(S241A) structure takes the position of the carbonyl of Asn-240 in the wild type structure (located within 1.3 Å, Fig. 3D). Consistent with the biochemical data, we find that the PDK1(S241A) structure displays fully ordered density for the αC-helix as well as the adjacent αB-helix (Fig. 3B, maximum atomic shift 0.4 Å). The PDK1(S241A) also displays a well ordered HM-pocket, indistinguishable from that of wild type PDK1. This shows that T-loop phosphorylation of PDK1 only has a role for enzyme activity and stability but not for formation of the αC-helix and, hence, docking to substrates via the HM-pocket. To date, no dephosphorylated T-loop structure of PKA has been solved, and the only other inactive AGC kinase crystallized apart from PKBβ is the N-terminal catalytic domain of MSK1 (40Smith K.J. Carter P.S. Bridges A. Horrocks P. Lewis C. Pettman G. Clarke A. Brown M. Hughes J. Wilkinson M. Bax B. Reith A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1067-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This structure revealed an autoinhibited conformation in which a novel, three-stranded β-sheet occupies the position of the αC-helix in the N-terminal lobe, rendering the protein inactive (40Smith K.J. Carter P.S. Bridges A. Horrocks P. Lewis C. Pettman G. Clarke A. Brown M. Hughes J. Wilkinson M. Bax B. Reith A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1067-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, the phosphorylated, active structure of the catalytic domain of PKCθ AGC kinase was reported, which possesses similar features to that of PKA, PDK1, and activated PKBβ (41Xu Z.B. Chaudhary D. Olland S. Wolfrom S. Czerwinski R. Malakian K. Lin L. Stahl M.L. Joseph-McCarthy D. Benander C. Fitz L. Greco R. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50401-50409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In PKCθ, similar to PKBβ, the αC-helix creates an HM-pocket, which forms an intramolecular interaction with its own phosphorylated hydrophobic motif (41Xu Z.B. Chaudhary D. Olland S. Wolfrom S. Czerwinski R. Malakian K. Lin L. Stahl M.L. Joseph-McCarthy D. Benander C. Fitz L. Greco R. Somers W.S. Mosyak L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50401-50409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A major difference, however, is that the phosphorylated T-loop in PKCθ does not interact with the αC-helix. The only charged interaction conserved in all PKC isoforms between the PKCθαC-helix and the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain is between Glu-528 (in the C-lobe), which interacts with Arg-430 (in αC-helix). As the phosphorylated T-loop in PKCθ does not interact with the αC-helix, PKCθ may be similar to PDK1 in that formation of the αC-helix is independent of T-loop phosphorylation. Strikingly, in the PDK1(S241A) structure, strong electron density is observed at the site where the phosphate group is located in wild type PDK1 (Fig. 3E). The large, bulky electron density does not resemble any obvious component from the crystallization condition and was therefore not interpreted in the refinement procedure. The electron density is surrounded by residues Tyr-126, Arg-129, and Arg-204. Tyr-126 and Arg-204 adopt the same conformation as in wild type PDK1, whereas Arg-129 adopts a different conformation (Fig. 3D). The fourth residue interacting with the phosphorylated Ser-241 in the wild type structure, namely Lys-228, is disordered in the PDK1(S241A) structure. These observations suggest that a potentially negatively charged ligand occupied the unassigned density, possibly in the shape of a tetrahedral oxy-anion. A range of common oxy-anions (such as phosphate, sulfate, pyrophosphate) was included in the refinement procedure in an attempt to identify the ligand but without convincing results (data not shown). Interestingly, similar observations with negatively charged ligands in a positively charged pocket in a similar location have been made in a number of other crystal structures of protein kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (42Dajani R.

Hurley T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 618-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and phosphorylase kinase (PhK) (36Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D. Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A common feature of these kinases with PDK1 is that they all belong to the RD class of protein kinases. The site of oxy-anion interaction has recently been named the RD-pocket, as the RD Arg (Arg-204 in PDK1) is a main contributor to the positively charged nature of the pocket (32Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase kinase is not activated by phosphorylation in the T-loop but instead contains a negatively charged Glu residue that serves to align the catalytic machinery (36Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D. Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 46Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the structure of a T-loop mutant of phosphorylase kinase in which the T-loop Glu residue was mutated to a Ser, a phosphate molecule occupies the site of the former negative charge contributed by the Glu residue, and no overall conformational changes are observed (36Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D. Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This situation is similar to that observed in PDK1. From the current knowledge of how PDK1 is regulated it is not clear whether the ability of this site in unphosphorylated PDK1 to bind oxy-anions is physiologically important. We have investigated how PDK1 T-loop phosphorylation affects activation and peptide binding in the HM-pocket. The biochemical and structural data show that T-loop phosphorylation of PDK1 is not required for the structural integrity of the αC-helix and the HM-pocket. Furthermore, the basal activity of PDK1 in the absence of the HM-PRK2 is not influenced by the interaction of the αC-helix with the phosphorylated T-loop residue. However, activation of PDK1 by HM-PRK2 is abolished in the PDK1(Y126A,R129A) mutant, which lacks contacts between the phosphorylated T-loop and the HM-pocket through the central αC-helix. Moreover, this mutant can no longer be stabilized to thermal denaturation in the presence of HM-PRK2. Thus it appears that these interactions enable the binding of PDK1 to the HM-motif of its substrates to be communicated to the catalytic residues. Interestingly, the three inactive structures of AGC kinases crystallized to date, namely PKBβ (21Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), MSK1 (40Smith K.J. Carter P.S. Bridges A. Horrocks P. Lewis C. Pettman G. Clarke A. Brown M. Hughes J.

In contrast, the active forms of the four AGC kinases crystallized to date, namely PDK1 (15Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F.F.

As there is much interest in development of specific AGC kinase inhibitors for the treatment of disease, the greater diversity shown between inactive kinase structures indicates that more selective protein kinase inhibitors would be obtained if the inactive forms of kinases were targeted."
https://openalex.org/W1980854046,"The metalloglutathione transferase FosA catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to carbon-1 of the antibiotic fosfomycin, rendering it ineffective as an antibacterial drug. Codon randomization and selection for the ability of resulting clones to confer fosfomycin resistance to Escherichia coli were used to identify residues critical for FosA function. Of the 24 codons chosen for randomization, 16 were found to be essential because only the wild type amino acid was selected. These included ligands to the Mn2+ and the K+, residues that furnish hydrogen bonds to fosfomycin, and residues located in a putative glutathione/fosfomycin-binding site. The remaining eight positions randomized were tolerant to substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis of some of the essential and tolerant amino acids to alanine was performed, and the activity of the purified proteins was determined. Mutation of the residues that are within hydrogen bonding distance to the oxirane or phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin resulted in variants with very low or no activity. Mutation of Ser94, which bridges one of the phosphonate oxygens with a potassium ion, resulted in insoluble protein. The Y39A mutation in the putative glutathione-binding site resulted in a 4-fold increase in the apparent Km for glutathione. Only two of the amino acids in the substrate-binding site are conserved in the related fosfomycin resistance proteins FosB and FosX, whereas no amino acids in the putative glutathione-binding site are conserved. The metalloglutathione transferase FosA catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to carbon-1 of the antibiotic fosfomycin, rendering it ineffective as an antibacterial drug. Codon randomization and selection for the ability of resulting clones to confer fosfomycin resistance to Escherichia coli were used to identify residues critical for FosA function. Of the 24 codons chosen for randomization, 16 were found to be essential because only the wild type amino acid was selected. These included ligands to the Mn2+ and the K+, residues that furnish hydrogen bonds to fosfomycin, and residues located in a putative glutathione/fosfomycin-binding site. The remaining eight positions randomized were tolerant to substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis of some of the essential and tolerant amino acids to alanine was performed, and the activity of the purified proteins was determined. Mutation of the residues that are within hydrogen bonding distance to the oxirane or phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin resulted in variants with very low or no activity.

The broad-spectrum antibiotic (1R,2S)-epoxypropylphosphonic acid (fosfomycin) is often used in the treatment of urinary tract infections (1Nicolle L.E. Am. J.

Four different fosfomycin-modifying enzymes have been described including FosA, FosB, FosC, and FosX. These enzymes catalyze the formation of a glutathione-fosfomycin (FosA), l-cysteine-fosfomycin (FosB), ATP-fosfomycin (FosC), or water-fosfomycin (FosX) adduct (6Garcia P. Arca P. Suarez J.E.

The best-characterized fosfomycin-modifying enzyme is FosA, which has been shown to be a manganese-containing metalloglutathione transferase that conjugates GSH to carbon-1 of fosfomycin (Scheme 1) (14Bernat B.A. Laughlin L.T.

FosA is an unusual GSH transferase (GST) 1The abbreviation used is: GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviation used is: GST, glutathione S-transferase. because of its high specificity for fosfomycin and the presence of a metal cofactor (5Arca P. Hardisson C. Suarez J.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Bernat B.A. Laughlin L.T. Armstrong R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no significant sequence similarity between FosA and the cytosolic (members of the alpha, pi, mu, sigma, theta, zeta, or kappa classes) GSTs. However, the three-dimensional structure of FosA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits similarity to members of the vicinal oxygen chelate family such as glyoxalase I and the extradiol dioxygenases (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which are characterized by the ability to bind a metal cofactor with available sites for substrate coordination (20Armstrong R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13625-13632Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol.

Interact. 1998; 111–112: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of substrate-bound FosA showed that, like other members of the vicinal oxygen chelate family, fosfomycin binds at the active site Mn2+ with distances of 2.0 Å between Mn2+ and one of the phosphonate oxygens and 2.4 Å between Mn2+ and the oxirane oxygen of fosfomycin (Scheme 1) (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also revealed a number of amino acids (Thr9, Lys90, Ser94, Tyr100, and Arg119) that interact with the bound fosfomycin at the active site (Fig. 1). Thr9 has been proposed to be involved in opening of the epoxide via protonation of the oxirane oxygen (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lys90, Ser94, Tyr100, and Arg119 are all within hydrogen bonding distance to the phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin. In addition, Ser94 bridges the substrate to a potassium ion that is required for maximal activity (Fig. 1) (17Bernat B.A. Laughlin L.T. Armstrong R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7462-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The key step in the catalytic mechanism of GSTs is the activation of GSH and stabilization of GS– for nucleophilic attack. The “classical” GSTs utilize the hydroxyl group of a serine, threonine (theta class), tyrosine (alpha, mu, pi, and sigma classes), the side chain of an arginine (alpha class), or the thiol group of a cysteine (beta class) to interact with and thereby stabilize the thiolate anion (23Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 24Armstrong R.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The interactions between FosA and GSH have yet to be determined; however, carbon-1 of fosfomycin, to which GSH is added, is situated at the end of a short channel near the surface of the protein (Fig. 2) (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that the binding and activation of GSH occur in this channel. Furthermore, the residues highlighted in this channel (with the exception of Trp46) contain a hydroxyl or thiol side chain that could be involved in activating and/or stabilizing GSH/GS–. The low toxicity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity of fosfomycin have resulted in its increased clinical use, which in turn has resulted in fosfomycin-resistant strains (7Suarez J.E. Mendoza M.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Shimizu M. Shigenobu F. Miyakozawa I. Nakamura A. Nakazawa K. Suzuki M. Mizukoshi S. O'Hara K. Sawai T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2007-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Currently, there are no inhibitors to combat FosA-mediated fosfomycin resistance. To develop effective FosA inhibitors, it will be essential to understand the catalytic mechanism and, consequently, the amino acid determinants of structure and activity. In this report, we have utilized codon randomization and selection for the ability of the resulting clones to confer fosfomycin resistance to Escherichia coli to identify amino acids in the active site of FosA that are critical for function. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis was performed and the activity of the purified proteins was determined. Amino acids were chosen for mutagenesis based on their interactions at the substrate-binding site or in the proposed GSH-binding channel. Site-directed mutagenesis of most of the substrate-binding residues resulted in completely inactive proteins, consistent with the randomization and selection results. None of the proposed GSH-binding variants significantly affected the apparent Km for fosfomycin; however, GSH binding was affected as determined by an increase in apparent Km. Reagents and General Procedures—Fosfomycin, reduced glutathione, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were of the highest commercially available grade. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Molecular biology procedures not described in detail below followed those in Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was performed using an ABI3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Protein purity was judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar). Cloning of fosA—The fosA gene (408 bp) was PCR-amplified with Taq polymerase (Sigma) and the primers FosNde 5′-ACGATACATATGCTTACCGGTCTCAAT-3′ and FosXho 5′-ACGATACTCGAGCTAGTCGGCGAAACG-3′ (with added NdeI and XhoI restriction sites underlined) or FosSac 5′-ACGATAGAGCTCATGCTTACCGGTCTCAAT-3′ and FosXba 5′-ACGATATCTAGACTAGTCGGCGAAACG-3′ (with added SacI and XbaI sites underlined) from P. aeruginosa genomic DNA and ligated into the multiple cloning site of pET-24a(+) (NdeI, XhoI) (Novagen) to yield plasmid pFOS2 or pTP123 (SacI, XbaI) (27Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to yield plasmid pFOS1. The nucleotide sequence of pFOS1 and pFOS2 was confirmed to be the same as GenBank™ accession number NC002516. Codon Randomization—Codon randomization was performed using overlap extension PCR (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). pFOS1 was used as the template with the external primers FosSac and FosXba and internal complementary primers containing NNN at the codon position to be randomized for amplification of fosA gene fragments using Taq polymerase (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were purified, and overlapping fragments were combined and the full-length randomized fosA gene was amplified using the FosSac and FosXba primers and ligated into pTP123. The ligation products were transformed into TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen), and the colonies were pooled and stored at –80 °C as glycerol stocks. Selection of Functional Clones—Functional FosA clones were selected on LB-chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml) agar plates containing 240 or 50 μg/ml fosfomycin. The higher concentration of fosfomycin was chosen because it is the maximum concentration where E. coli harboring the pFOS1 plasmid is able to grow, whereas the lower concentration was selected in order to identify variants with partial activity. A randomized library was grown from the corresponding glycerol stock overnight at 37 °C in LB-chloramphenicol media. The culture was diluted 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold and plated on LB-chloramphenicol-fosfomycin plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The fosA gene was PCR-amplified from an average of ten colonies, and the entire gene was sequenced. Construction of FosA Variants—Individual site-directed mutagenesis of residues 9, 39, 46, 48, 90, 94, 100, and 119 to alanine was carried out using the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pFOS2 was used as the template with the primers listed in Table I. Replacement with alanine in the resulting plasmids was verified by nucleotide sequencing of the entire fosA gene.Table IPrimers used to construct FosA variantsMutationPrimer (5′-3′ with mutational codon underlined)T9ACTCAATCACCTGGCTCTGGCGGTCGCCY39AGACCAGGGCGCCGCTCTCGAACTGGGTW46ACTGGGTTCGCTGGCTCTGTGCCTGTCCCGGC48ATCGCTGTGGCTGGCTCTGTCCCGGGAGK90AGGCGTGCGCGAATGGGCTCAGAACCGCAGCS94AAAGCAGAACCGCGCTGAGGGCGATTCGY100AGGCGATTCGTTCGCTTTCCTCGACCCGR119AGACCTGCGCAGCGCTCTCGCGGCGTGC Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Variant FosA Enzymes—The following procedures were used to purify wild type and all of the FosA variants. A single colony of E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) harboring pFOS2 (or variant FosA expression plasmid, Table I) was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB-kanamycin and grown aerobically overnight at 37 °C with shaking. This entire culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB-kanamycin, and growth with shaking continued until A600 ∼0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl α-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm), and after ∼4 h of incubation at 37 °C with shaking (A600 ∼2), cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells were lysed using the reagent BugBuster (Novagen) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (buffer A), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), resulting in a pink-brown supernatant. The supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A and eluted using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing FosA (determined by SDS-PAGE or enzymatic activity assayed as described below) were concentrated to ∼1 ml (Centriprep YM10 membrane, Amicon) and applied to a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A containing 250 mm NaCl (buffer B). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing FosA (determined by SDS-PAGE or enzymatic activity assayed as described below) were pooled and concentrated to ∼0.5 ml and stored at –80 °C in aliquots. Approximately 10–15 mg of purified FosA (quantitated by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215507) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard) or variant FosA was obtained per liter of E. coli culture. FosA Activity Assay—Fosfomycin-dependent glutathione conjugation was detected spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent. Unless otherwise stated, assays were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, containing 100 mm KCl (buffer C), 0.05 mm MnCl2, 10 mm fosfomycin, 15 mm GSH, and 0.8 μm monomer FosA in a final assay volume of 100 μl at 25 °C. A control reaction under identical conditions but without FosA was also performed. The reactions were allowed to incubate for 5 min followed by the addition of methanol (300 μl) to quench enzyme activity. The concentration of GSH was detected colorimetrically at 405 nm using an EL800 Universal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). Assays were carried out in buffer C with Ellman's reagent (0.6 mm) and 5 μl of the methanol-quenched reaction. A standard curve was prepared using GSH. The amount of GSH conjugated was determined by subtracting the “+ FosA” value from the “control reaction” (no FosA) value. The specific activity values are reported as micromolar GSH conjugated/min/micromolar FosA monomer. Codon Randomization and Selection—Random mutagenesis by overlap extension PCR was used to generate libraries containing all of the possible amino acid substitutions at 24 positions in the fosA gene to identify active site residues essential for FosA function. The 24 codons were selected for randomization based on their proximity to the Mn2+, fosfomycin, or a putative GSH-binding site in the active site of FosA. Functional FosA variants conferring fosfomycin resistance to E. coli were selected from randomized libraries that were grown in the presence of 240 μg/ml fosfomycin (the maximum concentration of fosfomycin that E. coli harboring the pFOS1 FosA expression plasmid can survive). In addition, libraries for which only the wild type amino acid was found were also subjected to a less stringent selection on 50 μg/ml fosfomycin to identify variants with partial activity. An average of 10 clones was selected for sequencing to determine the amino acid substitutions that are allowed at each of the 24 positions chosen for randomization. The sequencing results for clones selected on 240 μg/ml fosfomycin are shown in Fig. 3 (top). Positions that do not tolerate substitutions are considered to be critical for FosA structure and function. Accordingly, 16 of the 24 positions randomized were found to be essential for the structure and function of FosA (Fig. 3, boldface), which includes the residues that furnish ligands to the Mn2+ (His7, His64, Glu110) and the K+ (Ser94, Ser98, Glu95), Arg119 and Tyr100 that are within hydrogen-bonding distance to fosfomycin, and eight residues located in a putative fosfomycin/GSH-binding channel. In all of the functional Glu95 clones selected on fosfomycin, a K90R mutation was found. The sequencing of ten clones from the nonselected Glu95 library showed a variety of substitutions (Trp2, Phe, Leu3, Ala, Asp, Pro, Glu) at position 95, but none contained an additional mutation at position 90 indicating that the substitution was not due to a systematic mutation in the library. The minimum inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin for the Glu95 K90R mutant was similar to that of wild type, indicating that the K90R mutation was not selected due to increased resistance levels. The remaining eight positions randomized, Thr9, Tyr62, His112, Lys90, Asp105, Ser50, Arg93, and Asp97, were shown to be tolerant to substitutions, because amino acids other than wild type were found when clones selected on fosfomycin were sequenced (Fig. 1). Thr9 and Lys90, both of which are within hydrogen bonding distance to fosfomycin, clearly showed a preference for wild type or wild type-like amino acids, whereas Asp97 and Asp105 located within the fosfomycin/GSH-binding channel demonstrated a preference for substitutions other than the wild type codon. Ser50, Arg93, and His112, which are all located in the putative fosfomycin/GSH-binding channel, and Tyr62, which is a second coordination sphere ligand to the Mn2+, could be substituted by a variety of different amino acids. The libraries of the 16 positions that did not tolerate substitutions at 240 μg/ml fosfomycin were selected at a lower concentration (50 μg/ml) to identify variants with partial activity (Fig. 3, bottom). The only positions that allowed substitutions were Cys48 and Tyr128 located in the putative fosfomycin/GSH-binding channel and the Mn2+ ligand Glu110. In each case, however, the wild type amino acid is preferred. The Thr9 random library, which showed a clear preference for the wild type amino acid under the more stringent selection, was also selected at the lower fosfomycin concentration. Because T9G and T9S were selected at the higher fosfomycin concentration, it might be expected that even more variants with partial activity would be found at a lower fosfomycin concentration; however, only the wild type amino acid was selected. This may be due to the fosfomycin concentration being below the Km of Thr9 variants with partial activity. Therefore, partially active variants are catalytically inefficient compared with wild type FosA and cannot compete in the selection process. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Activities of FosA Variants— Based on the codon randomization results, the following residues were mutated to alanine and the resulting proteins were purified and characterized kinetically: Tyr39; Trp46; Cys48; Ser94; Tyr100; and Arg119. In addition, T9A and K90A were also constructed and purified because the randomization results suggested that the wild type codon is preferred at these positions. Tyr39, Trp46, and Cys48 were chosen for mutagenesis based on their location in a proposed GSH-binding site and the importance of these amino acids in the binding and activation of GSH in other GSTs (Fig. 2). Thr9, Tyr100, Arg119, and Lys90 were selected for mutagenesis because all are within hydrogen-bonding distance to fosfomycin and Ser94 was selected because it is a ligand to the K+. The turnover number of wild type and variant FosA enzymes under standard assay conditions are listed in Table II. No activity could be detected in assays with K90A, Y100A, or R119A FosA variants. S94A FosA assays with purified enzyme could not be performed because, under the expression and purification conditions employed, this variant was found to be insoluble. The W46A and C48A FosA enzymes exhibited similar specific activities, which were 62 and 74% that of wild type FosA, respectively, whereas the least active variants were the Y39A and T9A enzymes with specific activities of 37 and 3% wild type, respectively. The activities of Y39A, W46A, and C48A variants located in the putative fosfomycin/GSH-binding channel do not correlate with the in vivo selection results that showed these positions to be critical for FosA structure function. This discrepancy may be attributed to the sensitivity of the in vivo selection, which is dependent on the intracellular concentration of substrates and stability of the protein in vivo among other conditions. However, the kinetics of Y39A, W46A, and C48A do lend support for a role of these residues in the binding and/or activation of GSH as described below. Previous mutagenesis studies of the FosA Mn2+ ligands demonstrated that each of the three ligands (His7, His64, Glu110) could independently be substituted with Gln and still retain significant activity (17Bernat B.A. Laughlin L.T. Armstrong R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7462-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in this study, substitutions were only allowed at Glu110 and only observed at the lower fosfomycin concentration.Table IIKinetic values of wild type and variant FosA enzymesTurnover numberaValues are per active site.

Open table in a new tab Table II lists the apparent Km, kcat, and catalytic efficiency values for wild type and the FosA variants for fosfomycin and GSH. The apparent Km values of wild type FosA for fosfomycin and GSH are essentially the same as that previously reported (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For those variants within hydrogen-bonding distance to fosfomycin, kinetic data could only be obtained with T9A FosA because no activity could be detected with the other variants under the standard assay conditions employed and S94A FosA was insoluble. The T9A mutation showed the greatest effect on the binding of fosfomycin. The apparent Km of this variant for fosfomycin increased 10-fold over wild type along with a 6-fold decrease in kcat, resulting in an overall catalytic efficiency with respect to fosfomycin nearly two orders of magnitude lower than wild type. The dependence of the kinetics on the concentration of GSH was most affected by the mutation of Tyr39 to alanine. The apparent Km for GSH increased by ∼4-fold, and the kcat decreased by ∼7-fold, resulting in an overall decrease in catalytic efficiency by approximately an order of magnitude compared with wild type. Fosfomycin has many advantageous pharmacological properties, and its activity alone or in combination with other antibiotics against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, quinolone-resistant E. coli, biofilms, and other antibiotic-resistant strains suggests that its usage will increase (2Grif K.

Resistance to fosfomycin by FosA-, FosB-, FosC-, or FosX-catalyzed alteration of the antibiotic, however, threatens its therapeutic value and demonstrates the need for effective FosA inhibitors. Currently, there are no known inhibitors of any of the fosfomycin resistance enzymes. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the structure-activity relationship of these antibiotic resistance enzymes is a necessary component in the discovery of effective therapeutics. In this report, a combination of codon randomization and functional selection and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify residues important for FosA function. All of the residues selected in the substrate-binding site were shown to be essential because the variants showed very little or no activity. As seen in the crystal structure of the FosA-fosfomycin complex (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), their function appears to be to properly position the substrate to promote catalysis. However, the complete lack of activity observed with the alanine-substituted variants (with the exception of T9A FosA) may suggest an additional role for these residues perhaps in proper folding and/or stability of the protein dimer. A sequence alignment of FosA with the cysteine-dependent FosB and the FosX hydrolase (Fig. 4) shows conservation of the metal ligands (His7, His64, Glu110) along with Tyr100 and Arg119 that are within hydrogen-bonding distance to two of the phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin in FosA. It has been reported that this arginine in FosX (Arg127) is also involved in substrate binding (32Fillgrove K.L. Pakhomova S. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15730-15731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and it most probably plays a similar role in FosB. Lys90 and Ser94, neither of which is conserved in FosB or FosX, were also demonstrated to be important (although Lys90 tolerates conservative substitutions) for FosA catalysis. These residues are also within hydrogen-bonding distance to the phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin. These interactions may also be found in FosB and FosX but involving different amino acids. Additionally, Ser94 is apparently required for maintaining the structural integrity of FosA because mutation to alanine resulted in insoluble protein. Ser94 bridges one of the phosphonate oxygens of fosfomycin with a potassium ion that is required for maximal activity of FosA (Fig. 1) (17Bernat B.A. Laughlin L.T. Armstrong R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7462-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither the cysteine conjugation reaction nor the hydration reactions catalyzed by FosB or FosX are enhanced by monovalent cations; however, both enzymes are capable of the addition of GSH to fosfomycin but at significantly lower rates than FosA (15Cao M. Bernat B.A. Wang Z. Armstrong R.N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2380-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Fillgrove K.L. Pakhomova S. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15730-15731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only two of the five amino acids that coordinate the potassium ion in FosA (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are conserved in FosB and FosX. One of these residues, Ser98, in FosA is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the Mn2+ ligand Glu110 and therefore may be required for activity. This may suggest that, in the evolution of the fosfomycin resistance enzymes, the structural requirements for a potassium ion-binding site were acquired specifically for optimal GSH-conjugating activity. Thr9, which is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the oxirane oxygen in both FosA and FosX, has been suggested to play a role in catalysis by acting as a proton donor in facilitating the opening of the epoxide (19Rife C.L. Pharris R.E. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11001-11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Fillgrove K.L. Pakhomova S. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15730-15731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr9 to alanine caused a significant decrease in activity and the affinity of the enzyme for fosfomycin, consistent with Thr9 playing a critical role in catalysis. The analogous residue in the mammalian GSTs that show conjugating activity with epoxide substrates is a tyrosine (24Armstrong R.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). This tyrosine is essential for activity, and the crystal structures of the substrate- and product-bound forms show that the side-chain hydroxyl is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the oxirane oxygen in the epoxide substrate and in the resulting ring-opened product (33Johnson W.W. Liu S. Ji X. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11508-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, although FosA and the mammalian GSTs show essentially no sequence similarity, both enzymes apparently utilize similar active site substrate interactions to facilitate catalysis. Thr9 is conserved in FosX, and an overlay of the FosX and FosA structures shows that this residue is in a similar position in both active sites (32Fillgrove K.L. Pakhomova S. Newcomer M.E. Armstrong R.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15730-15731Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, Thr9 is not conserved in FosB where it is replaced with leucine. There are other mechanistic differences between FosA and FosB such as a preference for Mg2+ over Mn2+ and cysteine as opposed to GSH as the thiol donor (15Cao M. Bernat B.A. Wang Z. Armstrong R.N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2380-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of FosA with GSH is an order of magnitude greater than FosB with cysteine (15Cao M. Bernat B.A. Wang Z. Armstrong R.N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2380-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which may be the result of this leucine substitution at the Thr9 position presumably in close proximity to the oxirane oxygen. There is no crystal structure of a GSH·FosA complex currently available. Therefore, a putative GSH-binding site has been proposed based on the position of fosfomycin in the active site. Tyr39, Trp46, and Cys48 are located in this region and were mutated to alanine in order to determine whether they affect GSH-binding and/or catalysis. Tyr39 and Cys48 were selected because of the importance of similar residues in mammalian and bacterial GSTs in GSH binding and activation (24Armstrong R.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 34Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Allocati N. Di Ilio C. De Maria F. Innocenti F. Parker M.W. Masulli M. Lo Bello M. Turella P. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18777-18784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Y39A variant exhibited a slight decrease in affinity for GSH and showed a significant decrease (∼14-fold) in catalytic efficiency. The other variants exhibited only modest changes in their kinetics. Studies of a mammalian GST showed that mutation of the tyrosine that stabilizes GS– through hydrogen bonding did not affect GSH binding but did decrease the catalytic efficiency by at least 100-fold (35Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FosA shares essentially no structural homology with the mammalian GSTs, and so it is difficult to draw any conclusions by analogy. However, the results are consistent with Tyr39 being involved in GSH binding (35Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The random libraries used in this study to identify residues critical for the inactivation of fosfomycin may also prove useful for inhibitor development. As putative FosA inhibitors become available, the random libraries could be used for structure-function studies on inhibitor-binding sites as well as to rapidly assess the potential for the evolution of inhibitor resistance due to amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the enzyme active site."

The present study describes an additional carbohydrate epitope recognized by H. pylori. The activity was first detected as a binding to a seven-sugar ganglioside in a mixture of rabbit thymus gangliosides separated on TLC plates. However, the interaction was independent of sialic acid because activity remained after treatment with mild acid. Therefore the ganglioside was purified and structurally characterized in detail followed by partial degradation studies that showed a pentaglycosylceramide, GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, 1The abbreviations used are: Cer, ceramide; C, chloroform; M, methanol; MS, mass spectrometry; FAB, fast atom bombardment; GC, gas chromatography; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, N-glycolylneuraminic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: Cer, ceramide; C, chloroform; M, methanol; MS, mass spectrometry; FAB, fast atom bombardment; GC, gas chromatography; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, N-glycolylneuraminic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography., 2The carbohydrate and glycolipid nomenclature is according to recommendations of IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (Chester, M.

On screening for binding using a reference library of glycolipids three other pentaglycosylceramides differing in terminal monosaccharide substitution were also found to be bound by H. pylori. Isolation and Purification of Glycolipids from Rabbit Thymus—Total mixtures of neutral and acid glycosphingolipids were isolated from acetone powder of 1 kg of rabbit thymus (Pel-Freez, North Arkansas, AR). The powder was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with C/M (2:1) 3All solvent mixtures were by volume, unless otherwise stated. for 24 h followed by C/M/H2O (8:1:1) for 36 h. Dry residue of the combined extracts (240 g) was subjected to Folch separation (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the material in the upper hydrophilic phase was fractionated by ion-exchange gel chromatography on DE23 cellulose (DEAE, Whatman). These isolation steps gave 2.5 g of the crude fraction containing acid glycosphingolipids. The gangliosides were then separated according to number of sialic acids using open tubular chromatography on a glass column filled with DEAE-Sepharose (CL6, Amersham Biosciences). The column was connected to an HPLC pump producing a concave gradient (preprogrammed gradient number 4, System Gold chromatographic software, Beckman) starting with methanol and ending with 0.5 m CH3COONH4 in methanol. About 350 mg of the ganglioside fraction were applied for each separation using 500 g of Sepharose (50-mm-inner diameter column; bed height, 130 mmm) and a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The monosialylated gangliosides (218 mg) were further separated by HPLC on a silica column (SH-044.10, Yamamura Chemical Laboratories Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) using a linear eluting gradient of C/M/H2O (60:35:8 to 10:10:3) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The final yield of the seven-sugar ganglioside fraction was 23 mg/1000 g of the acetone powder. Other glycosphingolipids used in these studies were prepared according to Karlsson (20Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) unless otherwise specified. Chemical Desialylation of Gangliosides—Chemical desialylation was performed in 1.5% CH3COOH in water at 100 °C after which the material was neutralized with NaOH and evaporated under nitrogen after addition of excess of methanol. De-N-acylation—Conversion of the acetamido moiety of GlcNAc residues into primary amine was accomplished by treating various glycosphingolipids with anhydrous hydrazine as described previously (10Ångström J. Teneberg S. Abul Milh M. Larsson T. Leonardsson I. Olsson B.-M. Ölwegård-Halvarsson M. Danielsson D. Näslund I. Ljungh A. Wadström T. Karlsson K.-A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Partial Acid Degradation of Core Chain—For partial degradation of the core carbohydrate chain, the seven-sugar ganglioside was hydrolyzed in 0.5 m HCl for 7 min in a boiling water bath. The material was then neutralized with NaOH and partitioned in C/M/H2O (8:4:3) (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower phase was collected and evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was used for analysis. Endoglycoceramidase Digestion of Glycolipids—The reaction mixture contained 200 μg of a glycolipid, 80 μg of sodium taurodeoxycholate, and 0.8 milliunit of the enzyme (endoglycoceramidase from Rhodococcus species, Genzyme Corp.) in 160 μl of 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (21Ito M. Yamagata T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C after which water (140 μl) and C/M (2:1, 1.5 ml) were added. Subsequently the sample was shaken and centrifuged. The upper phase was dried under nitrogen, redissolved in a small volume of water, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.4 × 10 cm), which had been equilibrated in H2O, and eluted with the same solvent. Fractions of about 0.1 ml were collected and tested for the presence of sugars (using TLC plates and anisaldehyde). Preparation of Pentaglycosylceramide Using β-Galactosidase from Escherichia coli—The six-sugar glycolipid fraction (2 mg), obtained from the seven-sugar ganglioside of rabbit thymus, was dissolved in 1.5 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing sodium taurodeoxycholate (1.5 mg/ml), MgCl2 (1 mm), and E. coli β-galactosidase (Roche Applied Science; 500 units when assayed with 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as substrate) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The material was next partitioned in C/M/H2O (10:5:3), and the glycolipid in the lower phase was purified using silica gel chromatography (0.4 × 5-cm column). The column was packed in C/M (2:1) and eluted with C/M/H2O (60:35:8). Fractions of about 0.2 ml were collected and tested for the presence of carbohydrates. The sugar-containing eluate was evaporated under nitrogen. To remove all contaminating detergent the chromatography was repeated twice. The final recovery of the pentaglycosylceramide fraction was 0.7 mg. Analytical Enzymatic Tests—Oxford GlycoSystems (Oxford, UK) enzymatic tests were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations except that Triton X-100 was added to each incubation mixture to a final concentration of 0.3%. When a mixture of sialidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens) and β4-galactosidase (Streptococcus pneumoniae) was added for digestion, buffer from the β-galactosidase kit was used. If β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (S. pneumoniae) was present in the digestion mixture the buffer from the β-hexosaminidase enzyme kit was used. The enzyme concentrations in the incubation mixtures were 80 milliunits/ml for β-galactosidase, 120 milliunits/ml for β-hexosaminidase, and 1 unit/ml for sialidase. The substrate concentration was about 20 μm. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed overnight at 37 °C. After digestion the samples were dried and desalted using small columns containing 0.3 g of Sephadex G-25 (22Wells M.E. Dittmer J.C. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) equilibrated in C/M/H2O (60:30:4.5). Each sample was applied on the column in 2 ml of the same solvent and eluted with C/M/H2O (60:30:4.5) and 2.5 ml of C/M (2:1). Application and washing solutions were collected and evaporated under nitrogen. Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry (FAB-MS)—FAB-MS analyses were performed on a Jeol SX-102 mass spectrometer (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Negative FAB spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode at 10-kV accelerating voltage using xenon atom bombardment (6 keV) and triethanolamine as matrix. Methylation of Saccharides—Methylation was performed according to Larson et al. (23Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) except that sodium hydroxide was added to samples before methyl iodide as suggested by Needs and Selvendran (24Needs P.W. Selvendran R.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 245: 1-10Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In some experiments the saccharides were reduced with NaBH4 before methylation. In the latter case the amount of methyl iodide was increased to a final Me2SO/methyl iodide proportion of 1:1 (25Hansson G.C. Karlsson H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Analysis of Methylated Oligosaccharides—Gas chromatography of methylated oligosaccharides was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5890A Series II gas chromatograph equipped with an on-column injector and a flame ionization detector. The oligosaccharides were analyzed on a fused silica capillary column (11 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter) coated with cross-linked PS264 (Fluka; film thickness, 0.03 μm). Samples were dissolved in ethyl acetate and injected on-column at 80 °C. The temperature was programmed from 80 to 390 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min with a 2-min hold at the upper temperature. Gas chromatography (GC)/electron ionization MS of the methylated oligosaccharides was as described in detail previously (25Hansson G.C. Karlsson H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890A Series II gas chromatograph interfaced to a Jeol SX-102 mass spectrometer. Proton NMR Spectroscopy—All samples for 1H NMR spectroscopy were first deuterium-exchanged and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO/D2O (98:2). The spectrum of the seven-sugar ganglioside of rabbit thymus was recorded at 400 MHz on a modified Varian XL400 spectrometer, whereas spectra of the five- and six-sugar glycolipids of rabbit thymus origin were recorded at 500 MHz on a Jeol Alpha 500 spectrometer. All spectra were obtained at 30 °C and were referenced via the internal solvent signal. Molecular Modeling—Minimum energy conformers of glycosphingolipids were calculated within the Quanta2000/CHARMm25 molecular modeling package (Accelrys Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 extreme work station as described previously for toxin A from Clostridium difficile (26Teneberg S. Lönnroth I. Torres Lopez J.F. Galili U. Ölwegård Halvarsson M. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TLC Bacterial Overlay Assay—Thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass- or aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) essentially as described by Karlsson and Strömberg (27Karlsson K.-A. Strömberg N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TLC plates with separated glycolipids were treated for 1 min with 0.3% (weight by volume) polyisobutylmethacrylate Plexigum (Röhm GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) in diethyl ether/hexane (3:1) and blocked for 2 h by incubation in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (weight by volume) Tween 20. The plates were then overlaid with a suspension of radiolabeled bacteria (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to 1 × 108 colony-forming units/ml and 1–5 × 106 cpm/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Finally the plates were washed three to four times in phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 12–72 h. Bacterial Strains—The H. pylori strains used for dissection of epitopes were two clinical isolates, S-002 and S-032 from Örebro Medical Centre, Örebro, Sweden, obtained from patients with gastritis and duodenal ulcer, respectively. Additional H. pylori strains were used in a survey of the binding frequency to neolacto structures. These included clinical isolates obtained from the Department of Medical Microbiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden (isolates 4, 15, 17, 48, 51, 54, 56, 57, 62, 65, 69, 73, 77, 78, 80, 81, 88, 95, 133, 176, 185, 188, 191, 198, 214, 215, 225, 239, 244, 247, 263, 265, 266, 271, 272, 275, 287, 306, 1139, BH000324, BH000325, BH888331, BH000332, and BH000334), isolates obtained from Örebro Medical Centre (isolates S-005, F6, Ö10, and C7050), and isolates from Dr. Gosciniak, Department of Microbiology, Wroclaw, Poland (isolates 1, 177, 480, 604, 608, and 609). In addition a number of H. pylori strains from the Culture Collection, University of Göteborg were used including 30990, 30991, 30988, 17874, and 17875. Bacterial Cultivation and Labeling—The strains were stored at -80 °C in tryptic soy broth containing 15% glycerol (by volume). The bacteria were initially cultured on gonococcal agar base-Campylobacter medium (28Hirmo S. Utt M. Ringner M. Wadström T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 10: 301-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) agar under humid (98%) microaerophilic conditions (5–7% O2, 8–10% CO2, and 83–87% N2) for 48–72 h at 37 °C. For growth in liquid medium the cells were transferred to Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (SERA-Lab) using an inoculum of 1 × 105 colony-forming units/ml. [35S]Methionine was then added to the inoculated medium (50 μCi/10 ml), and the bacteria were allowed to grow for 24 h under mild shaking. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation (3500 × g for 5 min), washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3), resuspended in the same buffer (1 × 108 cells/ml), and used for overlay assay. The bacterial motility and purity were checked by phase-contrast microscopy. For cultivation of H. pylori on agar medium, a semisolid Brucella agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and enriched with 0.5% IsoVitaleX was used. The agar medium was inoculated by streaking with bacterial material from the agar plate, and the new plate was sprinkled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/plate). The incubation conditions and preparation of bacterial cells were done as described above. Most of the experiments of the present work were performed on H. pylori cells grown in liquid cultures. This growth environment eliminates binding to simple sialylated glycolipids (29Miller-Podraza H. Bergström J. Abul Milh M. Karlsson K.-A. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thus providing better conditions for investigation of the neolacto epitope. Other Analytical Methods—Hexose content in glycolipids was determined according to Dubois et al. (30Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39378) Google Scholar). Screening for H. pylori Carbohydrate Binding—To expose H. pylori to a larger number of potentially binding-active carbohydrate structures, mixtures of glycolipids isolated from various species and tissues were utilized in a chromatogram binding assay. The binding pattern shown in Fig. 1 was thereby frequently obtained. Thus, although most compounds were not recognized by the bacteria, a selective binding to some glycosphingolipids was detected. The binding in lanes 1 and 3 corresponds to the previously reported recognition of gangliotetraosylceramide (7Lingwood C.A. Huesca M. Kukis A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lactotetraosylceramide (11Teneberg S. Leonardsson I. Karlsson H. Jovall P.-Å. Ångström J. Danielsson D. Näslund I. Ljungh Å. Wadström T. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19709-19719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, H. pylori bound to a slow migrating compound (arrow) in the acid glycosphingolipid fraction of rabbit thymus (lane 5). This fraction was subsequently isolated and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and examined using various analytical approaches. Characterization of the H. pylori-binding Fraction of Rabbit Thymus—The negative ion FAB mass spectrum of the most strongly binding fraction from rabbit thymus fraction is shown in Fig. 2. The pseudomolecular ion [M - H]- at m/z 1898.1 and a series of fragment ions at m/z 1590.9, 1428.8, 1225.7, 1063.7, 860.6, 698.6, and 536.6 (Yi sequence ions, Ref. 31Domon B. Costello C.E. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 397-409Crossref Scopus (2332) Google Scholar) shown in the spectrum were in agreement with a Neu5Gc-Hex-HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc-Hex-Hex-Cer structure where the Y0 ion at 536.6 indicated the dominant d18:1–16:0 ceramide species. The 1H NMR spectrum of the heptaglycosylceramide fraction is shown in Fig. 3A. The analysis revealed features very similar to those found for the same structure having a terminal Neu5Ac (32Levery S.B. Nudelman E. Kannagi R. Symington F.W. Andersen N.H. Clausen H. Baldwin M. Hakomori S.-I. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 178: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) instead of Neu5Gc. Six β-doublets were seen in the anomeric region of the spectrum readily identifiable as Glcβ H-1 at 4.18 ppm, two overlapping Galβ H-1 signals at 4.28 ppm originating from two internal residues, and a third Galβ H-1 signal at 4.24 ppm stemming from the residue linked to sialic acid whereas two overlapping Glc-NAcβ H-1 signals were found at 4.67 and 4.68 ppm, respectively. The chemical shifts of the Gal and GlcNAc residues were consistent with a type-2 structure having a repetitive Galβ4GlcNAcβ3 core. Sialic acid was identified by the quartet from H-3eq at 2.77 ppm (not shown), a value indicating an α3 linkage. The amide substitution of the sialic acid was almost exclusively N-glycolyl according to the pseudodoublet seen at 3.88 ppm. Only a minor signal from an N-acetyl group was seen at 1.89 ppm (not shown). Thus, the major component in the binding fraction was identified as Neu5-Gcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Number 1 in Table I). Additionally a minor GlcNAcβ3 signal at 4.80 ppm indicated the presence of a small amount of the corresponding lacto structure, Neu5Gcα3Galβ3GlcNAcβ3-Galβ3GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer.Table IBinding of H. pylori to glycosphingolipids Denotations hepta, hexa, etc. indicate the number of monosaccharides in a glycosphingolipid.

https://openalex.org/W2017848367,"When co-expressed with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate biosensor eGFP-PHPLCδ, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) can suppress M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor-mediated phospholipase C signaling in hippocampal neurons through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism, most likely involving the direct binding of the RGS homology domain of GRK2 to Gαq/11. To define the importance of this mechanism in comparison with classical, phosphorylation-dependent receptor regulation by GRKs, we have examined M1 mACh receptor signaling in hippocampal neurons following depletion of GRK2 and also in the presence of non-Gαq/11-binding GRK2 mutants. Depletion of neuronal GRK2 using an antisense strategy almost completely inhibited M1 mACh receptor desensitization without enhancing acute agonist-stimulated phospholipase C activity. By stimulating neurons with a submaximal agonist concentration before (R1) and after (R2) a period of exposure to a maximal agonist concentration, an index (R2/R1) of agonist-induced desensitization of signaling could be obtained. Co-transfection of neurons with either a non-Gαq/11-binding (D110A) GRK2 mutant or the catalytically inactive D110A,K220RGRK2 did not suppress acute M1 mACh receptor-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. However, using the desensitization (R2/R1) protocol, it could be shown that expression of D110AGRK2 enhanced, whereas D110A,K220RGRK2 inhibited, agonist-induced M1 mACh receptor desensitization. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, the loss of Gαq/11 binding did not affect the ability of the D110AGRK2 mutant to phosphorylate M1 mACh receptors, whereas expression of D110A,K220RGRK2 had no effect on receptor phosphorylation. These data indicate that in hippocampal neurons endogenous GRK2 is a key regulator of M1 mACh receptor signaling and that the regulatory process involves both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Receptor desensitization is usually mediated by either second messenger-activated kinases (e.g. protein kinase C (PKC)) or GPCR kinases (GRKs). Receptor phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of arrestin proteins, which bind and physically prevent interaction between the GPCR and G protein (10Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol.

Using this approach, we showed that GRK2 inhibits M1 mACh receptor signaling in hippocampal neurons via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism (18Willets J.M. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4157-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) most likely involving the direct binding of the RH domain of GRK2 to Gαq/11-GTP. Although these data highlight a novel mechanism by which GRK2 can regulate M1 mACh receptor signaling in neurons, they do not establish whether GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation is also an important mechanism in M1 mACh receptor desensitization. Here we have used a number of approaches to delineate the mechanism by which M1 mACh receptor signaling is regulated by GRK2 in hippocampal neurons. Our data indicate that endogenous GRK2 is a key regulator of M1 mACh receptor signaling utilizing both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms to regulate receptor activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—Hippocampal neurons from 1-day-old Lister-hooded rat pups were isolated as described previously (22Nash M.S.

Briefly, isolated hippocampi were dissociated with Pronase E (0.5 mg ml–1) and thermolysin (0.5 mg ml–1) in a HEPES-buffered salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 25 mm glucose, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2) for 30 min. Tissue fragments were further dissociated by trituration in HEPES-buffered salt solution containing DNase I (40 μg ml–1). Following centrifugation and further trituration, the cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (50 μgml–1)-treated 25-mm glass coverslips. For the first 72 h, the cells were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and 10% fetal calf serum. Cytosine arabinoside (5 μm) was added after 24 h, and after 72 h the cells were transferred to serum-free medium. The cultured neurons were transfected on day 5 with a 3:1 ratio of either vector-control or GRK constructs to eGFP-PHPLCδ, respectively, using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, neuronal transfection rates of ≤5% were achieved using this technique. HEK293 and CHO-K1 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units ml–1), streptomycin (100 μg ml–1), and amphotericin B (2.5 μgml–1) (Invitrogen). All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C, under 5% CO2 in humidified conditions.Measurement of PLC Activity in Neurons and Assessment of M1 mACh Receptor Desensitization—PLC activity was assessed using the agonist-stimulated translocation of eGFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 (eGFP-PHPLCδ) and was visualized using an Olympus Optical FV500 scanning laser confocal IX70 inverted microscope as described previously (18Willets J.M. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4157-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Nash M.S. Willets J.M. Billups B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49036-49044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were undertaken in the presence of tetrodotoxin (500 nm) to block action potential-dependent synaptic activity. M1 mACh receptor desensitization was assessed as described previously (18Willets J.M. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4157-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the neurons were challenged with an approximate EC50 concentration (10 μm, R1) of the mACh agonist methacholine (MCh) for 30 s, followed by a 5-min washout to allow recovery of PIP2, intracellular Ca2+ stores, and eGFP-PHPLCδ fluorescence to basal levels. Next a maximal concentration of MCh (100 μm) was applied for 1 min to induce receptor desensitization. Finally, following another 5-min washout, neurons were rechallenged with a second pulse of MCh (10 μm, R2) for a further 30 s. Receptor desensitization was determined as the reduction in peak IP3 formation in R2 when compared with R1.M1 mACh Receptor Phosphorylation Studies—CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) rat M1 mACh receptor cDNA/well in the presence of 1 μg of vector control (pcDNA3), wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, or D110A, K220RGRK2 for 48 h. Confluent cells were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi ml–1; Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free Krebs buffer (118.6 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 11.7 mm glucose), pH 7.4. After 60 min at 37 °C, MCh (1 mm) was added to the cells for varying time periods. The cells were then solubilized as described previously (16Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the receptors were immunoprecipitated using a specific rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Applied Science) and electrophoretically resolved as described previously (16Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were documented and analyzed using the GeneGenius system and software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). To examine the effects of GRK2 manipulation on M1 mACh receptor phosphorylation, the cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged M1 mACh receptor and either wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, or D110A,K220RGRK2. Receptor expression was equalized following [3H]NMS binding prior to gel loading. For co-transfection experiments wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, or D110A,K220RGRK2 expression was determined by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK2 antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA).Assessment of Antisense Suppression of Endogenous GRK2 Expression—The ability of a specific antisense GRK2 construct (almost the full length of rat GRK2 cloned into pcDNA3 in an antisense direction) (23Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to suppress endogenous GRK2 expression was initially determined after transfection of HEK293 cells with 1, 2, or 3 μg of either pcDNA3 (control) or antisense GRK2 using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h the cells were lysed, and GRK2 expression was determined by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK2 antibody (Santa Cruz). To examine the specificity of the GRK2 antisense construct, the expression levels of GRK3 and GRK6 were also examined in the same samples by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK3 and anti-GRK6 antibodies (Santa Cruz). To assess to what extent antisense treatment suppresses endogenous expression of GRK2 in neurons, hippocampal neurons were transfected with a 1:3 ratio of either eGFP and pcDNA3 (control) or eGFP and antisense GRK2. After 72 h, the neurons were fixed for 10 min using 4% paraformaldehyde prior to permeabilization with phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100 (0.2%, for 5 min). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton X-100-containing goat serum (10%, 30 min). The neurons were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal anti-rabbit GRK2 antibody (Santa Cruz). After washing, the neurons were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:400, for 40 min) prior to washing and mounting. GRK2 staining was visualized using an Olympus Optical FV500 scanning laser confocal IX70 inverted microscope, using excitation at 488 nm for eGFP and 543 nm for Alexa Fluor 546. GRK2 expression was determined as the mean fluorescence intensity of all eGFP-expressing neurons.Creation of Non-Gαq-binding Mutants—The aspartate residue at position 110 of GRK2 was mutated to an alanine using QuikChange (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the following primers were used to create D110AGRK2 and D110A, K220RGRK2 mutants (forward primer, GTC TGC AGC CGA GAG ATC TTC GCG ACC TAC ATC ATG AAG GAG; reverse primer, CTC CTT CAT GAT GTA GGT CGC GAA GAT CTC TCG GCT GCA GAC), creating a new NruI endonuclease site, which was used to identify positive mutants. The presence of the correct mutation was determined following DNA sequencing. Wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, and D110A,K220RGRK2, were Myc-tagged following cloning into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) between the HindIII and EcoRI sites.Assessment of GRK2/Gαq Binding—The ability of wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, and D110A,K220RGRK2 to bind to Gαq was determined as follows. HEK293 cells were transfected with either 2 μg of D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, and D110A,K220RGRK2 or 1 μg of the constitutively active Gαq mutant Q209LGαq using GeneJuice according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h the cells were lysed on ice for 10 min with the following buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Igepal, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Supernatants from cells transfected with Q209LGαq were mixed with supernatants from cells expressing wild-type GRK2, D110AGRK2, K220RGRK2, or D110A, K220RGRK2. Following rolling for 1 h at 4 °C, the specific mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was added for 1 h at 4 °Cto immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged GRK2. Next 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the samples were placed on a roller for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed three times with lysis buffer minus Igepal and EDTA, prior to resuspension in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were heated for 3 min at 85 °C before separation by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel). Each sample (25 μl) was loaded onto a gel for Gαq detection, and a further 10 μl was loaded onto another gel for detection of Myc expression. Separated protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, and Gαq expression was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαq (1:2500 dilution); Myc expression was determined using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution; New England Biolabs). Protein expression was determined by the addition of ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Single Cell Ca2+ Concentration—Following loading with Fluo-3 AM (4 μm, 1 h), the neurons were excited at 488 nm, using an Olympus Optical FV500 scanning laser confocal IX70 inverted microscope. The cells were incubated at 37 °C using a temperature controller and microincubator (PDMI-2 and TC202A; Burleigh, UK) and perfused at 5 ml/min with Krebs buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 10mm HEPES, 11.7 mm glucose, and 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The images were captured using an oil immersion ×100 objective. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels were measured as the relative change in fluorescence detected in an area of interest as described previously (24Willets J.M. Parent J.L. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1781-1789PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs were applied via the perfusion line for the times stated under “Results.”Data Analysis—Concentration-response curves were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis using Prism, version 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All of the data were analyzed using one or two-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test (Excel 5.0; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Significance was accepted when p < 0.05.RESULTSSuppression of GRK2 Expression Using an Antisense GRK2 Construct—The GRK2 antisense construct used in this study has previously been shown to cause an approximate 75% suppression of endogenous GRK2 expression when stably expressed in NG108 –15 cells (25Willets J.M. Kelly E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 431: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To examine the effectiveness of the GRK2 antisense in a transient system, HEK293 cells were transfected with 1, 2, or 3 μg of GRK2 antisense (or the pcDNA3 vector) for 72 h. Western blot analysis showed that 1 μg of the GRK2 antisense was sufficient to cause an 80% suppression of endogenous GRK2 expression in HEK293 cells 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 1, A and B). The GRK2 antisense construct produced specific depletion of endogenous GRK2, because GRK3 and GRK6 expression levels were unaffected (Fig. 1A). Note that the GRK3 antibody used detects both GRK2 (upper band) and GRK3 (lower band) and that antisense GRK2 selectively depletes GRK2 without affecting GRK3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A). To determine whether antisense treatment was able to deplete endogenous GRK2 expression in neurons, the cultures were co-transfected with eGFP and pcDNA3 (control) or eGFP and antisense GRK2 for 72 h. Analysis of all neurons co-expressing eGFP indicated that the mean intensity of GRK2 immunoreactivity was reduced by ≥60% following antisense GRK2 treatment (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas GRK3 immunoreactivity was not affected (data not shown).Effects of GRK2 Suppression on M1 mACh Receptor Signaling in Hippocampal Neurons—To examine the effects of GRK2 on M1 mACh receptor signaling endogenous GRK2 was specifically depleted following transfection with antisense GRK2 for 72 h. Expression of antisense GRK2 did not affect IP3 production stimulated by an acute agonist addition when compared with pcDNA3-transfected, control neurons (Fig. 2A). In agreement with our previous findings using the agonist pretreatment protocol, which compares responses to submaximal agonist concentrations before (R1) and after (R2) a maximal agonist application (100 μm, for 60 s), R2 was ∼40% less than R1 following desensitization with 100 μm MCh in the presence of pcDNA3 (Fig. 2, B and D). However, in neurons expressing the antisense GRK2, R2 was virtually identical to R1, indicating that down-regulation of the endogenous GRK2 protein largely prevents M1 mACh receptor desensitization (Fig. 2, C and D). These data strongly suggest that GRK2 is a key endogenous mediator of M1 mACh receptor desensitization in hippocampal neurons.Fig. 2Effects of antisense GRK2 on M1 mACh receptor signaling in hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with a 1:3 ratio of eGFP-PHPLCδ and either pcDNA3 or antisense GRK2 for at least 72 h. A, concentration-response curves for eGFP-PHPLCδ translocations stimulated by a single 30-s application of MCh at the indicated concentrations in neurons expressing either pcDNA3 (▪) or antisense GRK2 (□). Representative traces showing the desensitization protocol for M1 mACh receptor signaling (R1, R2 = 10 μm MCh for 30 s; MChmax = 100 μm MCh for 60 s) in hippocampal neurons transfected with pcDNA3 (B) or antisense GRK2 (C). D, cumulative data showing a significant reduction (**, p < 0.01) in the extent of desensitization of the M1 mACh receptor in hippocampal neurons expressing antisense GRK2 (n = 14) compared with pcDNA3 (n = 16). The data are shown as the means ± S.E. for the percentage of change in R2 relative to the R1 response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A C-terminal Fragment of GRK2 (GRK2-ct) Does Not Alter M1 mACh Receptor Signaling—Agonist activation of receptors leads to a translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane, a process that requires binding of free Gβγ subunits to the C-terminal domain (Gly-495 to Leu-689) of bovine GRK2 (26Koch W.J.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), overexpression of GRK2 may lead to inhibition of PLC signaling through sequestration of free Gβγ subunits. To assess whether inhibition of PLC signaling seen with the overexpression of GRK2 or K220RGRK2 was due to sequestration of free Gβγ subunits, the C-terminal 194 amino acids of GRK2 (GRK2-ct) were co-expressed with eGFP-PHPLCδ. Overexpression of GRK2-ct, confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown), did not affect the acute IP3 response to single concentrations of MCh (3, 10 or 100 μm, for 30 s; data not shown), and had no effect on the R2/R1 ratio assessed using the M1 mACh receptor desensitization protocol (data not shown).Does M1 mACh Receptor Phosphorylation by GRK2 Mediate Receptor Desensitization?—Suppression of endogenous GRK2 expression reverses M1 mACh receptor desensitization in hippocampal neurons; however, it is unclear whether this is due to inhibition of PLC signaling via binding of Gαq/11 and/or GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation. To determine whether GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation is required for M1 mACh receptor desensitization, we introduced a single point mutation D110A to create both GRK2 and K220RGRK2 mutants, which are incapable of binding Gαq/11 (19Sterne-Marr R.

https://openalex.org/W2159507449,"Tumor removal remains the principal treatment modality in the management of solid tumors. The process of tumor removal may potentiate the resurgent growth of residual neoplastic tissue. Herein, we describe a novel murine model in which flank tumor cytoreduction is followed by accelerated local tumor recurrence. This model held for primary and recurrent tumors generated using a panel of human and murine (LS174T, DU145, SW480, SW640, and 3LL) cell lines and replicated accelerated tumor growth following excisional surgery. In investigating this further, epithelial cells were purified from LS174T primary and corresponding recurrent tumors for comparison. Baseline as well as tumor necrosis factor apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis were significantly reduced in recurrent tumor epithelia. Primary and recurrent tumor gene expression profiles were then compared. This identified an increase and reduction in the expression of p110γ and p85α class Ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits in recurrent tumor epithelia. These changes were further confirmed at the protein level. The targeting of PI3K ex vivo, using LY294002, restored sensitivity to TRAIL in recurrent tumor epithelia. In vivo, adjuvant LY294002 prolonged survival and significantly attenuated recurrent tumor growth by greatly enhancing apoptosis levels. Hence, PI3K plays a role in generating the antiapoptotic and chemoresistant phenotype associated with accelerated local tumor recurrence."

For this purpose pig γa and γb sequences were determined by cloning and mass spectrometry. Three bifunctional reagents were used: N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA), disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST), and 1-ethyl-3-[3dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide (EDC). NHS-ASA induced α-γ, DST induced α-γ and β-γ, and EDC induced primarily β-γ cross-links. Specific proteolytic and Fe2+-catalyzed cleavages located NHS-ASA- and DST-induced α-γ cross-links on the cytoplasmic surface of the α subunit, downstream of His283 and upstream of Val440. Additional considerations indicated that the DST-induced and NHS-ASA-induced cross-links involve either Lys347 or Lys352 in the S4 stalk segment. Mutational analysis of the rat γ subunit expressed in HeLa cells showed that the DST-induced cross-link involves Lys55 and Lys56 in the cytoplasmic segment. DST and EDC induced two β-γ cross-links, a major one at the extracellular surface within the segment Gly143-Ser302 of the β subunit and another within Ala1-Arg142. Based on the cross-linking and other data on α-γ proximities, we modeled interactions of the transmembrane α-helix and an unstructured cytoplasmic segment SKRLRCGGKKHR of γ with a homology model of the pig α1 subunit.

The Na,K-ATPase actively pumps Na+ ions out of cells and K+ ions into cells and maintains the characteristic transmembrane electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ ions. As could be expected for a protein with such a central physiological role, Na,K-ATPase is closely regulated at several levels. Recently a unique mode of regulation of the Na,K-ATPase has been described (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crambert G.

FXYD2 (γ), FXYD4 (CHIF), and FXYD7, are now known to interact specifically with the Na,K-ATPase and alter the pump kinetics in characteristic and different ways. The FXYD proteins show a highly tissue-specific expression pattern: γ is expressed in kidney, CHIF is expressed in kidney and colon, PLM is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, and FXYD7 is expressed in brain. In kidney γ is expressed as two splice variants, γa and γb (4Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 5Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X.

Splicing in other FXYD proteins has not been detected at the protein level.

In cultured mammalian cells γ raises apparent affinity for ATP by shifting the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1, reduces apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ by making cytoplasmic K+ a better competitor (8Therien A.G.

Anti-γC (directed against the sequence KHRQVNEDEL at the C terminus of rat γ) abrogates the effect of γ on the apparent ATP affinity in renal Na,K-ATPase or HeLa cells transfected with γ but not that on the K+ to Na+ antagonism (7Therien A.G.

In oocytes, γ reduces affinity for cell Na+ and evokes a small increase in the extracellular K+ affinity, which varies with voltage (6Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In HeLa and HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes small or insignificant differences in functional effects are found between γb and γa (Refs. 10Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N.

Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) CHIF raises the apparent affinity for cell Na+ by 2-3-fold, the reverse effect to that of γ. In HeLa cells, CHIF has no effect on the affinity for external K+ or ATP (14Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanzano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas in Xenopus oocytes an increased K0.5 to external K+ was observed at high voltages and in the presence of external Na+ (12Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The opposite functional effects of CHIF and γ on the apparent Na+ affinity are consistent with their different patterns of expression along the nephron and physiological roles (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crambert G. Geering K. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE1PubMed Google Scholar, 3Garty H. Karlish S.J.D. Semin. Nephrol. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes PLM interacts with both the α1β1 and α2β1 isoforms and decreases the internal Na+ affinity of the pump by about 2-fold and external K+ affinity by a small amount (15Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas use of an anti-PLM antibody on choroid plexus membranes suggested that PLM might increase Na,K-ATPase activity (16Feschenko M.S. Donnet C. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Jones L.R. Sweadner K.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2161-2169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FXYD7 is the fourth family member whose functional interaction with the Na,K-ATPase has been demonstrated. In Xenopus oocytes FXYD7 decreases the apparent K+ affinity of the pump when expressed with α1β1 or α2β1 but not with α3β1 (2Crambert G. Geering K. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE1PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison with functional studies there is little information on structural interactions of FXYD proteins with α/β subunits. It is, however, becoming clear that there are multiple sites of interaction, involving both transmembrane segments and the extramembrane domains. The fact that the anti-γC abrogates the effect of γ on the apparent ATP affinity but not that on the K+ to Na+ antagonism (8Therien A.G. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) provided an initial indication. In addition, in HeLa cells expression of γ with either C- or N-terminal truncated sequences removes the effect on ATP affinity but does not affect the K+ to Na+ antagonism (17Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In a recent systematic study of roles of the different segments, a series of γ/CHIF chimeric molecules was prepared in which extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic sequences were interchanged (18Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Fuzesi M. Karlish S.J. Garty H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was found that both the stability of the FXYD-α/β complex in detergent and the effects on the apparent Na+ affinity were determined by the origin of the transmembrane segment. Interestingly, however, different residues appear to be involved in the stability and functional effects of the transmembrane segments. The functional role of the transmembrane segments has been confirmed in a study showing that peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segment of γ reduce apparent Na+ affinity of the α/β complex in HeLa cell membranes as found previously for full-length transfected γ (19Zouzoulas A. Therien A.G. Scanzano R. Deber C.M. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40437-40441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In short, extramembrane segments mediate the effect of γ on apparent ATP affinity, whereas transmembrane segments mediate the effect on cation affinities. Where do FXYD proteins interact with the α/β complex? On the basis of cryoelectron microscopy of renal Na,K-ATPase electron densities were assigned as transmembrane helices of α, β, and γ subunits. The γ subunit helix was proposed to lie in a groove bounded by M2, M6, and M9 of the α subunit (20Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A denaturation study suggested that γ might interact in the M8-M10 region (21Donnet C. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7357-7365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently a role for M9 of the α subunit has been inferred from effects of mutants in M9 on stability of α/β-γ, α/β-CHIF, or α/β-FXYD7 complexes and their functional consequences studied in Xenopus oocytes (22Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Leu964 and Phe967 were important for stability of the complexes, whereas Phe956 and Glu960 were required for mediation of effects of the FXYD protein on K+ affinity. Thus, stabilizing and functional interactions were separable as found also in mutational studies in CHIF/γ chimera (23Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly the Phe956 and Glu960 mutations did not alter effects of γ and CHIF on Na+ affinity, implying that still other interactions in the transmembrane segment mediate these effects. Modeling of the FXYD helix was consistent with docking in the groove between M2, M6, and M9. The present work has utilized a different approach, namely covalent cross-linking, to obtain direct evidence for proximities between the γ subunit and α and β subunits of pig kidney Na,K-ATPase and in HeLa cells expressing rat α and γ subunits. We have used a variety of bifunctional reagents with different chemical specificities and arm lengths, optimized cross-linking efficiency, and determined the approximate positions of observed α-γ and γ-β cross-links. Based on the inferred position of α-γ cross-links in the cytoplasmic domains of the α and γ subunits, we have modeled the α-γ interactions. Partially purified Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney outer medulla was prepared as described previously (24Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Extensively trypsinized 19-kDa membranes were prepared as described previously (25Karlish S.J. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Membranes were solubilized by the non-ionic detergent C12E10 (polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether) in the presence of Rb+ plus ouabain or Na+ plus oligomycin as described previously (14Garty H.

HeLa cells overexpressing the rat α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase were kindly provided by Dr. J. B Lingrel, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH. Cells were transfected with wild type and mutated rat γ constructs subcloned into pIREShyg. Transfection was done using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colonies stably expressing γ proteins were selected in 400 μg/ml hygromycin B and tested for maximal expression of γ by Western blotting. NHS-ASA—Purified pig kidney Na,K-ATPase or 19-kDa membranes were suspended in 10 mm sodium borate, pH 9.5, 130 mm NaCl or 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 130 mm NaCl to 0.5 mg/ml protein concentration. NHS-ASA (26van der Horst G.T. Mancini G.M. Brossmer R. Rose U. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol.

The reaction was quenched by 50 mm unbuffered Tris. The pH of the suspension was restored to near neutral with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the suspension was illuminated for 2 min with a xenon lamp (150 watts, fitted with a filter cutting off light below 300 nm). Where indicated, the membranes were pelleted and resuspended in the detergent solubilization buffer: 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and either 10 mm RbCl plus 5 mm ouabain (pig kidney enzyme) or 20 mm NaCl plus oligomycin 0.1 mg/ml (pig kidney enzyme, HeLa cells). C12E10 was added at 1 mg/ml. The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and was illuminated with the UV lamp for 2 min. The sample was denatured with 2% SDS, and protein was precipitated by 4 volumes of methanol:diethyl ether (2:1, v/v). Pellets were dried in N2 and suspended in gel sample buffer. DST—Purified kidney enzyme was suspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl or 30 mm Rb+ plus 220 mm choline at 0.5-1 mg/ml protein, or the Na,K-ATPase was solubilized with C12E10 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, in the presence of 10 mm RbCl plus 5 mm ouabain or 20 mm NaCl plus oligomycin.

The reaction was quenched with 50 mm unbuffered Tris. EDC—Purified kidney enzyme was suspended in 100 mm MES, pH 6, 250 mm NaCl or 30 mm Rb+ plus 220 mm choline to 0.5-1 mg/ml protein. Alternatively the Na,K-ATPase was solubilized with 1 mg/ml C12E10 in media containing 100 mm MES, pH 6, 10 mm RbCl plus 5 mm ouabain or 20 mm NaCl plus oligomycin. 19-kDa membranes were suspended in 100 mm MES, pH 6, 10 mm RbCl, and 140 mm choline chloride. 1 mm EDC (28Grabarek Z.

The cross-linking was stopped by addition of 10 mm hydroxylamine. Cross-linked native enzyme or 19-kDa membranes (30-40 μg) were treated with PNGase F (125 units, New England Biolabs) for 24 h at 37 °C in a medium containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm RbCl after denaturation in the buffers supplied with the PNGase. The digestion was arrested by addition of concentrated gel sample buffer. Purified kidney enzyme or NHS-ASA-cross-linked membranes were suspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing either 20 mm RbCl or 20 mm NaCl (0.1 mg/ml protein) and incubated with 1:20 chymotrypsin (mg/mg of protein) for 15 min (see Refs. 29Jorgensen P.L.

Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots utilized the following antibodies as indicated: affinity-purified anti-γC, polyclonal antibody raised against the peptide KHRQVNEDEL at the C terminus of the rat γ subunit (dilution, 1:250); affinity-purified anti-KETYY, polyclonal antibody raised against KETYY at the C terminus of the α subunit (dilution, 1:4000); a monoclonal antibody (6H) recognizing a sequence within the first 23 residues at the N terminus of the α subunit (dilution, 1:5000); anti-β50, polyclonal antibody raised against a 50-kDa tryptic fragment of the β subunit, Gly143-Ser302 (dilution, 1:4000); and anti-β16, polyclonal antibody raised against a 16-kDa tryptic fragment of β subunit, Ala1-Arg142 (dilution, 1:1000). Pig γa and γb were extracted from gels with organic solvents, or gel pieces were subjected to tryptic digestion as described previously (5Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R.

Mass spectra were acquired on an Q-STAR Pulsari electrospray-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer containing a quadrupole collision cell (MDS-Sciex) and equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Proxeon Biosystems). Peptide fingerprinting was performed on a Bruker Reflex III™ matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, a reflector, and a 337 nm nitrogen laser. The EST data base contains only one expressed sequence tag entry corresponding to pig γa (BX674298). To verify the amino acid sequence of this protein, pig γa was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Pig kidney RNA was reverse transcribed from the poly(A) tail and then amplified using the primers GCAGGAAGAGGGCAGTGG (5′) and TGCGATGGGGGCACAGCCGA (3′). The 270-bp product was sequenced from both ends and found to correspond to γa. To exclude PCR errors, sequencing was repeated for two independent reactions of reverse transcription and amplification. The nucleotide sequence of pig γa has been deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY941203. Homology Modeling of Pig α1 Subunit—The alignment used by Li and co-workers (22Li C. Grosdidier A.

Starting from this initial conformation, 50,000 different random conformations were generated by randomly rotating the helix 0-360° around the long axis; translating it -3 to +5 Å toward or away from the center of the bundle, respectively; translating the helix ±10 Å along its long axis; and tilting the helix relative to the fixed angles of the TM helices of the α subunit by ±20°. The coordinate transformations were done using the program package CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Each such generated conformation was subjected to 50 steps of Powell minimization, and the Van der Waals interaction energy of the γ-helix with the α subunit was calculated. All degrees of freedom were sampled in 20 bins per parameter. The average energy of each bin was evaluated independently by using Boltzmann averaging of all conformations within this bin. After Boltzmann averaging the minimal average energy of the parameter in question was taken as that at the center of the bin of lowest energy. A related procedure has been shown to successfully reproduce structures of four-helix bundles (41Gottschalk K.E. J. Mol. Graph.

In a first step the φ/ψ angles of the backbone were adjusted so that the segment came into contact with the α subunit without backbone clashes and so that side chains of acidic residues of the α subunit came into proximity with the side chains of Lys54, Lys55, His56, and Arg57.

https://openalex.org/W2000634886,"IgE antibodies cause long-term sensitization of tissue mast cells and blood basophils toward allergen-induced cross-linking and triggering of allergic inflammation. This persistence of IgE binding is due to its uniquely high affinity for the receptor FcepsilonRI and in particular its slow rate of dissociation once bound. The binding interface consists of two subsites, one contributed by each Cepsilon3 domain of IgE Fc in a 1:1 complex. We have investigated the contributions of Cepsilon3 disulfide linkage and glycosylation to the kinetics and affinity of binding of an Fc subfragment (Fcepsilon3-4) to a soluble receptor fragment (sFcepsilonRIalpha). In contrast to IgG Fc where deglycosylation abrogates receptor binding activity, the removal of the N-linked carbohydrate at Asn-394 in Fcepsilon3-4 only reduces binding affinity by a factor of 4, principally because of a faster off-rate. Removal of the inter-heavy chain disulfide bond unexpectedly resulted in a fragment with a much faster off-rate and the potential to form a complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry (sFcepsilonRIalpha:Fcepsilon3-4). This permitted the determination of the affinity of a single, natively folded Cepsilon3 domain for the first time. The low affinity Ka approximately 10(5)-10(6) m-1, similar to that determined previously for an isolated and partially folded Cepsilon3 domain, demonstrates that substantial reduction in affinity can be achieved by preventing the engagement of one of the two Cepsilon3 domains. Recent structural data indicate that conformational change in IgE is required to allow both Cepsilon3 domains to bind, and thus an allosteric inhibitor that prevents access to the second Cepsilon3 has the potential to reduce the ability of IgE to sensitize allergic effector cells."

LCFA-CoA binding was due to close molecular interaction as shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from full-length HNF-4α tryptophan (FRET donor) to bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA (FRET acceptor), which yielded an intermolecular distance of 33 Å, although no FRET to cis-parinaric acid was detected. (ii) Deleting the N-terminal A–D-domains, comprising the AF1 and DNA binding functions, only slightly affected affinities for LCFA-CoAs (Kd = 0.9–4 nm) and LCFAs (Kd = 93–581 nm). (iii) Further deletion of the F-domain robustly reduced affinities for LCFA-CoA and reversed ligand specificity (i.e. high affinity for LCFAs (Kd = 1.5–32 nm) and low affinity for LCFA-CoAs (Kd = 54–302 nm)). No FRET from HNF-4α-E (amino acids 132–370) tryptophan (FRET donor) to bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA (FRET acceptor) was detected, whereas an intermolecular distance of 28 Å was calculated from FRET between HNF-4α-E and cis-parinaric acid. (iv) Circular dichroism showed that LCFA-CoA, but not LCFA, altered the secondary structure of HNF-4α only when the F-domain was present. (v) cis-Parinaric acid bound to HNF-4α with intact F-domain was readily displaceable by S-hexadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable thioether analogue of LCFA-CoAs. Truncation of the F-domain significantly decreased cis-parinaric acid displacement. Hence, the C-terminal F-domain of HNF-4α regulated ligand affinity, ligand specificity, and ligand-induced conformational change of HNF-4α.

Although HNF-4α shares overall similar domain structure (i.e. A/B, C, D, E) with many other nuclear transcription factors, it is unique in exhibiting a very large (85-aa) C-terminal F-domain that has negative regulatory activity (Fig. 1).

Modular structures of most frequently employed HNF-4α truncation mutants are schematically shown in comparison with the full-length HNF-4α molecule (Fig. 1). (i) HNF-4α-E-F (aa 132–455) is an N-terminal truncation form, lacking the A/B (including activation function 1 (AF-1)), C (DNA binding domain), and D (hinge) domains; (ii) the shortest truncation forms, HNF-4α-E-0.1F (aa 133–382) and HNF-4α-E (aa 132–370), contain mainly the ligand binding domain (E). Whether HNF-4α has an endogenous ligand with a role in transactivation regulation has been widely debated, and controversial conclusions have been made based on experimental data obtained with different truncation forms of HNF-4α rather than full-length HNF-4α. For example, recent x-ray crystallography data revealed the presence of a free fatty acid molecule within the binding pocket of HNF-4α-E-0.1F (aa 133–382), suggesting that this was a constitutive, undisplaceable ligand (18Dhe-Paganon S. Duda K. Iwamoto M. Chi Y-I. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, fluorescence and circular dichroic investigations of another truncated form that contained the complete F-domain (i.e. HNF-4α-E-F (aa 132–455)) showed that HNF-4α preferentially binds fatty acyl-CoAs with much higher affinity than fatty acids (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The basis for this discrepancy may lie in the presence or absence of the complete C-terminal F-domain. Consistent with this possibility, it is known that deletion of the F-domain converts the partially repressed HNF-4α into fully active HNF-4α in transactivation assays (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N.

The main objectives were to resolve the role of the HNF-4α C-terminal F-domain in determining (i) ligand affinity (Kd), (ii) ligand specificity (LCFA-CoA versus LCFA), and (iii) F-domain-dependent conformational responsiveness of HNF-4α to ligand (LCFA-CoA versus LCFA).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Nonfluorescent long chain fatty acids (C14:0, myristic; C16:0, palmitic; C16:1, palmitoleic; C20:4, arachidonic) and long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (C14:0-CoA, myristoyl-CoA; C16:0-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA; C16:1-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA; C20:4-CoA, arachidonyl-CoA) were purchased from Sigma. The 18 carbon chain length fluorescent fatty acids (cis-parinaric acid and NBD-stearic acid) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescent acyl-CoA (i.e. cis-parinaroyl-CoA) was prepared in our laboratory as previously described (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Full-length and Deletion Mutant Forms of Rat HNF-4α—The full-length rat HNF-4α1 (aa 1–455) and the N-terminal deletion mutant HNF-4α-E-F (aa 132–455) recombinant proteins were obtained as previously described (11Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

The cDNA of the C-terminal truncation mutant lacking the entire F-domain, HNF-4α-E (aa 132–370), was obtained by PCR using the sense 5′-CATGCCATGGGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGGTCAAGCTACGAG and antisense 5′-GAAGATCTCTAGGCAGACCCTCCAAG primers. The PCR product was cloned into pet11d plasmid. The recombinant plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-(DE3)pLyS strain, and the His-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and stored at –70 °C. The purity of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE.Ligand Binding Assay: Fluorescent Ligands—Ligand (LCFA, LCFA-CoA) binding to HNF-4α and HNF-4α mutants was determined by fluorescence ligand binding assays as described earlier (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A.D. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol.

Since binding of fluorescent ligands (cis-parinaric acid, NBD-stearic acid, cis-parinaroyl-CoA) to HNF-4α (or HNF-4α truncation mutants) induced a measurable increase in ligand fluorescence intensity, direct excitation of ligand and simultaneous monitoring of ligand fluorescence emission intensity was performed in the presence of increasing ligand concentration. Fluorescence emission of fluorescent ligands was detected with a PC1 photon counting fluorimeter (ISS Inc., Urbana, IL) (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A.D. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N.

For NBD-stearic acid/HNF-4α (or HNF-4α mutant) binding assays, the ligand was excited at 480 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 500 to 600 nm. All fluorescent ligand binding assays were performed at 22 °C, in L&C buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) with moderate stirring and a short (1-min) protein/ligand mixing time to allow for equilibration before measuring fluorescence emission intensities. Controls for the emission intensities of fluorescent ligands in the absence of the respective proteins were run for all concentrations of ligand used in the titration experiments. In order to avoid inner filter effects, sample absorbance at excitation wavelength was kept at <0.05.The binding parameters (i.e. dissociation constant, Kd, and n (number of binding sites)) were calculated from the titration curves plotted as ligand fluorescence intensity as a function of ligand concentration in nm at each titration point as follows (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A.D. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol.

A plot of 1/(1–Fi/Fmax) versus [L]/(Fi/Fmax) yielded a linear function with a slope of 1/Kd and an ordinate intercept of (nE0)/Kd. Since the n values calculated by this method were around 1, curve fitting to one ligand binding site model by nonlinear regression was also performed, and Kd values were calculated. Basically, similar values were obtained.Ligand Binding Assay: Protein Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements—Nonfluorescent ligand (LCFA, LCFA-CoA) binding to full-length HNF-4α and HNF-4α truncation mutants was determined from the quenching of protein Trp/Tyr fluorescence in the presence of added nonfluorescent LCFA or LCFA-CoA ligands as described (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N. Petrescu A.D. Kalderon B. Berman I. Eldad N. Schroeder F. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol.

These titration curves allowed calculation of dissociation constants (Kd) for each type of ligand interacting with HNF-4α and HNF-4α mutant proteins. In this type of experiment, Tyr and Trp residues within the respective proteins were excited at 280 nm, and their fluorescence emission was scanned from 300 to 400 nm. Controls were run with the same amounts of the respective protein and the same volumes of ligand solvent (usually ethanol for LCFAs or ethanol/water (1:1, v/v) for LCFA-CoAs) without the ligand, to exclude the contribution of small volumes of solvent to protein Tyr/Trp fluorescence quenching. Calculation of binding parameters (i.e. dissociation constant, Kd, and n (number of binding sites)) was performed from the titration curves plotted as quenching in protein fluorescence intensity (F0 – F, where F0 and F represented the HNF-4α Tyr/Trp fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of ligand, respectively, at each titration point) as a function of ligand concentration. Linear plots of 1/(1 – Fi/Fmax) versus [ligand]/(Fi/Fmax) according to Equation 1 were used for calculation of Kd and n values. In this case, Fi and Fmax measured the decrease in protein fluorescence intensity (i.e. quenching) in the presence of ligand at each titration point and at saturation, respectively (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since the n values calculated by this method were within a range around 1, curve fitting to one ligand binding site model by nonlinear regression was also performed, and Kd values were calculated. Sigmoidal curves have been also fit to the Hill equation, y=axb/cb+Xb (Eq. 2) where y and x represented (F0 – F) and ligand concentration at each titration point, whereas the a, b, and c parameters were used to estimate Bmax or the maximum binding, n (the number of binding sites), and the Kd value, respectively.Displacement of Bound Fluorescent LCFA—To determine whether an exogenously added LCFA-CoA could displace bound LCFA, a displacement assay was employed utilizing the fluorescence of naturally occurring LCFA, cis-parinaric acid. Displacement was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of S-hexadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable and nonfluorescent LCFA-CoA ether analogue. The latter was chosen to preclude potential interference from nonfluorescent LCFA arising upon degradation/hydrolysis of the LCFA-CoA. Briefly, HNF-4α protein (150 nm) was saturated with cis-parinaric acid and then titrated with increasing concentrations of S-hexadecyl-CoA (0–75 nm). Fluorescence emission spectra of cis-parinaric acid were recorded from 400 to 480 nm (excitation at 317 nm) to monitor HNF-4α saturation with cis-parinaric acid followed by displacement during titration with S-hexadecyl-CoA. The decrease in maximum fluorescence intensity of cis-parinaric acid at 420 nm was plotted versus the S-hexadecyl-CoA concentrations. From the plot, the I50 value was determined, and then the equation, Ki = [I50]/(1 + [L]/KL), was used to calculate the dissociation constant (Ki) for S-hexadecyl-CoA; [L] was the cis-parinaric acid concentration used in the experiment, and KL was the dissociation constant for cis-parinaric acid and HNF-4α binding.Reverse Titration of NBD-Stearic Acid with Full-length HNF-4α Versus Deletion Mutants HNF4α-E-F (aa 132–455) and HNF-4α-E (aa 132–370)—In the HNF-4α/NBD-stearic acid reverse titration experiments, NBD-stearic acid (100–250 nm) was titrated with increasing concentrations of HNF-4α protein up to a plateau (binding saturation). The NBD fluorescent group was excited at 480 nm, and its fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 500 to 600 nm for each titration point as previously described (8Hertz R. Ben-Haim N.

The buffer used in these experiments was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol in order to ensure the best solubility of HNF-4α. The ligand/protein molar ratio (i.e. the number of ligand binding sites per HNF-4α molecule) was estimated as previously described for cis-parinaric acid binding to albumin (23Sklar L.A. Hudson B.S. Simoni R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5100-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Additionally, in cases where the binding curves had sigmoidal shape, curve fitting to a Hill plot (Eq. 2) was performed for estimation of Kd and n values.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to Determine Intermolecular Distance between HNF-4α Constructs and Bound Ligands—To further establish the close molecular interaction between a bound LCFA-CoA and the various HNF-4α constructs, Forster FRET (24Forster T. Florkin M. Statz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Scientific Publishers, New York1967: 61-77Google Scholar) was measured between HNF-4α tryptophan and bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid basically as described earlier (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HNF-4α tryptophan was excited at 295 nm to avoid contributions from Tyr. The emission of Trp in proteins at 330 nm exhibits significant overlap with cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid absorption (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Elsevier Scientific Publishers, New York1967: 61-77Google Scholar). Since efficiency of FRET varies as (intermolecular distance)[sufrax,1,6], donor (Trp in HNF-4α variants) and acceptor (bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA of cis-parinaric acid) must be in very close proximity (up to 100 Å) for efficient FRET. HNF-4α variants (170 nm) were titrated with increasing concentrations of cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid (5–1500 nm final concentration). FRET was measured as the appearance of sensitized emission from bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid at 420 nm. Energy transfer efficiency was determined according to E = (FAD/FA – 1) × (ϵA/ϵD), where FAD represented the fluorescence intensity of acceptor (cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid) in the presence of energy donor (Trp in HNF-4α variants), FA was fluorescence intensity of the acceptor (cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid) in the absence of energy donor (Trp in HNF-4α variants), and ϵA and ϵD were the molar absorption coefficients of energy acceptor (cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid) and donor (Trp in HNF-4α variants), respectively, at λ = 295 nm. Intermolecular distance between Trp of full-length HNF-4α or HNF-4α-E and bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA or cis-parinaric acid was calculated from E = R06/(R06 + R2/36), where E represents the FRET efficiency, R0 is the critical distance for 50% efficiency, and R2/3 is the actual distance between donor and acceptor (24Forster T. Florkin M. Statz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier Scientific Publishers, New York1967: 61-77Google Scholar). R0, the critical distance for 50% efficiency, was calculated in Å as described (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

The quantum yield, QD, for Trp in full-length HNF-4α or HNF-4α-E as well as J(λ) were determined as shown earlier (19Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Tat and Sp1 play major roles in transcription by protein-protein interactions at human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat. Sp1 activates transcription by interacting with cyclin T1 in the absence of Tat. To disrupt the transcription activation by Tat and Sp1, we fused Sp1-inhibiting polypeptides, zinc finger polypeptide, and the TAR-binding mutant Tat (TatdMt) together. A designed or natural zinc finger and Tat mutant fusion was used to target the fusion to the key regulatory sites (GC box and TAR) on the long terminal repeat and nascent short transcripts to disrupt the molecular interaction that normally result in robust transcription. The designed zinc finger and TatdMt fusions were targeted to the TAR, and they potently repressed both transcription and replication of HIV-1. The Sp1-yinhibiting POZ domain, TatdMt, and zinc fingers are key functional domains important in repression of transcription and replication. The designed artificial zinc fingers were targeted to the high affinity Sp1-binding site, and by being fused with TatdMt and POZ domain, they strongly block both Sp1-cyclin T1-dependent transcription and Tat-dependent transcription, even in the presence of excess expressed Tat.

Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar and references therein). A mixture of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood significantly. However, the severe side effects of these drugs, expensive cost, and viral mutation make the chemotherapy less than satisfactory. The rapid development of alternative therapies such as DNA vaccines carrying HIV genes, designed zinc finger, and RNA interference remains critically important (Ref. 2Reynolds L. Ullman C. Moore M. Isalan M. West M.J. Clapham P. Klug A. Choo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and references therein). The molecular mechanism of the regulation of HIV-1 transcription provides a molecular basis for developing novel antiviral agents. There is a great need for developing therapeutic agents that can repress transcription of the HIV-1 to overcome the problem viral resistance, because such agents would prevent production of the genetic material for viral replication and the template for reverse transcriptase. Because Sp1 and Tat (trans-activator protein) play a central role in the transcription, inhibition of both Sp1 and Tat can repress transcription and replication of HIV-1 (3Frankel A.D. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Zinc finger domains are small DNA-binding modules (about 30 a.a.) that can be engineered to bind to the desired target sequences (4Bae K.H. Kwon Y.D. Shin H.C. Hwang M.S. Ryu E.H. Park K.S. Yang H.Y. Lee D.K. Lee Y. Park J. Kwon H.S. Kim H.W. Yeh B.I. Lee H.W. Sohn S.H. Yoon J. Seol W. Kim J.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Segal D.J.

Chem. 2003; 3: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, the engineered zinc finger or its fusion form with other functional domains have been constructed by several groups, including our group, and these zinc fingers have successfully activated or repressed gene targets in various systems including the HIV-1 viral gene (Refs. 2Reynolds L. Ullman C. Moore M. Isalan M. West M.J. Clapham P. Klug A. Choo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Isalan M. Klug A. Choo Y. Nat.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14509-14519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and references therein). In the case of HIV-1, the engineered zinc finger proteins were designed to bind a key regulatory DNA sequence within the HIV-1 LTR promoter, including Sp1 sites, the TATA box, and the downstream sequences (2Reynolds L. Ullman C. Moore M. Isalan M. West M.J. Clapham P. Klug A. Choo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Isalan M. Klug A. Choo Y. Nat.

They were even more effective when linked with the repression domain of the SID or KRAB transcription repressors (2Reynolds L. Ullman C. Moore M. Isalan M. West M.J. Clapham P. Klug A. Choo Y. Proc.

The zinc finger proteins have the potential to exploit several HIV-specific processes, both at the level of transcription at the promoter and also at other nucleic acid-protein interactions such as TAR-Tat interaction. HIV-1 encodes a regulatory protein Tat, which functions by interaction with the specific RNA element called TAR. The protein-RNA interactions are absolutely required for HIV replication and transcription, and so they are enticing potential target points for antiviral strategies. No studies using zinc finger proteins have yet targeted the Tat-TAR interaction. The POZ domain of FBI-1 has recently been shown to bind to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of Sp1 to prevent the recognition of the target GC boxes and thus to repress transcription activation (9Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). FBI-1 has both zinc fingers recognizing the LTR inducer of short transcript sequences and Sp1-inhibiting POZ domain. In addition, FBI-1 was shown to interact with Tat via its zinc finger and to form an inducer of short transcript-FBI-1-Tat-P-TEFb complex in vivo, which suggested that the FBI-1 protein is in close contact with other regulatory proteins and nucleic acids (10Pendergrast P.S. Wang C. Hernandez N. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Initially, we designed transcription repressors that incorporated part or the full length of FBI-1. In addition to the unique features of the FBI-1, we incorporated a novel feature of the TatdMt, the dominant negative mutant form of Tat, for targeting the Tat-TAR interaction. This particular form of the Tat mutant can bind TAR efficiently, but it is lacking the ability to form P-TEFb (12Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). FBI-1 or POZ-TatdMt fusions can target both the Sp1 and Tat-TAR interaction, and so they are effective transcription blockers. By structural analysis of the fusion gene construct FBI-1-TatdMt, we mapped the functional domains important in transcription repression. Furthermore, we designed artificial zinc finger (AZF) fusions specifically targeting the Sp1-binding GC box region and Tat-TAR interaction. The TatdMt fusion proteins of ZFs were efficiently targeted to the HIV-1 LTR and strongly repressed transcription and replication. Plasmids and Antibodies—The HIV-1 LTR-CAT fusion plasmid (pU3R-IIICAT or luciferase) has been described previously (13Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 299: 74-77Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for TatWt (HIVHBX2R type, 86 a.a.), TatdMt (Tat K28A, K50A, 72 a.a.), and FBI-1 were prepared by subcloning their cDNAs into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) (12Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 13Sodroski J.

The mammalian expression plasmids for FBI-1 or POZ domain fusion proteins with a mutant TatdMt were constructed by subcloning their cDNAs into pcDNA3.0-TatdMt plasmid (FBI-1, GenBank™ accession number, AF097916). The pG5-luciferase was from Promega, and the pG5-Sp1-luciferase was prepared by subcloning five copies of the Sp1-binding GC box into the pG5-luciferase. pBind Gal4-POZFBI-1, and -FBI-1 were prepared by subcloning the cDNA into the pBind plasmid (Promega). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—To analyze the repression by Gal4-POZ domain or FBI-1 fusions on Sp1-dependent transcription, CV-1 cells were transfected with a mixture of pG5-Luc or pG5-Sp1-luc plasmid (0.4 μg), pCMV-LacZ plasmid (0.2 μg), and various pGal4-POZFBI or pGal4-FBI (0.4 μg) by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). To assay the repression caused by various fusion proteins on HIV-1 transcription, the stable HeLa cells integrated with the HIV-1 LTR-CAT gene (pU3R-III CAT) were transfected with the pcDNA3.0 TatWt expression plasmid (0.3 μg) and various pcDNA3.0 TatdMt fusion expression plasmids (0.3 μg). For the titration experiments, 0–0.3 μg of pcDNA3.0 expression plasmids for FBI-1-TatdMt was cotransfected with pcDNA3.0 TatWt (0.3 μg) into stable HeLa cells. The cells were grown for 24 h and then assayed for reporter gene expression. Variations in transfection efficiencies were normalized using coexpressed β-galactosidase activity. HIV-1 Replication Inhibition Analysis—Transient trans-complementation or a single-round HIV-1 replication inhibition analysis was carried out as described elsewhere (15Maddon P.J. Dalgleish A.G.

A plasmid that expresses the HIV-1 genome with the hygromycin B resistance gene was cotransfected into 293T cells with a viral envelope protein VSV-G expression plasmid and either the control (pHYK) or the TatdMt fusion protein expression plasmid. The cotransfection resulted in the production of HIV-1 virus particles that undergo only a single round of infection in susceptible cell lines such as HeLaT4 and Magi cells (15Maddon P.J.

The efficiency of a single round of infection was determined by scoring the numbers of HygR HeLaT4 cells or β-galactosidase-positive Magi cells (see Fig. 2A). To produce HIV-1 virus, 293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA (YK177–86, 1 μg) (16Kim Y.-S. Panganiban A.T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and either the control (pHYK, 2 μg) or TatdMt fusion expression plasmid (fused with POZ domain, FBI-1, artificial zinc finger, 2 μg), the envelope protein expression plasmid (pVSV-G, 0.5 μg), and the LacZ gene expression plasmid (MFG/LacZ/Puro, 0.5 μg) using Lipofectamine Plus. The MFG/LacZ/Puro plasmid was cotransfected to normalize variations in transfection efficiencies. The transfected cells were further incubated for 2 days to prepare a supernatant containing infectious HIV-1 virus particles. The supernatant from the transfected 293T cells was collected, filtered, diluted serially, and used to infect CD4+ HeLaT4 cells or Magi cells (HeLaT4 cells integrated with the HIV-1 LTR-LacZ gene). After 4 h, fresh culture medium was then added, and the cells were cultured for selection of HygR-positive cells, and the virus titer was determined by counting the colonies that were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet/50% (v/v) methanol. In the case of Magi cells, the virus titer was determined by scoring the number of Magi cells that turned blue after β-galactosidase staining. The assays results are presented as averages of three independent experiments. Mapping of Functionally Important Functional Domains of FBI-1-TatdMT Fusion—Various deletion and zinc finger mutants of FBI-1 were prepared by subcloning FBI-I or FBI-1 zinc finger 1 mutant cDNA fragments that had gone through PCR into the pcDNA3.0-TatdMt plasmid (see Fig. 3A) (9Lee D.K.

For the PCR to amplify the region between a.a. 124 and 584 for the constructs 2-1 and 2-2 (see Fig. 3A), 5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGCGCCGACCTCCTGGACCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCGAATTCGGCGAGTCCGGCTGTGAAGTT-3′ (reverse) were used. To amplify the region between a.a. 124 and 512 for the constructs 3-1 and 3-2, 5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGCGCCGACCTCCTGGACCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCGAATTCCGGGCTGGGGTCGGGCGCCCCGCC-3′ (reverse) were used. Also, for the PCR between a.a. 335 and 584 (for 4-1 construct) or a.a. 512 (for 5-1 and 5-2 constructs), 5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGGGGACAGCGACGAGTC-3′ (forward) was paired with reverse primer (5′-GATCGAATTCGGCGAGTCCGGCTGTGAAGTT-3′ or 5′-GATCGAATTCCGGGCTGGGGTCGGGCGCCCCGCC-3′). For the 4–1ZFC, forward primer (5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGGGGACAGCGACGAGTC-3′) was paired with reverse primer (5′-GATCGAATTCGGCGAGTCCGGCTGTGAAGTT-3′) for the PCR. For the PCR of ZF (a.a. 371–495), forward primer (5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGAGAAGGTGGAGAAGATCCGA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACGTAAGCTTCGAGGGGACGCCGTTGCAGCC-3′) were used. PCR was performed by denaturing at 94 °C for 5 min and 30 cycles of an amplification reaction (94 °C 30 s, 60 °C 1 min, 72 °C 3 min), and a final extension was done at 72 °C for 4 min. For PCRs to prepare constructs 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, 4-1ZFC, and ZF fragments, we used the FBI-1 cDNA that we isolated previously as a PCR template (9Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For PCRs of 2-2, 3-2, and 5-2, we used the FBI-1 cDNA with a mutation at the first zinc finger (C384A,C387A) (11Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amplified PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.0TatdMt/HindIII-EcoRI plasmid to generate various deletion mutants of FBI-1-TatdMt. ZF cDNA of FBI-1 that had gone through PCR was prepared in the same manner and cloned into pcDNA3.0 HindIII. Design and Preparation of AZFs Recognizing Various Regions of HIV-1 LTR—Ten AZFs that recognize the HIV-1 LTR were prepared by a method previously described and cloned in pcDNA3.1 (4Bae K.H. Kwon Y.D. Shin H.C. Hwang M.S. Ryu E.H. Park K.S. Yang H.Y. Lee D.K. Lee Y. Park J. Kwon H.S. Kim H.W. Yeh B.I. Lee H.W. Sohn S.H. Yoon J. Seol W. Kim J.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The AZFs contain three or four zinc fingers and recognize a 9- or 12-bp target sequence, respectively. ZF-56-II is a four-zinc finger polypeptide, and all others are three zinc fingers. The numbers are the uppermost nucleotides of the recognition sites. These AZFs were designed to recognize the regions around Sp1-binding sites, TATA box, and a downstream region that are critical in the transcription of HIV-1 LTR. All of the AZFs contain HA tag at the N terminus and nuclear localization sequence fused with the zinc finger open reading frame. The AZF expression vectors contain the same 5′ and 3′ sequences flanking the AZF open reading frame. To prepare the pcDNA3.0-artificial zinc finger fusion TatdMt constructs, 5′-GATCGGTACCATGGAATTGCCTCCAAAAAAGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCGATATCTGCGGCCGCTTTTTCACCGGTATG-3′ (reverse) were used to subject the zinc finger open reading frame sequences to PCR using various artificial zinc finger plasmids as PCR templates. PCR was performed by denaturing at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification reaction (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min), and a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRV and then cloned into the pcDNA3.0-TatdMt plasmid that was digested with HindIII-EcoRV. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) of AZFs and Specificity of AZF Binding—For EMSA, HA-AZF LTR-62 and HA-AZF LTR-65 polypeptides were prepared using TnT in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Antibody against HA polypeptide was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Sp1 was purchased from Promega. Oligonucleotide probes used are (only top strand shown): for Sp1 binding, 5′-GATCATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; for HA-AZF LTR-62, 5′-GATCATTCGATCCGGGACTGGCGAGC-3′; and for HA-AZF LTR-65, 5′-GATCATTCGATCGGGCGGGACGCAGC-3′. EMSA was carried out as described previously (9Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To show that the AZFs act specifically on their own target sequences and do not act on the Sp1 binding GC box, two well characterized Sp1-dependent human gene promoters fused with reporter luciferase gene, pADH5/FDH-luc and p21Waf/cip1-luc, were cotransfected with AZF expression vectors into HeLa cells and analyzed as described above under “Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays.” Transcription Inhibition Assays with the Artificial Zinc Fingers or Artificial Zinc Fingers Fused with POZ Domain or TatdMt and Transient Transfection Reporter CAT Assays—To investigate the transcription inhibition by the artificial zinc fingers proteins, the stable HeLa cells integrated with the HIV-1 LTR CAT gene were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). After growing the cells for 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of each pcDNA 3.1 zinc finger expression plasmid, 0.3 μg of pcDNA3.0-TatWt expression plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (LacZ) mixed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), and the cells were then allowed to grow for 24 h. The rest of the assay procedures are the same as described above in the transient transfection reporter assays. To investigate whether the transcription activation by Sp1 and CyclinT1 can be inhibited by the artificial zinc fingers and the AZFs fused with POZ domain and TatdMt, the stable HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid mixture composed of 0.3 μg of pcDNA3.0 AZF LTR-65 or AZF LTR-65-TatdMt, in the presence or absence of 0.3 μg of pCMV-Sp1 and/or cyclin T1, and 0.1 μg pCMV-β-galactosidase (LacZ) using Lipofectamine Plus. The rest of the transcription assay procedures are the same as described above. TatdMt fusion protein can potently represses transcription of HIV-1—FBI-1 has been shown to bind to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of Sp1, to prevent Sp1 from recognizing the target GC boxes, and to repress transcription activation by Sp1 (9Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We tested whether Gal4DBD fusion proteins with FBI-1 or the POZ domain of FBI-1 could repress transcription activation by Sp1 when these proteins were targeted proximal to the GC boxes. Targeting Sp1-inhibiting polypeptides using Gal4-DBD proximal to the Sp1 binding GC box can effectively repress transcription by more than 75% (Fig. 1, A and B). We applied this finding for the control of HIV-1 transcription. Instead of Gal4DBD, we used TatdMt (72 a.a. Tat K28A,K50A), a mutant form of TAR RNA-interacting polypeptide Tat that lacks the ability to interact with P-TEFb but binds efficiently to TAR (12Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The two lysine residues at a.a. 28 and 50 that are critical in the interaction with cyclin T1 were replaced with alanines in TatdMt. TatdMt neither forms a complex with P-TEFb (cyclin T1 and cyclin-dependent protein kinase 9) nor activates transcription. These features of TatdMt can be useful in targeting Sp1-inhibiting polypeptides to HIV-1 LTR. TAR-bound Tat is in close proximity to and interacts with cellular proteins such as Sp1, NF-κB, general transcription factors (TFIID and TFIIH), and P-TEFb (1Jeang K.-T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 3Frankel A.D. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 14Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 235-254Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We fused the Sp1-inhibiting POZ domain and FBI-1 with either the N or C terminus of TatdMt (72 a.a.) (Fig. 1C shows the constructs in one configuration). The fusion expression plasmids were transfected into stable HeLa cells with the integrated HIV-1 LTR-CAT gene in the presence or absence of TatWt expression. In the absence of TatWt, transcription in the stable HeLa cells occurred at a low basal level (Fig. 1D, lane 1). TatWt potently activated the transcription of HIV-1 LTR by 46-fold (Fig. 1D, lane 1, filled bar). In contrast, TatdMt or TatdMt fusions alone did not activate transcription over the basal level (Fig. 1D, open bars, compare lanes 1 and lanes 2–4). However, TatdMt reduced transcription activation by TatWt to half of that observed with TatWt alone, and this suggested that TatdMt competes with TatWt for TAR (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2, filled bars). The TatdMt fusions successfully competed with TatWt for TAR and potently repressed transcription (Fig. 1D, compare filled bars, lanes 1 versus lanes 3 and 4). FBI-1-TatdMt was the most potent repressor, and it repressed transcription down to the basal transcription level even in the presence of an excess of TatWt expression plasmid (0.3 μg) (Fig. 1D, filled bar, lane 4). The POZ domain (120 a.a.) is mainly responsible for the repressor activity of the FBI-1-TatdMt fusion. A titration experiment shows that FBI-1-TatdMt competed with TatWt and potently inhibited transcription by 30% at 3 ng and 80% at 30 ng, and it nearly nullified transcription at 300 ng (Fig. 1F). FBI-TatdMt Fusion Protein Potently Represses HIV-1 Replication—We investigated whether TatdMt fusion proteins can inhibit HIV-1 replication by using transient trans-complementation assays in 293T cells (Fig. 2A) (15Maddon P.J. Dalgleish A.G. McDougal J.S. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Axel R. Cell. 1986; 47: 333-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 16Kim Y.-S. Panganiban A.T. J. Neurosci.

The FBI-1-TatdMt in the configuration, as shown in Fig. 3A, reduced the number of infectious HIV-1 virus particles by 286-fold (Fig. 2B). Mapping of Functional Domains of FBI-1-TatdMT Fusion— Encouraged by the above finding, we investigated which domains of FBI-1-TatMt fusion contribute to this potent transcription repression. We prepared various deletion and mutation constructs (Fig. 3A). Deletions were made within the POZ domain (1–123 a.a.), C terminus (513–584 a.a.), and junctional domain between the POZ domain and the zinc fingers (124–334 a.a.). In addition, to investigate the importance of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, mutations at the two cysteine residues of the first zinc finger (C384A and C387A) were introduced (11Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays in the stable HeLa cells with integrated HIV-1 LTR-CAT showed that the FBI-TatdMt again potently repressed transcription activation by TatWt (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 3). Deletion of the POZ domain (construct 2-1) resulted in 5-fold decrease in transcription repression, suggesting the importance of the domain in repression by inhibiting Sp1 (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Although deletion of the POZ domain decreased the repression potential of the fusion proteins, the truncated fusions containing zinc fingers and TatdMt still retained a significant repression potential. All of the zinc finger mutants (constructs 2-2, 3-2, and 5-2) showed no repressor activity comparable with any of the deletion mutants. They showed repression activity that was only comparable with TatdMt alone (Figs. 3B and 1E). This data suggested that the zinc finger is essential in transcription repression of the fusion constructs, and this probably happens by blocking transcription initiation or progression and by helping TatdMt in TAR binding. Our data indicated that the POZ domain and the zinc finger are the important repression domains of FBI-1-TatdMt. The zinc finger itself, with no nuclear localization sequence attached, was able to repress transcription, although relatively weakly compared with either 4-1ZFC or FBI-1-TatdMt. FBI-1-TatdMt repressed transcription five times more strongly as compared with the zinc finger alone. Our data also suggest that although the zinc finger of FBI-1 can repress transcription, the degree of transcription repression can be significantly enhanced by a fusion with the POZ domain and TatdMt (Fig. 3C). Design of AZFs Recognizing Various Regions of HIV-1 LTR and Transcription Repression—Because FBI-1 is ubiquitously expressed and overexpression of the fusion protein in the targeted cells can potentially alter the expression of various genes, we designed and prepared ten artificial zinc fingers that specifically recognized the HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 4, A and C). The zinc fingers were designed to contain three or four zinc fingers and to recognize 9 or 12 bp, respectively (Fig. 4C). Eight of the ten zinc fingers were targeting the Sp1-binding region (-77 to -46 bp), and two others targeted the TATA box or downstream region (+37 to +66 bp) of the transcription start p"
https://openalex.org/W2107103558,"In microvillar photoreceptors the pivotal role of phospholipase C in light transduction is undisputed, but previous attempts to account for the photoresponse solely in terms of downstream products of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis have proved wanting. In other systems PIP2 has been shown to possess signaling functions of its own, rather than simply serving as a precursor molecule. Because illumination of microvillar photoreceptors cells leads to PIP2 break-down, a potential role for this phospholipid in phototransduction would be to help maintain some element(s) of the transduction cascade in the inactive state. We tested the effect of intracellular dialysis of PIP2 on voltage-clamped molluscan photoreceptors and found a marked reduction in the amplitude of the photocurrent; by contrast, depolarization-activated calcium and potassium currents were unaffected, thus supporting the notion of a specific effect on light signaling. In the dark, PIP2 caused a gradual outward shift of the holding current; this change was due to a decrease in membrane conductance and may reflect the suppression of basal openings of the light-sensitive conductance. The consequences of depleting PIP2 were examined in patches of light-sensitive microvillar membrane screened for the exclusive presence of light-activated ion channels. After excision, superfusion with anti-PIP2 antibodies induced the appearance of single-channel currents. Replenishment of PIP2 by exogenous application reverted the effect.

In microvillar invertebrate photoreceptors the key enzymatic step for light transduction is a light-regulated phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; TRPL, transient receptor potential-like. 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; TRPL, transient receptor potential-like. that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). A pivotal clue was the isolation of a blind Drosophila mutant, norpA (1Pak W.L. Grossfield J. White N.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the demonstration that this gene encodes a PLC-β expressed in the retina (2Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as messengers in photoexcitation, a number of shortcomings have become evident. (i) Buffering intracellular calcium attenuates and slows down the photocurrent but does not abolish it (9Bolsover S.R. Brown J.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 364: 381-393Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Lisman J.E. Brown J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). (ii) Low molecular weight heparin, an inhibitor of the IP3 receptor, does not depress the plateau of the photoresponse (14Frank T.M. Fein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 697-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Faddis M.N. Brown J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 909-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). (iii) In some species, such as Balanus and Drosophila, removal of extracellular calcium virtually abolishes the light-evoked Δ[Ca2+]i (increase in intracellular calcium) (16Brown J.E. Blinks J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 64: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Ranganathan R. Bacskai B.J. Tsien R.Y. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 837-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting it is solely the consequence of the opening of light-activated channels, which are calcium-permeable (Refs. 18Brown H.M. Hagiwara S. Koike H. Meech R.W. Fed. Proc. 1971; 30: 69-78PubMed Google Scholar and 19Hardie R.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

(iv) A null mutation of the IP3 receptor does not adversely affect the light response (21Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Raghu P. Colley N.J. Webel R. James T. Hasan G. Danin M Selinger Z. Hardie R.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings argue against IP3 and calcium release being indispensable for visual excitation and prompted a search for alternative signaling molecules. The potential role of diacylglycerol (DAG), the other messenger generated by PIP2 hydrolysis, has recently emerged; in Lima microvillar photoreceptors DAG analogs elicit a robust inward current, the properties of which resemble those of the photocurrent or a component thereof (23Gomez M. Nasi E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5253-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DAG can in turn be metabolized by DAG lipase, releasing fatty acids and glycerol, and in Drosophila photoreceptors polyunsaturated fatty acids can activate a current that shares significant features with the photocurrent (24Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar); heterologously expressed TRPL channels (believed to underlie a component of the light-dependent conductance) were also responsive to the same agents. However, the generality of the involvement of polyunsaturated fatty acids is unclear, as the results could not be confirmed in Limulus (25Fein A. Cavar S. Visual Neurosci. 2000; 17: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Despite the tantalizing evidence for DAG and/or its down-stream products in visual transduction and the synergistic role of calcium, in no instance has application of such chemical stimuli fully reproduced the remarkable size and speed of the photocurrent. This may imply that yet another signal may be missing from the proposed schemes. In other systems PIP2 has been shown to possess signaling functions of its own, independent from those of its hydrolysis products. The seminal observation concerns PIP2 requirements of kinase-mediated desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (26Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premonst R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

For a group of channels PIP2 acts as a co-agonist; these include members of the inward rectifier family, such as ATP-inhibited potassium channels (28Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B.

A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the same behavior is exhibited by sodium-activated cationic channels in lobster olfactory neurons (33Zhainazarov A.B. Ache B.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by retinal cGMP-gated channels (34Womack K.B. Gordon S.E. He F. Wensel T. Lu C.-C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 2792-2799Crossref Google Scholar). Other channels, by contrast, are inhibited by PIP2; interestingly, these are all related to the PLC cascade, such as neuronal IP3 receptors (35Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), calcium release-activated channels (which mediate calcium influx following depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum) (36Kaznacheyeva E. Zubov A. Nikolaev A. Alexeenko V. Bezprozvanny I. Mozhayeva G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4561-4564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and heterologously expressed TRPL channels of Drosophila photoreceptors (37Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These observations prompted the conjecture that in microvillar photoreceptors PIP2 may help keep the channels closed and its hydrolysis could promote their opening. In the present report, we examined the consequences of manipulating PIP2 on membrane currents and light responsiveness in isolated photoreceptors from Pecten and Lima. Our results are consistent with the participation of PIP2 as a negative messenger for visual excitation, targeting at least in part the light-dependent conductance. Initial aspects of this study were presented in preliminary form (38Gomez M. Nasi E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (abstr.): 606aAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Dissociation Procedures—Complete eyecups of Lima scabra (Carolina Biological, Burlington, NC) were dissected under dim red light (λ > 650 nm), incubated in 0.6% collagenase (Worthington type II) and 0.4% trypsin (Sigma type III) for 40 min at 24 °C, washed in 3% fetal calf serum, and gently triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette, as described previously (39Nasi E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Retinas of Pecten irradians, obtained from the Aquatic Resources Center at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA), were dissociated after incubation in Pronase (Roche Applied Science, 850 p.u.k./ml) for 40–50 min at 22 °C (40Nasi E. Gomez M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 747-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After plating, the recording flow chamber was continuously superfused with artificial seawater containing 480 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 49 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.8 (NaOH).Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch pipettes were fabricated from thin wall borosilicate glass (Garner Glass 7052, outer diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 1.1 mm), fire-polished, and filled with an intracellular solution containing 100 mm KCl, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 12 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 300 mm Sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm GTP, pH 7.3 (KOH). To block potassium channels, cesium replaced potassium on an equimolar basis. Electrode resistance measured in artificial seawater was 2–4 megohms; series resistance was routinely compensated (maximum residual error <2 mV). For single channel recording thick wall glass capillaries (outer diameter 1.5 mm, inner diameter 0.75 mm) were pulled to a resistance of 10–15 MΩ (measured in symmetrical artificial seawater). All of the recordings were made at room temperature (20–22 °C).Calcium Measurements—Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ were monitored with the fluorescent indicator Oregon Green 2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The octapotassium salt of the probe was dissolved in the intracellular solution filling the patch electrode, at a concentration of 65–100 μm. Excitation light was provided by a 75-watt xenon arc lamp (PTI, South Brunswick, NJ) filtered by a dichroic reflector to reject wavelengths longer than 670 nm (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and by an interference filter (480 nm, 40 nm bandwidth; Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). The beam was brought to the epi-illumination port of the microscope via a liquid light-guide (Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT); the dichroic reflector in the microscope turret had a cutoff wave-length of 505 nm. Emission light collected by a ×100, 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Nikon) was filtered sequentially by an additional dichroic to reject λ > 610 nm and by a 535-nm interference filter, 50-nm bandwidth (all supplied by Chroma). An adjustable rectangular mask (Nikon) located at a conjugated image plane was positioned under infrared visualization to restrict the collection of fluorescence emission to the region of interest. The fluorescence signal was detected by a photomultiplier tube (model R4220 PHA, Hammamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) operated at 800 V in photon-counting mode, using a window discriminator and a rate meter (models F-100T and PRM-100, Advanced Research Instruments, Boulder, CO). An analog voltage proportional to the counts accumulated in bins of programmable duration (typically, 10–5 s) was fed to the analog to digital interface of the computer.Chemical Stimulation—For local superfusion, a dual puffer pipette (tip diameter ≈2–3 μm) was lowered automatically to a pre-set position near the target cell (≈30–50 μm) by a programmable positioner (Patchman, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany); test solutions were ejected by applying pressurized nitrogen under the control of a solenoid-activated valve. For intracellular dialysis, substances were added to the electrode-filling solution from freshly made stocks and perfused via patch pipette, sealed onto the somatic lobe of the cell in the whole-cell configuration. With a variety of small molecules, ranging from inorganic ions to fluorescent dyes, we have previously shown that the cytosol of the light-sensitive microvillar lobe fully equilibrates with the internal solution within 2–3 min (23Gomez M.

Brain PIP2 (99.5% purity by high pressure liquid chromatography) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), dissolved in chloroform, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. For each experiment, an aliquot was extensively dried under nitrogen and the lipid sonicated in buffer solution. The final “concentration” used was in the range of 10–50 μm, which compares favorably with the effective concentration range reported for a variety of PIP2-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor kinases (26Pitcher J.A.

Anti-PIP2 antibodies produced by PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) and distributed through Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI) were used at a dilution of 1:200 in intracellular solution.Light Stimulation—The optical stimulator consisted of a 100-watt tungsten-halogen light source (Oriel, Stratford, CT), the beam of which was passed through a heat-absorbing filter (>95% rejection for λ > 800 nm). A solenoid-driven shutter (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY) and calibrated neutral density filters (Melles Griot, Irvine, CA) were used to control the duration and intensity of stimulation. A pinhole and a field lens restricted the illuminated region to a focused spot on the chamber (≈150 μm). A beam splitter above the microscope condenser combined this beam with that of the microscope illuminator. The intensity of stimulating light was measured with a radiometer (UDT, Hawthorne, CA) and is expressed either as log10 attenuation or as the equivalent flux of effective photons at 500 nm. During experimental manipulations the cells were illuminated with near infrared light using a long pass filter (λ > 780 nm; Andover Corp., Salem, NH) and viewed with the aid of a TV camera (Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ). The infrared illuminator was turned off for 3–4 min before testing light responses.RESULTSWe first determined whether PIP2 altered the basal membrane conductance in voltage-clamped Lima microvillar photoreceptors. For this purpose a freshly sonicated stock of PIP2 was added to the standard intracellular solution used to fill the patch electrode. The pipette tip was front-filled with regular internal solution to forestall problems with seal formation. As shown in Fig. 1A, 10–15 s after gaining access to the cell interior the holding current gradually shifted in the outward direction; control cells displayed a stable holding current. The effect was concentration-dependent as shown in the bar graph in Fig. 1B; with 10 μm PIP2 in the pipette the current stabilized at a mean value (±S.E.) of 180 ± 112 pA (n = 3). Increasing PIP2 to 50 μm augmented the average change in holding current to 329 ± 117 pA (n = 6). In control cells the current drifted by an average of 13 ± 7 pA (n = 7). To monitor the changes in membrane resistance that accompanied such a shift in holding current, a repetitive rectangular command step (4–10 mV in amplitude, 10 Hz) was superimposed on the –50 mV holding potential. As shown in Fig. 1C, the current steps induced by the perturbations in the command voltage progressively decreased in amplitude, indicating that the slow shift in membrane current was due to a decrease in membrane conductance. No changes in input resistance were detectable in control cells (n = 3). Fig. 1D shows that, on average, gm (membrane conductance) was reduced ≈3.6-fold, from 8.4 nanosiemens to 1.7 nanosiemens with 50 μm PIP2 (n = 4), whereas the effect was more modest with 10 μm (≈1.9-fold, n = 2).Because light-dependent activation of a PLC is recognized as a necessary step in visual excitation of microvillar photoreceptors, it follows that if PIP2 does function as a signal for the photoresponse, it has to be a negative one, i.e. it needs to antagonize the excitatory process. We examined the effect of dialyzing PIP2 into Lima photoreceptors on the light response. The top trace of Fig. 2A is the current evoked by a half-saturating light stimulus applied to a cell internally perfused with 50 μm PIP2; light responsiveness was substantially reduced, compared with a control cell (bottom trace). The bar graph in Fig. 2B compares the average saturating amplitude of the photocurrent measured in the two conditions, pooling different cells (n = 5 and 11, respectively). The reduction in the size of the light response by PIP2 was >80%.Fig. 2The light-dependent current is reduced by PIP2.A, membrane current evoked by a 100-ms flash (1.5 × 1011 photons × s–1 × cm–2) in a voltage-clamped Lima microvillar photoreceptor internally perfused with 50 μm PIP2 (top trace) and in an untreated cell (bottom trace). Holding potential, –50 mV. B, average amplitude of the saturating photocurrent pooled for PIP2-treated and control cells (n = 4 and 11, respectively). Error bars indicate S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observed decrease in membrane conductance in the dark and the reduction in the amplitude of the photocurrent could conceivably occur if dialysis with the PIP2-containing solution caused membrane re-sealing, thus compromising access to the cell interior. However, monitoring the access resistance via the capacitance and series resistance circuitry of the amplifier did not reveal that access to the cell interior suffered any degradation. Alternatively, the observed outcome could reflect a generalized impairment of membrane conductance. To rule out nonspecific effects on ion channels, we examined the consequence of PIP2 application on non-light-dependent currents. Lima microvillar photoreceptors express depolarization-activated calcium and potassium channels (42Nasi E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates a measurement in a cell that was internally perfused with Cesium to block potassium currents and with the fluorescent indicator Oregon Green 2 to monitor calcium changes. The top traces in Fig. 3A are the nearly identical calcium inward currents elicited by applying the same voltage step twice, from –60 to 0 mV. The bottom traces in Fig. 3A are the corresponding fluorescence measurements restricted to a small optical window (3 × 3 μm) that was positioned either on the light-sensitive microvillar lobe or on the soma. The voltage-dependent calcium channels are primarily found in the microvillar region, as indicated by the larger amplitude and the more rapid rise of the fluorescence change. Pooled data are shown in the bar graph in Fig. 3B (n = 5). Potassium channels, by contrast, seem more widely distributed throughout the cell, as gauged by recordings of single channel currents from either cellular region (data not shown). Fig. 3C shows voltage-dependent calcium and potassium currents measured in the dark either in control conditions (namely, with standard intracellular solution) or with PIP2. Administration of depolarizing steps of increasing amplitude from a holding potential of –60 mV (after the effects of PIP2 dialysis stabilized) elicited a calcium inward current that was not different from control cells either in mean amplitude (peak 237 ± 95 pA, n = 4 versus 180 ± 28 pA, n = 11) or in time course. Likewise, the outward potassium current retained its normal amplitude (990 ± 87 pA at +20 mV, n = 4) compared with untreated cells (1155 ± 218 pA, n = 11). These data are summarized in the bar graph in Fig. 3D. Because no effects were observed either on calcium channels, which colocalize with the light-sensitive conductance, or on potassium channels, which also express in the soma (and hence are even less liable to accessibility problems), it appears that PIP2 selectively targets the light transduction pathway.Fig. 3Voltage-dependent currents are not affected by PIP2.A and B, demonstration that depolarization-activated calcium channels are confined to the light-sensitive microvillar lobe (M). A photoreceptor was internally perfused with 300 mm Cesium and 83 μm Oregon Green 2, a fluorescent calcium indicator. Repetitive membrane depolarization from a holding potential of –60 to 0 mV reproducibly elicited an isolated calcium current (top traces); simultaneously, a calcium fluorescence signal was monitored either from the microvillar lobe or from the cell body by displacing an optical mask with a 3 × 3-μm window. The average amplitude of the calcium transient measured in the two regions is shown in B (n = 5). Vm, membrane voltage; cps, counts per second; S, soma.

A critical test of this proposition entails assessing the consequence of decreasing functional PIP2 in the membrane; the working hypothesis predicts that such manipulation should either directly activate or synergistically facilitate the light-dependent conductance. In principle, two alternative strategies are available for this purpose. The obvious one, which parallels the physiological situation, would be to hydrolyze PIP2 by exogenous application of a PLC. Unfortunately, this approach suffers from two shortcomings. First, phospholipases that are commercially available are either nonselective and target a variety of phospholipids or, like the phosphoinositide-specific bacterial PLC, are not effective on multiply phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol. Second, even if a suitable (and constitutively active) PLC-β were readily available, a more insidious issue is that such stimulation would inevitably be accompanied by the production of DAG and IP3, thus confounding the effects of PIP2 reduction with those due to the generation of its downstream messengers.An alternative strategy is to use antibodies raised against PIP2, which have been found to be functional in a number of studies cited previously (31Huang C-L.

The kese values for the plastocyanins from spinach, Dryopteris crassirhizoma (a fern), and the green alga Ulva pertusa, which possess acidic patches of varying size and locations, increase 190-, 29-, and 21-fold, respectively, at elevated ionic strength (I = 2.03 m). In contrast, the kese for the almost neutral cyanobacterial plastocyanin from Anabaena variabilis exhibits very little dependence on ionic strength. The temperature dependence of the kese for spinach plastocyanin (I = 0.28 m) provides evidence for poor packing at the homodimer interface. Representative structures of the transient homodimers involved in electron self-exchange, which are consistent with fits of the ionic strength dependence of kese to van Leeuwen theory, have been obtained from protein modeling and docking simulations. The Coulombic energy of the docked homodimers follows the order spinach > D. crassirhizoma > U. pertusa > A. variabilis, which matches that of the overall influence of ionic strength on kese. Analysis of the homodimer structures indicates that poor packing and high planarity are features of the interface that favor transient interactions. The physiologically relevant Mg2+ ion has a much more pronounced influence on the kese of spinach plastocyanin, which along with the known properties of the thylakoid lumen suggests a biological role for electron self-exchange.

Protein-protein interactions are vital to cellular function and recent studies have revealed the complexity of protein interaction networks (1Gavin A.C. Superti-Furga G. Curr. Opin. Chem.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). However, given their low affinity, such complexes tend to be overlooked by high-throughput proteomics. The structural features of protein-protein interfaces that enable transient interactions are not well understood, although poor geometric complementarity seems to be a prerequisite (4Nooren I.M.A. Thornton J.M.

Carrondo M.A. Proteins. 2004; 55: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Electron self-exchange (ESE) is a simple reaction exhibited by redox proteins that provides a measure of their ET capabilities. An essential step in ESE is homodimer formation giving rise to transient protein interactions on the submillisecond time scale. To investigate the features of transient protein-protein interactions involved in ET we have studied the influence of ionic strength on the ESE reactivity of a single family of redox metalloproteins. For this purpose we have chosen the plastocyanins (PCus), which are cupredoxins involved in photosynthetic ET, as their surface features vary considerably depending upon the organism from which the protein is obtained, yet their active site structures are almost identical (8Sato K. Kohzuma T. Dennison C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plastocyanin is one of the best structurally characterized ET metalloproteins and possesses a β-barrel structure with the type 1 copper ion buried ∼6 Å beneath the protein surface (Fig. 1A) (9Colman P.M.

We also investigate the influence of the physiologically relevant Mg2+ ion and temperature on the ESE reactivity of spinach PCu, the most highly charged protein studied. Protein modeling and docking simulations have been used to obtain representative structures of the transient homodimers formed. These models highlight the features of the protein-protein interface that enable transient interactions. Protein Samples—The spinach PCu gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli TG1 and the protein was isolated and purified as described previously (8Sato K. Kohzuma T. Dennison C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2101-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PCu from A. variabilis was isolated and purified according to a published method (22Dennison C. Kyritsis P. McFarlane W.

Samples with a total protein concentration of 1.0–2.5 mm were used for ESE rate constant measurements and were typically prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH* 8.0 (99.9% D2O), containing the required concentrations of NaCl or MgCl2. The pH* (pH uncorrected for the deuterium isotope effect) of the buffer was adjusted prior to the addition of salt. The U. pertusa PCu sample with an ionic strength of 0.10 m was prepared in 35 mm phosphate buffer, pH* 8.0. The ESE rate constant of A. variabilis PCu was measured in 73 mm phosphate buffer (99.9% D2O), pH* 6.2 (I = 0.10 m), and in 10 mm phosphate buffer (99.9% D2O), pH* 6.2, plus the appropriate amount of NaCl. The concentration of oxidized protein [PCuII] in the ESE samples was determined as described previously (8Sato K. Kohzuma T. Dennison C. J. Am. Chem.

Constraints were applied to the Cδ2, Cϵ1, and Nϵ2 atoms of the exposed His ligand such that homodimers involving these atoms were scored more favorably during the geometric matching step. The desolvation and electrostatic energies were independently calculated for each orientation and 2000 structures with the lowest desolvation free energies (500) and the lowest electrostatic energies (1500) were retained. A symmetric docking protocol was then implemented, which retains only those structures having 2-fold symmetry. These solutions were then subjected to a pair-wise, hierarchical clustering process, in which docking orientations were ranked according to those having the highest number of neighbors within a cluster radius of ≤9 Å Cα root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.). To remove side chain clashes a van der Waals energy minimization of the docked structures was performed in CHARMM (28Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J.

Coulombic electrostatic energies were calculated for formal charges only, as assigned in GRASP (33Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). In addition, the thiol group of the copper-coordinating Cys residue was given a charge of -1, whereas the copper ions were assigned as CuI and CuII. The calculation was implemented between all charges on each of the monomers using a dielectric constant of 80. Ionic Strength Dependence of the ESE Rate Constant—The influence of increasing [PCuII] and ionic strength (using NaCl) on the inversion recovery experiments of spinach PCuI is demonstrated in Supplemental Materials Fig. S1. Plots of T1-1 against [PCuII] for His resonances in spinach, D. crassirhizoma, U. pertusa, and A. variabilis PCuI at various ionic strengths (NaCl) are shown in Supplemental Materials Figs. S2–S5, respectively. The ESE rate constants (kese), obtained from the average of k1 values (which are less prone to errors than k2 values) of at least two resonances, are plotted as a function of ionic strength in Fig. 2A and the low and high ionic strength values are summarized in Table I. At the lowest ionic strength (I = 0.03 m) the ESE of spinach PCu is extremely slow (kese = 4.8 × 102m-1 s-1). As the ionic strength is raised, the kese increases and at I = 2.03 m, the value of 9.1 × 104m-1 s-1 is 190-fold larger. Similar trends for the ionic strength dependence of kese are observed for D. crassirhizoma and U. pertusa PCus (see Fig. 2A), both of which exhibit significantly larger kese values than spinach PCu at low I (Table I). The overall accelerating effect of increasing ionic strength on kese is 29- and 21-fold for D. crassirhizoma and U. pertusa PCus, respectively. In contrast to the other PCus, the kese for the A. variabilis protein exhibits very little dependence on ionic strength (see Table I and Fig. 2A).Table IElectron self-exchange rate constants of the PCusPlastocyaninNet chargeaNet charge as calculated for the reduced protein (PCuI) at neutral pHkese × 104kinfbkinf obtained from fits of the ionic strength dependence of kese to van Leeuwen theory (35) (see Fig. 2B) × 104Low IHigh Im–1 s–1m–1 s–1Spinach–90.048cI = 0.03 m9.1dI = 2.03 m15U. pertusa–71.7cI = 0.03 m35dI = 2.03 m49D. crassirhizoma–70.12cI = 0.03 m3.5dI = 2.03 m7.3A. variabilis+117eI = 0.01 m34fI = 2.01 m53a Net charge as calculated for the reduced protein (PCuI) at neutral pHb kinf obtained from fits of the ionic strength dependence of kese to van Leeuwen theory (35van Leeuwen J.W.

The symbols q, kB, ϵ0, ϵ, and T are the elementary charge (1.6 × 10-19 C), Boltzmann's constant (1.3807 × 10-23 JK-1), the permittivity constant (8.85418 × 10-12 C2N-1 m-2), the static dielectric constant (80) and the absolute temperature, respectively. Knowing the charges and radii of PCuII and PCuI the experimental data can be fit (see Fig. 2B) to give D′ox, D′red, and kinf values of -141 D, -159 D, and 1.5 × 105 m-1 s-1, respectively, for spinach PCu. Fitting of the data for the other proteins is less precise because of the limited number of data points, but the kinf values are informative (see Table I). The influence of increasing concentrations of the physiologically relevant Mg2+ cation on the ESE rate constant of spinach PCu has also been investigated. Plots of T1-1 against [PCuII] for the His87 Cϵ1H resonance of spinach PCuI at different MgCl2 concentrations are shown in Supplemental Materials Fig. S6 and the kese values are compared with those in which the ionic strength was altered by the addition of NaCl in Fig. 2A. The kese increases 133-fold from 4.8 × 102 m-1 s-1 at I = 0.03 m (10 mm phosphate) to 6.4 × 104 m-1 s-1 at I = 1.91 m (10 mm phosphate plus 0.63 m MgCl2). To obtain further information about the interactions involved in homodimer formation the temperature dependence of the ESE reactivity of spinach PCu has been studied at I = 0.28 m. Plots of T1-1 against [PCuII] for the His87 Cϵ1H resonance of spinach PCuI at different temperatures are shown in Supplemental Materials Fig. S7. Under these conditions kese increases from 5.8 × 103 m-1 s-1 at 10 °C to 6.0 × 104 m-1 s-1 at 48 °C. The data were fit (see Fig. 3) to the Eyring Equation (see Equation 5), which provides the activation parameters for this reaction.kese=(kBT/h)exp(−ΔH‡/RT+ΔS‡/R)eq.5 In Equation 5, h is Planck's constant, R is the gas constant, ΔH‡ is the activation enthalpy, and ΔS‡ is the activation entropy. Values of ΔH‡ = 44 kJ mol-1 and ΔS‡ = -16 J mol-1 K-1 are obtained for the ESE reaction of spinach PCu (giving a ΔG‡ of 49 kJ mol-1 at 298 K).

Sci. 1998; 23: 358-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) provides co-ordinates of likely quaternary states for protein structures determined by x-ray crystallography. Among the cupredoxins, azurin frequently crystallizes as a dimer or as a tetramer, in which the interfaces are formed between the hydrophobic patches of adjacent monomers (37Nar H. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. van de Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Auracyanin, an azurin-like protein, forms similar crystallographic dimers (38Bond C.S. Blankenship R.E. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Maher M.J. Selvaraj F.M. Wilce M.C.J. Willingham K.M. J. Mol.

A survey of the PCu structures in the Protein Quaternary Structure data base reveals several that contain two or more molecules in the asymmetric unit. The S. pratensis (24Sugawara H. Inoue T. Li C. Gotowda M. Hibino T. Takabe T. Kai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) protein is of particular interest because it forms a crystallographic dimer similar to those found in azurin, auracyanin, rusticyanin, and amicyanin (Table II lists the features of the interfaces in these dimers). A Cu-Cu distance of 14 Å, compatible with fast ET, is observed in the S. pratensis PCu dimer. There is a small contact area involved in dimer formation and the orientation of the monomers minimizes repulsion between the acidic patches (see Fig. 4), resulting in a Coulombic electrostatic energy of ∼50 kJ mol-1.Table IIInterface properties of cupredoxin crystal dimers and PCu dimer modelsProteinPDB codeSizeaThe area of the monomer surface that becomes solvent inaccessible in the homodimerfNPbFraction of the interface composed of non-polar (carbon) atomsPackingPlanarityeDefined as the r.m.s.d. of interface atoms (in Å) from the best-fit plane through the interfaceECoulombDCu-CuBridging groupsfHydrogen bond mediators between the exposed His ligandsGVcThe gap volume (GV) index (32) is a measure of geometric complementarity in the interfaceSCdAn alternative indication of packing given by the shape complementarity (SC) (33)Å2r.m.s.d.kJ mol–1ÅCrystal dimersAzurin1e5z5400.782.10.671.23152 × H2OAuracyanin1qhq5000.642.90.591.1714Cl–Rusticyanin1gy23000.735.20.771.02152 × H2OAmicyanin1sfd3100.813.70.661.0511S. pratensis PCu1byo3200.683.10.550.84814PCu dimer modelsSpinachNAgNA, not applicable2900.753.20.390.74714NAU. pertusaNA2800.663.50.280.81814NAA. variabilisNA3700.692.30.620.9214NAD. crassirhizomaNA4700.632.90.641.35714NAa The area of the monomer surface that becomes solvent inaccessible in the homodimerb Fraction of the interface composed of non-polar (carbon) atomsc The gap volume (GV) index (32Lawrence M.C.

The interface properties of these models are summarized in Table II with the overall features for spinach, U. pertusa, and A. variabilis proteins similar to S. pratensis PCu. In all cases, the contact surfaces are small, hydrophobic, and poorly packed, and the interfaces are extremely planar. Notably, the electrostatic energy of the PCu dimers decreases dramatically from spinach to U. pertusa to A. variabilis. In terms of sequence and structure, D. crassirhizoma PCu is the most divergent member of the family (41De Rienzo F. Gabdoulline R.R. Menziani M.C. Wade R.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1439-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The large structural differences around the exposed His ligand in this PCu are reflected in the altered character of its homodimer interface, which is 150 Å2 larger than in the S. pratensis protein. Moreover, the side chains of Glu8, Glu34, Glu68, and Asp69 form directly opposing clusters in the dimer, resulting in unfavorable Coulombic repulsion (Table II). It can be concluded that the D. crassirhizoma PCu homodimer is poorly represented by th"

The process of A-MuLV infection requires cleavage of the R peptide from the envelope protein. This occurs within virions thereby rendering them competent to fuse with target cells. Envelope proteins lacking the inhibitory R peptide (e.g. envelope (R-) proteins) induce viral envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion (syncytium). Here we have performed studies to determine if cell signaling through protein kinases is involved in the regulation of PiT2-mediated A-MuLV envelope (R-)-induced syncytium formation. Truncated A-MuLV retroviral envelope protein lacking the inhibitory R peptide (R-) was used to induce viral envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. Signaling through cyclic AMP to activate PKA was found to inhibit envelope-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas treatment of cells with PKA inhibitors H89, KT5720, and PKA Catα siRNA all enhanced this cell fusion process. It was noted that activation of PKC, as well as overexpression of PKCϵ, up-regulated A-MuLV envelope protein-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas exposure to PKC inhibitors and expression of a kinase-inactive dominant-negative mutant of PKCϵ (K437R) inhibited syncytium formation. v-ras transformed NIH3T3 cells were highly susceptible to A-MuLV envelope-induced cell-cell fusion, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (N17Ras) inhibited this cell fusion process. Importantly, activation of Raf-1 protein kinase also is required for A-MuLV envelope-induced syncytium formation. Expression of constitutively active BXB Raf supported, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Raf-1 (Raf301) blocked, A-MuLV-induced cell-cell fusion. These results indicate that specific cell signaling components are involved in regulating PiT2-mediated A-MuLV-induced cell-cell fusion.

Selective pharmacological modulation of these signaling components may be an effective means of altering cell susceptibility to viral-mediated cytopathic effects. Retrovirus entry into cells is initiated by the binding of virus envelope glycoproteins to specific cell surface receptors. This is followed by fusion of the viral membrane with the receptor-bearing cellular plasma membrane, which allows the viral core to be released into the cell (1Marsh M. Helenius A. Adv. Virus Res. 1989; 36: 107-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Retrovirus infection also can result in virus-induced cell-cell fusion to form multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) (2Jones J.S. Risser R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wilson C.A. Marsh J.W. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7262-7269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syncytium formation is dependent on the interactions between viral envelope protein on the surface of infected cells and virus receptors on the surface of uninfected cells (4Coffin J. Fields B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Third Ed. Field's Virology. 2. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1996: 1767-1848Google Scholar). Syncytium formation is an important consequence of virus infection. Yet, the cellular regulatory mechanisms that allow retrovirus-mediated cell-cell fusion, including activation or inhibition of cellular signal transduction pathways, remain to be elucidated. Several studies have suggested that cellular signal transduction pathways and associated protein kinases could be involved in regulating both retrovirus infection and virus-induced cell-cell fusion.

Other studies have suggested that fusion regulatory proteins (FRPs) and protein kinases regulate HIV gp160 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion (7Tsurudome M. Ito Y. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 167-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger that activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), also has been implicated in the regulation of HIV infection and virus-induced cell-cell fusion by up-regulating HIV-1 co-receptor CXCR4 expression (8Cole S.W. Jamieson B.D. Zack J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1392-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cristillo A.D. Highbarger H.C. Dewar R.L. Dimitrov D.S. Golding H. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cell surface receptors for amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) have been demonstrated to serve as sodium-dependent phosphate (Na+/Pi) transporters in a variety of cells. Based on their structural and functional characteristics, these molecules, together with the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) receptor, were classified as type III Na+/Pi transporters and were designated as PiT2 and PiT1, respectively (for review, see Ref. 10Overbaugh J. Miller A.D. Eiden M.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both the PiT1 and PiT2 phosphate transporter and virus receptor activities are altered in response to changes in extracellular inorganic phosphate concentrations (11Chien M.L. Foster J.L. Douglas J.L. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4564-4570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chien M.L. O'Neill E. Garcia J.V.

A. 1994; 91: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In studies carried out in CHO cells, the levels of PiT2 at the cell surface remained unchanged following variations of the phosphate supply, whereas changes in the efficiency of PiT2-mediated phosphate and virus entry occurred within minutes in response to changes in extracellular phosphate concentration (14Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Salaun et al. (15Salaun C. Gyan E. Rodrigues P. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4304-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that changes in extracellular phosphate concentration appear to switch PiT2 assemblies at the cell surface between compact and relaxed configurations, and that it is the compact arrangement that is required for enhanced PiT2 activities. These results indicated that PiT2 activities may be regulated by un-specified post-translational modifications of the cell surface PiT2 proteins, and that these modifications are required for activation of phosphate transporter and retrovirus receptor functions. In earlier studies we reported that activation of PKC by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced, whereas activation of PKA inhibited, Na+/Pi uptake (16Olah Z. Lehel C.

In more recent studies, it was established that PMA treatment of cells enhances Na+/Pi uptake via stimulation of PiT2, and that this effect is specifically mediated through PMA activation of PKCϵ (17Jobbagy Z. Olah Z. Petrovics G. Eiden M.V. Leverett B.D. Dean N.M. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if changes in protein kinase activities also can modulate PiT2 viral receptor function. GALV and A-MuLV are closely related γ-retroviruses. Their envelope proteins are composed of a surface (SU) subunit and a transmembrane (TM) subunit that are cleaved by a host protease from a common precursor protein (18Pinter A. Fleissner E. J. Virol. 1979; 30: 157-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that SU is the subunit responsible for binding to the cell surface receptor whereas the TM subunit contributes to the fusion process. The R peptide, the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic tail of TM polypeptide, is further cleaved by a viral protease. After binding of SU to the viral receptor, TM mediates fusion of virion and host membranes. However, R peptide acts to inhibit fusion until it is cleaved from the C terminus of TM (19Ragheb J.A. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rein A. Mirro J. Haynes J.G. Ernst S.M. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated retroviral envelope proteins not bearing R peptides (R-) and expressed in appropriate cells induce syncytium formation (19Ragheb J.A. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rein A. Mirro J. Haynes J.G. Ernst S.M. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have expressed truncated A-MuLV and GALV envelope proteins (R-) in certain cell lines to determine if signal transduction pathways and the modulation of specific protein kinase activities can act to regulate PiT1 and PiT2 receptor function and modulate A-MuLV and GALV envelope-induced cell-cell fusion. It was found that activation of PKCϵ is required for A-MuLV-, but not GALV-, induced syncytium formation, whereas cell signaling through cyclic AMP to activate PKA inhibited the A-MuLV-induced fusion process. Further, activation of Raf protein kinase also is required for A-MuLV-induced syncytium formation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and the PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity PCR kit were purchased from Invitrogen. PMA, rottlerin, Gö6976, GF109203X, PD98059, SB202190, 8-Br-cAMP, KT5720, forskolin, and H89 were from Calbiochem. The PKA Catα siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The pCAETR plasmid coding for the A-MuLV envelope protein (R-) (not bearing R peptide) was a gift from Dr. Jack A. Ragheb (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Plasmids coding N17Ras, Raf301, and ERK185 were kindly provided by Dr. Toren Finkel (National Institutes of Health) with Dr. Silvio Gutkind's (National Institutes of Health) permission. The pCIGALV plasmid carrying the GALV envelope cDNA, pLNHA.PiT1 encoding an HA tagged PiT1, pcDNAMoMLV gag-pol, and pCI4070A encoding the A-MuLV envelope protein (21Farrell K.B. Ting Y.T. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were used in this study. Polyfect transfection reagent is a product of Qiagen (Valencia, CA). pCI-neo vector and pGEM-T easy vector were from Promega (Madison, WI). The BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. The PiT2-specific rabbit antiserum was produced in our laboratory as described previously (22Jobbagy Z. Garfield S. Baptiste L. Eiden M.V. Anderson W.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A-MuLV pig antiserum (lot no. 77S000445) was obtained from the NCI/BCB Reagents Repository (Camden, NJ). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (AC-15), horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-FLAG, and anti-HA tag monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PKAα catalytic subunit, anti-Raf-1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAP kinase antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal Pan-Ras antibody (Ab-3) was purchased from Calbiochem. Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit and anti-swine Igs were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The ϵMTH vector contains a zinc-inducible promoter (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, cells transfected utilizing the ϵMTH vector were incubated in the presence and absence of 75 μm zinc acetate to further induce synthesis of the indicated recombinant proteins. Because of significant constitutive expression of the encoded recombinant proteins in the absence of zinc in NIH3T3 cells, similar results were obtained in studies carried out without zinc induction. (i)Primers—PCR primers used were as follows: 1) AATTCACGCGTGGTACCTCTAGAAG; 2) TTTCTGCGGCCGCTAGATCTACAGAATTTTAACTGCAC; 3) AGACAGGATATCAGTGGTCC; 4) TTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG.Recognition sites for restriction endonucleases used for cloning are underlined. Primer pairs 1–2 were used to produce GALVTR that encodes truncated GALV envelope protein (R-) (not bearing R peptide). Primer pairs 3–4 were used to amplify 3′-untranslated and poly(A) in pCAETR.(ii)pCIGALVTR Construct—pCIGALV DNA (21Farrell K.B. Ting Y.T. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used as template to produce the high fidelity PCR fragment GALVTR using primer pairs 1–2. The purified product GALVTR was cloned into the pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) easy vector. GALVTR then was cut out with XbaI-NotI and ligated into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) cut with XbaI-NotI to form new plasmid pCIGALVTR-a. To create pCIGALVTR that has the same 3′-UTR and poly(A) as pCAETR, high fidelity PCR product from plasmid pCAETR was produced using primer pairs 3–4, then cut with BglII-NotI and inserted into the BglII-NotI site of pCIGALVTR-a to form pCIGALVTR. The validity of the pCIGALVTR construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. (i)Primers—PCR primers used were as follows: 1) 5′-SalI primer, GAGGTCGACATGGCCATGGATGAGTATTTGTGG; 2) 3′-FLAG primer, CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTACATGGATTTTGTGCAAC; 3) 5′-FLAG primer, TACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTTAAAGGCCCTGAGGAAAAGCTCT; 4) 3′-MluI primer, GTATACGCGTCACATATGGAAGGATCCCATACATG; Recognition sites for restriction endonucleases used for cloning are underlined; overlapping sequences are italicized.(ii)pϵMTH.EAR.FLAG Construct—Insertion of the FLAG epitope tag into the cytoplasmic loop of hamster PiT2 was accomplished in two steps by overlapping PCR using primer pairs 1–2 and 3–4 in the first rounds of PCRs. The products of these reactions then were purified, annealed, and used as template for a final PCR using primers 1 and 4. The purified product was cut with SalI-MluI and ligated into the pϵMTH vector cut with XhoI-MluI. The NIH3T3 Cl-7 cell line and the v-Ha-ras and v-Ki-ras transformed NIH3T3 cells were kindly provided by Drs. J. DeClue and D. Lowy (National Institutes of Health). NIH3T3/hamster PiT2.FLAG and NMU34m/hamster PiT2.FLAG cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged hamster PiT2 were constructed using the pϵMTH.EAR.FLAG construct described above, and were generated as described previously (17Jobbagy Z.

The PKCα-, PKCβ-, PKCδ-, and PKCϵ-overexpressing NIH3T3 cell lines were generated as described previously utilizing the ϵMTH vector (17Jobbagy Z. Olah Z. Petrovics G. Eiden M.V. Leverett B.D. Dean N.M. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7067-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NIH3T3/DN-PKCϵ cells overexpressing the kinase-inactive mutant of PKCϵ were constructed by converting lysine 437 within the catalytic domain to an arginine and then cloned into the epitope-tagging vector pϵMTH, as described previously (24Hong D.H. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Forstner J. Forstner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1041-G1047PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3/BXB Raf cells overexpressing the N-terminally truncated, activated Raf-1 were produced by cloning into the pϵMTH vector (25Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Generation of NIH3T3/HA.PiT1 Cell Line—The pCI4070A plasmid encoding the A-MuLV envelope protein was co-transfected along with the pcDNAMoMLV gagpol plasmid and the pLNHA.PiT-1 plasmid encoding HA-tagged PiT1 into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Promega) (21Farrell K.B. Ting Y.T. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Supernatant containing enveloped pseudoretrovirus was harvested at 48 h post-transfection. NIH3T3 cells at about 70% confluency were exposed to retroviral vector containing supernatant that had been passed through a 0.22-μm Millipore (Bedford, MA) filter and then were adjusted to contain 10 μg of polybrene/ml. Thirty-six hours later, the medium was changed, and cell lines stably expressing HA.PiT1 were selected with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) as previously described (21Farrell K.B. Ting Y.T. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PKAα catalytic subunit (PKA Catα) siRNA oligonucleotides (SMARTpool), and Luciferase siRNA oligonucleotides (target sequence 5′-cgtacgcggaatacttcga-3′) from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells with TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Corporation, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 50 nm PKA Catα siRNA and control Luciferase siRNA (final concentration present in the cell culture media). The cell types indicated were transiently transfected with 1.8 μg of the envelope-encoding plasmids pCAETR or pCIGALVTR using Poly-Fect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated on 35-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated overnight to reach about 50% confluency at the time of transfection. The DNA-PolyFect-DMEM mixture (1.8 μg of DNA, 10 μl of PolyFect, and 100 μl of DMEM) was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with 2.5 ml of PBS, and 1.5 ml of cell culture medium was added to the cells. After 10 min of incubation, 600 μl of cell culture medium were added to the DNA-PolyFect-DMEM mixture, and the resulting solution was gently loaded onto the cells. Syncytium formation in 4 random fields was assessed at the indicated time points post-transfection. There were about 1000 cells in the fields. A syncytium with more than 5 nuclei was counted as syncytium formation. The fusion number is expressed as the percentage of N/T (N is the number of nuclei in syncytia, and T is the total number of nuclei in the field). Whole cell lysates, cellular membrane, and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously (22Jobbagy Z. Garfield S. Baptiste L. Eiden M.V. Anderson W.B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2847-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proteins present in cell lysates were separated by precast 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Owl Separation Systems, Portsmouth, NH) electrophoresis, and then electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Immunoreactive proteins were detected with appropriate antibodies as described elsewhere (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transfection of cells with viral envelope protein expression vectors in the absence of other viral proteins has been used successfully to induce extensive cell-cell membrane fusion (2Jones J.S. Risser R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ragheb J.A. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Forestell S.P. Dando J.S. Chen J. de Vries P. Bohnlein E. Rigg R.J. Gene. Ther. 1997; 4: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study we employed pCAETR, an A-MuLV envelope protein (R-) expression vector, and pCIGALTR, a GALV envelope protein (R-) expression vector, to transfect cells and express the indicated envelope protein lacking the R inhibitory peptide as described by Ragheb and Anderson (19Ragheb J.A. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of cell-expressed envelope protein to induce multinuclear syncytium formation is termed fusion-from-within, and was used here as a measure of viral envelope-induced cell-cell fusion. Such syncytium formation also is thought to serve as a model for fusion between viral envelope and the host cell membrane that precedes viral entry. Here, we have used this model system to characterize the cell signaling events that regulate PiT2-dependent A-MuLV envelope-mediated syncytium formation. When the indicated cell lines were transiently transfected with empty vector (no expression of A-MuLV envelope) in the presence and absence of the indicated inhibitors and activators, no syncytium formation was observed under any of the conditions described. The Level of PiT2 Expression Affects A-MuLV Envelope Protein-induced Syncytium Formation—In agreement with the results reported by Ragheb and Anderson (19Ragheb J.A. Anderson W.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3220-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little detectable syncytium formation (<1%) was observed when NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pCAETR to express A-MuLV envelope protein (R-) (Fig. 1, panel A). However, expression of hamster PiT2 in NIH3T3 cells to increase the level of PiT2, the A-MuLV receptor, significantly enhanced the ability of expressed A-MuLV envelope to induce cell fusion (Fig. 1, panel B). To support this finding that the efficiency of A-MuLV envelope-induced syncytium formation was dependent on the level of PiT2 receptor, studies also were carried out with NMU34m cells, a nitrosylmethylurea (NMU)-transformed cell line that like BHK cells lack functional A-MuLV receptors are resistant to A-MuLV infection (27Miller D.G. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again it was observed that numerous and large multinucleated syncytia formed on NMU34m cells expressing hamster PiT2 (panel D), but not on parental NMU34m cells (panel C), with expression of A-MuLV envelope protein (R-). Inhibition of A-MuLV Envelope Protein-induced Syncytium Formation by PKA—Previously, it was established that preincubation of NIH3T3 cells with 8-Br-cAMP to activate PKA resulted in a decrease in Pi uptake (16Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here studies were carried out to determine the possible involvement of cellular PKA activity in the regulation of A-MuLV-induced cell-cell fusion in these cells. The results presented in Fig. 2, panel A, and in Table I, show that treatment of NIH3T3 cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged hamster PiT2 with the PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP inhibited A-MuLV envelope-induced cell-cell fusion. Likewise, exposure of NIH3T3 cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged hamster PiT2 to forskolin to increase intracellular levels of cAMP to activate PKA also decreased A-MuLV envelope-induced syncytium formation (Table I). As noted in Fig. 1, expression of the A-MuLV envelope (R-) in mock control NIH3T3 cells was not capable of inducing syncytium formation.Table IActivation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway inhibited A-MuLV envelope protein (R-)-induced cell-cell fusionCell lineNuclei in syncytiaUntreated8-Br-cAMPForskolinH89KT5720PKA Catα siRNA%NIH3T3 (M)<1<1<115 ± 2.4aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.14 ± 1.6aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.7 ± 1.8aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.NIH3T3/PKCϵ12 ± 1.1bStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to untreated NIH3T3 cells.7 ± 2aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.8 ± 1.5aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.11 ± 2.212 ± 2.3NDcND, not determined.NIH3T3/hamster PiT2.FLAG17 ± 0.2bStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to untreated NIH3T3 cells.11 ± 1.3aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.12 ± 2.4aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.20 ± 1.7aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.19 ± 1.1aStatistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.NDa Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to similar untreated cells.b Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. p < 0.05, compared to untreated NIH3T3 cells.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The reagents H89 and KT5720 both are well established inhibitors of PKA activity. As reported by the supplier (Calbiochem), H89 is a specific inhibitor of PKA (Ki, 50 nm) compared with PKC (Ki, 76 μm). KT5720 also is an effective inhibitor of PKA (Ki, 56 nm), but does not inhibit PKC or PKG. In studies utilizing H89 and KT5720 in the treatment of intact cells in culture, these agents commonly have been used at high concentrations (1–10 μm). However, in a recent report Fu et al. (28Fu M. Rao M. Wu K. Wang C. Zhang X. Hessien M. Yeung Y. Gioeli D. Weber M. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29436-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that treatment of intact cells with only 50 nm H89 for 24 h resulted in significant and specific inhibition of PKA activity. Thus, to significantly enhance the specificity of H89 and KT5720 as selective inhibitors of PKA activity, we used these two PKA inhibitors at a concentration of 100 nm to treat cells for 24–48 h in the present study. Interestingly, treatment of NIH3T3 cells with low concentrations (100 nm) of the PKA inhibitors H89 and KT5720 markedly stimulated cell-cell fusion in response to expression of A-MuLV envelope (R-) (Fig. 2, panel B and Table I). In the presence of either H89 or KT5720, syncytium formation was observed within 12–18 h after the transfection of A-MuLV envelope expression pCAETR (Fig. 2, panel C). Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from these cells showed that treatment with 8-Br-cAMP and with the H89 and KT5720 PKA inhibitors had no effect on the cellular levels of either expressed A-MuLV envelope protein or PiT2 protein (Fig. 2, panel D). To gain additional evidence to support the involvement of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in the regulation of PiT2/A-MuLV envelope protein (R-)-induced cell-cell fusion, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 50 nm PKA Catα siRNA to decrease the intracellular level of the α catalytic subunit of PKA. Four days after transfection of cells with PKA Catα siRNA, these cells were transiently transfected with pCAETR to express the A-MuLV envelope protein (R-). As shown in Fig. 2, panel D, and in"
