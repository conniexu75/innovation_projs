https://openalex.org/W2091670176,"The SNF1 gene plays a central role in carbon catabolite repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely that SNF1 function is required for expression of glucose-repressible genes. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned SNF1 gene was determined, and the predicted amino acid sequence shows that SNF1 encodes a 72,040-dalton polypeptide that has significant homology to the conserved catalytic domain of mammalian protein kinases. Specific antisera were prepared and used to identify the SNF1 protein. The protein was shown to transfer phosphate from adenosine triphosphate to serine and threonine residues in an in vitro autophosphorylation reaction. These findings indicate that SNF1 encodes a protein kinase and suggest that protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulation by carbon catabolite repression in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1637070219,"Glucagon is a pancreatic hormone of 29 amino acids that regulates carbohydrate metabolism and glicentin is an intestinal peptide of 69 amino acids that contains the sequence of glucagon flanked by peptide extensions at the amino and carboxy termini. The glucagon gene encodes a precursor containing glucagon and two additional, structurally related, glucagon-like peptides separated by an intervening peptide. These peptides are encoded in separate exons. To determine whether the pancreatic and intestinal forms of glucagon arise by alternative RNA and/or protein processing, we used antisera to synthetic glucagon-like peptides and exon-specific, complementary oligonucleotides for analyses of proteins and mRNAs in pancreatic and intestinal extracts. Preproglucagon mRNAs are identical, but different and highly specific peptides are liberated in the two tissues. Immunocytochemistry shows colocalization of glucagon and the two glucagon-like peptides in identical cells. We conclude that diversification of preproglucagon gene expression occurs at the level of cell-specific post-translational processing."
https://openalex.org/W2027742586,"The oral administration of peptide drugs is well known to be precluded by their digestion in the stomach and small intestine. As a new approach to oral delivery, peptide drugs were coated with polymers cross-linked with azoaromatic groups to form an impervious film to protect orally administered drugs from digestion in the stomach and small intestine. When the azopolymer-coated drug reached the large intestine, the indigenous microflora reduced the azo bonds, broke the cross-links, and degraded the polymer film, thereby releasing the drug into the lumen of the colon for local action or for absorption. The ability of the azopolymer coating to protect and deliver orally administered peptide drugs was demonstrated in rats with the peptide hormones vasopressin and insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1538826970,"Recently we reported on the presence of two isoforms of heme oxygenase in rat liver microsomes, referred to as HO-1 and HO-2, and that only HO-1 is inducible (Maines, M. D., Trakshel, G. M., and Kutty, R. K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 411-419). Presently we report on the detection of two isoforms of the enzyme in rat testis and purification to near homogeneity of the noninducible isoform, HO-2. A comparative characterization of the liver HO-1 and the testicular HO-2 is also provided. The relative abundance of the isoforms in the two organs was dissimilar. In the testis, the predominant form was HO-2, and only minute amounts of HO-1 were detected. In the liver, however, a 1:2 ratio of HO-1 to HO-2 was noted. The activity of HO-2 in both organs was refractory to cadmium, an inducer of the hepatic HO-1. Under nondenaturing electrophoresis conditions, HO-2 showed a higher mobility than HO-1; on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, HO-2 displayed a higher monomeric Mr. The apparent Mr values for HO-2 and HO-1 were 36,000 and 30,000, respectively. The isoforms differed in immunochemical properties. Antiserum to the liver HO-1 did not recognize the testicular HO-2 when examined by double immunodiffusion or by Western immunoblotting. HO-2 was more sensitive to heat inactivation than HO-1. When exposed at 65 degrees C (10 min), 70% of HO-1 activity was retained; however, nearly 80% of HO-2 activity was lost. The apparent Km values for heme for HO-1 and HO-2 were 0.24 and 0.40 microM, respectively. HO-1 and HO-2 had similar requirements for cofactor and flavoprotein reductase and were inhibited by heme-ligands (CO, KCN, NaN3). HO-2 utilized as substrate, Fe-protoporphyrin, Fe-hematoporphyrin, and Fe-hematoporphyrin acetate; it did not degrade intact purified rat liver cytochromes b5 and P-450 LM2, catalase, cytochrome c, hemoglobin, or myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1536858827,"There is growing evidence that the protein products of the ras gene family, p21ras, can couple growth factor receptors to intracellular second messenger production and in particular to phosphoinositol lipid turnover. So far, however, there has been no direct proof that the ras proteins function as typical regulatory G proteins. We show here that the human p21N-ras protein, isolated from an Escherichia coli expression system, can exist as a stable GDP complex which exchanges very slowly with exogenous GTP, the half-life of the p21N-ras X GDP complex being around 20 min. However, in low Mg2+ (0.5 microM) the exchange rate is dramatically increased and the half-life of the p21N-ras X GDP complex is less than 30 s. Furthermore, in low Mg2+, the relative binding affinity of the protein for GTP as compared to GDP is increased 10-fold. The effect of low Mg2+ on the exchange rate of both normal and oncogenic mutant p21ras molecules is identical. We propose that removal of Mg2+ in vitro induces a similar conformational change to stimulation in vivo. The properties described here are consistent with a G protein-like activity for p21N-ras."
https://openalex.org/W1496759560,"Etioplasts of 5-day-old dark-grown barley seedlings synthesize most of the soluble and membrane proteins found in chloroplasts of illuminated plants. Prominent among these proteins are the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and the alpha- and beta-subunits of the chloroplast ATPase. However, etioplasts do not synthesize four chloroplast-encoded proteins which are major constituents of the chloroplast thylakoid membrane: two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem I (68 and 65 kDa) and two chlorophyll apoproteins of photosystem II (47 and 43 kDa). Pulse-labeling experiments show that the lack of radiolabel accumulation in the chlorophyll apoproteins in etioplasts is due to inhibition of synthesis rather than apoprotein instability. Illumination of 5-day-old dark-grown barley selectively induces synthesis of the plastid-encoded chlorophyll apoproteins and proteins of 32, 23, and 21 kDa. Synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins was significant in plants illuminated for 15 min and was near maximum by 1 h. The induction of photosystem I chlorophyll apoprotein synthesis was not accompanied by an increase in mRNA for these proteins. These results demonstrate that the synthesis of the plastid-encoded photosystem I chlorophyll apoproteins is blocked at the translational level in dark-grown barley. Translation of the chlorophyll apoproteins is induced rapidly by light with a time course which is similar to the light-dependent formation of chlorophyll from protochlorophyllide."
https://openalex.org/W1537286163,"Multiple fibronectin mRNAs arise by alternative splicing of the primary transcript of a single gene. We describe analyses of the contribution of this alternative splicing to fibronectin subunit heterogeneity in three different cell types using antisera directed against specific segments of fibronectin. beta-galactosidase-fibronectin fusion proteins produced with the lambda gt11 bacterial expression vector were used as immunogens. One region of alternative splicing accounts for differences in subunit size, while a second contributes to differences between the fibronectins present in blood plasma and in fibroblastic cells. We also show, however, that these two regions of alternative splicing do not account for all detectable subunits. We have also used these segment-specific antisera to show that blood platelets contain a spectrum of fibronectin subunits distinct from that found in blood plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1605888812,"The mechanism of modulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in isolated rat adipose cells by lipolytic and antilipolytic agents has been examined. We have measured glucose transport activity in intact cells with 3-O-methylglucose and in plasma membranes with D-glucose, and the concentration of glucose transporters in plasma membranes using a cytochalasin B binding assay. In intact cells, isoproterenol reduced insulin-stimulated transport activity by 60%. This effect was lost after cooling and washing the cells with homogenization buffer, and neither the concentration of glucose transporters nor transport activity in the plasma membranes differed from control. However, treatment of cells with KCN prior to homogenization preserved the isoproterenol effect through the fractionation procedure. Plasma membranes from these cells contained an unchanged number of transporters (31 +/- 7, mean +/- S.E., versus 31 +/- 4 pmol/mg of protein in controls) but transported glucose at a reduced rate (19 +/- 6 versus 48 +/- 9 pmol/mg of protein/s). Conversely, incubation of intact cells in the presence of adenosine stimulated plasma membrane glucose transport activity compared to that in the absence of adenosine (44 +/- 6 versus 36 +/- 6 pmol/mg of protein/s). Kinetic studies of isoproterenol-inhibited glucose transport in plasma membranes revealed a 60% decrease in Vmax (2900 +/- 350 versus 7200 +/- 1000 pmol/mg of protein/s) and a small increase in Km (15.1 +/- 1 versus 13.0 +/- 0.6 mM). These data indicate that modifications of glucose transport activity produced by lipolytic and antilipolytic agents in intact adipose cells can be fully retained in plasma membranes isolated under appropriate conditions. Furthermore, the effects of these agents occur through a modification of the glucose transporter intrinsic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1597912030,"A peptidase that cleaved neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 peptide bond, leading to the formation of neurotensin-(1-10) and neurotensin-(11-13), was purified nearly to homogeneity from rat brain synaptic membranes. The enzyme appeared to be monomeric with a molecular weight of about 70,000-75,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography filtration. Isoelectrofocusing indicated a pI of 5.9-6. The purified peptidase could be classified as a neutral metallopeptidase with respect to its sensitivity to pH and metal chelators. Thiol-blocking agents and acidic and serine protease inhibitors had no effect. Studies with specific peptidase inhibitors clearly indicated that the purified enzyme was distinct from enzymes capable of cleaving neurotensin at the Pro10-Tyr11 bond such as proline endopeptidase and endopeptidase 24-11. The enzyme was also distinct from other neurotensin-degrading peptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and a recently purified rat brain soluble metalloendopeptidase. The peptidase displayed a high affinity for neurotensin (Km = 2.6 microM). Studies on its specificity revealed that neurotensin-(9-13) was the shortest neurotensin partial sequence that was able to fully inhibit [3H]neurotensin degradation. Shortening the C-terminal end of the neurotensin molecule as well as substitutions in positions 8, 9, and 11 by D-amino acids strongly decreased the inhibitory potency of neurotensin. Among 20 natural peptides, only angiotensin I and the neurotensin-related peptides (xenopsin and neuromedin N) were found as potent as unlabeled neurotensin."
https://openalex.org/W2092550305,"We investigated the effects of double-strand breaks on meiotic recombination in yeast. A double-strand break was introduced at the MATa locus by sporulation of a diploid under inducing conditions for the HO-encoded endonuclease; 14% of the resulting tetrads had undergone 4α:0a conversion. Conversion at MAT was associated with co-conversion of a closely linked marker and an increased recombination frequency for flanking markers. We also studied the sporulation products of a diploid heterozygous at the HIS4 locus for an insertion of a 100 bp fragment of MATa containing the HO endonuclease cut site. Under inducing conditions, a significant number of tetrads were formed that had undergone gene conversions in favor of the HIS4+ allele. Although double-strand breaks can initiate meiotic recombination in yeast, the data suggest that they do not normally do so."
https://openalex.org/W1582640966,"We present evidence that cysteine 269 of the small subunit of Escherichia coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase is essential for the hydrolysis of glutamine. When cysteine 269 is replaced with glycine or with serine by site-directed mutagenesis of the carA gene, the resulting enzymes are unable to catalyze carbamyl phosphate synthesis with glutamine as nitrogen donor. Even though the glycine 269, and particularly the serine 269 enzyme bind significant amounts of glutamine, neither glycine 269 nor serine 269 can hydrolyze glutamine. The mutations at cysteine 269 do not affect carbamyl phosphate synthesis with NH3 as substrate. The NH3-dependent activity of the mutant enzymes was equal to that of wild-type. Measurements of Km indicate that the enzyme uses unionized NH3 rather than ammonium ion as substrate. The apparent Km for NH3 of the wild-type enzyme is calculated to be about 5 mM, independent of pH. The substitution of cysteine 269 with glycine or with serine results in a decrease of the apparent Km value for NH3 from 5 mM with the wild-type to 3.9 mM with the glycine, and 2.9 mM with the serine enzyme. Neither the glycine nor the serine mutation at position 269 affects the ability of the enzyme to catalyze ATP synthesis from ADP and carbamyl phosphate. Allosteric properties of the large subunit are also unaffected. However, substitution of cysteine 269 with glycine or with serine causes an 8- and 18-fold stimulation of HCO-3 -dependent ATPase activity, respectively. The increase in ATPase activity and the decrease in apparent Km for NH3 provide additional evidence for an interaction of the glutamine binding domain of the small subunit with one of the two known ATP sites of the large subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1512003497,"Despite intensive research efforts, the functional role and regulation of the insulin receptor kinase remain enigmatic. In this investigation, we demonstrate that calmodulin enhances insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor and histone H2b and that insulin also stimulates phosphorylation of calmodulin. Using wheat germ lectin-enriched insulin receptor preparations obtained from rat adipocyte plasma membranes, calmodulin stimulated the rate and increased the amount of 32P incorporated predominantly into tyrosine residues of the beta subunit of the receptor when assayed in the presence of insulin. The stimulatory effect of calmodulin was both dose-dependent and saturable with half-maximal and maximal phosphorylation of the beta subunit occurring at 0.4 and 2.0 microM calmodulin, respectively. Ca2+ enhanced the ability of calmodulin to stimulate insulin-mediated phosphorylation of the beta subunit with an apparent K0.5 of approximately 0.6 microM. Calmodulin also induced an approximately 2-fold increase in both the rate and amount of insulin-mediated incorporation of 32P into histone H2b. The stimulatory effect of calmodulin was only observed in the presence of insulin and was concentration-dependent (K0.5 approximately 3.0 microM calmodulin), saturable (at 5 microM calmodulin), and Ca2+-dependent (K0.5 = 0.2 microM free Ca2+). Insulin also induced phosphorylation of a 17-kDa protein. On the basis of its molecular weight and purification via immunoadsorption with protein A-Sepharose-bound anti-calmodulin IgG, this phosphoprotein was identified as a phosphorylated form of calmodulin. Phosphorylation of calmodulin was only observed in the presence of insulin and was both Ca2+- and insulin concentration-dependent with half-maximal effects observed at 0.1 microM free Ca2+ and 350 microunits/ml insulin. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that Ca2+ and calmodulin participate in the molecular mechanism whereby binding of insulin to its receptor is coupled to changes in cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1635649833,"Monoclonal antibodies to various domains of human protein C were characterized, and the cross-reactivity of these antibodies with other vitamin K-dependent proteins was explored. Three antibodies, JTC-1, -2, and -3 reacted with protein C only in the presence of Ca2+ and were shown to bind to the light chain of protein C. It is suggested that these antibodies recognize a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain-related conformational change induced by metal ions, evidenced by the fact that half-maximal binding was observed at calcium concentration of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 mM, respectively, by the fact that these antibodies, even in the presence of Ca2+, do not react with gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domainless protein C, and by the fact that Zn2+ and Tb3+ support binding in essentially the same way. Each cell line was stabilized by recloning five times. In addition each antibody had a single isoelectric point and was of the IgG1 kappa class. The interaction of antibodies JTC-1, -2; and -3 with protein C-Ca2+ was characterized by a single class of binding sites with Kd of 3.98 X 10(-9) M, 4.01 X 10(-9) M, and 6.76 X 10(-9) M, respectively. However, antibodies JTC-1, -2, and -3 bound to prothrombin-Ca2+ with Kd of 7.81 X 10(-9) M, 2.0 X 10(-7) M, and higher than 1.0 X 10(-5) M, respectively. In addition they had weak affinity for factor X in the presence of Ca2+. The results indicate that the antibodies JTC-1, -2, and -3 are conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies directed against an at least partially common metal ion-induced three-dimensional structure in protein C, prothrombin, and factor X."

https://openalex.org/W1534129180,"We have purified the beta subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to homogeneity from an overproducing strain (Blanar, M., Sandler, S., Armengod, M., Ream, L., and Clark, A. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 4622-4626). From this procedure we can obtain 100 mg quantities of protein. The beta isolated from the overproducer is indistinguishable from that isolated from wild-type cells in terms of its activity and molecular weight. Partial amino acid sequence analysis has confirmed the DNA sequence of the dnaN gene (Ohmori, H., Kimura, M., Nagata, T., and Sakakibara, Y. (1984) Gene (Amst.) 28, 159-170) and established the sites for initiation and termination of translation. No processing that removes amino acid residues from beta occurs since the active protein begins with the initiating methionine and terminates at the position predicted from the DNA sequence. Our knowledge of the precise amino acid composition has been used to determine the extinction coefficient of beta to be 17,900 and 18,700 cm-1 M-1 at 280 and 277 nm, respectively. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm is reduced to 14,700 cm-1 M-1 under denaturing conditions in guanidine HCl. Conditions have been optimized so that 1 N-ethylmaleimide residue can be incorporated per beta monomer with full preservation of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2115176239,"The utilization of exogenous fatty acids for phospholipid synthesis via the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase was blocked in Escherichia coli mutants lacking acyl-CoA synthetase activity (fadD) resulting in the selective esterification of the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine by extracellular fatty acids (Rock, C. O., and Jackowski, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12720-12724). The incorporation of exogenous [1-14C]palmitate into phosphatidylethanolamine in fadD mutants was inhibited by chloramphenicol and was depressed by preventing the acylation of the amino terminus of the lipoproteins with the antibiotic globomycin. Lipoprotein acylation was directly examined in fadD mutants harboring hybrid plasmids containing either the major outer membrane lipoprotein gene or a lipoprotein-beta-lactamase gene fusion transcriptionally regulated by the lacUV5 promoter-operator region. Induction of lipoprotein synthesis in the presence of extracellular [1-14C]palmitate increased the amount of radioactivity entering the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine and efficiently labeled lipoprotein acyl moieties. Labeling of the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine prior to the induction of lipoprotein biosynthesis resulted in the transfer of fatty acid from phosphatidylethanolamine to the lipoprotein. Lipoprotein fatty acids derived from the 1-position of phosphatidylethanolamine were resistant to hydroxylamine hydrolysis, and globomycin reduced the incorporation of exogenous [1-14C]palmitate into lipoproteins by 80% suggesting that this fatty acid is primarily attached to the amino terminus of the lipoprotein. These data illustrate that fatty acid turnover in phosphatidylethanolamine is initiated by the transfer of 1-position acyl moieties to the major outer membrane lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1518359924,"Isolated hemoprotein subunits of Escherichia coli NADPH:sulfite reductase catalyze the 6-electron reduction of SO2-3 to S2-. The prosthetic groups of the hemoprotein, a siroheme and a Fe4S4 cluster, have been shown by spectroscopy to be tightly coupled. We have crystallized the isolated hemoprotein subunits and produced a 3-A electron density map by x-ray crystallography. A single heavy atom derivative and the native anomalous scattering (from the protein's 5 Fe and several S) were used to calculate the phases. In the electron density map, the cluster has a geometry similar to other Fe4S4 clusters. Both the cluster and the siroheme are found near the surface of the protein. The siroheme and the Fe4S4 cluster pack next to each other in the structure, apparently with a common ligand, consistent with a cysteine S gamma, shared by the siroheme Fe and one of the cluster Fe. The distance from the siroheme Fe to the center of the cluster is 5.5 A and the distance from the siroheme Fe to the nearest cluster Fe is 4.4 A. The edge of the siroheme macrocycle appears to be in Van der Waals contact with a cubane S atom of the cluster. The sixth coordination position of the siroheme Fe appears unoccupied and is quite exposed to the solvent. Some possible implications of the proposed structure on the role of the bridged siroheme-Fe4S4 cluster in catalysis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1587229711,"The nuclear matrix is a putative skeletal structure which has been implicated in many nuclear functions. To assess a possible role of the nuclear matrix in glucocorticoid action, purified rat liver nuclei containing glucocorticoid-receptor complexes were treated with DNase I +/- RNase A followed by 1.6 M NaCl, thus yielding salt-extractable and salt-resistant (nuclear matrix) fractions. The subnuclear distribution of hormone-receptor complexes was determined by following the fate of unmetabolized radiolabel after injection of labeled triamcinolone acetonide into adrenalectomized animals and subjecting various subfractions to immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the glucocorticoid receptor. Both techniques indicated that 50-70% of the total nuclear hormone-receptor complexes were recovered in the nuclear matrix fraction. Previous results (Kaufmann, S. H., and Shaper, J. H. (1984) Exp. Cell Res. 155, 477-495) suggest that a variety of nuclear polypeptides become nuclease- and salt-resistant as a result of the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The following evidence suggests that disulfide bonds mediate the association between the glucocorticoid receptor and the nuclear matrix. When nuclei were isolated in the absence of sulfhydryl-blocking and -cross-linking reagents, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions revealed that the receptor was present as a high molecular weight disulfide-cross-linked complex. When nuclei were isolated in the presence of the irreversible sulfhydryl-blocking reagent iodoacetamide, the disulfide bonds which cross-linked the receptor into high molecular weight complexes were absent; and 85-100% of the hormone-receptor complexes were salt-extractable. When nuclei (isolated in the absence of iodoacetamide) were treated with the sulfhydryl-cross-linking reagent sodium tetrathionate, greater than 95% of the nuclear hormone-receptor complexes became resistant to extraction with nucleases and 1.6 M NaCl. The implications of these results for other matrix-associated nuclear functions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546302091,"Insulin stimulates hexose transport and phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in monolayer cultures of intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To assess the phosphorylation state of the receptor in situ, cells were equilibrated with [32P]orthophosphate and then disrupted under denaturing conditions which preserved the phosphorylation state of the receptor established in the cell. The insulin receptor, isolated by lectin adsorption and two-dimensional nonreducing/reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, occurred as a single oligomeric species with an apparent alpha 2 beta 2 subunit composition. This oligomeric structure was not altered by treating cells with insulin. Only the beta-subunit of the receptor was phosphorylated; [32P]phosphoserine and [32P] phosphotyrosine were both identified in the beta-subunit from cells in the unstimulated state, but only [32P] phosphotyrosine increased in cells stimulated with insulin. Neither insulin-like growth factors I nor II stimulated insulin receptor beta-subunit phosphorylation, although both activated hexose transport. Upon the addition of insulin, [32P]orthophosphate incorporated into the beta-subunit increased 4.5-fold (7-fold with respect to [32P]tyrosine) and was complete within 1 min (t1/2 = 8 s). Following the removal of insulin from the monolayers, [32P]beta-subunit fell to the basal level (t1/2 = 2.5 min); there was no lag phase before either transition. The tyrosine protein kinase activity, measured in vitro with a model substrate, was higher with immunoaffinity-purified insulin receptor from insulin-stimulated cells than from cells in the basal state. Hexose transport rate, measured using 3-O-[methyl-14C]glucose, was half-maximally stimulated at 2 nM insulin. A 1-min latency period followed insulin addition, after which a 7-fold increase in the steady-state rate of hexose uptake was achieved within 5 min. Upon the removal of insulin, hexose transport continued at the stimulated steady-state rate for 2.5 min and then declined to the basal rate with a half-time of 8 min. These kinetic experiments in situ and protein kinase activity measurements in vitro support the hypothesis that beta-subunit phosphorylation is an intermediate step linking insulin binding to the increased glucose transport rate."
https://openalex.org/W1567356479,"Monoclonal antibodies which recognize the cell surface-exposed part of outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli were used to select for antigenic mutants producing an altered PhoE protein. The selection procedure was based on the antibody-dependent bactericidal action of the complement system. Using two distinct PhoE-specific monoclonal antibodies, seven independent mutants with an altered PhoE protein were isolated. Among these seven mutants, five distinct binding patterns were observed with a panel of 10 monoclonal antibodies. DNA sequence analysis revealed the following substitutions in the 330-residue-long PhoE protein: Arg-201----His (three isolates), Arg-201----Cys, Gly-238----Ser, Gly-275----Ser and Gly-275----Asp. It is argued that amino acid residues 201, 238, and 275 are most likely directly involved in antibody binding and, therefore, exposed at the cell surface. Together with Arg-158, which was previously shown to be cell surface exposed as it is changed in phage TC45-resistant phoE mutants, these four positions show a remarkably regular spacing, being approximately 40 residues apart. A model is suggested in which the PhoE polypeptide repeatedly traverses the outer membrane in an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet structure, exposing eight areas to the outside which are all separated by approximately 40 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1943464759,"An expression vector has been constructed for the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. A cDNA clone for the bovine RI-subunit has been inserted into pUC7. When Escherichia coli JM105 was transformed with this plasmid, R-subunit was expressed in amounts that approached 4 mg/liter. The expressed protein was visualized in total cell extracts by photolabeling with 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-mono[32P]phosphate following transfer from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose. Expression of R-subunit was independent of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. R-subunit accumulated in large amounts only in the stationary phase of growth, and the addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside during the log phase of growth actually blocked the accumulation of R-subunit. Maximum expression (20 mg/liter) was achieved when E. coli 222 was transformed with the RI-containing plasmid. E. coli 222 is a strain that contains two mutations; it is cya- and also has a mutation in the catabolite gene activator protein (crp) that enables the protein to bind to DNA in the absence of cAMP. The expressed RI-subunit was a soluble, dimeric protein, and no significant proteolysis was apparent in the cell extract. The purified RI-subunit bound 2 mol of cAMP/mol of R monomer, reassociated with C-subunit to form holoenzyme, and migrated as a dimer on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in the absence of reducing agents. The expressed protein was also susceptible to limited proteolysis, yielding a monomeric cAMP-binding fragment having a molecular weight of 35,000. In all of these properties, the expressed protein was indistinguishable from RI purified from bovine tissue even though the R-subunit expressed in E. coli represents a fusion protein that contains 10 additional amino acids at the amino terminus that are provided by the lac Z' gene of the vector. This NH2-terminal sequence was confirmed by amino acid sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1613623416,"Preparations of small proteoglycans from bovine tendon, bone, and cartilage have been compared for sensitivity to various enzymes and reactivity with different polyclonal antibodies. Chondroitinase ABC digestion of all proteoglycans generated a core protein preparation that migrated similarly in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as a doublet band with Mr approximately equal to 45,000. The small proteoglycans of cartilage were divided into two populations based upon electrophoretic migration of the intact molecules (Rosenberg, L. C., Choi, H. U., Tank, L-H., Johnson, T. L., Pal, S., Webber, C., Reiner, A., and Poole, A. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6304-6313). The core preparations of tendon, bone, and the faster-migrating (PG II) proteoglycans of cartilage all interacted in Western blot/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis with polyclonal antibody raised against either the tendon or bone proteoglycans. The slower-migrating (PG I) proteoglycans of cartilage did not react with these antibodies. Digestion of the tendon small proteoglycan with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease released glycosaminoglycan chains from the molecule and generated a 40-kDa protein fragment that was resistant to further rapid degradation by the enzyme. This large digestion fragment was also prominent following V8 protease digestion of the faster-migrating (PG II) population of small cartilage proteoglycans, but not the small proteoglycan of bone. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the tendon (PG II) proteoglycan was determined. These observations provide additional evidence for heterogeneity among the chemically similar small proteoglycans from different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2024421359,"Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a monomeric protein composed of two domains of approximately equal size, connected by a hinge. Substrate-induced conformational change results in the closure of the active site cleft, which is situated between these two domains. In a study of the relations between structure and function of this enzyme, two interspecies hybrids were constructed, each composed of one domain from the human enzyme and one domain from the yeast enzyme. Despite a 35% difference in the amino acid composition between human and yeast PGK, catalytic properties of the hybrid enzymes are very similar to those of the parental proteins. This result demonstrates that the evolutionary substitutions within these two distantly related molecules do not significantly affect formation of the active site cleft, mechanism of domain closure, or enzyme activity itself."

Under conditions where the individual mutations permit normal lipoprotein secretion, the prolipoprotein with both mutations was unable to be normally modified or processed. These results demonstrate that a given signal peptide is fully functional only if it is structurally compatible with the protein to be secreted. This structural compatibility between the signal peptide and the secretory protein is considered to be dependent on the secondary structure formed at or near the signal peptide cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W1600480505,"An RNA polymerase was purified 6500-fold to near homogeneity from a whole cell extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purified enzyme consists of a single 145,000-dalton polypeptide. By subcellular fractionation, the enzyme was localized to the mitochondria. The RNA polymerase activity is alpha-amanitin- and rifampicin-resistant. With single-stranded DNA templates, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of polyribonucleotide chains with lengths ranging from less than 10 to greater than 100 residues. It is inactive with double-stranded DNA. Specific antisera inhibit the RNA polymerase activity and recognize the 145,000-dalton polypeptide. The antisera relate this enzyme to previously described yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase preparations capable of initiation of transcription at mitochondrial promoter sequences (Winkley, C. S., Keller, M. J., and Jaehning, J. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14214-14223). It therefore appears that the enzyme is a subunit of the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1557175898,"Contact points between the FLP protein of the yeast 2-micron plasmid and its recombination site have been defined. Important features of the region previously defined as the minimal recombination site in vitro include a pair of 13-base pair inverted repeats separated by an 8-base pair spacer. The two FLP protein-binding sites within this region are 12 base pairs in length. In each case they include the internal 11 base pairs of one of the 13-base pair repeats, as well as the adjacent base pair within the spacer. The internal 6 base pairs within the spacer are not involved in binding or recognition by FLP protein. When the size of the spacer is increased or decreased by one base pair, the distance between the cleavage points is also increased or decreased correspondingly by one base pair. Points of cleavage are unaffected by changes in the spacer sequence. Specific contact points involving purine residues, identified by methylation protection and recombination interference experiments, are located in both the major and minor grooves of the DNA. Additional contact points between FLP protein and phosphate groups in the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone are clustered near the cleavage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1487890825,"The relative rates of transcription of several classes of the mitochondrial genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been determined. The rates were measured by pulse labeling whole yeast with [32P]O4, isolating the total RNA, hybridization to single-stranded M13 DNA probes containing segments of the gene of interest, digestion with RNase A or T1, and separation of the protected fragment by gel electrophoresis. This analysis indicated that, among the genes analyzed, transcriptional promoters varied in strength by 20-fold while the rates of transcription varied by more than 50-fold. The strengths of the promoters of the genes were ordered: tRNAMetf greater than tRNAPhe greater than 14 S rRNA greater than 21 S rRNA greater than tRNAGlu greater than Oli-1 much greater than tRNACys. In addition, transcription rates were measured within polygenic transcription units. This analysis indicated that there was transcriptional attenuation within all the polygenic transcription units with the greatest attenuation factor being as much as 17-fold, occurring after the tRNAGlu and tRNAMetf genes. This analysis indicated that regulation of the rates of transcription in the yeast mitochondrial genome occurs by two distinct mechanisms, modulation of the rate of transcriptional initiation and attenuation of transcriptional elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1496748397,"A novel serine protease, which we have called IRCM-serine protease 1, was purified from both porcine neurointermediate and anterior pituitary lobes. The enzyme was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, and thiol reagents including HgCl2, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and was resistant to lima bean trypsin inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and C1-esterase inhibitor. IRCM-serine protease 1 displayed trypsin-like specificity toward a number of tripeptide coumarin-containing substrates, with kcat/km values ranging from 10(4) to 10(6) M-1 S-1. The best substrate was benzyloxycarbonyl-L-Ala-L-Lys-L-Arg-4-methylcoumarin-7-amide with a kcat/Km value of 2.27 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. IRCM-serine protease 1, Mr = 169,000-190,000 determined by gradient gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, respectively, appears to be a homologous dimer. The monomeric subunits of the enzyme are composed of an Mr = 38,000 polypeptide chain which is modifiable by 125I-D-Tyr-Glu-Phe-Lys-Arg-CH2Cl, disulfide-linked to another polypeptide resulting in a subunit molecular weight of 88,000."
https://openalex.org/W1679740236,"The gene encoding the Escherichia coli sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, plsB, was inserted into hybrid plasmids under transcriptional control of the lambda PL and tac promoters. Enzymatic activities 35-50-fold above wild type and a large increase in glycerol-P acyltransferase polypeptide were obtained. Thin section electron microscopy of the cells overproducing the glycerol-P acyltransferase revealed 235-245-A diameter tubular structures associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. These structures were released from the cell by osmotic lysis and purified on Matrex Gel Green A. Subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the dominant protein constituent of the tubules was the glycerol-P acyltransferase. Analysis of tubule-enriched fractions isolated by differential centrifugation revealed a decreased phospholipid to protein ratio as compared to total and cytoplasmic membrane fractions. At high magnification, negative stained tubules displayed ordered arrays of stain-excluding components projecting 50-60 A from the cytoplasmic surface. Optical diffraction patterns from the micrographs contained intense layer lines at (1/78 A) and (1/39 A) along the tubule axis and a prominent spot at (1/62 A) near the equator. From compositional and structural data, 18-37% of the polypeptide volume is estimated to lie within the hydrophobic domain of the tubule membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1543558622,"We have reciprocally transplanted the anticodon arm sequences of a set of amber suppressor tRNA genes, using recombinant DNA techniques. By this means, a very efficient suppressor may be converted to a poor one, and the poorest tRNA to the efficiency of the best one. In tRNA molecules of normal 2 degrees and 3 degrees structure, the suppressor efficiencies of different composite tRNAs having the same anticodon arm sequence are approximately the same. Large numbers of simultaneous changes throughout the rest of the molecule do not affect the efficiency. Selective nucleotide modification as a result of varied anticodon arm sequences cannot explain these efficiencies. Efficiencies are also unlikely to differ because of selective aminoacylation. Measurement of in vivo tRNA shows, however, that tRNA levels do vary if the anticodon arm sequence is changed. If tRNA levels are normalized, the anticodon arm effect on the translational efficiency remains. Therefore, different anticodon arms, all of normal secondary structure, are not equivalent in translation. The most efficient sequences in this series resemble those found in natural tRNAs associated with similar anticodons, as is proposed in the extended anticodon theory (Yarus, M. (1982) Science 218, 646-652). These molecules also provide some information on the specificity of nucleotide modification enzymes and on determinants of the steady-state tRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1536647334,"The assembly of the yeast transcription factors IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, represented by crude chromatographic fractions, into a stable complex on the 5 S RNA gene has been assessed using a template competition assay (Bogenhagen, D. F., Wormington, W. M., and Brown, D. D. (1982) Cell 28, 413-421). The yeast factor A can interact transiently with the yeast 5 S RNA gene, but both factors A and C are required for the formation of a stable complex. Factor A, but not factor C, is sequestered into this complex. Both factors A and C, however, are required for the sequestration of factor B into the 5 S RNA gene transcription complex. During this study, it was noted that an amount of factor C which was insufficient to lead to significant transcription of the 5 S RNA gene could nonetheless efficiently stabilize factor A on the template. This suggests that factor C may initially act catalytically to stabilize a transient interaction of factor A with the 5 S RNA gene before assuming a stoichiometric role in the assembly of the complete transcription complex. Alternative interpretations of this observation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1588494743,"C1-Tetrahydrofolate synthase is a trifunctional polypeptide found in eukaryotic organisms that catalyzes 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.3), 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5) activities. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase is encoded by the ADE3 locus, yet ade3 mutants have low but detectable levels of these enzyme activities. Synthetase, cyclohydrolase, and dehydrogenase activities in an ade3 deletion strain co-purify 4,000-fold to yield a single protein species as seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The native molecular weight of the isozyme (Mr = 200,000 by gel exclusion chromatography) and the size of its subunits (Mr = 100,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) are similar to those of C1-tetrahydrofolate Cell fractionation experiments show that the isozyme, but not C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, is localized in the mitochondria. Genetic studies indicate that the isozyme is encoded in the nuclear genome. Peptide mapping experiments show that C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase and the isozyme are not structurally identical. However, immunotitration experiments and amino acid sequence analysis suggest that C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase and the isozyme are structurally related. We propose to call the isozyme mitochondrial C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1662350717,"The beta-oxidation of 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA, an assumed metabolite of linoleic acid, by purified enzymes from mitochondria, peroxisomes, and Escherichia coli was studied. 2-trans,4-cis-Decadienoyl-CoA is an extremely poor substrate of the beta-oxidation system reconstituted from mitochondrial enzymes. The results of a kinetic evaluation lead to the conclusion that in mitochondria 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA is not directly beta-oxidized, but instead is reduced by NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase prior to its beta-oxidation. Hence, the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA does not require 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase, a conclusion which agrees with the finding that 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase is absent from mitochondria (Chu, C.-H., and Schulz, H. (1985) FEBS Lett. 185, 129-134). However, 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA can be slowly oxidized by the bifunctional beta-oxidation enzyme from rat liver peroxisomes, as well as by the fatty acid oxidation complex from E. coli. The observed rates of 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA degradation by these two multi-functional proteins were significantly higher than the values calculated according to steady-state velocity equations derived for coupled enzyme reactions. This is attributed to the direct transfer of L-3-hydroxy-4-cis-decenoyl-CoA from the active site of enoyl-CoA hydratase to that of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase on the same protein molecule. All observations together lead to the suggestion that the chain shortening of 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoyl-CoA in peroxisomes and in E. coli occurs simultaneously by two different pathways. The major pathway involves the NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, whereas 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase functions in the metabolism of D-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA which is formed via the minor pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1602434245,"In order to develop a molecular probe to delineate chemical and biological characteristics of human neuroblastoma cells, a murine monoclonal antibody (Mab 5G3) was produced that is directed to a glycoprotein, preferentially expressed on the surface of such cells. This antibody is of IgG2a isotype, has an association constant of 8 X 10(9) M-1, and reacts preferentially with human neuroblastoma cell lines and fresh frozen tissue sections in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoperoxidase assays, respectively. Minimal reactivity is observed with a variety of lymphoblastoid cell lines and normal fetal and adult tissues. Mab 5G3 specifically recognizes a neuroblastoma target glycoprotein antigen of 215 kDa that is derived from a 200-kDa precursor, as evident from pulse-chase biosynthetic studies. Treatment with tunicamycin revealed that both molecules contain N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharides; however, only the 215-kDa species is resistant to treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and sensitive to neuraminidase, indicating that it contains trimmed and terminally sialylated oligosaccharides of the complex type. In contrast, the 200-kDa precursor is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and resistant to neuraminidase treatment indicating that it contains high-mannose non-processed oligosaccharides. The 215-kDa molecule is sulfated, phosphorylated at serine residues, and expressed on the cell surface. A molecule of 200 kDa is detected by Mab 5G3 in spent culture medium of human neuroblastoma cells which is neither sulfated nor phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1534121049,"In the present study, Cys-176 and Cys-234 in the lactose carrier have been modified to serine residues via site-specific mutagenesis. The resultant mutants have been characterized with regard to galactoside transport activity and sulfhydryl reagent sensitivity. The mutant proteins (in which Cys-176 or Cys-234 had been replaced with serine) are able to effectively transport galactosides, although the transport rates for lactose and methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside are slightly reduced compared to the normal lactose carrier. In addition, both mutants are less sensitive than the wild-type to high concentrations of two different sulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Overall, the data are consistent with the idea that Cys-176 and Cys-234 are close to the substrate recognition site. However, neither residue appears to be essential for galactoside transport by providing an ionizable group near the active site or by forming a disulfide bond."

L. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 136, 228-234) and also retain almost 90% of their content of neutral serine proteinase (Pontremoli, S., Melloni, E., Michetti, M., Sacco, O., Sparatore, B., Salamino, F., Damiani, G., and Horecker, B. L. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 1685-1689). When ATP is added to the isolated membranes, a substantial amount (approximately 25%) of the intrinsic proteinase is released into the incubation medium. The addition of ATP in the presence of NADPH also caused a significant enhancement of the production of O2 radicals. These effects of ATP were not observed with membranes isolated from untreated neutrophils. The release of the serine proteinase is almost fully dependent on the addition of ATP and is correlated with the phosphorylation of membrane proteins. It is also markedly inhibited by the addition of retinal or trifluoperazine inhibitors of native protein kinase C. The results represent the first direct demonstration of a role for membrane-bound protein kinase C activity in the release of neutral proteinase and the production of O2 radicals, responses related to the cytotoxic effects of activated neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1590101925,"Exposure to low pH triggers an increase in the hydrophobicity of the colicin E3 molecule. Using a [3H] Triton X-100 binding assay we have shown that the amount of detergent (at supramicellar concentrations) associated with colicin E3 increased dramatically at pH 3.8 and below. Interaction of colicin E3 with asolectin vesicles was monitored by following its cross-linking with two different photoactivatable radioactive phospholipid analogues. At neutral pH colicin E3 was cross-linked with the phospholipid probing the membrane surface whereas at pH 4.5 and below, the bacteriocin reacted with the phospholipid probing the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. With the use of phase partitioning of proteins in Triton X-114 it was shown that at acidic pH whole colicin E3 and its immunity protein segregated in the detergent phase. After trypsin digestion of the colicin-immunity complex, the N-terminal portion of E3 (T1) and the immunity partitioned in the detergent phase at low pH. In contrast, the enzymic domain of the colicin (T2) remained in the aqueous phase and was recovered in a highly active form as a consequence of its dissociation from the immunity protein. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of entry of colicin E3 into bacterial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1483223566,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of chloroplasts contains eight large and eight small subunits. The small subunit is encoded by nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and imported into chloroplasts. The large subunit is encoded by chloroplast DNA and synthesized within chloroplasts. We show in this communication that the large subunit of Chlamydomonas chloroplasts could be efficiently imported into isolated yeast mitochondria if it was attached to the presequence of a protein transported into the yeast mitochondrial matrix. Thus, synthesis of the large subunit within chloroplasts does not reflect the inability of this subunit to cross membranes. The same mitochondrial presequence could also transport the nuclear-encoded small subunit into yeast mitochondria. However, when the two types of subunits were coimported into mitochondria, they did not assemble with each other inside the heterologous organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1511088874,"The treatment of confluent embryonic Swiss mouse fibroblasts (3T3-C2 cells) with glucocorticoids has been shown to result in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the number of cellular insulin receptors (Knutson, V. P., Ronnett, G. V., and Lane, M. D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2822-2826). Cellular events relating to the insulin receptor and insulin responsiveness which occur over the time course of the transition to the steady state are described. Over the 48-h transition from the basal to the up-regulated steady state, a transient increase in the level of intracellular receptor was detected with a 3-5-fold increase in intracellular receptor found 12 h after steroid administration. Through the use of the heavy isotope density shift, this increase in the intracellular receptor population was preceded by a decrease in the rate of receptor inactivation, with no change in receptor synthesis. Insulin-induced receptor down-regulation was abolished after 12 h of dexamethasone treatment, when the intracellular receptor level was elevated. Nevertheless, the cells maintained the ability to internalize receptor in response to insulin binding. The hormonal responsiveness of the cells over the glucocorticoid-induced transition was assessed by the ability of insulin to stimulate the cellular uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and aminoisobutyric acid. Glucose transport was transiently increased at a time when the intracellular population of receptor was transiently elevated. Glucocorticoid treatment ultimately led to a loss of insulin-sensitive glucose transport. Insulin-stimulated amino acid transport was transiently abolished when the intracellular population of receptor was high. With chronic steroid treatment, the sensitivity of the amino acid transporter was increased above control levels. These data would indicate that glucocorticoids have no short- or long-term effect on insulin receptor synthesis; the insulin-induced internalization of insulin receptor alone is not sufficient to induce a cellular response to insulin; and the cellular events leading to the transient accumulation of intracellular receptor are coupled to the cellular responsiveness of the cells to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1565734632,"The specificity and reactivity of human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor has been investigated by in vitro mutagenesis of the reactive site P1 methionine 358 residue to alanine 358 and cysteine 358. A comparison of the second-order association rates of both uncharged mutants with 9 serine proteinases indicated that each reacted similarly to either the normal plasma inhibitor or to a mutant containing valine in this position (Travis, J., Owen, M., George, P., Carrell, R., Rosenberg, S., Hallewell, R. A., and Barr, P. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4384-4389) when tested against either neutrophil or pancreatic elastase. However, oxidation, carboxymethylation, or aminoethylation of the cysteine mutant to yield a charged P1 residue resulted in a significant decrease in association rates with both elastolytic enzymes, and aminoethylation created an excellent trypsin and plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that the specificity of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is determined in a general manner by the class of amino acid residue in the P1 position. Substitution within the same category, such as from valine to alanine or cysteine among the aliphatic hydrophobic residues, has little effect on association rates with the elastolytic enzymes tested. However, alteration from an uncharged to a charged residue may cause considerable changes in both inhibitor specificity and reactivity as noted here with the cysteine derivatives and also previously with a natural variant in which methionine 358 to arginine 358 conversion resulted in the production of a potent thrombin inhibitor (Owen, M.

Val-neotrypsinogen has Arg105-Val106 cleaved which is located within the amino-terminal domain. The mixed disulfide derivative of Ser-neotrypsinogen was successfully refolded. A functional molecule was regenerated from the polypeptide fragments with the correct molecular weight of neotrypsinogen in an overall yield of 7%. Val-Neotrypsinogen could not be refolded. The first-order rate constants for the regeneration of Ser-neotrypsinogen were determined from the formation of active enzyme molecules as a function of time and from the regain of the correct molecular weight. Both kinetic values were the same indicating that refolding of the polypeptide chains first forms globular domain structures. The two domains then associate and the disulfide bonds between the domains and the correct geometry of the active site residues are formed last. The same kinetic results were also found in refolding Thr-neochymotrypsinogen (Duda, C. T., and Light, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9866-9871) where peptide bond cleavage also occurred in the connecting peptide.

Its existence was inferred from an analysis of the phenotypes of the ileR mutant avr-16 (Johnson, D. I., and Somerville, R. L. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 155, 49-55). The nucleotide sequence of ileR, the structural gene for Ile repressor, has been determined. A DNA segment of 300 base pairs constitutes the ileR gene. The predicted gene product, a protein of 100 amino acids (molecular weight 11,823) has primary structural features reminiscent of other double-stranded DNA-binding regulatory proteins. S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' terminus of ileR mRNA revealed two discrete species whose startpoints differed by approximately 47 nucleotides. The ileR gene, like other repressors for amino acid biosynthetic systems, is autogenously regulated at the transcriptional level. Within the ileR promoter region lie two 18-base pair segments of DNA bearing significant homology to putative operator targets also found within the thr and ilv promoters. A second open reading frame capable of specifying a protein of 83 amino acids, designated orf83, is transcribed divergently from the ileR gene. There are 202 base pairs separating the first codons of the two genes. S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' terminus of orf83 mRNA revealed two discrete species whose startpoints differed by approximately 27 nucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2097594468,"Membrane-associated enzymes are often solubilized with detergents, purified, and then reconstituted with phospholipid cofactors to regain function. Insofar as most purification and reconstitution procedures are not quantitative, the final reconstituted preparations could reflect a population of molecules ranging from fully functional to completely inactive. Quantitative studies on the efficiency of reconstitution of the Triton X-100-solubilized sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol-P) acyltransferase of Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane were undertaken at each step of purification. Physical recovery of the 83,000 Mr polypeptide was quantitated in polyacrylamide gels using membranes from cells labeled with [3H]leucine. The 83,000 Mr polypeptide in such gels was demonstrated to consist exclusively of the glycerol-P acyltransferase peptide by V8 peptide mapping. Comparison between physical recovery of 83,000 Mr polypeptide and reconstituted activity allowed the efficiency of reconstitution to be determined. Unexpectedly, disproportionalities occurred during the purification. However, the final purification of reconstituted enzyme activity matched that of the 83,000 Mr polypeptide. This method also allowed measurement of the specific activities of the glycerol-P acyltransferase in membranes from a wild type E. coli strain and from plasmid-containing strains which express the plsB gene product to different extents. The physical amounts of the 83,000 Mr polypeptide and glycerol-P acyltransferase activity measured in membranes were not strictly proportional. In strains where the amount of 83,000 Mr polypeptide was enhanced, a larger proportion of latent activity was observed following solubilization and reconstitution. The results establish the suitability of the reconstituted preparations of glycerol-P acyltransferase for detailed kinetic analysis and permit inferences pertaining to regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1573835749,"125I-Insulin binding to rat liver plasma membranes initiated two processes that occurred with similar time courses: an increase of receptor affinity for hormone and degradation of the Mr 135,000 alpha subunit of the insulin receptor to a fragment of Mr 120,000. Inhibitors of serine proteinases prevented alpha subunit degradation without affecting the affinity change. This shows that the change of affinity is not produced by receptor proteolysis and that the intact alpha subunit of the insulin receptor can exist as a higher or lower affinity species. Hormone binding was much more rapid than receptor proteolysis and the initial rate of alpha subunit degradation was independent of the concentration of occupied lower affinity receptors. Only persistent hormone binding and the accumulation of higher affinity insulin-receptor complexes led to significant receptor proteolysis. As the incubation time between 125I-insulin and membranes increased, the rate at which hormone dissociated from Mr 135,000 complexes diminished, whereas hormone dissociated from Mr 120,000 complexes slowly after brief or extended incubations. These observations suggest that 125I-insulin binds to membranes to form low affinity complexes that are not substrates for proteolysis. A slow conformational change produces higher affinity hormone-receptor complexes that are selectively degraded. Thus, the conversion between states of affinity may play a role in the regulation of receptor proteolysis and, consequently, insulin action in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1516668646,"Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible activation of dihydrogen. The hydrogenases from the aerobic, N2-fixing microorganisms Azotobacter vinelandii and Rhizobium japonicum are nickel- and iron-containing dimers that belong to the group of O2-labile enzymes. Exposure of these hydrogenases to O2 results in an irreversible inactivation; therefore, these enzymes are purified anaerobically in a fully active state. We describe in this paper an electron acceptor-requiring and pH-dependent, reversible inactivation of these hydrogenases. These results are the first example of an anaerobic, reversible inactivation of the O2-labile hydrogenases. The reversible inactivation required the presence of an electron acceptor. The rate of inactivation was first-order, with similar rates observed for methylene blue, benzyl viologen, and phenazine-methosulfate. The rate of inactivation was also dependent on the pH. However, increasing the pH of the enzyme in the absence of an electron acceptor did not result in inactivation. Thus, the reversible inactivation was not a result of high pH alone. The inactive enzyme could not be reactivated by H2 or other reductants at high pH. Titration of enzyme inactivated at high pH back to low pH was also ineffective at reactivating the enzyme. However, if reductants were present during this titration, the enzyme could be fully reactivated. The temperature dependence of inactivation yielded an activation energy of 44 kJ X mol-1. Gel filtration chromatography of active and inactive hydrogenase indicated that neither dissociation nor aggregation of the dimer hydrogenase was responsible for this reversible inactivation. We propose a four-state model to describe this reversible inactivation."

Initiation occurs through hairpin priming at the 3' ends of the genome, but shows a strong preference for the right end.
