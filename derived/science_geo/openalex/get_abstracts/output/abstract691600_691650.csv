https://openalex.org/W4225513536,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the most severe global pandemic due to its high pathogenicity and death rate starting from the end of 2019. Though there are some vaccines available against SAER-CoV-2 infections, we are worried about their effectiveness, due to its unstable sequence patterns. Therefore, beside vaccines, globally effective supporting drugs are also required for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore commonly effective repurposable drugs for the treatment against different variants of coronavirus infections, in this article, an attempt was made to explore host genomic biomarkers guided repurposable drugs for SARS-CoV-1 infections and their validation with SARS-CoV-2 infections by using the integrated bioinformatics approaches. At first, we identified 138 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SARS-CoV-1 infected and control samples by analyzing high throughput gene-expression profiles to select drug target key receptors. Then we identified top-ranked 11 key DEGs (SMAD4, GSK3B, SIRT1, ATM, RIPK1, PRKACB, MED17, CCT2, BIRC3, ETS1 and TXN) as hub genes (HubGs) by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs highlighting their functions, pathways, regulators and linkage with other disease risks that may influence SARS-CoV-1 infections. The DEGs-set enrichment analysis significantly detected some crucial biological processes (immune response, regulation of angiogenesis, apoptotic process, cytokine production and programmed cell death, response to hypoxia and oxidative stress), molecular functions (transcription factor binding and oxidoreductase activity) and pathways (transcriptional mis-regulation in cancer, pathways in cancer, chemokine signaling pathway) that are associated with SARS-CoV-1 infections as well as SARS-CoV-2 infections by involving HubGs. The gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis detected some transcription factors (FOXC1, GATA2, YY1, FOXL1, TP53 and SRF) and micro-RNAs (hsa-mir-92a-3p, hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-106b-5p, hsa-mir-34a-5p and hsa-mir-19b-3p) as the key transcriptional and post- transcriptional regulators of HubGs, respectively. We also detected some chemicals (Valproic Acid, Cyclosporine, Copper Sulfate and arsenic trioxide) that may regulates HubGs. The disease-HubGs interaction analysis showed that our predicted HubGs are also associated with several other diseases including different types of lung diseases. Then we considered 11 HubGs mediated proteins and their regulatory 6 key TFs proteins as the drug target proteins (receptors) and performed their docking analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease-guided top listed 90 anti-viral drugs out of 3410. We found Rapamycin, Tacrolimus, Torin-2, Radotinib, Danoprevir, Ivermectin and Daclatasvir as the top-ranked 7 candidate-drugs with respect to our proposed target proteins for the treatment against SARS-CoV-1 infections. Then, we validated these 7 candidate-drugs against the already published top-ranked 11 target proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections by molecular docking simulation and found their significant binding affinity scores with our proposed candidate-drugs. Finally, we validated all of our findings by the literature review. Therefore, the proposed candidate-drugs might play a vital role for the treatment against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 infections with comorbidities, since the proposed HubGs are also associated with several comorbidities."

Interventions involving the natural environment such as surf therapy, are increasingly being used to facilitate aspects of wellbeing in clinical populations. However, explorations of how nature-based interventions such as surf therapy may be used to promote wellbeing in the context of neurorehabilitation are missing from the peer-reviewed literature. Here we characterize the experience of a five-week surfing intervention involving fifteen adults living with the psycho-social and cognitive sequelae of acquired brain injury. Insights were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, which highlighted the importance of seven overarching themes, including: 1) Connection to Nature, 2) Facilitating Trust and Safety, 3) Managing and Accepting Difficult Emotions, 4) Facilitating Positive Emotion, Meaning and Purpose, 5) Building Community through Social Connection, and 6) Positive Change. Barriers and opportunities (theme 7) were also identified as components on which clinical services may be improved. We present a theoretical model for the benefits of surf therapy in people living with acquired brain injury (ABI) based on these themes and reflections on findings from the wider literature. Findings emphasise the importance of leveraging community partnerships to augment the holistic model of neurorehabilitation and potential implications for service redesign are discussed, focusing on recent developments in wellbeing science."

We identify the determinants of quality of working life (QWL) among night-shift healthcare workers (NSHW) in Paris public hospitals shortly after the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The ALADDIN cross-sectional online survey (15 June to 15 September 2020) collected QWL, socio-economic, behavioral, and work-related information among 1,387 NSHW in the 39 hospitals of the Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). Data were weighted (margin calibration) to be representative of the entire population of 12,000 AP-HP hospitals’ NSHW regarding sex, age, and professional category. Linear regression was used to identify correlates of QWL (WRQoL scale). Results New night position during the COVID pandemic, difficulties in getting screened for COVID, and considering protective measures inadequate were associated with poorer QWL, after adjustment for socio-economic characteristics, professional category, perceived health, physical activity, and history of harassment at work. Under-estimation of night-shift work by day-shift colleagues, reporting night work as a source of tension with friends, or feeling more irritable since working at night also impaired QWL. By contrast, satisfaction regarding COVID information received from the employer, and feeling valued by the general population during the pandemic improved QWL. Conclusions Insufficient access to screening, information, and protective measures impaired QWL of NSHW after the first wave of COVID-19 in Paris public hospitals. Social and professional recognition of night-shift work were the key determinants of QWL in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4226366959,"Changes in gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) phenology and distribution are related to observed and hypothesized prey availability, bottom water temperature, salinity, sea ice persistence, integrated water column and sediment chlorophyll a, and patterns of wind-driven biophysical forcing in the northern Bering and eastern Chukchi seas. This portion of the Pacific Arctic includes four Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) sampling regions. In the Bering Strait area, passive acoustic data showed marked declines in gray whale calling activity coincident with unprecedented wintertime sea ice loss there in 2017-2019, although some whales were seen there during DBO cruises in those years. In the northern Bering Sea, sightings during DBO cruises show changes in gray whale distribution coincident with a shrinking field of infaunal amphipods, with a significant decrease in prey abundance (r = -0.314, p<0.05) observed in the DBO 2 region over the 2010-2019 period. In the eastern Chukchi Sea, sightings during broad scale aerial surveys show that gray whale distribution is associated with localized areas of high infaunal crustacean abundance. Although infaunal crustacean prey abundance was unchanged in DBO regions 3, 4 and 5, a mid-decade shift in gray whale distribution corresponded to both: (i) a localized increase in infaunal prey abundance in DBO regions 4 and 5, and (ii) a correlation of whale relative abundance with wind patterns that can influence epi-benthic and pelagic prey availability. Specifically, in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, increased sighting rates (whales/km) associated with an ~110 km (60 nm) offshore shift in distribution was positively correlated with large scale and local wind patterns conducive to increased availability of krill. In the southern Chukchi Sea, gray whale distribution clustered in all years near an amphipod-krill 'hotspot' associated with a 50-60m deep trough. We discuss potential impacts of observed and inferred prey shifts on gray whale nutrition in the context of an ongoing unusual gray whale mortality event. To conclude, we use the conceptual Arctic Marine Pulses (AMP) model to frame hypotheses that may guide future research on whales in the Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W4226036078,"If biochar is to be used for carbon (C) management, we must understand how weathering or ageing affects biochar C mineralization. Here, we incubated aged and unaged eastern white pine wood biochar produced at 350 and 550°C with a Streptomyces isolate, a putative biochar-decomposing microbe. Ageing was accelerated via three different processes, namely, (a) physical ageing-subjecting biochar to alternating freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles, (b) chemical ageing-treating biochar with concentrated hydrogen peroxide and (c) biological ageing-incubating biochar in the presence of nutrients and microorganisms. Elemental composition and surface chemistry (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) of biochar samples were compared before and after ageing. Biochar C mineralization between ageing treatments was significantly different in the case of 350°C biochar (p value = 0.03). Among the 350°C biochars, physical ageing resulted in the greatest increase (by 103%) in biochar C mineralization (p value = 0.05). However, in the case of 550°C biochar, ageing did not result in a significant change in biochar C mineralization (p value = 0.40). Biochar C mineralization was positively correlated with an increase in O/C ratio post-ageing (rs = 0.86, p value = 0.01). In the case of 350°C biochar, surface oxidation during ageing enhanced biochar degradation by the isolate. For 550°C biochar, however, ageing did not significantly increase biochar C mineralization, likely due to high condensed aromatic C content and lower surface oxidation during ageing. The results from our study suggest that low temperature aged biochar is more susceptible to biological degradation by soil microbes. These findings have implications for the use of biochar for long term C storage in soils."
https://openalex.org/W4226086476,"Breastfeeding self-efficacy is known to positively influence breastfeeding behaviors. While previous research has studied the determinants of breastfeeding self-efficacy in general, these determinants are unstudied among postpartum women in rural China. This study aims to describe the breastfeeding self-efficacy of postpartum women in rural China and identify determinants of breastfeeding self-efficacy using the Dennis breastfeeding self-efficacy framework.Using a multi-stage random cluster sampling design, cross-sectional survey data were collected from 787 women within the 0-6 months postpartum period in 80 rural townships. Surveys collected data on breastfeeding self-efficacy, characteristics related to the Dennis breastfeeding self-efficacy framework, and demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify determinants of breastfeeding self-efficacy.Participants reported a moderate level of breastfeeding self-efficacy, with an item mean score of 3.50. Self-efficacy was lowest for exclusive breastfeeding. Breastfeeding attitudes (β = 0.088, P< 0.001), breastfeeding family support (β = 0.168, P< 0.001), and social support from significant others (β = 0.219, P< 0.001) were positively associated with breastfeeding self-efficacy. Breastfeeding problems, including trouble with latching (β = -0.170, P< 0.001), not producing enough milk (β = -0.148, P< 0.001), and milk taking too long to secrete (β = -0.173, P< 0.001) were negatively associated with breastfeeding self-efficacy.The findings indicate that positive attitudes, breastfeeding family support and social support contribute to greater breastfeeding self-efficacy in rural China, whereas difficulties with breastfeeding are associated with reduced self-efficacy. Researchers and practitioners should investigate effective strategies to improve social support and family support for breastfeeding, promote positive attitudes towards breastfeeding, and provide women with actionable solutions to breastfeeding problems."
https://openalex.org/W4226244451,"Cell-free protein expression is increasingly becoming popular for biotechnology, biomedical and research applications. Among cell-free systems, the most popular one is based on Escherichia coli (E. coli). Endogenous nucleases in E. coli cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) degrade the free ends of DNA, resulting in inefficient protein expression from linear DNA templates. RecBCD is a nuclease complex that plays a major role in nuclease activity in E. coli, with the RecB subunit possessing the actual nuclease activity. We created a RecB knockout of an E. coli strain optimized for cell-free expression. We named this new strain Akaby. We demonstrated that Akaby TXTL successfully reduced linear DNA degradations, rescuing the protein expression efficiency from the linear DNA templates. The practicality of Akaby for TXTL is an efficient, simple alternative for linear template expression in cell-free reactions. We also use this work as a model protocol for modifying the TXTL source E. coli strain, enabling the creation of TXTL systems with other custom modifications."
https://openalex.org/W4225933703,"Investigations of organic lithic micro-residues have, over the last decade, shifted from entirely morphological observations using visible-light microscopy to compositional ones using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy, providing a seemingly objective chemical basis for residue identifications. Contamination, though, remains a problem that can affect these results. Modern contaminants, accumulated during the post-excavation lives of artifacts, are pervasive, subtle, and even ""invisible"" (unlisted ingredients in common lab products). Ancient contamination is a second issue. The aim of residue analysis is to recognize residues related to use, but other types of residues can also accumulate on artifacts. Caves are subject to various taphonomic forces and organic inputs, and use-related residues can degrade into secondary compounds. This organic ""background noise"" must be taken into consideration. Here we show that residue contamination is more pervasive than is often appreciated, as revealed by our studies of Middle Palaeolithic artifacts from two sites: Lusakert Cave 1 in Armenia and Crvena Stijena in Montenegro. First, we explain how artifacts from Lusakert Cave 1, despite being handled following specialized protocols, were tainted by a modern-day contaminant from an unanticipated source: a release agent used inside the zip-top bags that are ubiquitous in the field and lab. Second, we document that, when non-artifact ""controls"" are studied alongside artifacts from Crvena Stijena, comparisons reveal that organic residues are adhered to both, indicating that they are prevalent throughout the sediments and not necessarily related to use. We provide suggestions for reducing contamination and increasing the reliability of residue studies. Ultimately, we propose that archaeologists working in the field of residue studies must start with the null hypothesis that miniscule organic residues reflect contamination, either ancient or modern, and systematically proceed to rule out all possible contaminants before interpreting them as evidence of an artifact's use in the distant past."
https://openalex.org/W4225742486,"Malaria is the disease caused by Plasmodium species and primarily transmitted by the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. During pregnancy, malaria causes life threatening outcomes to the mother, the fetus and the new born. Even though, malaria symptomatic pregnant women highly attract mosquitoes and have higher potential of transmitting the disease in communities, most of the previous studies focused on pregnant women with asymptomatic Plasmodium infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malaria and associated factors among symptomatic pregnant women attending antenatal care at three health centers in northwest Ethiopia.A health facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April, 2021. A total of 312 malaria symptomatic pregnant women were involved from three health centers and enrolled by convenient sampling technique. A questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic and clinical data through face to face interview. Capillary blood samples were collected and used to prepare thin and thick blood smears, which were then stained using 10% Giemsa and examined under light microscope. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with malaria. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated and P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The prevalence of malaria among symptomatic pregnant women was 20.8% (65/312) of which 12.2% (38/312), 4.8% (15/312) and 3.8% (12/312) were P. falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infections, respectively. Being illiterate (p< 0.001), first trimester (p = 0.036), primigravidae (p<0.001), living far from health center (p<0.001), not sleeping under long lasting insecticide treated nets (p<0.001) and living near irrigation areas (p = 0.006) were significantly associated with prevalence of malaria in malaria symptomatic pregnant women.Even though prevalence of malaria is decreasing in the country because of scale-up of intervention and prevention measures, this study showed that, malaria is still the major public health problem among pregnant women. Being illiterate, first trimester, primigravidae, living far from health centers, not sleeping under long lasting insecticide treated nets and living near irrigation areas were factors that increased the prevalence of malaria in malaria symptomatic pregnant women. Therefore, special attention should be given to pregnant women prone to these factors."
https://openalex.org/W4226029933,"Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is responsible for about 30-50 percent of visits to health facilities and for about 20-30 percent of admissions to hospitals in Nepal for children under 5 years old. Incidence of ARI in children among under-five years of age is 344 per 1000 in Nepal. Hence, the study aims to find out the prevalence and factors associated with acute respiratory infection among under-five children.A cross-sectional study was conducted at Nepal Medical College and Teaching Hospital and International Friendship Children's Hospital (IFCH) in Kathmandu among children of age 2-59 months attending Pediatric OPD. A total of 286 children were selected using the non-probability (convenient) sampling technique. Data were collected using pre-tested semi-structured tool through interview schedule, and descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used.Out of 286 children, more than half of children (60.8%) had Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Nearly one-fifth of the children had severe or very severe pneumonia. Acute respiratory infection was significantly associated with religion followed by the family (p = 0.009, OR = 4.59 CI = 1.47-14.36), presence of the child in the kitchen while cooking (p = 0.001, OR = 2.03 CI = 1.17-3.51), and presence of respiratory tract infection in family (p = <0.001 OR = 2.83 CI = 1.59-5.05).The study concluded that male children are more susceptible to acute respiratory infection than female children. Parents and family members should be aware of the prevention of acute respiratory infection by addressing and minimizing the factors contributing to ARI."
https://openalex.org/W4226044193,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection is a major health problem and leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Several point and deletion mutations on the PreS/S gene have been intensively considered associated with HCC. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of HBV PreS/S mutations in Vietnamese CHB-infected patients and their association with HCC.This cross-sectional study was conducted from 02/2020 to 03/2021, recruited Vietnamese CHB-infected patients with HBV-DNA >3 log10-copies/mL and successful PreS/S gene sequencing. Mutations were detected by direct Sanger sequencing.247 CHB-infected patients were recruited, characterized by 68.8% males, 54.7% HBV genotype B, 57.5% HBeAg positive, 23.1% fibrosis score ≥F3 and 19.8% HCC. 61.8% amino acid replacements were detected throughout the PreS1/PreS2/S genes. The most common point-mutations included N/H51Y/T/S/Q/P (30.4%), V68T/S/I (44.9%), T/N87S/T/P (46.2%) on PreS1 gene; T125S/N/P (30.8%), I150T (42.5%) on PreS2 gene; S53L (37.7%), A184V/G (39.3%), S210K/N/R/S (39.3%) on S gene. The rates of case(s) with any point-mutation on the Major Hydrophylic Region (MHR) and the ""a"" determinant region were 63.6% and 39.7%, respectively. Most of S point-mutations were presented with low rates such as T47A/E/V/K (9.3%), P120S/T (8.5%), G145R (2%). On multivariable analysis, males (OR = 4.51, 95%CI 1.78-11.4, p = 0.001), age≥40 (OR = 5.5, 95%CI 2.06-14.68, p = 0.001), W4P/R/Y on PreS1 (OR = 11.56, 95%CI 1.99-67.05, p = 0.006) and 4 S point-mutations as: T47A/E/V/K (OR = 3.67, 95%CI 1.19-11.29, p = 0.023), P120S/T (OR = 3.38, 95%CI 1.09-10.49, p = 0.035), S174N (OR = 29.73, 95%CI 2.12-417.07, p = 0.012), P203R (OR = 8.45, 95%CI 1.43-50.06, p = 0.019) were associated with HCC.We detected 61% amino acid changes on PreS/S regions in Vietnamese CHB patients. One point-mutation at amino acid 4 on PreS1 gene and 4 point-mutations at amino acids 47, 120, 174, and 203 on S gene were associated with HCC. Further investigations are recommended to further clarify the relationship and interaction between mutations in HBV genome and HCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W4226101114,"Although health inequalities in adolescence are well documented, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Few studies have examined the role of the family in explaining the association between the family's socioeconomic position and adolescents' self-rated health. The current study aimed to explore whether the association between socioeconomic position and self-rated health was mediated by familial determinants.Using data from wave 2 of the""German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents"" (KiGGS) (1,838 female and 1,718 male 11- to 17-year-olds), linear regression analyses were conducted to decompose the total effects of income, education, occupational status, socioeconomic position index and adolescents' subjective social status on self-rated health into direct effects and indirect effects through familial determinants (family cohesion, parental well-being, parental stress, parenting styles, parental obesity, smoking and sporting activity).A significant total effect of all socioeconomic position indicators on self-rated health was found, except for income in male adolescents. In female adolescents, more than 70% of the total effects of each socioeconomic position indicator were explained by familial mediators, whereas no significant direct effects remained. The most important mediator was parental well-being, followed by family cohesion, parental smoking and sporting activity. In male adolescents, the associations between income, parental education, the socioeconomic position index and subjective social status were also mediated by familial determinants (family cohesion, parental smoking, obesity and living in a single-mother family). However, a significant direct effect of subjective social status remained.The analysis revealed how a family's position of socioeconomic disadvantage can lead to poorer health in adolescents through different family practices. The family appears to play an important role in explaining health inequalities, particularly in female adolescents. Reducing health inequalities in adolescence requires policy interventions (macro-level), community-based strategies (meso-level) and programs to improve parenting and family functioning (micro-level)."
https://openalex.org/W4225713936,"The impact-induced fragmentation of rock is widely and frequently encountered when natural hazards occur in mountainous areas. This type of fragmentation is an important and complex natural process that should be described. In this study, laboratory impact tests under different impact velocities were first conducted using a novel gas-driven rock impact apparatus. The three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D DIC) technique was used to monitor the dynamic fragmentation process upon impact. Then, coupled 3D finite-discrete element method (FDEM) numerical simulations were performed to numerically investigate the energy and damage evolutions and fragmentation characteristics of the sample under different impact velocities. The laboratory test results show that as the impact velocity increases, the failure pattern of the rock sample gradually changes from shear failure to splitting failure, and the fragmentation intensity increases obviously. The strain localization area gradually increases as the impact velocity increases and as the location gradually deviates away from the impacting face. In the numerical simulation, the proposed model is validated by quasi-static uniaxial compression tests and impact tests. The numerical simulations clearly show the progressive fracture process of the samples, which agrees well with the experimental observations. The evolutions of energy and damage variables were also derived based on the simulation results, which are markedly affected by the impact velocity. The fragment size distributions based on mass and number can be well fitted using a generalized extreme value law. Finally, the distribution of the fragment flying velocity and angle are analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W4225913208,"Governments around the world are seeking to slow the spread of Covid-19 and reduce hospitalisations by encouraging mass vaccinations for Covid-19. The success of this policy depends on most of the population accepting the vaccine and then being vaccinated. Understanding and predicting the motivation of individuals to be vaccinated is, therefore, critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of a mass vaccination programme in slowing the spread of the virus. In this paper we draw on the I3 Response Framework to understand and predict the willingness of New Zealanders to be vaccinated for Covid-19. The Framework differs from most studies predicting willingness to be vaccinated because it is based on the idea that the willingness to adopt a behaviour depends on both involvement (a measure of motivational strength) with the behaviour and attitudes towards the behaviour. We show that predictions of individuals' willingness to be vaccinated are improved using involvement and attitudes together, compared to attitudes alone. This result has important implications for the implementation of mass vaccination programmes for Covid-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225673903,"Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets are an effective tool in reducing malaria transmission. However, with increasing insecticide resistance little is known about how physiologically resistant malaria vectors behave around a human-occupied bed net, despite their importance in malaria transmission. We used the Mbita bednet trap to assess the host-seeking behavior of insecticide-resistant Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes under semi-field conditions. The trap incorporates a mosquito netting panel which acts as a mechanical barrier that prevents host-seeking mosquitoes from reaching the human host baiting the trap. Methods Susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant colonies of female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes aged 3–5 days old were used in this study. The laboratory-bred mosquitoes were color-marked with fluorescent powders and released inside a semi-field environment where a human subject slept inside a bednet trap erected in a traditional African hut. The netting panel inside the trap was either untreated (control) or deltamethrin-impregnated. The mosquitoes were released outside the hut. Only female mosquitoes were used. A window exit trap was installed on the hut to catch mosquitoes exiting the hut. A prokopack aspirator was used to collect indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes. In addition, clay pots were placed outside the hut to collect outdoor resting mosquitoes. The F1 progeny of wild-caught mosquitoes were also used in these experiments. Results The mean number of resistant mosquitoes trapped in the deltamethrin-impregnated bed net trap was higher (mean = 50.21± 3.7) compared to susceptible counterparts (mean + 22.4 ± 1.31) (OR = 1.445; P&lt;0.001). More susceptible mosquitoes were trapped in an untreated (mean = 51.9 ± 3.6) compared to a deltamethrin-treated bed net trap (mean = 22.4 ± 1.3) (OR = 2.65; P&lt;0.001). Resistant mosquitoes were less likely to exit the house when a treated bed net was present compared to the susceptible mosquitoes. The number of susceptible mosquitoes caught resting outdoors (mean + 28.6 ± 2.22) when a treated bed net was hanged was higher than when untreated bednet was present inside the hut (mean = 4.6 ± 0.74). The susceptible females were 2.3 times more likely to stay outdoors away from the treated bed net (OR = 2.25; 95% CI = [1.7–2.9]; P&lt;0.001). Conclusion The results show that deltamethrin-treatment of netting panels inside the bednet trap did not alter the host-seeking behavior of insecticide-resistant female An . gambiae mosquitoes. On the contrary, susceptible females exited the hut and remained outdoors when a treated net was used. However, further investigations of the behavior of resistant mosquitoes under natural conditions should be undertaken to confirm these observations and improve the current intervention which are threatened by insecticide resistance and altered vector behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4225686888,"Lingzhi has long been regarded as having life-prolonging effects. Research in recent years has also reported that Lingzhi possesses anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective, and anti-lipogenic effects. The D-galactose (D-gal, 100 mg/kg/day)-induced aging Long-Evans rats were simultaneously orally administered a DMSO extract of Ganoderma tsugae (GTDE, 200 μg/kg/day) for 25 weeks to investigate the effects of GTDE on oxidative stress and memory deficits in the D-galactose-induced aging rats. We found that GTDE significantly improved the locomotion and spatial memory and learning in the aging rats. GTDE alleviated the aging-induced reduction of dendritic branching in neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Immunoblotting revealed a significant increase in the protein expression levels of the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and catalase, and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats that received GTDE. D-gal-induced increase in the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was significantly attenuated after the administration of GTDE, and pyrin domain-containing 3 protein (NLRP3) revealed a significant decrease in NLRP3 expression after GTDE administration. Lastly, GTDE significantly reduced the advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). In conclusion, GTDE increases antioxidant capacity and BDNF expression of the brain, protects the dendritic structure of neurons, and reduces aging-induced neuronal damage, thereby attenuating cognitive impairment caused by aging."
https://openalex.org/W4225807017,"Interspinous spacer devices used in interspinous fixation surgery remove soft tissues in the lumbar spine, such as ligaments and muscles and may cause degenerative diseases in adjacent segments its stiffness is higher than that of the lumbar spine. Therefore, this study aimed to structurally and kinematically optimize a lumbar interspinous fixation device (LIFD) using a full lumbar finite element model that allows for minimally invasive surgery, after which the normal behavior of the lumbar spine is not affected. The proposed healthy and degenerative lumbar spine models reflect the physiological characteristics of the lumbar spine in the human body. The optimum number of spring turns and spring wire diameter in the LIFD were selected as 3 mm and 2 turns, respectively-from a dynamic range of motion (ROM) perspective rather than a structural maximum stress perspective-by applying a 7.5 N∙m extension moment and 500 N follower load to the LIFD-inserted lumbar spine model. As the spring wire diameter in the LIFD increased, the maximum stress generated in the LIFD increased, and the ROM decreased. Further, as the number of spring turns decreased, both the maximum stress and ROM of the LIFD increased. When the optimized LIFD was inserted into a degenerative lumbar spine model with a degenerative disc, the facet joint force of the L3-L4 lumbar segment was reduced by 56%-98% in extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. These results suggest that the optimized device can strengthen the stability of the lumbar spine that has undergone interspinous fixation surgery and reduce the risk of degenerative diseases at the adjacent lumbar segments."

This study compared respiratory symptoms, using a modified European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire, between construction workers (n = 208) and a reference group of bus drivers and retail workers (n = 142). Within the construction workers, we assessed the effect of collective (on-tool vacuum/'wet-cut' systems) and personal (respirators) exposure controls on symptom prevalence. Logistic regression assessed differences between groups, adjusted for age, ethnicity, and smoking status. Construction workers were more likely to cough with phlegm at least once a week (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) and cough with phlegm ≥3 months/year for ≥2 years (OR 2.8, CI 1.2-7.0), but they had similar or fewer asthma symptoms. Construction workers who had worked for 11-20 years reported more cough/phlegm symptoms (OR 5.1, 1.7-15.0 for cough with phlegm ≥3 months/year for ≥2 years) than those who had worked <10 years (OR 1.9, 0.6-5.8), when compared to the reference group. Those who used 'wet-cut' methods reported less cough with phlegm, although the evidence for this association was weak (OR 0.4, CI 0.2-1.1 for cough with phlegm at least once a week); use of on-tool extraction showed a similar trend. No associations between respiratory protective equipment-use and symptoms were found. In conclusion, construction workers reported more symptoms suggestive of bronchitis, particularly those employed in the industry for >10 years. Use of collective dust exposure controls might protect against these symptoms, but this requires confirmation in a larger study."
https://openalex.org/W4226023821,"Northeast China is an important ecological barrier and commodity grain base in China. The coupling coordination relationship between geology-geomorphology and ecology has become a critical background condition for ecosystem protection and sustainable development. Taking Northeast China as a case (accounting for about 13% of China's land area), 9 divisions are divided according to the characteristics of regional ecology and geology-geomorphology, and 17 indicators are selected to build an evaluation index system. Methods of analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight and game theory are used to determine the index weights. Based on the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, the spatial coupling coordination characteristics of geology-geomorphology and ecology are studied. The variation characteristics of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are evaluated by Sen+Mann-Kendall (Sen+MK) method. Our results are as follows. (1) The coupling between geology-geomorphology and ecology is strong, but the spatial differentiation of CCD is obvious. Nine divisions are evaluated as two high-level, three medium-level and three low-level coordination types and one mild imbalance type. (2) The plain divisions Ⅰ and Ⅳ where the typical black soil belt is located are high coordination types. Restricted by geology-geomorphological conditions or ecological conditions, mountain divisions Ⅲ and Ⅶ and plain division Ⅴ are moderate coordination types, mountain divisions Ⅱ and Ⅷ and plateau division Ⅸ are low coordination types, and mountain division Ⅵ is mild imbalance type. (3) The variation trend of NDVI shows a significant increase in divisions Ⅲ, Ⅴ, Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅶ. it shows a significant decrease in part of divisions Ⅳ, Ⅵ, Ⅷ and Ⅸ, and ecological management and construction should be strengthened in these divisions. The research shows that the CCD model method is feasible for evaluating the relationship between geology-geomorphology and ecology and can provide eco-geological background information for Northeast China."
https://openalex.org/W4226127122,"Abnormal expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is involved in the tumor-promoting ability of CAFs. Hsa_ circ_ 0056686 has been reported to affect leiomyoma size. The purpose of this study is to investigate the regulatory role of hsa_circ_0056686 in CAFs on uterine leiomyoma (ULM). The primary CAFs and corresponding normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the tumor zones of ULM tissues and adjacent, respectively. Hsa_circ_0056686 level was higher in CAFs than NFs, and also higher in ULM tissues than in adjacent tissues. CAFs-CM significantly increased the proliferation and migration and inhibited apoptosis of ULM cells, as confirmed by CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Moreover, conditioned medium (CM) from CAFs transfected with hsa_circ_0056686 shRNA (CAFssh-circ_0056686-CM) abolished CAFs-mediated proliferation, migration and apoptosis of ULM cells. CAFs-CM suppressed the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) marker proteins and induced the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) marker proteins, thus suppressing ERS and increasing ECM accumulation, which could be declined by CAFssh-circ_0056686-CM. Meanwhile, knockdown of hsa_circ_0056686 reversed the inhibitory effects of CAFs-CM on brefeldin A-induced cell apoptosis. Luciferase gene reporter and RNA pull-down assays indicated that miR-515-5p directly bound with hsa_circ_0056686. MiR-515-5p overexpression restored the hsa_circ_0056686-shRNA-mediated malignant biological behaviors of ULM cells. Hsa_circ_0056686 contributed to tumor-promoting effects of CAFs in ULM, manifested by promoting ULM cell proliferation and migration and reducing ERS-induced apoptosis through sponging miR-515-5p."
https://openalex.org/W4226165808,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an urgent need for identifying potential therapeutic drugs. In the first half of 2020 tropic antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxochloroquine (HCQ) were the focus of tremendous public attention. In the initial periods of the pandemic, many scientific results pointed out that CQ/HCQ could be very effective for patients with severe COVID. While CQ and HCQ have successfully been used against several diseases (such as malaria, autoimmune disease and rheumatic illnesses); long term use of these agents are associated with serious adverse effects (i.e. inducing acute kidney injury, among many others) due to their role in blocking autophagy-dependent self-degradation. Recent experimental and clinical trial data also confirmed that there is no sufficient evidence about the efficient usage of CQ/HCQ against COVID-19. By using systems biology techniques, here we show that the cellular effect of CQ/HCQ on autophagy during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or following SARS-CoV-2 infection results in upregulation of ER stress. By presenting a simple mathematical model, we claim that although CQ/HCQ might be able to ameliorate virus infection, the permanent inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ has serious negative effects on the cell. Since CQ/HCQ promotes apoptotic cell death, here we confirm that addition of CQ/HCQ cannot be really effective even in severe cases. Only a transient treatment seemed to be able to avoid apoptotic cell death, but this type of therapy could not limit virus replication in the infected host. The presented theoretical analysis clearly points out the utility and applicability of systems biology modelling to test the cellular effect of a drug targeting key major processes, such as autophagy and apoptosis. Applying these approaches could decrease the cost of pre-clinical studies and facilitate the selection of promising clinical trials in a timely fashion."
https://openalex.org/W4226343819,"In the age of the data deluge there are still many domains and applications restricted to the use of small datasets. The ability to harness these small datasets to solve problems through the use of supervised learning methods can have a significant impact in many important areas. The insufficient size of training data usually results in unsatisfactory performance of machine learning algorithms. The current research work aims to contribute to mitigate the small data problem through the creation of artificial instances, which are added to the training process. The proposed algorithm, Geometric Small Data Oversampling Technique, uses geometric regions around existing samples to generate new high quality instances. Experimental results show a significant improvement in accuracy when compared with the use of the initial small dataset as well as other popular artificial data generation techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4223451035,"The circulation of livestock pathogens in the pig industry is strongly related to animal movements. Epidemiological models developed to understand the circulation of pathogens within the industry should include the probability of transmission via between-farm contacts. The pig industry presents a structured network in time and space, whose composition changes over time. Therefore, to improve the predictive capabilities of epidemiological models, it is important to identify the drivers of farmers' choices in terms of trade partnerships. Combining complex network analysis approaches and exponential random graph models, this study aims to analyze patterns of the swine industry network and identify key factors responsible for between-farm contacts at the French scale. The analysis confirms the topological stability of the network over time while highlighting the important roles of companies, types of farm, farm sizes, outdoor housing systems and batch-rearing systems. Both approaches revealed to be complementary and very effective to understand the drivers of the network. Results of this study are promising for future developments of epidemiological models for livestock diseases. This study is part of the One Health European Joint Programme: BIOPIGEE."
https://openalex.org/W4225508514,"Malaria is often most endemic in remote regions where diagnostic microscopy services are unavailable. In such regions, the use of rapid diagnostic tests fails to quantify parasitemia measurements which reflect the concentration of Plasmodium parasites in the bloodstream. Thus, novel diagnostic and monitoring technologies capable of providing such information could improve the quality of treatment, monitoring, and eradication efforts. A low-cost, portable microscope for gathering quantitative parasitemia data from fluorescently stained thin blood smears is presented. The system employs bimodal imaging using components optimized for cost savings, system robustness, and optical performance. The microscope is novel for its use of monochromatic visible illumination paired with a long working distance singlet aspheric objective lens that can image both traditionally mounted and cartridge-based blood smears. Eight dilutions of red blood cells containing laboratory cultured wild-type P . falciparum were used to create thin smears which were stained with SYBR Green-1 fluorescent dye. Two subsequent images are captured for each field-of-view, with brightfield images providing cell counts and fluorescence images providing parasite localization data. Results indicate the successful resolution of sub-micron sized parasites, and parasitemia measurements from the prototype microscope display linear correlation with measurements from a benchtop microscope with a limit of detection of 0.18 parasites per 100 red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W4225919471,"Objective This study aimed to determine caregivers’ perspectives on difficulties encountered while seeking care for adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). It explored the social, emotional, and financial impact of caring for an adolescent with SCD on their caregivers. Study design A mixed-method study in a major tertiary care hospital in Bahrain was conducted between June and August 2019. Cross-sectional questionnaires and thematic analyzed interviews were performed with 101 and 18 Bahraini caregivers of adolescents with SCD (aged 10–18 years), respectively. Results Lack of parking lots (52.5%) and traffic jams (27%) were identified as the most common challenges in seeking hospital care for adolescents with SCD. These difficulties, including prolonged waiting in the emergency room, discouraged more than half of the caregivers who preferred to seek care from smaller healthcare centers. Most caregivers reported receiving a high degree of support from their families, who emotionally encouraged them to facilitate patient care (73.3%). Therefore, their relationships with their friends, colleagues, and relatives were not significantly affected. Catastrophic health expenditure occurred in 14.8% of caregivers. Qualitative themes that emerged were A) the intricacy of caring for adolescents with SCD , B) dissatisfaction with hospital facilities , and C) insufficient healthcare services , wherein caregivers reported adolescents’ experiences with services during hospital visits. Subthemes for the intricacy of caring for adolescents with SCD were 1) the psychological tragedy , summarizing the initial caregivers’ feelings after the confirmed diagnosis, 2) caregiving hardships that described the caregivers’ emotional and health burden while accepting and adjusting to the disease, and 3) the cost of care on families , which highlights the financial burden of the disease on families. Conclusion The caregivers of adolescents with SCD experienced several overwhelming challenges, including problems in accessing healthcare and receiving medical services, in addition to influences on the emotional, financial, and social aspects of their lives."
https://openalex.org/W4225932718,"This study aimed to examine associations of dietary quality and diversity among reproductive-aged women with overweight and obesity. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Health and Demographic Surveillance System of the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) in Tanzania. A random sample of 1004 non-pregnant women was selected from the DUCS population database and interviewed about dietary information using the FFQ. Women were aged 30.2 (±8.1) years; 27.8% were overweight and 22.6% were obese. All 1004 women in the study consumed starchy staple foods. Of all the women studied, 10.5%, 1.7% and 3.8% consumed vitamin A rich dark green vegetables, nuts and seeds, and beans and peas, respectively. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of Prime Dietary Quality Score (PDQS), those who were in the highest quintile were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio (APR) = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.62, 0.89) (F for trend = 0.029). Dietary diversity score (DDS) was not significantly associated with overweight and obesity. Risk factors included the highest consumption of animal foods (APR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.51-3.51) and fast food (APR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.24-4.34). Consumption of legumes and whole grains was associated with lower risk (APR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38-0.2). Dietary quality is an important predictor of overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age. Nutrition interventions may be warranted to support women of reproductive age to enter pregnancy with healthier weight to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and future risk of chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4225984736,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) of the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are parasites which kill and reproduce within insects. While both have life cycles centred around their developmentally arrested, nonfeeding and stress tolerant infective juvenile (IJ) stage, they are relatively distantly related. These IJs are promising biocontrol agents, and their shelf life and stress tolerance may be enhanced by storage at low temperatures. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the proteome of the IJs of two distantly related EPN species is affected by storage at 9°C (for up to 9 weeks) and 20°C (for up to 6 weeks), using label-free quantitative proteomics. Overall, more proteins were detected in S. carpocapsae (2422) than in H. megidis (1582). The S. carpocapsae proteome was strongly affected by temperature, while the H. megidis proteome was affected by both time and temperature. The proteins which increased in abundance to the greatest extent in S. carpocapsae IJs after conditioning at 9°C were chaperone proteins, and proteins related to stress. The proteins which increased in abundance the most after storage at 20°C were proteins related to the cytoskeleton, cell signalling, proteases and their inhibitors, which may have roles in infection. The proteins which decreased in abundance to the greatest extent in S. carpocapsae after both 9°C and 20°C storage were those associated with metabolism, stress and the cytoskeleton. After storage at both temperatures, the proteins increased to the greatest extent in H. megidis IJs were those associated with the cytoskeleton, cell signalling and carbon metabolism, and the proteins decreased in abundance to the greatest extent were heat shock and ribosomal proteins, and those associated with metabolism. As the longest-lived stage of the EPN life cycle, IJs may be affected by proteostatic stress, caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates. The substantial increase of chaperone proteins in S. carpocapsae, and to a greater extent at 9°C, and the general decrease in ribosomal and chaperone proteins in H. megidis may represent species-specific proteostasis mechanisms. Similarly, organisms accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) over time and both species exhibited a gradual increase in proteins which enhance ROS tolerance, such as catalase. The species-specific responses of the proteome in response to storage temperature, and over time, may reflect the phylogenetic distance and/or different ecological strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4226000138,"Globally, biosecurity is instrumental in prevention, control and management of livestock diseases and protection of human health. It is defined, prescribed, adopted and enforced through global, regional and national frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. There is more biosecurity practice research conducted in developed countries than developing ones. Consequently, the gap between the ideals recommended in biosecurity frameworks and what is practical in under-resourced rural settings is poorly understood. This anthropological study sought to assess adoption of biosecurity practices across a cattle, sheep and goat value chains continuum to demonstrate where risks lie. The cross-sectional mixed-methods study took place in Baringo County, Kenya. Qualitatively, it utilized 26 focus group discussions with community members and 10 observational interviews with slaughter facility workers. Quantitatively, it included a household survey with 560 community members and a separate survey with 231 livestock traders. Results show that producers, traders and slaughter facility workers did observe some biosecurity practices but not others due but not limited to personal preference, limitations in veterinary service delivery and enforcement of some biosecurity measures, and lack of requisite infrastructure. The study concludes that the implementation of biosecurity measures in rural settings is more complex than envisioned in biosecurity policies and frameworks. It can be hampered by resource limitations, poor enforcement, and contestations with cultural practices. The study recommends that further studies on willingness to adopt biosecurity measures targeting community members in under-resourced settings be conducted to identify possible critical points of intervention at county and national levels."
https://openalex.org/W4226092298,"Background Leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates such as Plasmodium falciparum surface protein 25 ( Pfs25 gene) may undergo antigenic alterations which may render them ineffective or allele-specific. This study examines the level of genetic diversity, signature of selection and drivers of Pfs25 polymorphisms of parasites population in regions of western Kenya with varying malaria transmission intensities. Methods Dry blood spots (DBS) were collected in 2018 and 2019 from febrile outpatients with malaria at health facilities in malaria-endemic areas of Homa Bay, Kisumu (Chulaimbo) and the epidemic-prone highland area of Kisii. Parasites DNA were extracted from DBS using Chelex method. Species identification was performed using real-time PCR. The 460 base pairs (domains 1–4) of the Pfs25 were amplified and sequenced for a total of 180 P . falciparum -infected blood samples. Results Nine of ten polymorphic sites were identified for the first time. Overall, Pfs25 exhibited low nucleotide diversity (0.04×10 −2 ) and low mutation frequencies (1.3% to 7.7%). Chulaimbo had the highest frequency (15.4%) of mutated sites followed by Kisii (6.7%) and Homa Bay (5.1%). Neutrality tests of Pfs25 variations showed significant negative values of Tajima’s D (-2.15, p&lt;0.01) and Fu’s F (-10.91, p&lt;0.001) statistics tests. Three loci pairs (123, 372), (364, 428) and (390, 394) were detected to be under linkage disequilibrium and none had history of recombination. These results suggested that purifying selection and inbreeding might be the drivers of the observed variation in Pfs25 . Conclusion Given the low level of nucleotide diversity, it is unlikely that a Pfs25 antigen-based vaccine would be affected by antigenic variations. However, continued monitoring of Pfs25 immunogenic domain 3 for possible variants that might impact vaccine antibody binding is warranted."

The rationale behind our biobanking are explorations of post-zygotic pathogenic gene variants, especially in non-tumoral tissue, which might predispose to cancers. The targeted diagnoses are carcinomas of the breast (via mastectomy or breast conserving surgery), colon and rectum, prostate, and urinary bladder (via cystectomy or transurethral resection), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma as well as metastases of colorectal cancer to the liver. The choice was based on the high incidence of these cancers and/or frequent fatal outcome. We also collect age-matched normal controls. Our still ongoing collection originates from five clinical centers and after nearly 2-year cooperation reached 1711 patients and controls, yielding a total of 23226 independent samples, with an average of 74 donors and 1010 samples collected per month. The predominant diagnosis is breast carcinoma, with 933 donors, followed by colorectal carcinoma (383 donors), prostate carcinoma (221 donors), bladder carcinoma (81 donors), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma (15 donors) and metachronous colorectal cancer metastases to liver (14 donors). Forty percent of the total sample count originates from macroscopically healthy cancer-neighboring tissue, while contribution from tumors is 12%, which adds to the uniqueness of our collection for cancer predisposition studies. Moreover, we developed two program packages, enabling registration of patients, clinical data and samples at the participating hospitals as well as the central system of sample/data management at coordinating center. The approach used by us may serve as a model for dispersed biobanking from multiple satellite hospitals. Our biobanking resource ought to stimulate research into genetic mechanisms underlying the development of common cancers. It will allow all available ""-omics"" approaches on DNA-, RNA-, protein- and tissue levels to be applied. The collected samples can be made available to other research groups."

Co-creation-in which artists together with patients create a work of art reflecting on aspects of the patients' life story-may be used to support patients to integrate such a contingent life event into their life story. We conducted a qualitative study in which we interviewed 10 professional artists to explore if co-creative art processes could facilitate integration of experiences of contingency in patients. Template analyses were performed in AtlasTi. We identified co-creation as a specific form of support to the process of integration of experiences of contingency. In the formation of a new life narrative, patients transcend the boundaries of their previous life narrative by changing their perspective. Self-transcendence forms a pivotal point in co-creation, which may be helpful for patients to integrate experiences of contingency into their life narratives."
https://openalex.org/W4225576382,"We used data collected during a variety of research cruises in the northeastern Chukchi Sea and contributed to the Distributed Biological Observatory to explore the influence of the seasonal change in water masses on the development of the seabird community during the summer. Surveys that included seabird observations and hydrographic sampling were conducted from Alaska's northwestern coast to ~220 km offshore during 2008-2018. Species composition varied geographically, shifting from a nearshore community that included short-tailed shearwaters, loons, and seaducks to an offshore community dominated by crested auklets. Crested auklets were remarkably consistent in their occupation of Hanna Shoal among years and remained in the area throughout the summer. Short-tailed shearwaters exhibited the greatest seasonal and interannual variation in abundance and distribution of the 35 species recorded. They were concentrated south of 71°N and within 50 km of shore in August and tended to spread throughout the region in September. Surface-feeding species like gulls, fulmars, and phalaropes were 1-2 orders of magnitude less abundant and had wider distributions than birds that feed by diving. Including information about hydrography improved the fit of models of seabird density. Seabirds, especially those that breed in the Bering Sea, generally were more abundant in areas dominated by moderate-salinity Bering Sea Water than nearshore in low-salinity Alaska Coastal Water. The distribution of seabirds across the northeastern Chukchi Sea reflected the heterogeneity of oceanic habitats and prey availability over the shallow shelf. Our results will inform efforts to develop ecosystem models that incorporate oceanographic conditions to predict ongoing consequences of climate change."

We also accounted for the combined association of chronic physical conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk at work in relation to depressive symptoms, given that occupational infection risk might put additional psychological burden among those with chronic physical conditions with risk of severe COVID-19 outcome.The study sample consisted of 2,440 staff members who participated in a health survey conducted at the national medical institution during period between October 2020 and December 2020. Participants who reported at least one chronic physical condition that were deemed risk factors of severe COVID-19 outcome were regarded as having chronic physical conditions. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We performed logistic regression analysis to assess the association between chronic physical conditions and depressive symptoms.Our results showed that the presence of chronic physical conditions was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.02). In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly higher among healthcare workers with chronic physical conditions who were at a higher occupational infection risk (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.04-3.16).Our findings suggest the importance of providing more assistance to those with chronic physical conditions regarding the prevention and control of mental health issues, particularly among frontline healthcare workers engaging in COVID-19-related work."
https://openalex.org/W4225971921,"Background Smoking or weight loss is a risk of tuberculosis (TB) development. However, the impact of weight change after smoking cessation on the occurrence of TB remains elusive. We aimed to determine the relationship between weight change after smoking cessation and the risk of TB development. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study using the national database in Republic of Korea. Of the 10,490,491 subjects who underwent health check-up in 2009, we enrolled 9,953,124 subjects without a previous TB history and followed them until 2017. We divided all study participants into the following three groups: never, former, and current smokers. The primary endpoint was newly developed TB. Results Among 9,953,124 subjects analyzed, 5,922,845 (59.5%) were never smokers, 1,428,209 (14.4%) were former smokers, and 2,602,080 (26.1%) were current smokers. The risk of TB development was significantly higher in current smokers than in never smokers (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.158; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.131–1.186). Among current smokers, individuals who stopped smoking and maintained weight after baseline evaluation had a significantly lower risk of TB development compared with those who continued to smoke (aHR 0.771; 95% CI 0.741–0.892). However, even after smoking cessation, individuals who lost weight were at a significantly higher risk of TB development compared with those who continued to smoke (aHR 1.327; 95% CI 1.119–1.715). Conclusions Our findings suggest that smoking is a risk factor for TB and weight maintenance (neither gaining or losing) after quitting smoking might reduce the risk of TB development."

Koirala Lions Center for Ophthalmic Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal for a duration of one year. One hundred and eighty school aged children (71 female and 109 male) aged 7 to 17 years were included in the study. All the children underwent detailed ophthalmic and binocular vision examinations. The duration of the use of digital devices by the children were asked to either the parents or guardians present at the time of the study. The study participants were divided into two groups: children who used digital devices for the last six months (users group) and those who hadn't used digital devices for the last six months (non users group). The users group was again divided into two subgroups: children who used digital devices for less than 3 hours per day and a day per week (low digital device users subgroup) and children who used digital devices for more than 3 hours per day and all days in a week (high digital device users subgroup).Accommodative amplitudes, accommodative facility, and positive fusional vergence for both near and distance were significantly reduced in the high digital device users group than in the low digital device users subgroup (p <0.01). Stereo acuity, near point of convergence, and negative fusional vergences for both near and distance were not statistically significantly different between the two subgroups. Prevalence of accommodative and vergence anomalies (except convergence insufficiency) was more in the high digital device users subgroup than in the low digital device users subgroup (p<0.01).Children who used digital devices for a significantly greater amount of time had significantly reduced amplitudes of accommodation, accommodative facility, and positive fusional vergence both at near and distance."
https://openalex.org/W4226046584,"COVID-19 pandemic burdens the healthcare systems, causes healthcare avoidance, and might worsen the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. We aimed to estimate the impact of pandemic-related avoidance on outpatient IBD management, and the cost-effectiveness of adding telemonitoring during pandemic from the perspective of Hong Kong public healthcare provider.The study was performed by a decision-analytic model to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost of care for IBD patients before and during the pandemic, and to compare the cost and QALYs of adding telemonitoring to standard care (SC-TM) versus standard care alone (SC) for IBD patients during the pandemic. The sources of model inputs included publications (retrieved from literature search) and public data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the robustness of base-case results.Standard care with pandemic-related avoidance (versus without avoidance) lost 0.0026 QALYs at higher cost (by USD43). The 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations found standard care with pandemic-related avoidance lost QALYs and incurred higher cost in 100% and 96.82% of the time, respectively. Compared with the SC group, the SC-TM group saved 0.0248 QALYs and reduced cost by USD799. Monte Carlo simulations showed the SC-TM group gained higher QALYs at lower cost in 100% of 10,000 simulations.Standard care for IBD patients during pandemic with healthcare avoidance appears to worsen treatment outcomes at higher cost and lowered QALYs. The addition of telemonitoring to standard care seems to gain higher QALYs and reduce cost, and is therefore a potential cost-effective strategy for IBD management during the pandemic."

We therefore tested the association of incident colorectal cancer and genetic and epigenetic variability in PEAR1 among 2532 randomly recruited participants enrolled in the family-based Flemish Study on Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (51.2% women; mean age 44.8 years). All underwent genotyping of rs12566888 located in intron 1 of the PEAR1 gene; in 926 participants, methylation at 16 CpG sites in the PEAR1 promoter was also assessed. Over 18.1 years (median), 49 colorectal cancers occurred, all in different pedigrees. While accounting for clustering of risk factors within families and adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, serum creatinine, plasma glucose, smoking and drinking, use of antiplatelet and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, the hazard ratio of colorectal cancer contrasting minor-allele ( T ) carriers vs . major-allele ( GG ) homozygotes was 2.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.18–3.99; P = 0.013). Bootstrapped analyses, from which we randomly excluded from two to nine cancer cases, provided confirmatory results. In participants with methylation data, we applied partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and identified two methylation sites associated with higher colorectal cancer risk and two with lower risk. In-silico analysis suggested that methylation of the PEAR1 promoter at these four sites might affect binding of transcription factors p53, PAX5, and E2F-1, thereby modulating gene expression. In conclusion, our findings suggest that genetic and epigenetic variation in PEAR1 modulates the risk of colorectal cancer in white Flemish. To what extent, environmental factors as exemplified by our methylation data, interact with genetic predisposition and modulate penetrance of colorectal cancer risk is unknown."

Acute and chronic pain is often treated in a primary care out-of-hours (OOH) setting. This setting may be a driver of opioid use but the extent to which opioids are prescribed OOH is unknown. We aimed to investigate weak and strong opioid prescribing at OOH primary care services (PCS) in Flanders (Northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019.We performed a retrospective cross sectional study using data from routine electronic health records of OOH-PCSs in Flanders and the Netherlands (2015-2019). Our primary outcome was the opioid prescribing rate per 1000 OOH-contacts per year, in total and for strong (morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxycodone and naloxone, fentanyl, tapentadol, and buprenorphine and weak opioids (codeine combinations and tramadol and combinations) and type of opioids separately.Opioids were prescriped in approximately 2.5% of OOH-contacts in both Flanders and the Netherlands. In Flanders, OOH opioid prescribing went from 2.4% in 2015 to 2.1% in 2017 and then increased to 2.3% in 2019. In the Netherlands, opioid prescribing increased from 1.9% of OOH-contacts in 2015 to 2.4% in 2017 and slightly decreased thereafter to 2.1% of OOH-contacts. In 2019, in Flanders, strong opioids were prescribed in 8% of the OOH-contacts with an opioid prescription. In the Netherlands a strong opioid was prescribed in 57% of these OOH-contacts. Two thirds of strong opioids prescriptions in Flanders OOH were issued for patients over 75, in the Netherlands one third was prescribed to this age group.We observed large differences in strong opioid prescribing at OOH-PCSs between Flanders and the Netherlands that are likely to be caused by differences in accessibility of secondary care, and possibly existing opioid prescribing habits. Measures to ensure judicious and evidence-based opioid prescribing need to be tailored to the organisation of the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W4226189201,"To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic exposure on changes in alcohol use and mood from years 1 to 2 after traumatic brain injury (TBI).We used a difference-in-difference (DiD) study design to analyze data from 1,059 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database. We defined COVID-19 pandemic exposure as participants who received their year 1 post-injury interviews prior to January 1, 2020, and their year 2 interview between April 1, 2020 and January 15, 2021. Pandemic-unexposed participants had both year 1 and 2 follow-up interviews before January 1, 2020. We measured current alcohol use as any past month alcohol use, average number of drinks per drinking occasion, and past month binge drinking. We measured depression symptoms using Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7.We found persons with TBI exposed to the pandemic had greater increases in the average number of drinks per occasion from year 1 to 2 post-injury compared to pandemic-unexposed individuals (β = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.57, p = 0.001), with males, adults <65 years old, and Black and Hispanic subgroups showing the greatest increases in consumption. Though average consumption was elevated, changes in rates of any alcohol use or binge drinking by pandemic exposure were not observed. Overall, there were no significant changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms over time between pandemic exposed and unexposed groups; however, pandemic-exposed Hispanics with TBI reported significant increases in anxiety symptoms from year-1 to year-2 post-injury compared to pandemic-unexposed Hispanics (β = 2.35, 95% CI: 0.25, 4.47, p = 0.028).Among persons living with TBI, those exposed to the pandemic had significant increases in average alcohol consumption. Pandemic-exposed Hispanics with TBI had large elevations in anxiety symptoms, perhaps reflecting health inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, and suggesting a need for targeted monitoring of psychosocial distress."
https://openalex.org/W4226210015,"Approximately 2% of patients in primary care practice and up to 25% of hospital patients are registered as being allergic to an antibiotic. However, up to 90% of these registrations are incorrect, leading to unnecessary prescription of 2nd choice antibiotics with the attendant loss of efficacy, increased toxicity and antibiotic resistance. To improve registration, a better understanding is needed of how incorrect labels are attributed.To investigate the quality of antibiotic allergy registration in primary care and identify determinants to improve registration of antibiotic allergies.Registration of antibiotic allergies in primary care practices were analysed for 1) completeness and 2) correctness. To identify determinants for improvement, semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers from four healthcare domains were conducted.A total of 300 antibiotic allergy registrations were analysed for completeness and correctness. Thirty-four healthcare providers were interviewed.A registration was defined as complete when it included a description of all symptoms, time to onset of symptoms and the duration of symptoms. It was defined as correct when the conclusion was concordant with the Salden criteria. Determinants of correct antibiotic allergy registrations were divided into facilitators or obstructers.Rates of completeness and correctness of registrations were 0% and 29.3%, respectively. The main perceived barriers for correct antibiotic allergy registration were insufficient knowledge, lack of priority, limitations of registration features in electronic medical records (EMR), fear of medical liability and patients interpreting side-effects as allergies.The quality of antibiotic allergy registrations can be improved. Potential interventions include raising awareness of the consequences of incomplete and the importance of correct registrations, by continued education, and above all simplifying registration in an EMR by adequate ICT support."
https://openalex.org/W4226270058,"The preoperative evaluation of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) includes the assessment of the neuropsychological status of the patient. A widely used preoperative test is the Mattis Dementia rating scale (MDRS). However, the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) has also been proven to be a sensitive, time-sparing tool with high diagnostic validity in PD. We evaluate the utility of the MoCA as a preoperative screening test for PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS.In this single-centre, retrospective study, we analysed pre- and postoperative assessments of MoCA, MDRS, Movement disorder society-Unified PD Rating Scale-motor examination, PD Questionnaire-39 and levodopa equivalent daily dose. Longitudinal outcome changes were analysed using paired t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, linear regression and CHAID (chi-square automatic interaction detector) regression tree model.Clinical motor and cognitive scores of 59 patients (61.05±7.73 years, 24 females) were analysed. The MoCA, but not the MDRS, identified significant postoperative cognitive decline in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS. The preoperative MoCA score correlated with postoperative quality of life improvement, whereas the MDRS did not. PD patients with a MoCA score ≤ 23 points had a significant decline of quality of life after DBS surgery compared to patients > 23 points.This study identifies the MoCA as an alternative test within the preoperative evaluation of PD patients for the detection of neuropsychological deficits and prediction of the postoperative improvement of quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4226494236,"Adults with specific learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia) reveal limitations in daily functioning in various life domains. Following previous evidence of deficient executive functions and unique sensory patterns in this population, this study examined how relationships between these two domains are expressed in daily functioning. Participants included 55 adults with specific learning disabilities and 55 controls matched by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and education. Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions-adult version, and the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Results indicated significant relationships between executive functions (per the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions-adult version) and sensory patterns (per the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile) as reflected in daily functioning. The low sensory registration pattern predicted 12% to 16% of the variance in the behavioral regulation index, metacognitive index, and general executive composite scores and was a significant predictor of specific executive function abilities. Results indicated that the difficulties of adults with specific learning disabilities in using executive function abilities efficiently might be tied to a high sensory threshold and passive self-regulation strategies. A deeper understanding of this population's sensory-executive mechanisms may improve evaluation and intervention processes. This understanding can consequently increase executive abilities for improved daily functioning and life satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4226515164,"This study examines the value of risk stratification by documented diagnosis of diabetes and objectively measured height and weight (BMI) in COVID-19 severity and mortality in a large sample of patients in an urban hospital located in Southern California.Data from a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between March 8, 2020, and January 25, 2021, was analyzed. Sociodemographic characteristics and pre-existing conditions were extracted from electronic medical records. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models identified associated risk factors, and a regression causal mediation analysis examined the role of diabetes in the association between obesity and illness severity. All analyses were stratified by age (<65 and ≥65).Among individuals <65yo, diabetes accounted for 19-30% of the associations between obesity and COVID-19 illness severity. Among patients ≥65yo, having a BMI <18.5 was a risk factor for mortality regardless of diabetes history.Our findings have clinical implications in documenting which patients may be at elevated risk for adverse outcomes. More in-depth prospective studies are needed to capture how glycemic regulation may influence prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4225338094,"In the paper, we proposed a deep learning-based industrial equipment detection algorithm ROMS R-CNN (Rotation Occlusion Multi-Scale Region-CNN). It can solve the problem of inaccurate detection of industrial equipment under complex working conditions such as multi-scale ratio, rotation tilt, occlusion and overlap. The method proposed in this paper first is to construct the MobileNetV2 as the feature pyramid network, and then to combine high semantic information with high resolution information solved industrial equipment detection of different scales. Secondly, a specific rotation anchor scheme is proposed, and the data set is clustered through the k-means algorithm to obtain a specific aspect ratio. Combined with the rotation angle, a rotation anchor of any direction and size is generated to solve the problem of easy tilting of industrial equipment. Finally, a Non-Maximum Suppression algorithm with penalty factors is introduced to solve the overlapping in industrial equipment detection. The experimental results in common industrial equipment detection show that this method is better than other algorithms, significantly improves the missed detection and false detection, and the mAP reaches 0.939."
https://openalex.org/W4225769603,"The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the effects of 1-yr of volleyball practice on the bone mass development in the growing skeleton among prepubescent children. Twenty volleyball players and nine teen matched control boys (Tanner stage 1, at the start of the study) were followed over a 1-yr period. Bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2), bone mineral content (BMC, g) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on the whole body, lumbar spine (L2-L4), legs, arms, femoral necks, hips and radii. At follow-up, in comparison with controls, volleyball players gained more BMD in whole body (4.5% vs 1.7%; p = 0.014), both nondominant and dominant arms (5.8% vs 1.1% p = 0.005, and 6% vs 2.1%; p = 0.003, respectively), both nondmoninat and dominant legs (9% vs 4.8%; p = 0.005 and 10.7% vs 6% p = 0.0025; respectively), dominant ultradistal radius (10.4% vs 0.9%; p = 0.005), dominant third distal radius (9.6% vs 3.71%; p = 0.023), dominant whole radius (7.4% vs 3.1%; p = 0.017), lumbar spine L2-L4 (9.9% vs 2.8%; p = 0.004), femoral neck (4.7% vs 1.6%; p = 0.034), trochanter (6% vs 1.5%; p<0.001) and total hip (6.1% vs 2.6%; p = 0.006). Volleyball players gained more BMC in both nondominant and dominant arms (25.1% vs 13.4%; p = 0.003, and 26.1% vs 15.6%; p<0.001 respectively), both nondominant and dominant legs (20.2% vs 14.5%; p = 0.004 and 23% vs 16%; p = 0.004, respectively), dominant ultradistal radius (22.4% vs 8.7%; p = 0.002), dominant third distal radius (20.9% vs 5.9%; p = 0.001), dominant whole radius (20% vs 13%), nondominant third distal radius (14.5% vs 5.9%; p = 0.001), nondominant whole radius (21.1% vs 12%; p = 0.002), lumbar spine L2-L4 (21.1% vs 13.7%; p = 0.007), femoral neck (25.9% vs 8.7%; p = 0.007), trochanter (23.5% vs 17.1%; p = 0.006), and total hip (16.3% vs 11.3%; p = 0.009) than controls. A close correlation was observed between the increment (Δ) of whole body lean mass and increased (Δ) BMD and BMC in whole body (r = 0.43, p<0.01, r = 0.73, p<0.001; respectively), lumbar spine (r = 0.54, r = 0.61, p<0.001; respectively), trochanter (r = 0.46, p<0.01, r = 0.35, p<0.05; respectively), and total hip (r = 0.53, p<0.01, r = 0.6, p<0.0001; respectively). In summary, 1-yr of volleyball practice has an osteogenic effect on bone mass in loaded sites in prepubescent boys."
https://openalex.org/W4226014956,"It has been speculated that shared mechanisms underlie respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including systemic inflammation or mutual risk factors. In this context, we sought to examine the associations of CVD-related plasma proteins with lung function as measured by spirometry in a large community-based cohort of adults.The study included 5777 Framingham Heart Study participants who had spirometry and measurement of 71 CVD-related plasma proteins. The association of plasma proteins with lung function was assessed cross-sectionally and longitudinally using models accounting for familial correlations. Linear mixed models were used for the following measurements: FEV1%predicted, FVC%predicted, and FEV1/FVC ratio with secondary analyses examining obstructive and restrictive physiology at baseline and their new onset during follow up.Among the 71 CVD-related plasma proteins, 13 proteins were associated in cross-sectional analyses with FEV1%predicted, 17 proteins were associated with FVC%predicted, and 1 protein was associated with FEV1/FVC. The proteins with the greatest inverse relations to FEV1%predicted and FVC%predicted included leptin, adrenomedullin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; in contrast there were three proteins with positive relations to FEV1%predicted and FVC%predicted including insulin growth factor binding protein 2, tetranectin, and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products. In longitudinal analyses, three proteins were associated with longitudinal change in FEV1 (ΔFEV1) and four with ΔFVC; no proteins were associated with ΔFEV1/FVC.Our findings highlight CVD-related plasma proteins that are associated with lung function including markers of inflammation, adiposity, and fibrosis, representing proteins that may contribute both to respiratory and CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W4226083800,"Throughout the day, humans react to multisensory events conveying both visual and auditory signals by rapidly reorienting their gaze. Several studies showed that sounds can impact the latency of visually guided saccades depending on when and where they are delivered. We found that unlocalized beeps delivered near the onset time of a visual target reduce latencies, more for early beeps and less for late beeps, however, this modulation is far weaker than for perceptual temporal judgments. Here we tested our previous assumption that beeps shift the perceived timing of target onset and result in two competing effects on saccade latencies: a multisensory modulation in line with the expected perceptual effect and an illusory gap/overlap effect, resulting from target appearance being perceived later/closer in time than fixation offset and shortening/lengthening saccade latencies. Gap/overlap effects involve an oculomotor component associated with neuronal activity in the superior colliculus (SC), a multisensory subcortical structure devoted to sensory-motor transformation. We therefore predicted that the interfering illusory gap/overlap effect would be weaker for manual responses, which involve distinct multisensory areas. In three experiments we manipulated the delay between target onset and an irrelevant auditory beep (stimulus onset asynchrony; SOA) and between target onset and fixation offset (real gap/overlap). Targets appeared left/right of fixation and participants were instructed to make quick saccades or button presses towards the targets. Adding a real overlap/gap (50% of SOA) compensated for the illusory gap/overlap by increasing the beep-related modulation of saccade latencies across the entire SOA range, whereas it barely affected manual responses. However, although auditory and gap/overlap effects modulated saccade latencies in similar ways, these were additive and could saturate, suggesting that they reflect independent mechanisms. Therefore, multisensory temporal binding affects perception and oculomotor control differently, likely due to the implication of the SC in saccade programming and multisensory integration."
https://openalex.org/W4226104347,"Many endangered species exist in only a single population, and almost all species that go extinct will do so from their last remaining population. Understanding how to best conserve these single population threatened species (SPTS) is therefore a distinct and important task for threatened species conservation science. As a last resort, managers of SPTS may consider taking the entire population into captivity-ex situ, in toto conservation. In the past, this choice has been taken to the great benefit of the SPTS, but it has also lead to catastrophe. Here, we develop a decision-support tool for planning when to trigger this difficult action. Our method considers the uncertain and ongoing decline of the SPTS, the possibility that drastic ex situ action will fail, and the opportunities offered by delaying the decision. Specifically, these benefits are additional time for ongoing in situ actions to succeed, and opportunities for the managers to learn about the system. To illustrate its utility, we apply the decision tool to four retrospective case-studies of declining SPTS. As well as offering support to this particular decision, our tool illustrates why trigger points for difficult conservation decisions should be formulated in advance, but must also be adaptive. A trigger-point for the ex situ, in toto conservation of a SPTS, for example, will not take the form of a simple threshold abundance."
https://openalex.org/W4226107748,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. The aims of this study are to examine if omental adipose tissue (OMAT) and subcutaneous AT (SCAT) differentially express proinflammatory and lipid metabolic adipokines, and if so, whether their regional differences have implications on lipid metabolism in GDM. Paired samples of OMAT and SCAT were excised from pregnant women in scheduled Cesarean sections with non-obese (NOBS), obese (OBS) and GDM. The results showed that the mRNA of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage marker CD68, and cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α are increased in OMAT from GDM women compared to that in NOBS and OBS women (P&lt;0.05). Glucose and TNF-α dose-dependently enhanced ADM and its receptor components CRLR and RAMPs in human adipocytes. Immunofluorescence showed that ADM and its receptor components are higher in OMAT from GDM women compared to non-GDM women. Further, basal lipolysis was greater in OMAT than in SCAT and ADM stimulates further glycerol release in OMAT, but not in SCAT, and these increases are reduced by ADM antagonist, ADM22-52. We therefore conclude that elevated ADM and its receptor expressions by OMAT, but not by SCAT appear to contribute to the lipid dysregulation in GDM women, and manipulation of ADM may represent one of the novel approaches in minimizing the risk of GDM-related fetal overgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W4226204217,"An insect's fitness varies on different host plant species, and can be affected by previous host feeding experience. In New Zealand, Bactericera cockerelli (the tomato potato psyllid (TPP)) overwinter on various host species, and later migrate to annually grown crop host plants. How changing host plant species affects the insect's fitness is unknown. This study evaluated if transferring adult TPP from non-crop to crop host species impacts the development and survival of their progeny. TPP were reared on non-crop host species, boxthorn, poroporo, and crop host species, potato and tomato. Adults were transferred from non-crop to the crop host species and allowed to oviposit for 48 hours before being removed. The eggs and nymphs were monitored every 24 hours for the development and survival of each life stage. The incubation period of eggs from adults transferred from poroporo to tomato was 6.9 days, and for boxthorn to tomato was 7.2 days, and was less than for eggs of adults moved from tomato to tomato (9.0 days) and potato to potato (9.2 days) (P < 0.05). Nymph developmental time was similar for all treatments. Total development time (egg to adult) was shorter for the progeny of adults from poroporo transferred to tomato (20.5 days) than those from tomato to tomato (23.2). The survival of eggs did not differ across treatments. Fewer nymphs survived when adults were transferred from tomato to tomato (50.4%) than those from poroporo to tomato (92.1%) (P < 0.05). Total survival (egg to adult) was higher for progeny of adults transferred from poroporo to tomato (80.0%) compared to boxthorn to potato (35.3%), boxthorn to boxthorn (40.7%), poroporo to potato (33.9%) and tomato to tomato (37.6%) (P < 0.05). The implications of this shift in fitness are discussed in relation to TPP management."
