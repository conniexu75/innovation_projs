https://openalex.org/W1988608170,"Are inverse relations between psychiatric disorders and socioeconomic status due more to social causation (adversity and stress) or social selection (downward mobility of genetically predisposed)? This classical epidemiological issue is tested by focusing on ethnic status in relation to socioeconomic status. Ethnic status cannot be an effect of disorder because it is present at birth whereas socioeconomic status depends on educational and occupational attainment. A birth cohort sample of 4914 young, Israel-born adults of European and North African background was selected from the country's population register, screened, and diagnosed by psychiatrists. Results indicate that social selection may be more important for schizophrenia and that social causation may be more important for depression in women and for antisocial personality and substance use disorders in men."

There is concern that phytoplankton communities confined to near-surface waters of the marginal ice zone will be harmed by increased UVB irradiance penetrating the ocean surface, thereby altering the dynamics of Antarctic marine ecosystems. Results from a 6-week cruise (Icecolors) in the marginal ice zone of the Bellingshausen Sea in austral spring of 1990 indicated that as the O3 layer thinned: (i) sea surface- and depth-dependent ratios of UVB irradiance (280 to 320 nanometers) to total irradiance (280 to 700 nanometers) increased and (ii) UVB inhibition of photosynthesis increased. These and other Icecolors findings suggest that O3-dependent shifts of in-water spectral irradiances alter the balance of spectrally dependent phytoplankton processes, including photoinhibition, photoreactivation, photoprotection, and photosynthesis. A minimum 6 to 12 percent reduction in primary production associated with O3 depletion was estimated for the duration of the cruise."

https://openalex.org/W2041680090,"Many organisms construct structural ceramic (biomineral) composites from seemingly mundane materials; cell-mediated processes control both the nucleation and growth of mineral and the development of composite microarchitecture. Living systems fabricate biocomposites by: (i) confining biomineralization within specific subunit compartments; (ii) producing a specific mineral with defined crystal size and orientation; and (iii) packaging many incremental units together in a moving front process to form fully densified, macroscopic structures. By adapting biological principles, materials scientists are attempting to produce novel materials. To date, neither the elegance of the biomineral assembly mechanisms nor the intricate composite microarchitectures have been duplicated by nonbiological processing. However, substantial progress has been made in the understanding of how biomineralization occurs, and the first steps are now being taken to exploit the basic principles involved."
https://openalex.org/W2041108610,"The three-dimensional structure of a specific antibody (Fab 17/9) to a peptide immunogen from influenza virus hemagglutinin [HA1(75-110)] and two independent crystal complexes of this antibody with bound peptide (TyrP100-LeuP108) have been determined by x-ray crystallographic techniques at 2.0 Å, 2.9 Å, and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively. The nonapeptide antigen assumes a type I β turn in the antibody combining site and interacts primarily with the Fab hypervariable loops L3, H2, and H3. Comparison of the bound and unbound Fab structures shows that a major rearrangement in the H3 loop accompanies antigen binding. This conformational change results in the creation of a binding pocket for the β turn of the peptide, allowing TyrP105 to be accommodated. The conformation of the peptide bound to the antibody shows similarity to its cognate sequence in the HA1, suggesting a possible mechanism for the cross-reactivity of this Fab with monomeric hemagglutinin. The structures of the free and antigen bound antibodies demonstrate the flexibility of the antibody combining site and provide an example of induced fit as a mechanism for antibody-antigen recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2101896709,"We have examined the interactions between the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin and collagen types I-VI using solid phase binding assays. The results of these studies showed that 125I-decorin bound most efficiently to collagen type VI in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, this interaction was specific and of moderately high affinity (Kd approximately 3 x 10(-7) M). Binding of decorin to collagen type VI appears to involve the decorin core protein rather than the glycosaminoglycan side chains, since the isolated core protein as well as a recombinant fusion protein containing a major segment (65%) of the human decorin core protein inhibited binding of 125I-decorin to collagen type VI. Other related proteoglycans and their respective core proteins also inhibited the binding of 125I-decorin to collagen type VI, whereas unrelated proteins and isolated glycosaminoglycan chains were without effect. In addition to decorin, collagen type II was also shown to bind to immobilized collagen type VI. Both interactions were effectively inhibited by preincubation of the immobilized collagen VI with decorin or collagen type II. These results suggested that the collagen type VI molecule has binding sites for collagen type II and decorin which are located in close proximity on the collagen type VI molecule. Possible functional roles of these interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2076519224,"The direction and rate at which an object moves are normally not correlated with the manifold physical cues (for example, brightness and texture) that enable it to be seen. As befits its goals, human perception of visual motion largely evades this diversity of cues for image form; direction and rate of motion are perceived (with few exceptions) in a fashion that does not depend on the physical characteristics of the object. The middle temporal visual area of the primate cerebral cortex contains many neurons that respond selectively to motion in a particular direction and is an integral part of the neural substrate for perception of motion. When stimulated with moving patterns characterized by one of three very diverse cues for form, many middle temporal neurons exhibited similar directional tuning. This lack of sensitivity for figural cue characteristics may allow the uniform perception of motion of objects having a broad spectrum of physical cues."

During early embryonic cleavages, cells acquire distinct fates and their differences in developmental potential might be explained by localization of informational molecules in the egg. The mechanisms by which Vg1 RNA, a maternal mRNA, is translocated to the vegetal pole of Xenopus oocytes may indicate how developmental signals are localized. Data presented here show that a 340-nucleotide localization signal present in the 3' untranslated region of Vg1 RNA is sufficient to direct RNA localization to the vegetal pole."
https://openalex.org/W2082706052,"Messenger RNAs occur within the axons of magnocellular hypothalamic neurons known to secrete oxytocin and vasopressin. In Brattleboro rats, which have a genetic mutation that renders them incapable of vasopressin expression and secretion and thus causes diabetes insipidus, injection into the hypothalamus of purified mRNAs from normal rat hypothalami or of synthetic copies of the vasopressin mRNA leads to selective uptake, retrograde transport, and expression of vasopressin exclusively in the magnocellular neurons. Temporary reversal of their diabetes insipidus (for up to 5 days) can be observed within hours of the injection. Intra-axonal mRNAs may represent an additional category of chemical signals for neurons."

The genes that encode these subunits, termed TOA1 and TOA2, respectively, were cloned. Neither gene shares obvious sequence similarity with the other or with any other previously identified genes. The recombinant factor bound to a TATA binding protein-DNA complex and complemented yeast and mammalian in vitro transcription systems depleted of TFIIA.

https://openalex.org/W1499463091,"The effect on human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) viral transcription and subsequent gene expression mediated by mixed purine-pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligodeoxynucleotides) designed to form collinear DNA triplexes with purine-rich elements in the viral promoter was evaluated in intact mammalian cell lines (MT4 and U937). Oligonucleotides HIV31 (5'-GTTTTTGGGTGTTGTGGGTGTGTGTGGTTTG-3') and HIV38 (5'-TGGGTGGGGTGGGGTGGGGGGGTGTGGGGTGTGGGGTG-3') were designed to interact with the transcription initiation site (-16 to + 13) and nuclear factor Sp1 binding site (-81 to -44) of HIV-1, respectively. Oligonucleotides, synthesized with a 3' amine blocking group (5'-R-O-PO2-OCH (CHOH)-CH2-NH+3-3') to prevent degradation by cellular nucleases, were readily taken up by MT4 cells from the culture medium, achieving measured intranuclear concentrations higher than the medium in less than 2 h of incubation. The 3' amine modified oligonucleotides were recoverable from the cells after 24 h as greater than 90% intact material. Treatment of acutely infected MT4 cells with either HIV31 or HIV38 significantly inhibited viral-associated cytopathology and P24 antigen production (p less than 0.001). Additionally, inhibition of P24 antigen release, culture supernatant viral titer, and expression of the intact 9.2-kb HIV-1 mRNA was observed when the chronically infected promonocyte cell line, U937, was treated with 10 microM HIV38. Control oligonucleotides with similar base composition did not inhibit virus expression in either cell line. Furthermore, inhibition of viral expression was not due to alpha-interferon induction resulting from oligonucleotide treatment. Both HIV31 and HIV38 associate with their respective DNA target duplexes at micromolar concentrations, and a strong negative ellipticity near 210 nm, characteristic of DNA triplexes, was observed in the circular dichroism spectrum of either target-oligonucleotide complex. These observations suggest that oligonucleotides, designed to form nucleic acid triplexes with specific proviral target sequences, can selectively inhibit transcription of viral mRNA in intact cells and suppress accumulation of viral products."
https://openalex.org/W1515396348,"Tubulin, the 100-kDa subunit protein of microtubules, is a heterodimer of two 50-kDa subunits, alpha and beta. Both alpha and beta subunits exist as numerous isotypic forms. There are four isotypes of beta-tubulin in bovine brain tubulin preparations; their designations and relative abundances in these preparations are as follows: beta I, 3%; beta II, 58%; beta III, 25%; and beta IV, 13%. We have previously reported the preparation of monoclonal antibodies specific for beta II and beta III (Banerjee, A., Roach, M. C., Wall, K. A., Lopata, M. A., Cleveland, D. W., and Luduena, R. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3029-3034; Banerjee, A., Roach, M. C., Trcka, P., and Luduena, R. F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1794-1799). We here report the preparation of a monoclonal antibody specific for beta IV. By using this antibody together with those specific for beta II and beta III, we have prepared isotypically pure tubulin dimers with the composition alpha beta II, alpha beta III, and alpha beta IV. We have found that, in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins, all three dimers assemble into microtubules considerably faster and to a greater extent than does unfractionated tubulin. More assembly was noted with alpha beta II and alpha beta III than with alpha beta IV. When assembly is measured in the presence of taxol (10 microM), little difference is seen among the isotypically purified dimers or between them and unfractionated tubulin. These results indicate that the assembly properties of a tubulin preparation are influenced by its isotypic composition and raise the possibility that the structural differences among tubulin isotypes may have functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W2023880708,"A seven-base pair microhelix that recapitulates a glycine transfer RNA (tRNA) acceptor helix can be specifically aminoacylated with glycine. A single base pair and the single-stranded discriminator base near the attachment site are essential for aminoacylation. These nucleotide sequence elements, and those in microhelices that can be charged with histidine and alanine, occur in the same positions and therefore overlap. Studies on a systematic set of sequence variants showed that no microhelix could be charged with more than one amino acid. Also, none of the three cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) gave a detectable amount of aminoacylation of the CCA trinucleotide that is common to the 3' ends of all tRNAs, showing that the specific acceptor stem nucleotide bases confer aminoacylation. An analysis of the relative contributions of these microhelices to overall tRNA recognition indicated that their interaction with aaRSs constitutes a substantial part of the recognition of the whole tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1584811398,"In vivo regulation of hepatic sterol metabolism was examined in the rat. Sodium cholate markedly suppressed hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels and activity when fed to rats on a low cholesterol diet. Sterol balance was maintained solely by decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Compensatory mechanisms were inadequate when cholate was fed to rats on a high cholesterol diet and massive amounts of cholesterol accumulated in the liver and plasma. Suppression of bile salt synthesis was not responsible since cholate did not suppress 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity when fed to rats on a high cholesterol diet. Moreover, total hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor activity was not suppressed even though liver cholesteryl ester levels were increased more than 350-fold. Changes in 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were always accompanied by parallel changes in mRNA, whereas mRNA levels for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase were reduced by 50% or less, even when cholesterol synthesis was suppressed by 98%. HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein receptor activities were regulated independently although mRNA levels for these two proteins were coordinately regulated. These findings indicate that 7 alpha-hydroxylase is controlled by mRNA levels, whereas in vivo cholesterol synthesis is predominantly controlled by posttranscriptional regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1963862137,"The conformation and scaling properties of self-avoiding fluid membranes with an extrinsic bending rigidity kappa were studied with the use of Monte Carlo methods. For kappa = 0, the results are consistent with branched polymer behavior at large length scales. There is a smooth crossover from a crumpled to an extended state with increasing kappa, with a peak in the specific heat when the persistence length reaches the system size. The scale-dependent effective bending rigidity is a decreasing function of system size for all bare rigidities. These results indicate that fluid membranes are always crumpled at sufficiently long length scales."
https://openalex.org/W1490139598,"The thermal stability of bovine brain hsp73, Escherichia coli DnaK, and its mutant T199A was studied by a combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. DnaK undergoes a temperature-induced conformational change that leads to the formation of a molten globule at physiologically relevant temperatures (midpoint of the transition, tm, 41 degrees C). Native DnaK binds to a denatured form of alpha-lactalbumin in a temperature-dependent manner with maximum rate at about 40 degrees C. The molten globule of DnaK is unable to bind denatured alpha-lactalbumin but recovers native structure and activity upon cooling. The half-life of the refolding process is 10 min at 35 degrees C. Mg/ATP and Mg/ADP increase the thermal stability of DnaK; in the presence of these nucleotides the tm is shifted to 59 degrees C. Binding of Mg/ATP (but not Mg/ADP or Mg/adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) causes a conformational change in DnaK as determined by the emission fluorescence spectrum. The DnaK mutant T199A which lacks the threonine residue that is essential for ATP hydrolysis and autophosphorylation activity (McCarty, J. S., and Walker, G. C. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 9513-9517) shows nearly identical properties to the wild type in the presence or absence of nucleotides. Hsp73 undergoes similar temperature-induced transitions as determined by spectroscopic methods (Palleros, D.R., Welch, W.J., and Fink, A.L. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 5719-5723); however, contrary to DnaK, the molten globule of hsp73 irreversibly aggregates at temperatures higher than its tm (42 degrees C)."

https://openalex.org/W2082409290,"Transcription factor IID (TFIID) recognizes the TATA element of promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and serves as the base for subsequent association by other general transcription factors and RNAPII. The carboxyl-terminal domain of TFIID is highly conserved and contains an imperfect repetition of a 60-amino acid sequence. These repeats are separated by a region rich in basic amino acids. Mutagenesis of the lysines in this region resulted in a conditioned phenotype in vivo, and the mutant proteins were defective for interactions with transcription factor IIA in vitro. Binding of TFIID to DNA was unaffected. These results suggest that the basic domain of TFIID is important for protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1593614942,"alpha-Thrombin, a G-protein-coupled receptor agonist, is mitogenic for neonatal vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, but it also causes secretion of the tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor agonist platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In order to determine the role of growth factors with tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors in thrombin's mitogenic signal transduction cascade, the synergistic effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in this system was examined. While bFGF itself is a growth factor for VSM cells, it causes a 1.7-fold synergistic effect when added together with thrombin. Herbimycin A, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, both decreases thrombin-induced mitogenesis by greater than 90% and abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-1. The magnitude and time course of the increase in intracellular free calcium concentration in response to thrombin is comparable in both the presence and absence of herbimycin A. These results provide evidence that herbimycin A specifically inhibits PLC-gamma-1 tyrosine phosphorylation without affecting VSM cell viability or calcium release. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation is a necessary step in thrombin's mitogenic signal transduction cascade, but it is not essential for thrombin-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores. These data suggest that a tyrosine kinase, possibly supplied by the bFGF receptor, plays an essential role in thrombin-induced mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1546365621,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is synthesized as a latent high molecular weight complex in a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The complex is comprised of three components: mature TGF-beta 1, the TGF-beta 1 latency-associated peptide (beta 1-LAP), and the latent TGF-beta 1-binding protein (LTBP). LTBP plays an important role in the assembly and secretion of the latent TGF-beta 1 complex; if the TGF-beta 1 precursor fails to bind to LTBP, much of it remains inside the cells and may contain anomalous disulfide bond(s) between beta 1-LAP and the mature TGF-beta 1 molecule (Miyazono, K., Olofsson, A., Colosetti, P., and Heldin, C.-H. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1091-1101). In the present work, we have investigated the subcellular localization and properties of the TGF-beta 1 precursor retained intracellularly. When the HEL cells were metabolically labeled and chased for up to 72 h, a considerable part of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was still observed intracellularly in an unprocessed form. The secreted form of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was resistant to endoglycosidase H, whereas the intracellular form of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was sensitive to endoglycosidase H, regardless of the presence or absence of swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the TGF-beta 1 precursor co-localized with mannosidase II, a marker for the Golgi complex, but not with protein disulfide isomerase, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum. The intracellular TGF-beta 1 precursor was prepared from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated HEL cells and tested for TGF-beta 1 bioactivity. Half-maximal inhibition of the DNA synthesis in mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu, was observed at 80 pM of the acid-treated TGF-beta 1 precursor, whereas nontreated material showed minimal growth inhibitory activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the TGF-beta 1 precursor is retained inside the cells in the Golgi complex, mainly in a latent, immature form."
https://openalex.org/W1607157162,"We report the independent cloning of the cDNA for CD31, a recently described cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily present on platelets, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. Northern analysis revealed three major mRNA transcripts in Jurkat (a human T cell line) and K562 and HEL (leukemia cell lines) cells with an additional 5.3-kilobase transcript seen in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Following T cell activation, CD31 mRNA was down-regulated by Northern analysis, and decreased CD31 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots. The down-regulation of CD31 was partially mediated by decreased transcription as demonstrated by nuclear run-on studies. CD31 became rapidly phosphorylated in platelets, Jurkat cells, and endothelial cells after cell activation. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of a phosphotyrosine in CD31 using monoclonal and polyclonal phosphotyrosine antibodies. In addition, CD31 phosphorylation in platelets was induced by phorbol ester and was blocked by staurosporin, a protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that CD31 phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C and involves serine and/or threonine residues. The phosphorylation of CD31 following cell activation may modulate its cellular adhesiveness, and the down-regulation of its expression may serve to impart target specificity and to localize effector lymphocytes to areas of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2005711148,Ribonuclease footprinting of nascent messenger RNA within ternary complexes of vaccinia RNA polymerase revealed an RNA binding site that encompasses an 18-nucleotide RNA segment. The dimensions of the binding site did not change as the polymerase moved along the template. Capping of the 5' end of the RNA was cotranscriptional and was confined to nascent chains 31 nucleotides or greater in length. Purified capping enzyme formed a binary complex with RNA polymerase in solution in the absence of nucleic acid. These findings suggest a mechanism for cotranscriptional establishment of messenger RNA identity in eukaryotes.

The gap gene knirps, required for patterning in the posterior region of the embryo, can be activated throughout the wild-type embryo and is normally repressed from the anterior and posterior sides. These results provide direct molecular evidence that the posterior morphogen system interacts in a fundamentally different manner than do hunchback and bicoid, which are responsible for anterior pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W1544949122,"The D1 polypeptide of photosystem II (PSII) is synthesized as a precursor that is processed by cleavage at the carboxyl terminus during assembly of the active PSII complex. A mutant of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, LF-1, inactive in water-splitting, lacks the D1 processing activity but assembles otherwise normal PSII complexes containing the precursor D1 molecule. We have isolated and partially purified a soluble protease from sonicated thylakoids of both wild-type S. obliquus and Pisum sativum which will process the precursor D1 molecule in PSII-enriched membranes from the LF-1 mutant to the mature size. After processing (but not before), photoactivation of these PSII membranes in the presence of manganese restores water-splitting to levels seen after photoactivation of PSII membranes from dark-grown, wild-type, cells. The protease is unable to process D1 in intact thylakoids from the LF-1 mutant but processes D1 if present during sonication of the thylakoids, indicating that processing of the carboxyl-terminal extension of D1 occurs in the lumen of the thylakoid. The processing protease from both S. obliquus and P. sativum is a single subunit enzyme of native molecular mass 33-35 kDa. Processing rate is optimal at pH 6.5. Processing in vitro is evident within 5 min and is markedly inhibited by millimolar concentrations of divalent cations (Cu, Zn greater than Mn greater than Ca, Mg) but not by any known inhibitors of the major classes of proteases. The protease is inactive against the precursors of other thylakoidal proteins and is thus distinct from the thylakoidal amino-terminal processing enzyme involved in the removal of transit peptides from cytoplasmically-synthesised proteins imported into the thylakoid lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1555655466,"Abstract Lipid extracts of eggs, worms, and cercariae of the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni have been shown to contain a large number of highly immunogenic glycolipids (Weiss, J. B., Magnani, J. L., and Strand, M. (1986) J. Immunol. 136, 4275-4282). Three fractions of schistosome egg glycolipids were selected on the basis of their reactivity with an anti-schistosome monoclonal antibody (128C3/3), which recognizes a developmentally regulated carbohydrate epitope present on both glycolipid and glycoprotein antigens from S. mansoni. These fractions were purified by silica gel chromatography and preparative high performance thin layer chromatography and characterized by monosaccharide, fatty acid, and linkage analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, as well as by positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The immunogens were shown to be glycosphingolipids having homologous structures based on a highly novel extension of glucosylceramide. Monosaccharide inhibition studies indicated that the epitope recognized by 128C3/3 residues in an outer region of the immunogens consisting of Fuc2GlcNAc (where Fuc is fucose) repeating units. The largest antigen characterized may have the following structure, based on the evidence presented in this paper. [sequence: see text] The evidence indicated the existence of a series of glycan structures created by deletions of one or more Fuc1----3 side chains from the above structure."
https://openalex.org/W2066445560,"To preserve biological diversity, wealthy nations usually save the large and cuddly species that excite the public’s imagination1. This is not necessarily a bad strategy. The relatively large size of these species means that their population densities are low. Consequently, the minimal numbers required for persistence inhabit large areas and many other less charismatic species are protected under their umbrella. Furthermore, large species are often top predators and thus play crucial, so-called keystone roles in the community’s dynamics. Yet such a species-biased approach is not necessarily appropriate for the great majority of animal species that are not furred and feathered, or for plants, or, indeed, for all organisms in species-rich tropical nations deciding on how to allocate land for national parks. The obvious strategy protects areas of greatest diversity. Two recent papers on mammals by Mares in this issue and Pagel et al.2 illustrate the complex biological issues involved in predicting what diversity might remain after future planners have taken a cookie cutter to their wilderness."
https://openalex.org/W1532050162,"A single cardiac troponin T (cTNT) gene generates two mRNAs by including or excluding the 30-nucleotide exon 5 during pre-mRNA processing. Transfection analysis of cTNT minigenes has previously demonstrated that both mRNAs are expressed from unmodified minigenes, and mutations within exon 5 can lead to complete skipping of the exon. These results suggested a role for exon sequence in splice site recognition. To investigate this potential role, an in vitro splicing system using cTNT precursors has been established. Two-exon precursors containing the alternative exon and either the upstream exon or downstream exon were spliced accurately and efficiently in vitro. The mutations within the alternative exon that resulted in exon skipping in vivo specifically blocked splicing of the upstream intron in vitro and had no effect on removal of the downstream intron. In addition, the splicing intermediates of these two precursors have been characterized, and the branch sites utilized on the introns flanking the alternative exon have been determined. Potential roles of exon sequence in splice site selection are discussed. These results establish a system that will be useful for the biochemical characterization of the role of exon sequence in splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W1556854190,"Using a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in the NAT1 gene, that encodes one of the NH2-terminal acetyltransferases, we have identified 14 ribosomal proteins whose electrophoretic mobility at pH 5.0 suggests they carry an additional charge, presumably due to the lack of NH2-terminal acetylation. At least 30 other ribosomal proteins from the mutant are electrophoretically normal. Attempted NH2-terminal analysis of most of the presumed acetylated proteins from wild type cells indicated that all were blocked. NH2-terminal analysis of the same proteins from the nat1 mutant strain yielded unique sequences. Each one carries an NH2-terminal serine. We conclude that these are normally acetylated due to the presence of the NAT1 gene product. It seems surprising that cells whose ribosomes have been altered to this degree grow rather well and synthesize the same spectrum of proteins as do wild type cells (Mullen, J. R., Kayne, P. S., Moerschell, R. P., Tsunasawa, S. Gribskov, M., Sherman, F., and Sternglanz, R. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2067-2075). Finally, this analysis has provided the first sequence information available for several of the acetylated ribosomal proteins and for one non-acetylated ribosomal protein, which is clearly the product of the MFT1 gene (Garrett, J. M., Singh, K. K., Vonder Haar, R. A., and Emr. S. D. (1991) Mol. Gen. Gen. 225, 483-491)."
https://openalex.org/W1559742425,"Myosin light chain kinase is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Insights into the kinetic mechanism of this activation by Ca2+/calmodulin have now been obtained using extrinsically labeled fluorescent calmodulin, a fluorescent peptide substrate, and a stopped-flow spectrophotofluorimeter. We employed spinach calmodulin labeled with the sulfhydryl-selective probe, 2-(4-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, to measure changes in the fluorescence intensity of the 2-(4-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid-calmodulin upon binding to rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. The fluorescent peptide substrate KKRAARAC(sulfobenzo-furazan)SNVFS-amide was used to measure kinase activity. Our results showed that the binding interaction could be modeled as a two-step process: a bimolecular reaction with an association rate of 4.6 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 followed by an isomerization with a rate of 2.2 s-1. Phosphorylation of the peptide during stopped-flow experiments could be modeled by a two-step process with a catalytic association rate of 6.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and a turnover rate of 10-20 s-1. Our results also indicated that kinase activity occurred too rapidly for the slower isomerization rate of 2.2 s-1 to be linked specifically to the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1497452828,"Band 4.2 is a major protein of the erythrocyte membrane which has been immunologically detected in a variety of cell types and is apparently essential for normal erythrocyte membrane function. Since band 4.2 has unusual solubility and membrane binding properties and has an N-terminal glycine following the initiating methionine, we explored the possibility that band 4.2 is myristylated. When Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant band 4.2 Baculovirus were incubated with [3H]myristic acid, label became incorporated into recombinant band 4.2 protein and resisted extraction with hydroxylamine. Consistent with N-terminal myristylation, the incorporation of label was dependent upon protein synthesis. The fatty acid covalently bound to recombinant band 4.2 was definitively identified as myristic acid by recovering the fatty acid after hydrolysis of band 4.2 and examining its migration relative to standards in thin layer chromatography. It was determined that native erythrocyte band 4.2 is an N-myristylated protein by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography detection of an azlactone derivative of N-myristylglycine after mild acid hydrolysis and azlactone derivatization of the purified protein. Study of myristylation of band 4.2, an abundant normal cellular protein, and its role in membrane binding may produce insights relevant to other myristylated cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1544824666,"The specificity of peptide binding by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules was investigated in a cell-free direct-binding assay. Peptides were assessed for binding to HLA-A2 and HLA-B27 by measuring the formation of heterotrimeric HLA complexes that consisted of iodinated beta 2-microglobulin, HLA heavy chain fragments isolated from the Escherichia coli cytoplasm, and peptide. In this system, no detectable HLA heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin complexes were formed unless appropriate peptides were intentionally added to the reconstitution solution. Analysis with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that these heterotrimeric complexes were correctly folded. Five nonhomologous peptides, known to form complexes with HLA-A2 or HLA-B27 from T-cell functional studies, were tested for their capacity to bind to HLA-A2 and HLA-B27 using the reconstitution assay. Four of the peptides bound to the appropriate class I molecule only. One peptide and some (but not all) substitution analogs of it bound to both HLA-A2 and HLA-B27. The effect of peptide length on binding to HLA-B27 was studied, and it was found that the optimal length was 9 or 10 amino acid residues; however, one peptide that bound to HLA-B27 was 15 amino acids long. All peptides that bound to HLA-B27 in the direct-binding assay also competed with antigenic peptides for binding to HLA-B27 on the surface of intact cells, as determined by a standard cytotoxic T-lymphocyte functional assay. Thus, we conclude that HLA-A2 and HLA-B27 bind distinct but partially overlapping sets of peptides and that, at least in vitro, the assembly of HLA heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin complexes requires specific peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1602159464,"Ca(2+)-dependent activation of citric acid cycle enzymes has been demonstrated in isolated cardiac mitochondria. These observations led to the hypothesis that Ca2+ is the signal coupling myofibrillar energy use to mitochondrial energy production in vivo. To test this hypothesis we have measured mitochondrial Ca2+ content during increased energy demand, using electron probe microanalysis. Mitochondrial Ca2+ was measured in hamster papillary muscles rapidly frozen at the peak rate of tension rise under control conditions and after stimulation with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M). A third group of muscles was frozen after incubation in low (46.5 mM) Na+ solution to Ca2+ load the cells. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was measured in each of the muscles. Isoproterenol caused a 39% increase in force and a 43% increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity but no change in mitochondrial Ca2+ (0.46 +/- 0.19 (S.E.) mmol of Ca2+/kg, dry weight) compared with control (0.54 +/- 0.12). In contrast, low Na+ increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by 56% and also elevated mitochondrial Ca2+ to 1.28 +/- 0.31 (p less than 0.02). These results demonstrate that mitochondrial Ca2+ is not elevated after inotropic stimulation of cardiac muscle by beta-adrenergic agonists although pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is increased. We conclude that Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria is not a requirement for activation of mitochondrial respiration after increased energy demand."
https://openalex.org/W1510080787,"N-Acetylserotonin (compound 1) and N-acetyldopamine (compound 7) inhibit bovine adrenal medullary sepiapterin reductase in a manner competitive with the pterin substrate and have Ki values of 0.12 and 0.4 microM, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that the phenyl rings of the two compounds bind in the pyrimidine pocket of the enzyme with the 3-hydroxyl of dopamine or the 5-hydroxyl of serotonin aligned at the pyrimidine 4-position. Further, the acetyl moieties of the two inhibitors appear to mimic the substrate side chain. Consistent with this analysis, N-acetyl-m-tyramine (compound 13) is also an excellent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.13 microM), whereas N-acetyltryptamine (compound 2), N-acetyl-p-tyramine (compound 14) and N-acetylphenylethylamine (compound 15) all bind poorly. Interestingly, restricted-rotation analogs of N-acetyldopamine and N-acetyl-m-tyramine are noncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Modification of N-acetyldopamine to N-chloroacetyldopamine (compound 10) or of N-acetylserotonin to the N-chloroacetyl (5) or N-methoxyacetyl (compound 6) analogs results in greatly increased competitive affinity, with Ki = 0.014 microM for the dopamine analog and 0.006 and 0.008 microM, respectively, for the serotonin analogs. In MOLT-4 T-cell leukemia and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma in culture, 0.1 mM N-methoxyacetylserotonin depleted tetrahydrobiopterin by greater than or equal to 97 and greater than 50%, respectively, with no effect upon cell growth. In both cell lines, the GTP cyclohydrolase inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine at 1-5 mM also depleted tetrahydrobiopterin greater than or equal to 97%. In this case, however, modest growth inhibition did occur. Since the growth inhibition could not be reversed upon tetrahydrobiopterin repletion, inhibition was due to other effects of the inhibitor rather than to tetrahydrobiopterin depletion. The results show that there is no effect on cell growth when at least 97% of the tetrahydrobiopterin in these cell lines is depleted. Since the sepiapterin reductase inhibitor depleted tetrahydrobiopterin with fewer nonspecific effects than the cyclohydrolase inhibitor, it will be useful for determining metabolic effects of tetrahydrobiopterin depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1564691344,"Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the cotranslational, covalent attachment of a rare fatty acid, myristic acid (C14:0), to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a number of eukaryotic proteins involved in cellular growth and signal transduction as well as several viral proteins necessary for assembly-replication. NMT has become a target for both anti-viral and anti-fungal therapy. Analysis of purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMT plus yeast strains with conditional lethal nmt1 mutations have provided insights about how this process is regulated in vivo. We have now defined the location of NMT in two strains of S. cerevisiae to better understand the functional and spatial relationships between this enzyme and cellular systems that generate its acyl-CoA and peptide ligands. Western blot studies using an affinity purified antibody raised in rabbits against purified S. cerevisiae NMT indicate that the acyltransferase represents 0.06% of total cellular proteins in an exponentially growing haploid strain with a wild type NMT1 allele. Another strain containing a single, integrated copy of a GAL1/NMT1 fusion gene and a nmt1 null allele had 12-fold higher levels of NMT when grown on galactose-containing media. This increase in NMT production had no detectable effects on growth or cellular morphology. Cell fractionation studies, confocal fluorescence immunocytochemical analysis, and immunogold electron microscopic surveys of fixed, gelatin-embedded cryosections of both strains revealed that NMT is a cytosolic protein that is not associated with cellular membranes (including the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane), the nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, or vacuoles. This finding is discussed in light of what is known about the location and activities of enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and in amino-terminal processing of nascent proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1510648915,"Di- or trivalent metal ions stabilize a supercoil-dependent transition in pGA37, which contains the (GA)37.(CT)37 insert, at neutral and basic pH. The structure formed is different from the well known protonated triplexes (H-DNA) adopted at low pH by polypurine.polypyrimidine (Pur.Pyr) inserts in plasmids. DNA samples must be preincubated in the presence of multivalent ions at 50 degrees C for the new transition to occur. At neutral pH in the presence of Co hexamine, both strands of the insert have modification maxima situated at one-third of the distance from both ends. We propose the formation of a new structure called nodule DNA which consists of both Pyr.Pur.Pyr and Pur.Pur.Pyr triplexes and does not contain continuous single-stranded regions. At basic pH (greater than 8.5) in the presence of magnesium ions, the modification pattern corresponds to Pur.Pur.Pyr triplex formation in the whole insert. At neutral pH in the presence of magnesium, both nodule DNA and the Pur.Pur.Pyr triplex can be formed in the insert. We also observed a magnesium-dependent transition at neutral pH in the other Pur.Pyr insert containing plasmids. These data demonstrate that Pur.Pyr sequences can adopt several non-B conformations at close to in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1577260677,"The topology of integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins can be analyzed using alkaline phosphatase fusions by determining which constructs have low and which have high specific activity. We show that in all cases the enzymatic activity is due to the fraction of the alkaline phosphatase moiety of the fusion protein localized to the periplasm. We present evidence that these fusions can also be used to analyze the process of assembly of cytoplasmic proteins into the membrane. The rate of acquisition of protease resistance of the alkaline phosphatase moiety of such hybrid proteins is compared for fusions to periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains. We show that this process, which is assumed to be representative of export of alkaline phosphatase, is significantly slower for fusions to cytoplasmic and certain periplasmic domains than for most periplasmic domains. These results are discussed in the context of the normal assembly of integral membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1603902297,"Interactions among the three major constituents of focal adhesions, talin, actin, and alpha-actinin, were studied. No evidence was obtained for the direct interaction between talin and alpha-actinin. Both talin and alpha-actinin increased the rate and extent of polymerization of actin, and their effects were additive. Whereas talin alone exhibited very little actin-gelating activity, it potentiated markedly the gelation in the presence of alpha-actinin and lowered the concentration of alpha-actinin necessary for the gel formation. Its gelation-potentiating activity on prepolymerized actin was much smaller than observed on G-actin. Treatment of talin with a cross-linking reagent, 1-ethyl-3[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide or dimethyl suberimidate, resulted in the formation of its oligomeric polypeptides. The complexes of talin and G-actin were also demonstrated with the cross-linking reagents and fluorescence-labeled actin. These results indicate that talin is able to cross-link some limited regions of actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1556928805,"Platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP)IIb-IIIa exists as a divalent cation-dependent heterodimer which recognizes the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of adhesive proteins. To isolate the RGD binding domain of GPIIb-IIIa we performed proteolysis of GPIIb-IIIa with alpha-chymotrypsin. GPIIb-IIIa was bound to an affinity matrix of GRGDSPK-coupled Sepharose 4B and was then treated with chymotrypsin. After washing the unbound fragments, two discrete polypeptides of 55 and 85 kDa remained bound to the RGD affinity matrix and were specifically eluted by soluble HHLGGAKQAGDV (H12) or by GRGDSP, but not by GRGESP. Immunoblotting with subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies showed that the 55- and 85-kDa fragments were derived from GPIIb and GPIIIa, respectively. Amino-terminal sequencing and immunoblotting using site-specific antibodies indicated that these fragments contained the amino termini of their parent molecules. In the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+, these two fragments were maintained as a heterodimer inasmuch as both fragments were immunoprecipitated by the polyclonal anti-GPIIIa antibodies. In contrast, chelating the divalent cations with 5 mM EDTA resulted in the lack of co-immunoprecipitation of the 55-kDa GPIIb fragment. After removal of the H12 peptide, the 55/85-kDa heterodimer bound to immobilized fibrinogen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by an RGD-dependent mechanism. These findings suggest that the RGD binding domain and structures required for heterodimer maintenance are present within the 55/85-kDa chymotryptic fragment of GPIIb-IIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1545319559,"c-myb is expressed predominantly in proliferating immature hemopoietic cells and, like v-myb, functions as a transcriptional activator that displays sequence-specific DNA binding. Oncogenic activation of the c-myb protein (Myb) is associated with carboxyl-terminal and/or amino-terminal truncations, the former of which also potentiates Myb's transcriptional activation capacity. We show here that a carboxyl-truncated Myb protein binds with a 7-fold higher affinity to an oligonucleotide bearing a Myb recognition sequence than does the full-length form. In addition, data are presented which show that Myb binds with different apparent affinities to variants of the recognition site and that Myb binds independently to adjacent sites regardless of the orientation of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W1576739831,"The reactions of cytochromes P450101 (P450cam), P450108 (P450terp), and P450102 (P450BM-3) with phenyldiazene result in the formation of phenyl-iron complexes with absorption maxima at 474-478 nm. Treatment of the cytochrome P450 complexes with K3Fe(CN)6 decreases the 474-478 nm absorbance and shifts the phenyl group from the iron to the porphyrin nitrogens. Acidification and extraction of the prosthetic group from each of the ferricyanide-treated enzymes yields a different mixture of the four possible N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomers. The ratios of the regioisomers with the phenyl ring on pyrrole rings B, A, C, and D (in order of elution from the high performance liquid chromatography column) are, respectively: cytochrome P450cam, 0:0:1:4; P450terp, 0:0:0:1; and P450BM-3, 2:10:2:1. The isomer ratio for recombinant cytochrome P450BM-3 without the cytochrome P450 reductase domain (2:9:2:1) shows that the reductase domain does not detectably perturb the active site topology of cytochrome P450BM-3. Potassium ions modulate the intensity of the spectrum of the phenyl-iron complex of cytochrome P450cam, but do not alter the N-phenyl isomer ratio. Computer graphics analysis of the crystal structure of the cytochrome P450cam phenyl-iron complex indicates that the active site of cytochrome P450cam is open above pyrrole ring D and, to a small extent, pyrrole ring C, in complete agreement with the observed N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomer pattern. The regioisomer ratios indicate that the active site of cytochrome P450terp is only open above pyrrole ring D, whereas that of cytochrome P450BM-3 is open to some extent above all the pyrrole rings but particularly above pyrrole ring A. The bacterial enzymes thus have topologies distinct from each other and from those of the mammalian enzymes so far investigated, which have active sites that are open to a comparable extent above pyrrole rings A and D."
