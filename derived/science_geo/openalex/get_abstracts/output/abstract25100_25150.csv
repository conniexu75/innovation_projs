https://openalex.org/W1606394252,"A general transcription factor (BTF2) has been purified from HeLa whole cell extract and shown to be absolutely required for the formation of a functional initiation complex. We also demonstrate that this factor binds in solution to RNA polymerase B(II) and to the other general transcription factors BTF1(TFIID), BTF3, and BTF4. These results strongly suggest the existence of multiple interactions between the various components of the multiprotein initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1533816737,"Pretreatment of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced resistance to the cytolytic activity of this cytokine in combination with cycloheximide. This resistance correlated with the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2). HT-1080 cells were transfected with a PAI-2 expression vector in both sense and antisense orientation. The resistance to TNF-mediated cytolysis of transfected cell clones was correlated with the level of PAI-2 expression. Cells expressing antisense PAI-2 RNA showed reduced expression of PAI-2 and increased sensitivity to TNF-mediated cytolysis. Cells expressing constitutively PAI-2 were treated with TNF and cycloheximide to select cells with increased resistance to cytolysis and enhanced PAI-2 expression. PAI-2 gradually disappeared during a treatment with TNF and cycloheximide. This finding suggested that PAI-2 formed a complex with a target proteinase, which could be involved in mediating the cytolytic activity of TNF."
https://openalex.org/W1533710344,"We present evidence to show that the alpha-amylase gene family in rice is under two different modes of regulation: 1) hormonal regulation in germinating seeds, and 2) metabolic repression in cultured cells by available carbohydrate nutrients. Expression of alpha-amylase genes in deembryoed rice seeds is known to be induced by exogenous gibberellic acid. On the other hand, expression of alpha-amylase genes in suspension-cultured cells is induced by the deprivation of carbohydrate nutrient. A lag period of 2-4 h is required for the induction of alpha-amylase mRNA in sucrose-depleted medium. The induction of alpha-amylase expression is extraordinarily high and levels of alpha-amylase mRNA can be increased 8-20-folds after 24 h of sucrose starvation. The synthesis and secretion of alpha-amylase is also dependent upon the level of carbon source. The derepression or repression of alpha-amylase synthesis can be readily reversed by the deprivation or replenishment of sucrose in the medium, respectively. Glucose and fructose exert a repression on the alpha-amylase synthesis similar to that of sucrose. A hypothesis that explains the induction of alpha-amylase synthesis by carbohydrate starvation is proposed. Our data have suggested a hitherto undiscovered, potentially important control mechanism of carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants."

Cell extracts contain a substantial nucleoside hydrolase activity but an insignificant purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The nucleoside hydrolase has been purified 1000-fold to greater than 99% homogeneity from kilogram quantities of C. fasciculata. The enzyme is a tetramer of Mr 34,000 subunits to give an apparent holoenzyme Mr of 143,000 by gel filtration. All of the commonly occurring nucleosides are substrates. The Km values vary from 0.38 to 4.7 mM with purine nucleosides binding more tightly than the pyrimidines. Values of Vmax/Km vary from 3.4 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 to 1.7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 with the pyrimidine nucleosides giving the larger values. The turnover rate for inosine is 32 s-1 at 30 degrees C. The kinetic mechanism with inosine as substrate is rapid equilibrium with random product release. The hydrolytic reaction can be reversed to give an experimental Keq of 106 M with H2O taken as unity. The product dissociation constants for ribose and hypoxanthine are 0.7 and 6.2 mM, respectively. Deoxynucleosides or 5'-substituted nucleosides are poor substrates or do not react, and are poor inhibitors of the enzyme. The enzyme discriminates against methanol attack from solvent during steady-state catalysis, indicating the participation of an enzyme-directed water nucleophile. The pH profile for inosine hydrolysis gives two apparent pKa values of 6.1 with decreasing Vmax/Km values below the pKa and a plateau at higher pH values. These effects are due to the pH sensitivity of the Vmax values, since Km is independent of pH. The pH profile implicates two negatively charged groups which stabilize a transition state with oxycarbonium character."
https://openalex.org/W1503953082,"The subcellular compartment in which apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA is edited is unknown. We studied the site of endogenous apoB mRNA editing and correlated the extent of editing with mRNA maturation in the rat liver. RNA editing activity was demonstrated in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. The specific activity of the editing activity was 5.5-fold higher in the nuclear extract, which was not accounted for by activators, inhibitors, or modulators. However, the total editing activity was 3.1 times higher in the cytoplasmic extract. Highly purified rat liver nuclear apoB mRNA contained 17.3 +/- 1.45% edited sequences compared with 56 +/- 2.5% and 62.15 +/- 6.2% edited sequences in hepatic total and polysomal RNAs, respectively. Because of the significant extent of editing of total nuclear RNA, we fractionated it into a poly(A-) and poly(A+) fraction. While the poly(A-) nuclear fraction contained only 10.4 +/- 1.1% edited sequences, which represents a maximum estimate, the poly(A+) nuclear apoB mRNA contained 50 +/- 1.8% edited sequences, a value very similar to that for polysomal RNA. By direct sequencing of cDNA and genomic clones, we found that as in the case of the human apoB gene, the rat apoB gene contains an intron 25 immediately upstream of the edited exon 26. Using this information, we developed a method to examine in a highly selective manner apoB mRNA that is present in the nucleus before splicing of intron 25 and after splicing of this intron. The unspliced nuclear pre-mRNA contained 7.4 +/- 0.2% edited sequences compared with 51.0 +/- 0.9% edited sequences in the spliced nuclear apoB mRNA. Furthermore, in the poly(A-) pool of apoB pre-mRNA, unspliced nuclear pre-mRNA contained hardly any (1.56%) edited sequences, and the spliced nuclear pre-mRNA contained 7.8 +/- 0.6% edited mRNA. In the poly(A+) fraction, unspliced nuclear pre-mRNA had 25.4 +/- 0.05% and spliced nuclear mRNA 53 +/- 0.6% of its apoB mRNA in an edited form. We conclude that in the rat liver apoB mRNA editing is not a cotransciptional event. It occurs posttranscriptionally, but the process is essentially complete in the spliced polyadenylated apoB mRNA before it leaves the nucleus. Little, if any, additional editing occurs in the cytoplasmic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1563686976,"The nucleotide sequence of one of the putrescine transport operons (pPT71), located at 16 min of the Escherichia coli chromosome, was determined. It contained the genes for an induced ornithine decarboxylase and a putrescine transport protein. The gene for the ornithine decarboxylase contained a 2,196-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 732-amino acid protein whose calculated Mr was 82,414, and the predicted amino acid sequence from the open reading frame had 65% homology with that of a constitutive ornithine decarboxylase encoded by the gene at 64 min. The ornithine decarboxylase activity was observed in the cells carrying pPT71 cultured at pH 5.2, but not in the cells cultured at pH 7.0. The gene for the putrescine transport protein contained a 1,317-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 439-amino acid protein whose calculated Mr was 46,494. The hydropathy profile of the putrescine transport protein revealed that it consisted of 12 putative transmembrane spanning segments linked by hydrophilic segments of variable length. The transport protein was in fact found in the membrane fraction. When the gene for the putrescine transport protein was linked to the tet promoter of the vector instead of its own promoter, the putrescine transport activity increased greatly. The results suggest that the gene expression of the operon is repressed strongly under standard conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1569276586,"A portion of rat mannose-binding protein A (MBP-A), a Ca(2+)-dependent animal lectin, has been overproduced in a bacterial expression system, biochemically characterized, and crystallized. A fragment corresponding to the COOH-terminal 115 residues of native MBP-A, produced by subtilisin digestion of the bacterially expressed protein, contains the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Gel filtration, chemical cross-linking, and crystallographic self-rotation function analyses indicate that the subtilisin fragment is a dimer, although the complete bacterially expressed fragment, containing the neck and CRD of MBP-A, is a trimer. Crystals of the minimal CRD, obtained only as a complex with a Man6GlcNAc2Asn glycopeptide, diffract to Bragg spacings of at least 1.7 A. Several trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) can substitute for Ca2+, as assessed by their ability to support carbohydrate binding and to protect the CRD from proteolysis in a manner similar to that observed for Ca2+. These assays indicate that Ln2+ binds about 30 times more tightly than Ca2+ to the CRD, and that two Ca2+ or Ln3+ bind to each monomer, a result confirmed by determination of the Ho3+ positions in a Ho(3+)-containing crystal of the CRD. Crystals grown in the presence of Ln3+ belong to different space groups from those obtained with Ca2+ and are therefore not useable for traditional crystallographic phase determination methods, but are well-suited for high resolution structure determination by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing."
https://openalex.org/W1670885862,"The role of seleno-glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx; EC 1.11.1.9) in the cellular defense against oxidative stress was selectively investigated in novel cell models. Expression vectors designed to overexpress human GSHPx efficiently in a broad range of mammalian cells were used to transfect T47D human breast cells which contain very low levels of endogenous GSHPx. Several stable transfectants expressing GSHPx to various extents, up to 10-100 times more than parental cells, were isolated and characterized. Growth inhibition kinetics following transient exposure to increasing concentrations of H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide or menadione (an intracellular source of free radicals and reactive oxygen intermediates) showed that transfectants overexpressing GSHPx were considerably more resistant than control T47D cell derivatives to each of these oxidants. A sensitive DNA end-labeling procedure was used as a novel approach to compare relative extents of DNA strand breakage in these cells. In contrast to the extensive DNA damage induced in control transfectants by 1-h exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of menadione, the extent of DNA breakage detected in GSHPx-rich transfectants was remarkably reduced (6- to 9-fold, p less than 0.005)."
https://openalex.org/W1574547932,"Pancreatic RNase injected into Xenopus oocytes abolishes protein synthesis at concentrations comparable to the toxin ricin yet has no effect on oocyte protein synthesis when added to the extracellular medium. Therefore RNase behaves like a potent toxin when directed into a cell. To explore the cytotoxic potential of RNase toward mammalian cells, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A was coupled via a disulfide bond to human transferrin or antibodies to the transferrin receptor. The RNase hybrid proteins were cytotoxic to K562 human erythroleukemia cells in vitro with an IC50 around 10(-7) M whereas greater than 10(-5) M native RNase was required to inhibit protein synthesis. Cytotoxicity requires both components of the conjugate since excess transferrin or ribonuclease inhibitors added to the medium protected the cells from the transferrin-RNase toxicity. Compounds that interfere with transferrin receptor cycling and compartmentalization such as ammonium chloride decreased the cytotoxicity of transferrin-RNase. After a dose-dependent lag period inactivation of protein synthesis by transferrin-RNase followed a first-order decay constant. In a clonogenic assay that measures the extent of cell death 1 x 10(-6) M transferrin-RNase killed at least 4 logs or 99.99% of the cells whereas 70 x 10(-6) M RNase was nontoxic. These results show that RNase coupled to a ligand can be cytotoxic. Human ribonucleases coupled to antibodies also may exhibit receptor-mediated toxicities providing a new approach to selective cell killing possibly with less systemic toxicity and importantly less immunogenicity than the currently employed ligand-toxin conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1557412251,"We have identified a gene that encodes Old Yellow Enzyme in brewer's bottom yeast. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 400 amino acids with Mr = 45,021. Using the T7 RNA polymerase system, recombinant enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli. 17 mg of Old Yellow Enzyme was obtained from a 3-liter cell culture, and the recombinant enzyme had NADPH oxidase activity. On fast protein liquid chromatography separation, the recombinant enzyme showed a single large peak, while native enzyme from brewer's bottom yeast separated into five fractions on fast protein liquid chromatography. Southern blot analysis showed that there are at least two Old Yellow Enzyme genes in brewer's bottom yeast genomic DNA. These results suggest that the heterogeneity of Old Yellow Enzyme in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis is due to the presence of multiple genes."
https://openalex.org/W1606697306,"Lavendustin-A was reported to be a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (Onoda, T., Iinuma, H., Sasaki, Y., Hamada, M., Isshibi, K., Naganawa, H., Takeuchi, T., Tatsuta, K., and Umezawa, K. (1989) J. Nat. Prod. 52, 1252-1257). Its inhibition kinetics was studied in detail using the baculovirus-expressed recombinant intracellular domain of the EGF receptor (EGFR-IC). Lavendustin-A (RG 14355) is a slow and tight binding inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase. The pre-steady state kinetic analysis demonstrates that the inhibition corresponds to a two-step mechanism in which an initial enzyme-inhibitor complex (EI) is rapidly formed followed by a slow isomerization step to form a tight complex (EI*). The dissociation constant for the initial rapid forming complex is 370 nM, whereas the overall dissociation constant is estimated to be less than or equal to 1 nM. The difference between the two values is due to the tight binding nature of the inhibitor to the enzyme in EI*. The kinetic analysis using a preincubation protocol to pre-equilibrate the enzyme with the inhibitor in the presence of one substrate showed that Lavendustin-A is a hyperbolic mixed-type inhibitor with respect to both ATP and the peptide substrate, with a major effect on the binding affinities for both substrates. An analogue of Lavendustin-A (RG 14467) showed similar inhibition kinetics to that of Lavendustin-A. The results of the pre-steady state analysis are also consistent with the proposed two-step mechanism. The dissociation constant for the initial fast forming complex in this case is 3.4 microM, whereas the overall dissociation constant is estimated to be less than or equal to 30 nM. It is a partial (hyperbolic) competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP. Its inhibition is reduced to different extents by different peptide substrates, when the peptide is added to the enzyme simultaneously with the inhibitor. When studied with the least protective peptide, K1 (a peptide containing the major autophosphorylation site of the EGF receptor), RG 14467 acts as a hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1841400157,"The rhamnosyltransferase catalyzing the production of the bitter flavanone-glucosides, naringin and neohesperidin, was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of rhamnose from UDP-rhamnose to the C-2 hydroxyl group of glucose attached via C-7-O- of naringenin or hesperetin. To our knowledge this is the first complete purification of a rhamnosyl-transferase. The enzyme from young pummelo leaves was purified greater than 2,700-fold to a specific activity of over 600 pmol/min/mg of protein by sequential column chromatographies on Sephacryl S-200, reactive green 19-agarose, and Mono-Q. The enzyme was selectively eluted from the green dye column with only three other proteins by a pulse of the substrate hesperetin-7-O-glucoside followed by UDP. The rhamnosyltransferase is monomeric (approximately 52 kDa) by gel filtration and electrophoresis. The enzyme rhamnosylates only with UDP-rhamnose. Flavonoid-7-O-glucosides are usable acceptors but 5-O-glucosides or aglycones are not. It is inhibited by 10 microM UDP, its end product, but not by naringin or neohesperidin. Several flavonoid-aglycones at 100 microM inhibited the rhamnosyltransferase; UDP-sugars did not. The Km for UDP-rhamnose was similar with prunin (1.3 microM) and hesperetin-7-O-glucoside (1.1 microM) as substrate. The affinity for the natural acceptor prunin (Km = 2.4 microM) was much higher than for hesperetin-7-O-glucoside (Km = 41.5 microM). The isolation of the gene may enable its use in genetic engineering directed to modifying grapefruit bitterness."
https://openalex.org/W1690419364,"A new member of the human cystatin multigene family has been cloned from a genomic library using a cystatin C cDNA probe. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4.3-kilobase DNA segment, containing a complete gene with structure very similar to those of known Family 2 cystatin genes, was determined. The novel gene, called CST4, is composed of three exons and two introns. It contains the coding information for a protein of 142 amino acid residues, which has been tentatively called cystatin D. The deduced amino acid sequence includes a putative signal peptide and presents 51-55% identical residues with the sequences of either cystatin C or the secretory gland cystatins S, SN, or SA. The cystatin D sequence contains all regions of relevance for cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity and also the 4 cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges in the other members of cystatin Family 2. Northern blot analysis revealed that the cystatin D gene is expressed in parotid gland but not in seminal vesicle, prostate, epididymis, testis, ovary, placenta, thyroid, gastric corpus, small intestine, liver, or gall-bladder tissue. This tissue-restricted expression is in marked contrast with the wider distribution of all the other Family 2 cystatins, since cystatin C is expressed in all these tissues and the secretory gland cystatins are present in saliva, seminal plasma, and tears. Cystatin D, being the first described member of a third subfamily within the cystatin Family 2, thus appears to have a distinct function in the body in contrast to other cystatins."
https://openalex.org/W1547327928,"In this study a model system for expression of the chicken progesterone receptor in cultured cells was developed using a quail fibroblast cell line, QT6. The chicken progesterone receptor form A expressed in QT6 cells was evaluated and determined to have a number of similarities to receptor isolated from chicken oviduct. These include hormone binding, sedimentation profile, phosphorylation pattern, heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and hsp90 associations and the ability to stimulate a reporter gene construct. Therefore, the receptor expressed in this system functioned adequately for further evaluation of the particular region (or regions) involved in hsp70 and hsp90 binding. Several receptor deletion mutants were tested for hsp70/hsp90 binding; only the d369-659 mutant, which has the entire steroid-binding domain deleted, was unable to bind hsp90 and hsp70. Three separate regions of the steroid-binding domain were found to partially restore hsp90 and hsp70 binding to the d369-659 mutant protein. However, hsp binding was not abolished when these or other regions of the steroid binding domain were deleted individually. These findings indicate that hsp90 and hsp70 both bind to the steroid-binding domain of the receptor through interactions at multiple locations or through some structural quality that is distributed throughout this region of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1584978389,"The protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Src leads to the transcriptional activation of the mitogen-responsive transcription factor Egr-1. c-Raf-1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in the transduction of signals induced by mitogens. The involvement of c-Raf-1 in v-Src-induced Egr-1 expression was investigated using an inhibitory mutant of c-Raf-1. We report here that expression of a kinase-defective mutant of c-Raf-1 inhibits v-Src-induced activation of the Egr-1 promoter. This inhibition is reversed by overexpression of wild type c-Raf-1. Consistent with an involvement of c-Raf-1 in a signaling pathway leading to Egr-1 expression, we find that v-Raf induces Egr-1 promoter activation. These data suggest that c-Raf-1 is a component in an intracellular signaling pathway initiated by v-Src leading to the induction of the mitogen-responsive transcription factor Egr-1."
https://openalex.org/W1588873317,"Elevated expression of the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a characteristic of several malignancies including those of the breast, bladder, prostate, lung, and neuroglia. To therapeutically target the cytotoxic action of diphtheria toxin to EGF receptor-expressing tumor cells, we have constructed a hybrid gene in which the sequences for the binding domain of diphtheria toxin have been replaced by those for human EGF. The resulting fusion toxins, DAB486EGF and DAB389EGF, bind specifically to the EGF receptor and inhibit protein synthesis in a variety of EGF receptor expressing human tumor cell lines with an IC50 as low as 0.1 pM. Comparisons of DAB486EGF and DAB389EGF showed that DAB389EGF was consistently 10- to 100-fold more cytotoxic than DAB486EGF. Like diphtheria toxin, the cytotoxic action of DAB389EGF results from ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 and is sensitive to the action of chloroquine. Studies of the kinetics of cellular intoxication showed that a 15-min exposure of EGF receptor-expressing A431 cells to DAB389EGF results in complete protein synthesis inhibition within 4 h. Furthermore, inhibition of protein synthesis results in elimination of human tumor cell colonies. These findings show that DAB389EGF is a potential therapeutic agent for a wide variety of EGF receptor-expressing solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1916742722,"The CDC42Hs protein appears to be an isoform of the ras-related GTP-binding protein G25K and is an apparent human homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-division-cycle protein, CDC42Sc. In this study, we report the identification of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for CDC42Hs from human platelets (designated from here on as CDC42Hs-GAP). The CDC42Hs-GAP activity was solubilized from platelet membranes, recovered through successive chromatography steps (the final step being Mono-Q chromatography), and purified approximately 3500-fold. The CDC42Hs-GAP activity appeared to correspond to a polypeptide with an apparent Mr of approximately 25,000. The GTPase activities of the purified human platelet CDC42Hs, the Escherichia coli-recombinant CDC42Hs, and the Spodoptera frugiperda-recombinant GTP-binding proteins are all stimulated by the CDC42Hs-GAP to identical extents, which indicates that the recombinant CDC42Hs proteins are as effective as the native human platelet protein in coupling to the GAP. However, a mutant form of the E. coli-recombinant CDC42Hs which contains a valine residue at position 12 (CDC42HsVal-12) has a significantly reduced intrinsic GTPase activity (relative to the wild type CDC42HsGly-12) which is not stimulated by the CDC42Hs-GAP. The CDC42Hs-GAP also does not stimulate the GTPase activities of the ras or rap GTP-binding proteins; however, it is capable of a weak stimulation of the GTPase activity of mammalian rho. Based on the apparent similarities in the molecular size of the CDC42Hs- and rho-GAPs (i.e. 25-30 kDa), and the cross-reactivity of rho with the CDC42Hs-GAP, it seems likely that the CDC42Hs- and rho-GAPs will constitute a specific subclass of the ras-related GAP superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1528133103,"The riboflavin precursor, L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate, is formed from D-ribulose 5-phosphate by a single 24-kDa enzyme. Studies with various specifically 13C-labeled D-ribulose 5-phosphates as substrate showed that the carbon atoms 1-3 of the enzyme product correspond to carbon atoms 1-3 of the substrate, whereas C-4 of the product stems from C-5 of the substrate. Carbon atom 4 of the substrate is released as formate together with the hydrogen atom attached to it. The skeletal rearrangement which leads to the loss of C-4 and the direct linkage between C-3 and C-5 of the substrate is an intramolecular reaction. The hydrogen atom at C-3 of the enzyme product is introduced from solvent water. A reaction mechanism which is in agreement with all experimental data is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1487733459,"Abstract The animal fatty acid synthase is a multifunctional protein with a subunit molecular weight of 260,000. We recently reported the expression and characterization of the acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains of the chicken liver fatty acid synthase in Escherichia coli. In order to gain insight into the mechanism of action of the thioesterase domain, we have replaced the putative active site serine 101 with alanine and cysteine and the conserved histidine 274 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. While both the Ser101----Ala and His274----Ala mutant proteins were inactive, the Ser101----Cys mutant enzyme (thiol-thioesterase) retained considerable activity, but the properties of the enzyme were changed from an active serine esterase to an active cysteine esterase, providing strong evidence for the role of Ser101 as the active site nucleophile. In order to further probe into the role of His274, a double mutant was constructed containing both the Ser101----Cys and the His274----Ala mutations. The double-mutant protein was inactive and exhibited diminished reactivity of the Cys-SH to iodoacetamide as compared to that of the Ser101----Cys-thioesterase, suggesting a role of His274 as a general base in withdrawing the proton from the Cys-SH in the thiol-thioesterase or Ser101 in the wild-type enzyme. Incubation of the recombinant thioesterases with [1-14C] palmitoyl-CoA resulted in the incorporation of [1-14C] palmitoyl into the enzyme only in the double mutant, suggesting that Cys-SH of the double mutant is reactive enough to form the palmitoyl-S-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is not hydrolyzed because of the lack of His274, which is required for the attack of H2O on the acyl enzyme. These results suggest that the catalytic mechanism of the thioesterases may be similar to that of the serine proteases and lipases, which employ a serine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad as part of their catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1664264312,"Abstract Vertebrate blood sera contain a that elicits oscillatory chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes through activation of the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. This was purified from rabbit and human sera by a sequence of Blue-Agarose chromatography, concanavalin A affinity chromatography, and hydroxyapatite fractionation, yielding a single active protein band (67 kDa). This protein is a subfraction of serum albumin, as revealed by its molecular mass, isoelectric properties, peptide maps, amino acid composition, and NH2-terminal sequence. Moreover, the could be purified with a monoclonal antibody to serum albumin and its ability to elicit oscillatory currents was inhibited by several polyclonal-monospecific antibodies to serum albumin. Various commercial high purity albumin preparations elicited oscillatory currents in oocytes. The activity of albumin was partially reduced by charcoal absorption and was greatly diminished when crystalline albumin was extracted with dry methanol. However, the activity was resistant to extraction with chloroform/ether, disulfide cleavage, and denaturation with 8 M urea, 6 M guanidinium chloride, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Trypsin or lipase treatment substantially reduced the potency of the active albumin, but neither treatment alone abolished the even after prolonged digestion. In contrast to serum or serum albumin, freshly collected blood plasma or purified plasma albumin did not evoke oscillatory currents. This indicates that some of the plasma albumin changes during blood coagulation and acquires a factor that makes it capable of activating the phosphatidylinositol-Ca2+ system in Xenopus oocytes. The serum also activates the phosphatidylinositol system in a variety of mammalian cells, suggesting that the modified albumin may play a role in cellular events related to tissue repair following injury."
https://openalex.org/W1489829446,"Bovine liver mitochondrial translational initiation factor 2 (IF-2mt) has been purified to near homogeneity. The scheme developed results in a 24,000-fold purification of the factor with about 26% recovery of activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that IF-2mt has a subunit molecular mass of 85 kDa. IF-2mt promotes the binding of formyl(f)Met-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes but is inactive with the nonformylated derivative. IF-2mt is active on chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits, but IF-2chl has no activity in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to animal mitochondrial ribosomes. IF-2mt is sensitive to elevated temperatures and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. It is partially protected from heat and N-ethylmaleimide inactivation by the presence of either GTP or GDP suggesting that guanine nucleotides may bind to this factor directly. The binding of fMet-tRNA to mitochondrial ribosomes requires the presence of GTP and is inhibited by GDP. DeoxyGTP is very effective in replacing GTP in promoting fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes and some activity is also observed with ITP. No activity is observed with ATP, CTP, or UTP. Nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP can promote formation of both 28 S and 55 S initiation complexes indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for subunit joining in the animal mitochondrial system."
https://openalex.org/W1593237929,"Inhibition of protein synthesis stabilizes a number of mRNAs, but little is known about the mechanism. To understand the relationship between protein synthesis and mRNA stability, we studied the degradation of calcitonin-induced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA in LLC-PK cells. uPA mRNA became highly stable by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or pactamycin, and the stabilizing effect of cycloheximide treatment was time dependent with the full effect exerted by 60 min. Stabilization was also observed with histone H4 mRNA but only partially with c-myc mRNA. To further analyze, we developed a cell-free decay reaction system based on post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS). In this system, uPA mRNA was completely stable when fractions were obtained from cells pretreated with cycloheximide, but very unstable in control fractions, paralleling uPA mRNA stability in intact cells. However, in contrast to uPA mRNA and the in vivo observation, histone H4 mRNA was unstable whether or not the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide. These results suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis stabilizes mRNAs in at least two different ways in LLC-PK1 cells. When PMS from cycloheximide/calcitonin-treated cells was mixed with PMS from untreated cells, uPA mRNA was not destabilized. This suggests that a putative labile factor responsible for uPA mRNA degradation is not a soluble protein."
https://openalex.org/W1479936980,"Insulin treatment of fibroblasts overexpressing the insulin receptor causes a rapid accumulation of the GTP-bound form of p21ras. We have studied the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in, and the effect of phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a putative inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity on, this process. Activation of p21ras was not observed when the cells were stimulated with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and pretreatment with TPA for 16 h, sufficient to down-regulate PKC activity, did not abolish p21ras activation by insulin. These results show that PKC is not involved in the insulin-induced activation of p21ras. Pretreatment of the cells with PAO for 5 min completely blocked insulin-induced p21ras activation. Addition of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol prevented this inhibition by PAO. Also, addition of PAO after insulin stimulation could reverse the activation of p21ras. Since PAO did not affect overall phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-chain, we conclude that a PAO-sensitive protein is involved in the induction of p21ras activation by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1551578945,"The present study was undertaken to determine the extent of COOH-terminal proteolytic processing in matrix Gla protein (MGP), a 10-kDa protein which contains 5 residues of the vitamin K-dependent Ca2+ binding amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). Two forms of MGP were isolated from demineralization and urea extracts of bovine cortical bone, one 79 residues in length with the COOH terminus Phe-Arg-Gln and the other 83 residues in length with the COOH terminus Phe-Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala. The 84-residue form of bovine MGP predicted from the message structure could not be detected in the bone extracellular matrix extracts, and it therefore seems probable that the lysine at position 84 was removed by the action of a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme prior to secretion. A plausible sequence of proteolytic cleavages that could generate the 79-residue form of MGP would be a trypsin-like cleavage at Arg80-Arg81 or Arg81-Gly82 followed by carboxypeptidase B-like cleavage to remove COOH-terminal arginine(s). Since essentially equal amounts of the 79- and 83-residue forms of MGP were also detected in bovine articular cartilage and plasma, it seems likely that the COOH-terminal processing events identified in bone apply to many of the other tissues which synthesize this protein. Only one form of MGP was detected in human bone extracts, a 77-residue protein that lacks the COOH-terminal residues Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gly-Thr-Lys. This shortened version of human MGP is consistent with the proposed model for COOH-terminal processing, since the amino acid substitution in the COOH terminus of the human protein, Lys79 for Gln79, would allow removal of the additional basic residues from the human MGP COOH terminus by the action of the carboxypeptidase B-like enzymic activity. Recent studies have shown that MGP is strongly induced by retinoic acid in fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, a response which suggests that MGP mediates an action of retinoic acid on an aspect of cell growth or differentiation. If this hypothesis is true, the present evidence for complex COOH-terminal processing events could provide a means to regulate the as yet unknown activity of MGP in the extracellular environment in a mechanism similar to the activation of hormones such as anaphlotoxins and kinins."
https://openalex.org/W1569099820,"Stopped-flow techniques were utilized to investigate the kinetics of the reaction of lignin peroxidase compounds I and II (LiPI and LiPII) with veratryl alcohol (VA). All rate data were collected from single turnover experiments under pseudo first-order conditions. The reaction of LiPI with VA strictly obeys second-order kinetics over the pH range 2.72-5.25 as demonstrated by linear plots of the pseudo first-order rate constants versus concentrations of VA. The second-order rate constants are strongly dependent on pH and range from 2.62 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 (pH 2.72) to 1.45 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 (pH 5.25). The reaction of LiPII and VA exhibits saturation behavior when the observed pseudo first-order rate constants are plotted against VA concentrations. The saturation phenomenon is quantitatively explained by the formation of a 1:1 LiPII-substrate complex. Results of kinetic and rapid scan spectral analyses exclude the formation of a LiPII-VA cation radical complex. The first-order dissociation rate constant and the equilibrium dissociation constant for the LiPII reaction are also pH dependent. Binding of VA to LiPII is controlled by a heme-linked ionizable group of pKa approximately 4.2. The pH profiles of the second-order rate constants for the LiPI reaction and of the first-order dissociation constants for the LiPII reaction both demonstrate two pKa values at approximately 3.0 and approximately 4.2. Protonated oxidized enzyme intermediates are most active, suggesting that only electron transfer, not proton uptake from the reducing substrate, occurs at the enzyme active site. These results are consistent with the one-electron oxidation of VA to an aryl cation radical by LiPI and LiPII."
https://openalex.org/W1504428449,"We, and others, have recently reported that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues during embryogenesis and in whole embryos during early organogenesis. Therefore, it is likely that, in addition to any effect on embryo growth, IGF-I plays a paracrine/autocrine role in development. The embryonic chicken lens, an avascular organ composed by a single type of cell that undergoes differentiation in vivo and in vitro, is an ideal model to characterize the paracrine/autocrine action of IGF-I. The lens cells express IGF-I receptors, and respond to exogenous IGF-I with induction of fiber cells differentiation and stimulation of delta-crystallin gene transcription. Whether embryonic lens cells express IGF-I was uncertain. In the present study, we used a sensitive semiquantitative method (reverse transcription of RNA followed by amplification with the polymerase chain reaction) to analyze IGF-I gene expression. An amplified product of the expected length (209 base pairs) was found in days 8, 12, 15, and 19 lenses. At all embryo ages studied, the product was more readily detected in the lens than in the liver, while in eye tissues (excluding lens), IGF-I expression was relatively high. After microdissection of the epithelial cells from the fully differentiated fiber cells, IGF-I expression was detected exclusively in the epithelial cells. IGF-I immunoactivity was found using high performance liquid chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay in the days 8-19 lens extracts, and in primary cultures of isolated epithelial cells. Our previous and present findings show that the lens has all the elements for IGF-I autocrine/paracrine action in development."
https://openalex.org/W1528592059,"The MalF protein is an integral membrane protein of Escherichia coli containing eight membrane-spanning stretches and a large periplasmic domain of approximately 180 amino acids. We have asked whether this protein is dependent for its membrane insertion on the bacterial secretion machinery specified by the sec genes. Using azide to inhibit the SecA protein and sec mutants to reduce the functioning of the machinery, we have studied the membrane assembly of MalF and beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase fusions to MalF. In no case did we see an effect of reducing sec gene function on the insertion of MalF or fusion proteins. Selection for mutants that would cause internalization of a MalF-beta-galactosidase hybrid protein yielded no mutations in sec genes. Our results suggest that MalF can assemble in the membrane independently of the bacterial secretion machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1536418167,"The kinetics of reaction between lentil seedlings amine oxidase and two amine substrates, namely putrescine and dimethylaminomethylbenzylamine, have been studied by rapid mixing with diode array detection. In this way several wavelengths can be monitored at once allowing the simultaneous measurement of enzyme bleaching and formation of a yellow radical intermediate. The two substrates are oxidized at rates that differ by one order of magnitude in favor of putrescine. Of the individual five rate constants measured and/or calculated from the experimental ones, k2 alone, the monomolecular transformation of ES to EP accounts for this difference. The reoxidation step is instead not rate limiting and identical for the two substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1537161537,"smg p21B, a member of the ras p21-like small GTP-binding protein superfamily, undergoes post-translational modifications, which are geranylgeranylation of the cysteine residue in the C-terminal region followed by removal of the three C-terminal amino acids (QLL) and the subsequent carboxyl methylation of the exposed prenylated cysteine residue. smg p21B has a polybasic region upstream of the prenylated cysteine residue. We have previously proposed that these C-terminal structures of smg p21B are essential for the action of its stimulatory GDP/GTP exchange protein, named GDP dissociation stimulator (GDS). We studied here which structure of the C-terminal region of smg p21B is important for its interaction with smg p21 GDS. For this purpose, we synthesized a peptide according to the C-terminal structure of smg p21B, which was PGKARKKSSC-geranylgeranyl-carboxyl methyl, and its variously modified peptides and examined their ability to interact with smg p21 GDS and to interfere with the smg p21 GDS action to stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of smg p21B. The results indicate that the phosphorylated form of PGKARKKSSC-geranylgeranyl stoichiometrically interacts with smg p21 GDS, that the presence of the geranylgeranyl moiety is essential for, but not sufficient for, the smg p21 GDS action, and that the presence of the methyl moiety, removal of the three C-terminal amino acids, and the presence of the polybasic amino acids also affect the smg p21 GDS action. It is likely that all the steps of the post-translational processing and presence of the polybasic region in the C-terminal region of smg p21B are related to its interaction with smg p21 GDS."
https://openalex.org/W1558180130,"Incubation of galactose treated Kluyveromyces bulgaricus yeast cells in EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline led to an extract possessing hemagglutinating and yeast flocculating properties. Purification of this extract by affinity chromatography and gel filtration gave two lectin forms, Kb-CWL I and Kb-CWL II, with an apparent molecular mass of 38,000 and 150,000 Da, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that Kb-CWL I and Kb-CWL II were dimeric and octameric of a subunit of 18,900 Da. At high concentration, purified Kb-CWL I associated to give Kb-CWL II. This association seemed to be independent on pH. The two lectin forms were glycoproteins, the peptide counterpart was very rich in Lys, Glu, and Gly, and the carbohydrate part represented 1% of the whole molecule and was composed of Glc, Man, and Ara. The two lectin forms (KB-CWL I and Kb-CWL II) agglutinated human red blood cells and flocculated EDTA-treated K. bulgaricus yeast cells. The activity of both lectin forms required Ca2+ ions, while Sr2+ showed some competitive inhibition. Optimal activity was obtained within a pH range of 4-6.5 for both forms. Temperatures of 80-90 degrees C for 20 min, or proteolytic treatment reduced irreversibly the activity of Kb-CWL I and Kb-CWL II. The role of the cell wall phosphopeptidomannan as a ligand and a potential physiological receptor of these lectin forms was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1652011955,"p18 is a phosphoprotein that is present in great abundance in acute leukemia blasts and in less abundance in proliferating lymphocytes. This protein undergoes major changes in its state of phosphorylation upon induction of differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. The same protein appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes that include regulation of hormone secretion, T cell activation, muscle differentiation, and brain development. In this report, we describe our studies of the regulation of expression of this gene in leukemic cells. We show that the expression of this gene is markedly reduced upon induction of differentiation of a variety of leukemic cells in culture. We use a cDNA clone that we constructed earlier which encodes this protein as a probe to isolate the human chromosomal p18 gene. We characterize the 5' end of this gene in detail and identify its promoter element. We also identify a regulatory element in the first intervening sequence (IVS-1) of this gene which loses its DNase I hypersensitivity upon induction of differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. Our DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrate nuclear protein binding to multiple sequence motifs within its promoter element and its IVS-1 regulatory element. Functional studies using a transient expression system show that deletion of these sequence motifs has profound effects on the expression of this gene. These studies begin to shed some light on the mechanism of regulation of a gene that may be involved in control of cell growth and differentiation and in a variety of other vital cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1591943713,"We treated intact cells with trypsin to remove most of the external domain of the transferrin receptor and investigated what effect the absence of the external domain had on the turnover of the fragment that remained associated with the cells. To detect the cell-associated tryptic fragment, which contains a small amount of the external domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic domain, we prepared an anti-peptide antibody against a segment of the cytoplasmic domain. This antibody specifically immunoprecipitated the intact transferrin receptor as well as a 21-kDa peptide from trypsin-treated HeLa cells. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 21-kDa peptide was the cell-associated tryptic fragment of the transferrin receptor. The fragment was only present in trypsin-treated cells; the fragment migrated as a dimer in nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as it should if it were derived from the transferrin receptor; a goat antibody prepared to the purified human transferrin receptor also precipitated the 21-kDa peptide from trypsinized cells. In addition, treating the tryptic fragment with neuraminidase increased the electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting the fragment contained O-linked carbohydrate. When cells were trypsinized and then incubated at 37 degrees C, the half-life of the tryptic fragment (15 +/- 4 h) was not significantly different than the half-life of the intact receptor (19 +/- 6 h). This indicates that removing 95% of the external domain of the transferrin receptor has little effect on processes operating in the turnover of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2128312951,"The three-dimensional structures of apo- and holomutant human lysozymes (D86/92 lysozyme), in which a calcium binding site was designed and created for enhancing molecular stability by replacing both Gln86 and Ala92 with aspartic acids, were refined at 1.8-A resolution by x-ray crystallography. The overall structures and crystallographic thermal factors of all three proteins, the apo-, holo-D86/92, and the wild-type human lysozymes, were essentially identical; these results showed that the introduction of the calcium binding site did not affect either the overall structure or molecular rigidity of the proteins. However, structure analyses of the apo-D86/92 lysozyme revealed that the mutations affected the side chain conformation of residue 86 and hydrogen networks between the protein and the internal solvent molecules. In the structure of the holo-D86/92 lysozyme, seven oxygen ligands formed a slightly distorted pentagonal bipyramid around the calcium ion, indicating that the coordination around the calcium ion was quite similar to that in baboon alpha-lactalbumin. The pentagonal bipyramid coordination could be one of the most widely found and appropriate calcium binding schemes in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1586063227,"We have examined the ability of the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), to regulate RNA polymerase III gene expression in Drosophila. Using nuclear run-on assays, we detected a 3-5-fold increase in tRNA synthesis following treatment of Drosophila Schneider S2 cells with TPA, whereas transcription from the actin 5C, fos-, and jun-related antigen promoters was unaffected. This response is rapid and transient, peaking at about a 45-min exposure of the cells to TPA, and dissipating after 60 min. We have reproduced this stimulation in vitro. Extracts prepared from cells treated with TPA show an approximate 10-fold increase in specific transcription using a 5 S RNA and various tRNA gene templates. The nonspecific transcription by RNA polymerase III in these extracts, however, is essentially unchanged. Mixing the extracts derived from uninduced and induced cells suggests that the TPA stimulation observed may be due to the increase of a positive-acting factor. These results are the first to demonstrate that a phorbol ester can induce RNA polymerase III gene expression. The ability to reproduce this activation in vitro will now allow us to assess the role of the transcription components in this regulatory event, and the biochemical consequence of this signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W69616607,"The complex of Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) with 5 S rRNA was analyzed in nuclease protection experiments using hydroxyl radical. The protection pattern reveals that TFIIIA interacts with a substantial amount of the RNA molecule, with close association between the factor and the arm of the RNA composed of helix IV-loop E-helix V. Additional sites of protection punctuate the other arm of the molecule. Important contact sites within the complex were identified in missing experiments. Random single-nucleoside gaps were introduced into 5 S rRNA using either Fe[EDTA]2-/H2O2 or bis(1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I). This modified RNA was allowed to bind to TFIIIA in an exchange reaction, and, afterward, bound and unbound fractions were separated on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Missing nucleoside positions specifically enriched in the unbound fraction of RNA are located in the two strands that comprise loop E. These are not necessarily sites of sequence-specific contacts, but rather may constitute a region of secondary structure essential to recognition and binding of TFIIIA to 5 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1500563880,"Human placental and germ cell alkaline phosphatases (PLAP and GCAP, respectively), are characterized by their differential sensitivities to inhibition by L-leucine, EDTA, and heat. Yet, they differ by only 7 amino acids at positions 15, 67, 68, 84, 241, 254, and 429 within their respective 484 residues. To determine the structural basis and the amino acid(s) involved in these physicochemical differences, we constructed three GCAP mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and six GCAP/PLAP chimeras and then expressed these alkaline phosphatase mutants in COS-1 cells. We report that the differential reactivity of PLAP and GCAP depends critically on a single amino acid at position 429. GCAP with Gly-429 is strongly inhibited by L-leucine, EDTA, and heat, whereas PLAP with Glu-429 is resistant. By substituting Gly-429 of GCAP with a series of amino acids, we demonstrate that the relative sensitivities of these mutants to L-leucine, EDTA, and heat inhibition are, in general, parallel. Mutants in the order of resistance to these treatments are: Glu (most resistant), Asp/Ile/Leu, Gln/Val/Lys, Ser/His, and Arg/Thr/Met/Cys/Phe/Trp/Tyr/Pro/Asn/Ala/Gly (least resistant). However, the Ser-429 and His-429 mutants were more resistant to EDTA and heat inhibition than the wild-type GCAP, but were equally sensitive to L-leucine inhibition. Structural analysis of mammalian alkaline phosphatase modeled on the refined crystal structure of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase indicates that the negative charge of Glu-429 of PLAP, which simultaneously stabilizes the protein as a whole and the metal binding specifically, probably acts through interactions with the metal ligand His-320 (His-331 in E. coli alkaline phosphatase). Replacement of codon 429 with Gly in GCAP leads to destabilization and loosening of the metal binding. The data suggest that the natural binding site for L-leucine may be near position 429, with the amino and carboxyl groups of L-leucine interacting with bound phosphate and His-432 (His-412 in E. coli alkaline phosphatase), respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1586866955,"The effects of the neuropeptide bradykinin (BK) and its natural proteolytic fragment Des-Arg9 bradykinin (DBK) on DNA synthesis and phospholipase C activation were investigated in cultured mesangial cells. DBK, acting through a distinct bradykinin receptor, induced DNA synthesis in serum-starved cultured mesangial cells. The effect of DBK was dose dependent (ED50 = 0.6 microM) and was strongly potentiated by insulin. Under the same conditions, BK had no effect. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by long term pretreatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) markedly reduced DBK-induced DNA synthesis. In the same way, co-incubation with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine potently attenuated the response to DBK, suggesting a role of protein kinase C in DBK-induced mitogenesis. Analysis of phosphoproteins from 32P-labeled mesangial cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that DBK, like TPA but not BK, induced a net increase in the phosphorylation of an acidic cellular protein migrating with an apparent Mr = 80,000 (termed 80K), identified as a major and specific substrate of protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of the 80K protein by DBK or TPA was completely abolished in cells depleted of protein kinase C. DBK and TPA also induced an increase in phosphorylation of an Mr = 28,000 protein. Moreover, DBK but not TPA stimulated the phosphorylation of an Mr = 18,000 protein in normal as well as in protein kinase C-depleted cells. Analysis of phospholipase C activation revealed that DBK induced a large and sustained increase in diacylglycerol production and inositol phosphate accumulation over a 10-min incubation. BK had only a minor effect on both parameters. These results demonstrate that DBK, but not BK, modulates DNA synthesis through protein kinase C activation in cultured mesangial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1538629029,"Escherichia coli citrate synthase is strongly and specifically inhibited by NADH, but this inhibition can be prevented by reacting the enzyme with Ellman's reagent. We have now labeled the single reactive cysteine covalently with monobromobimane and isolated and sequenced the bimane-containing cyanogen bromide peptide and identified the cysteine as Cys-206. Modeling studies suggest that this residue is on the subunit surface, 25-30 A from the active site. Mutation of Cys-206 to serine (C206S), or of Gly-207 to alanine (E207A), weakened NADH binding and inhibition; when these mutations were present together, NADH binding was weaker by 18-fold and inhibition by 250-fold. The mutations also had small effects on substrate binding at the active site. Cys-206 of wild type enzyme and of the mutant E207A was alkylated with 1,1,1-trifluorobromoacetone and the environment of the fluorine nuclei studied by 19F NMR. With wild type enzyme, the NMR spectrum consisted of two peaks of about equal intensity but different line widths, at -8.65 ppm (line width 11.2 +/- 0.5 Hz) and -7.6 ppm (line width 57 +/- 4 Hz). As the labeled wild type citrate synthase was titrated with KCl, the narrow peak converted to the broad one. The same range of KCl concentrations was needed for this conversion as for the allosteric activation of E. coli citrate synthase. The E207A mutant gave the broader NMR peak almost exclusively. We propose that the fluorine label in wild type citrate synthase exists in two conformational states with different mobilities, exchanging slowly on the NMR time scale, and that treatment with KCl, or truncation of the Glu-207 side chain by mutagenesis, stabilizes one of these states. Consistent with this explanation is the finding that Cys-206 reacts more quickly with Ellman's reagent in the presence of KCl, and that this rate is faster yet in the E207A mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1523405477,"To identify ionizations of the active site metal-bound water in horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.1), the pH, solvent isotope, temperature, and anion dependences of the steady-state kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/KM have been evaluated under initial velocity conditions for the native and the active site-specific Co(2+)-reconstituted enzyme. In the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, a bell-shaped pattern of four prototropic equilibria was observed under conditions of saturating concentrations of NAD+. It is shown that the ionizations governing kcat (pK1 congruent to 6.7, pK2 congruent to 10.6) belong to the ternary enzyme-NAD(+)-alcohol complex, whereas the ionizations governing kcat/KM (pK1' congruent to 7.5, pK2' congruent to 8.9) belong to the binary enzyme-NAD+ complex. The ionizations pK1 and pK1' are not influenced by metal substitution and are ascribed to His-51 on the basis of experimental estimates of their associated enthalpies of ionization. On the other hand, pK2 and pK2' are significantly decreased (delta pKa congruent to 1.0) in the Co(2+)-enzyme and are attributed to the active site metal-bound water molecule. The shape of the pH profiles requires that the metal ion coordinates a neutral water molecule in the ternary enzyme-NAD(+)-alcohol complex under physiological conditions. The possible catalytic role of the water molecule within a pentacoordinate metal ion complex in the active site is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1943224608,"The possible involvement of acyl-coenzyme A:1-acyllysophospholipid acyltransferase activity and phospholipid acylation-deacylation cycles in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition have been examined by direct methods. 1-Acyllysophospholipid acyltransferase activity found in mitochondrial preparations obtained by differential centrifugation is inhibited by several transition-inducing agents and by glutathione disulfide. However, marker enzyme analysis employing mitochondria prepared by Percoll density gradient centrifugation or fractionated by a shear force-dependent method indicate that this activity is associated with contaminating microsomes and not with mitochondria. The absence of phospholipid acylation-deacylation cycles in isolated mitochondria is demonstrated by the absence of 18O incorporation from H2(18)O into phospholipid acylester carbonyl groups, confirming conclusions arrived at from marker enzyme data by a definitive independent approach. Mitochondria prepared by differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation are shown to be equivalent in requirements for induction of the permeability transition and the apparent rate of this process. It is concluded that 1-acyllysophospholipid acyltransferase activity and phospholipid acylation-deacylation cycles are not factors regulating the transition in isolated mitochondria. However, mitochondrial phospholipase A2 activity remains as a potential regulating factor, whereas the action of transition-inducing agents on microsomal 1-acyllysophospholipid acyltransferase may be important in mechanisms of cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W1492234562,"Two different photoaffinity analogs of 4-hydroxy coumarin, 3-(p-azidobenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin (AzBHC) and 3-(4-azido-5-iodosalicylamido)-4-hydroxycoumarin (AzISAHC), are being used in the identification of warfarin-binding proteins present in mammalian tissue (Myszka, D. G., and Swenson, R. P. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 172, 415-422; Myszka, D. G., and Swenson, R. P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4789-4797). In this study, [14C]AzBHC, but not [125I]AzISAHC, was observed to specifically label a 15,000-dalton protein present in both the microsomal and cytosolic fractions of rat liver. Pretreatment of the crude protein samples with warfarin or dicoumarol completely protected the 15-kDa protein from modification by [14C]AzBHC, indicating that this photoaffinity reagent is specifically labeling a coumarin-binding protein. 4-Hydroxycoumarin itself and AzISAHC were unable to block the incorporation of this photoaffinity probe. The 15-kDa protein was isolated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis. The first 20 amino acid residues analyzed were found to be identical with the amino-terminal sequence of rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) (Gordon J. I., Alpers, D. H., Ockner, R. K., and Strauss, A. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3356-3363). Photoaffinity labeling and protection experiments carried out on purified preparations of L-FABP paralleled the labeling results obtained in the microsomes and cytosol, confirming that L-FABP is capable of specifically binding AzBHC, warfarin, and dicoumarol. Oleic acid, an established ligand for L-FABP, can compete with the binding of the photoaffinity probe; however, it was less effective in protecting the protein than warfarin. The specificity of labeling of crude liver fractions by warfarin photoaffinity analogs reported here as well as the high concentration of FABP in liver tissue together suggest that this protein may represent a major hepatic receptor responsible for the uptake and/or transport of various oral 4-hydroxycoumarin-based anticoagulant drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1502599455,"Abstract Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine how the allosteric properties of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) are affected by amino acid replacements in the nucleotide binding region of the regulatory polypeptide chains. Amino acid substitutions were made for both Lys-60 and Lys-94 in the regulatory chain since those residues have been implicated by x-ray diffraction studies, chemical modification experiments, and site-directed mutagenesis as playing a role in binding CTP and ATP. Lys-60 was replaced by His, Arg, Gln, and Ala, and Lys-94 was changed to His. These mutant forms of ATCase exhibit bewildering changes in the allosteric properties compared to the wild-type enzyme as well as altered affinities for the nucleotide effectors. The enzyme containing His-60 lacks both homotropic and heterotropic effects and exhibits no detectable binding of nucleotides. In contrast, the holoenzymes containing either Gln-60 or Arg-60 retain both homotropic and heterotropic effects. Replacement of Lys-60 by Ala yields a derivative exhibiting altered heterotropic effects involving insensitivity to CTP and activation by ATP. The mutant enzyme containing His-94 in place of Lys exhibits cooperativity with reduced affinity for nucleotides. The multiple substitutions at Lys-60 in the nucleotide binding region of the regulatory chains of ATCase demonstrate that different amino acids in the same location can alter indirectly the delicate balance of interactions responsible for the allosteric properties of ATCase. The studies show that it is hazardous and frequently unwarranted from single amino acid replacements of a specific residue to attribute to that residue the properties observed for the wild-type enzyme."

The inhibitory effect on octamer-binding proteins also occurs after culturing cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but it does not occur following alpha-IFN treatment of an alpha-IFN-resistant variant of the Daudi cell line or of HeLa cells. We discuss the potential role of the decreased levels of octamer-binding proteins in the inhibition of cell proliferation.
https://openalex.org/W2112650037,"Abstract Site-specific mutagenesis techniques have been used to construct active site variants of the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain present in the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP-KD). Striking alteration of its protease inhibitory properties were obtained when the putative P1 residue, arginine, was replaced with the small hydrophobic residue valine. The altered protein was no longer inhibitory toward bovine pancreatic trypsin, human Factor XIa, mouse epidermal growth factor-binding protein, or bovine chymotrypsin, all of which are strongly inhibited by the unaltered APP-KD (Sinha, S., Dovey, H. F., Seubert, P., Ward, P. J., Blacher, R. W., Blaber, M., Bradshaw, R. A., Arici, M., Mobley, W. C., and Lieberburg, I. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8983-8985). Instead, the P1-Val-APP-KD was a potent inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase, with a Ki = 0.8 nM, as estimated by the inhibition of the activity of human neutrophil elastase measured using a chromogenic substrate. It also inhibited the degradation of insoluble elastin by the enzyme virtually stoichiometrically. Replacement of the P1' (Ala) and P2' (Met) residues of P1-Val-MKD with the corresponding residues (Ser, Ile) from alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor resulted in an inactive protein, underscoring the mechanistic differences between the serpins from the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor family. These results confirm the importance of the P1 arginine residue of APP-KD in determining inhibitory specificity, and are also the first time that a single amino acid replacement has been shown to generate a specific potent human neutrophil elastase inhibitor from a human KD sequence."

The affinity of in vitro aldose reductase for 3-FG was approximately 20 times greater (9.3 mM) than that for glucose (188 mM). An excellent correlation between the rate of 3-FS production in the intact canine lens, determined with 19F NMR, and extracted aldose reductase activity was observed. The relatively high affinity of aldose reductase for 3-FG and the correlation of 3-FS production with enzyme activity in the intact lens suggests that 3-FS production from 3-FG detected by 19F NMR could provide an accurate noninvasive determination of aldose reductase activity in the eye lens."
https://openalex.org/W1564497002,"The distances between enzyme-bound paramagnetic CrATP (a stable, beta, gamma-bidentate complex of Cr3+ and ATP) at the active site of sheep brain pyridoxal kinase and the protons of bound inhibitor 4-dPyr (4-deoxypyridoxine) were determined in the ternary enzyme-CrATP.4-dPyr complex by measuring the paramagnetic effects of Cr3+ on the longitudinal relaxation rates (1/T1p) of the protons of 4-dPyr. The correlation time for the Cr(3+)-4-dPyr dipolar interaction on the enzyme was estimated as 1.59 ns by the frequency dependence of 1/T1p of water protons. Temperature dependence of 1/T1p values indicated the fast exchange of 4-dPyr from the paramagnetic enzyme.CrATP.4-dPyr complex; hence the measured 1/T1p values can be used for metalnucleus distance determinations. The distances from the Cr3+ of the enzyme-bound CrATP to the 2-methyl (7.19 A), 4-methyl (7.18 A), and H6 proton (6.18 A) of the 4-dPyr are too great to permit a direct coordination of any group from 4-dPyr. However, these distances can be built into a model in which phosphorus of the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP is 4 A away from the oxygen atom of the 5-CH2OH group of the 4-dPyr. This suggests that phosphorylation of pyridoxal can occur via direct transfer of the phosphoryl group between the bound substrates at the active site of pyridoxal kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1501677998,"There are 11 histidine residues in Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase. His-246 alpha is well established as the phosphorylation site of the enzyme. Replacement of this histidine by asparagine (Mann, C. J., Mitchell, T., and Nishimura, J. S. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 1497-1503) or by aspartic acid (Majumdar, R., Guest, J. R., and Bridger, W. A. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1076, 86-90) through site-directed mutagenesis resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. Chemical modification experiments suggested a second histidine at the active site (Collier, G. E., and Nishimura, J. S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10925-10930). In the present study, we have changed His-142 alpha to an asparagine residue using the technique of site-directed mutagenesis and have purified the mutant enzyme to homogeneity. The resulting mutant enzyme is practically devoid of enzyme activity but can be thiophosphorylated with adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and dethiophosphorylated with ADP at rates that are significantly faster than those with wild type enzyme. The observation that phosphorylated mutant enzyme can be dephosphorylated with succinate and with succinate plus desulfo-CoA at rates comparable with those with wild type enzyme suggests that mutant enzyme can bind succinate and CoA. Dethiophosphorylation of the enzyme in the presence of CoA plus succinate proceeds much faster with wild type than with mutant. While there was no significant change in KCoA or Ksuccinate, the turnover number for dethiophosphorylation of the mutant was 10-fold lower. These data are consistent with location of His-142 alpha at the active site and a facilitative role for this residue in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1503025018,"Abstract A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5'-d(CTAGT-CTAGACTAG)-3' which encodes translational termination codons in three reading frames, was inserted into either exon IV (pbGH-4A) or V (pbGH-5A) of the bovine growth hormone gene. The resultant plasmids, under the transcriptional regulation of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter, were introduced into cultured mouse L-cells or rat GH3 cells. Compared to wild type bGH RNA, bGH-specific RNA transiently expressed from pBGH-5A or pBGH-4A DNA in mouse L-cells was similar or slightly smaller in size, respectively. Unexpectedly, bGH-4A RNA lacked exon IV sequences. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that wild type bGH was localized to the Golgi apparatus, while truncated hormones were confined to the cytoplasmic compartment of transfected cells. In addition, truncated hormones were shown to be secretion-defective albeit the bGH signal peptide was efficiently and precisely processed. Thus, structural alterations in the bGH gene can dramatically affect bGH precursor mRNA processing and hormone localization within cultured mouse fibroblast or rat pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1582379549,"The stability of carboxypeptidase Y under different reaction conditions and in the presence various cosolvents was investigated. Loss of both hydrolysis and transpeptidation activities was monitored. Incubation of the enzyme at high temperatures or high pH resulted in the loss of both activities at the same rate. Addition of ammonium sulfate resulted in loss of transpeptidation activity but not hydrolysis activity. Addition of some organic solvents or Triton X-100 to the incubation mixture resulted in loss of both activities with transpeptidation being lost more rapidly than hydrolysis activity, while other organic solvents were observed to eliminate both activities entirely. Incubation of the enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in a decrease in both activities but hydrolysis was lost more rapidly than the transpeptidase activity. Implications of the observed preferential loss of activities to the labeling of peptides and proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599268066,"The composition and structural aspects of the amino and carboxylic acid groups required for incorporation into peptides by transpeptidation and inhibition of hydrolysis in carboxypeptidase Y-catalyzed reactions were studied. Separation of these two groups by even one carbon prevents incorporation by transpeptidation and does not inhibit incorporation of other amino acids into model peptides. Substitution of phosphonic or sulfonic acids for the carboxylic acid group also results in loss of incorporation by transpeptidation. Only the sulfonic acid analog of glycine causes inhibition of hydrolysis and this inhibition is lost when serine is included in the reaction. d-Serine is not incorporated by carboxypeptidase Y, and its presence in the reaction mixture does not inhibit the incorporation of the L-isomer."
