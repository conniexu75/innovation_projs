https://openalex.org/W2807721837,"Established cell lines are widely used in research, however an appealing question is the comparability of the cells between various laboratories, their characteristics and stability in time. Problematic is also the cell line misidentification, genetic and phenotypic shift or Mycoplasma contamination which are often forgotten in research papers. The monocyte/macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 has been one of the most commonly used myeloid cell line for more than 40 years. Despite its phenotypic and functional stability is often discussed in literature or at various scientific discussion panels, their stability during the consecutive passages has not been confirmed in any solid study. So far, only a few functional features of these cells have been studied, for example their ability to differentiate into osteoclasts. Therefore, in the present paper we have investigated the phenotype and functional stability of the RAW 264.7 cell line from passage no. 5 till passage no. 50. We found out that the phenotype (expression of particular macrophage-characteristic genes and surface markers) and functional characteristics (phagocytosis and NO production) of RAW 264.7 cell line remains stable through passages: from passage no. 10 up to passage no. 30. Overall, our results indicated that the RAW 264.7 cell line should not be used after the passage no. 30 otherwise it may influence the data reliability."
https://openalex.org/W2952218450,"Machine learning methods for protein function prediction are urgently needed, especially now that a substantial fraction of known sequences remains unannotated despite the extensive use of functional assignments based on sequence similarity. One major bottleneck supervised learning faces in protein function prediction is the structured, multi-label nature of the problem, because biological roles are represented by lists of terms from hierarchically organised controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology. In this work, we build on recent developments in the area of deep learning and investigate the usefulness of multi-task deep neural networks (MTDNN), which consist of upstream shared layers upon which are stacked in parallel as many independent modules (additional hidden layers with their own output units) as the number of output GO terms (the tasks). MTDNN learns individual tasks partially using shared representations and partially from task-specific characteristics. When no close homologues with experimentally validated functions can be identified, MTDNN gives more accurate predictions than baseline methods based on annotation frequencies in public databases or homology transfers. More importantly, the results show that MTDNN binary classification accuracy is higher than alternative machine learning-based methods that do not exploit commonalities and differences among prediction tasks. Interestingly, compared with a single-task predictor, the performance improvement is not linearly correlated with the number of tasks in MTDNN, but medium size models provide more improvement in our case. One of advantages of MTDNN is that given a set of features, there is no requirement for MTDNN to have a bootstrap feature selection procedure as what traditional machine learning algorithms do. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed MTDNN algorithm improves the performance of protein function prediction. On the other hand, there is still large room for deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction ability."
https://openalex.org/W2808168982,"Low temperature is one of the important limiting factors for growing season and geographical distribution of plants. Zoysiagrass (Zoysia Willd) is one of the widely used warm-season turfgrass that is distribute in many parts of the world. Zoysaigrass native to high latitude may have evolved higher cold tolerance than the ones native to low latitude. The objective of this study was to investigate the cold stress response in zoysiagrass native to diverse latitude at phenotypic, physiological and metabolic levels. Two zoysiagrass (Z. japonica) genotypes, Latitude-40 (higher latitude) and Latitude-22 (lower latitude) were subjected to four temperature treatments (optimum, 30/25°C, day/night; suboptimum, 18/12°C; chilling, 8/2°C; freezing, 2/-4°C) progressively in growth chambers. Low temperature (chilling and freezing) increased leaf electrolyte leakage (EL) and reduced plant growth, turf quality, chlorophyll (Chl) content, photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and photosynthesis (Pn, net photosynthetic rate; gs, stomatal conductance; intercellular CO2; Tr, transpiration rate) in two genotypes, with more rapid changes in Latitude-22. Leaf carbohydrates content (glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, fructan, starch) increased with the decreasing of temperature, to a great extend in Latitude-40. Leaf abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content increased, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA3) and trans-zeatin ribside (t-ZR) content decreased with the reduction of temperature, with higher content in Latitude-40 than in Latitude-22. Chilling and freezing induced the up-regulation of C-repeat binding factor (ZjCBF), late embryogenesis abundant (ZjLEA3) and dehydration-responsive element binding (ZjDREB1) transcription factors in two genotypes, whereas those genes exhibited higher expression levels in Latitude-40, particularly under freezing temperature. These results suggested that zoysiagrass native to higher latitude exhibited higher freezing tolerance may attribute to the higher carbohydrates serving as energy reserves and stress protectants that stabilize cellular membranes. The phytohormones may serve signals in regulating plant growth, development and adaptation to low temperature as well as inducing the up-regulated ZjCBF, ZjLEA3 and ZjDREB1 expressions thus result in a higher cold tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2807882583,"In South-East Asia, the maternal and child mortality rate has declined over the past decades; however, it varies among and within the countries in the region, including Cambodia. The continuum of care is an integrated series of care that women and children are required to avail continuously from pregnancy to the child/motherhood period. This study aimed to assess the completion rate of the continuum of care and examine the factors associated with the continuum of care in Ratanakiri, Cambodia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ratanakiri. Overall, 377 women were included, and data were collected via face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among them, 5.0% completed the continuum of care (antenatal care at least four times, delivery by skilled birth attendant, and postnatal care at least once). Meanwhile, 18.8% did not receive any care during pregnancy, delivery, and after birth. The highest discontinuation rate was at the postnatal care stage (73.6%). Not receiving any perinatal care was associated with neonatal complications at 6 weeks after birth (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.075; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.310–7.215). Furthermore, a long distance to the health center was negatively associated with completion of the continuum of care (AOR: 0.877; 95% CI: 0.791–0.972). This study indicates the need for efforts to reduce the number of women who discontinue from the continuum of care, as well as who do not receive any care to avoid neonatal complications. Since the discontinuation rate was highest at the postnatal care, postnatal care needs to be promoted more through the antenatal care and delivery services. Furthermore, given that long distance to health facilities was a barrier for receiving the care continuously, our findings suggest the need for a village-based health care system that can provide the basic continuum of care in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W2808133644,"Background A quarter of acute hospital beds are occupied by persons living with dementia, many of whom have communication problems. Healthcare professionals lack confidence in dementia communication skills, but there are no evidence-based communication skills training approaches appropriate for professionals working in this context. We aimed to develop and pilot a dementia communication skills training course that was acceptable and useful to healthcare professionals, hospital patients and their relatives. Methods The course was developed using conversation analytic findings from video recordings of healthcare professionals talking to patients living with dementia in the acute hospital, together with systematic review evidence of dementia communication skills training and taking account of expert and service-user opinion. The two-day course was based on experiential learning theory, and included simulation and video workshops, reflective diaries and didactic teaching. Actors were trained to portray patients living with dementia for the simulation exercises. Six courses were run between January and May 2017. 44/45 healthcare professionals attended both days of the course. Evaluation entailed: questionnaires on confidence in dementia communication; a dementia communication knowledge test; and participants’ satisfaction. Video-recorded, simulated assessments were used to measure changes in communication behaviour. Results Healthcare professionals increased their knowledge of dementia communication (mean improvement 1.5/10; 95% confidence interval 1.0–2.0; p<0.001). Confidence in dementia communication also increased (mean improvement 5.5/45; 95% confidence interval 4.1–6.9; p<0.001) and the course was well-received. One month later participants reported using the skills learned in clinical practice. Blind-ratings of simulated patient encounters demonstrated behaviour change in taught communication behaviours to close an encounter, consistent with the training, but not in requesting behaviours. Conclusion We have developed an innovative, evidence-based dementia communication skills training course which healthcare professionals found useful and after which they demonstrated improved dementia communication knowledge, confidence and behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2808484379,"Human brain function depends on directed interactions between multiple areas that evolve in the subsecond range. Time-varying multivariate autoregressive (tvMVAR) modeling has been proposed as a way to help quantify directed functional connectivity strengths with high temporal resolution. While several tvMVAR approaches are currently available, there is a lack of unbiased systematic comparative analyses of their performance and of their sensitivity to parameter choices. Here, we critically compare four recursive tvMVAR algorithms and assess their performance while systematically varying adaptation coefficients, model order, and signal sampling rate. We also compared two ways of exploiting repeated observations: single-trial modeling followed by averaging, and multi-trial modeling where one tvMVAR model is fitted across all trials. Results from numerical simulations and from benchmark EEG recordings showed that: i) across a broad range of model orders all algorithms correctly reproduced patterns of interactions; ii) signal downsampling degraded connectivity estimation accuracy for most algorithms, although in some cases downsampling was shown to reduce variability in the estimates by lowering the number of parameters in the model; iii) single-trial modeling followed by averaging showed optimal performance with larger adaptation coefficients than previously suggested, and showed slower adaptation speeds than multi-trial modeling. Overall, our findings identify strengths and weaknesses of existing tvMVAR approaches and provide practical recommendations for their application to modeling dynamic directed interactions from electrophysiological signals."
https://openalex.org/W2808461263,"Primary care faces challenging times in many countries, mainly caused by an ageing population. The GPs' role to match patients' demand with medical need becomes increasingly complex with the growing multiple conditions population. Shared decision-making (SDM) is recognized as ideal to the treatment decision making process. Understanding GPs' perception on SDM about patient referrals and whether patients' preferences are considered, becomes increasingly important for improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction. This study aims to 1) understand whether countries vary in how GPs perceive SDM, in patients' referral, 2) describe to what extent SDM in GPs' referrals differ between gatekeeping and non-gatekeeping systems, and 3) identify what factors GPs consider when referring to specialists and describing how this differs between gatekeeping and non-gatekeeping systems. Data were collected between October 2011 and December 2013 in 32 countries through the QUALICOPC study (Quality and Costs of Primary Care in Europe). The first question was answered by assessing GPs' perception on who takes the referral decision. For the second question, a multilevel logistic model was applied. For the third question we analysed the GPs' responses on what patient logistics and need arguments they consider in the referral process. We found: 1) variation in GPs reported SDM- 90% to 35%, 2) a negative correlation between gatekeeper systems and SDM-however, some countries strongly deviate and 3) GPs in gatekeeper systems more often consider patient interests, whereas in non-gatekeeping countries the GP's value more own experience with specialists and benchmarking information. Our findings imply that GPs in gatekeeper systems seem to be less inclined to SDM than GPs in a non-gatekeeping system. The relation between gatekeeping/non-gatekeeping and SDM is not straightforward. A more contextualized approach is needed to understand the relation between gatekeeping as a system design feature and its relation with and/or impact on SDM."
https://openalex.org/W2807714100,"Corn has been a pillar of American agriculture for decades and continues to receive much attention from the scientific community for its potential to meet the food, feed and fuel needs of a growing human population in a changing climate. By midcentury, global temperature increase is expected to exceed 2°C where local effects on heat, cold and precipitation extremes will vary. The Northeast United States is a major dairy producer, corn consumer, and is cited as the fastest warming region in the contiguous U.S. It is important to understand how key agronomic climate variables affect corn growth and development so that adaptation strategies can be tailored to local climate changes. We analyzed potential local effects of climate change on corn growth and development at three major dairy locations in the Northeast (Syracuse, New York; State College, Pennsylvania and Landisville, Pennsylvania) using downscaled projected climate data (2000–2100) from nine Global Climate Models under two emission pathways (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5). Our analysis indicates that corn near the end of the 21st century will experience fewer spring and fall freezes, faster rate of growing degree day accumulation with a reduction in time required to reach maturity, greater frequencies of daily high temperature ≥35°C during key growth stages such as silking-anthesis and greater water deficit during reproductive (R1-R6) stages. These agronomic anomalies differ between the three locations, illustrating varying impacts of climate change in the more northern regions vs. the southern regions of the Northeast. Management strategies such as shifting the planting dates based on last spring freeze and irrigation during the greatest water deficit stages (R1-R6) will partially offset the projected increase in heat and drought stress. Future research should focus on understanding the effects of global warming at local levels and determining adaptation strategies that meet local needs."
https://openalex.org/W2808148738,"The oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense, is an important commercial aquaculture resource in China. In order to overwinter, M. nipponense displays decreased physiological activity and less consumption of energy. Sudden warming would trigger molting and cause an extensive death, resulting in huge economic losses. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the molting mechanism of oriental river prawns. Molt-inhibiting hormone gene (MIH) plays a major role in regulating molting in crustaceans. In this study, a full length MIH cDNA of M. nipponense (Mn-MIH) was cloned from the eyestalk. The total length of the Mn-MIH was 925 bp, encoding a protein of 119 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Mn-MIH was highly expressed in the eyestalk, and that it had relatively low expression in gill, ovary, and abdominal ganglion. Mn-MIH was detected in all developmental stages, and changed regularly in line with the molting cycle of the embryo and larva. Mn-MIH varied in response to the molting cycle, suggesting that Mn-MIH negatively regulates ecdysteroidogenesis. Mn-MIH inhibition by RNAi resulted in a significant acceleration of molting cycles in both males and females, confirming the inhibitory role of MIH in molting. After long-term RNAi males, but not females had significant weight gain, confirming that Mn-MIH plays an important role in growth of M. nipponense. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the role of Mn-MIH in crustacean molting and growth."

Patients were randomly divided into two groups. The amoxicillin group received metronidazole 500mg, bismuth subcitrate 240mg, and amoxicillin 1000mg, all three times a day, plus omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, for 14 days. The tetracycline group received metronidazole 500mg three times a day; bismuth subcitrate240mg and tetracycline HCl 500mg, both four times a day; and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, for 14 days. Evaluation for compliance and drug-relatedadverse effects were evaluated at the end of two weeks. Eight weeks after the end of treatment, the rate of H.pylori eradication was assessed by the C13urease breath test.There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Eradication rate was higher with the amoxicillin-containing regimen than the tetracycline-containing regimen: 105/110 (95.51%; 95% confidence interval, 91.5%-99.3%) vs. 88/105 (83.8%; 95%CI, 76.7%-90.8%) by per-protocol analysis (p = 0.005) and 92.9% (95%CI, 88.1%-97.6%) vs. 76.5% (95%CI, 68.7%-84.2%) by intention-to-treat analysis (ITT, p = 0.001). Adverse effects were significant higher in the tetracycline groupthan in the amoxicillin group (65.2% vs. 43.4%; p = 0.001).Bismuth-based quadruple therapy including high-dose amoxicillin and metronidazole achieved an acceptable rate of H.pylori infection eradication with good tolerance in patients with duodenal ulcer. This regimen can overcome treatment resistance in areas with high prevalence of metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance.The Thai Clinical Trial Registry (TCTR) 20170623004."
https://openalex.org/W2807826064,"We investigated the validity of curriculum-sampling tests for admission to higher education in two studies. Curriculum-sampling tests mimic representative parts of an academic program to predict future academic achievement. In the first study, we investigated the predictive validity of a curriculum-sampling test for first year academic achievement across three cohorts of undergraduate psychology applicants and for academic achievement after three years in one cohort. We also studied the relationship between the test scores and enrollment decisions. In the second study, we examined the cognitive and noncognitive construct saturation of curriculum-sampling tests in a sample of psychology students. The curriculum-sampling tests showed high predictive validity for first year and third year academic achievement, mostly comparable to the predictive validity of high school GPA. In addition, curriculum-sampling test scores showed incremental validity over high school GPA. Applicants who scored low on the curriculum-sampling tests decided not to enroll in the program more often, indicating that curriculum-sampling admission tests may also promote self-selection. Contrary to expectations, the curriculum-sampling tests scores did not show any relationships with cognitive ability, but there were some indications for noncognitive saturation, mostly for perceived test competence. So, curriculum-sampling tests can serve as efficient admission tests that yield high predictive validity. Furthermore, when self-selection or student-program fit are major objectives of admission procedures, curriculum-sampling test may be preferred over or may be used in addition to high school GPA."
https://openalex.org/W2808167925,"Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a polyphagous insect that is an important biological agent used to control agricultural and forestry pests. The role of functional genes in H. axyridis based on quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is increasingly well understood to investigate biology, physiology, feeding behavior and the role of important genes in physiological processes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a powerful and reliable technique to quantify gene expression. Using qRT-PCR, expression levels of target genes are determined based on the levels of internal reference genes; therefore, reference genes need to be stably expressed under specific experimental conditions. However, there have been no studies on the stability of reference genes used in H. axyridis. In this study, we systematically investigated expression profiles of nine candidate reference genes from H. axyridis, including β-actin (ACTIN); elongation factor 1 α (EF1A); ribosomal proteins L10, L18, L28, S13, and S15 (RPL10, RPL18, RPL28, RPS13 and RPS15); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Four analytical methods (geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, and the ΔCt method) were used to evaluate the suitability of these genes as internal reference genes for three biotic factors (developmental stage, tissue, and sex) and two abiotic treatments (temperature and photoperiod). RefFinder, a comprehensive evaluation platform integrating the four analytical methods, was used to rank the overall stability of these reference genes. Among the nine candidate genes, different reference genes were identified as having the most stable expression across biotic and abiotic factors. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins typically had the most stable expression, though EF1A was the most stable across developmental stages and photoperiods. To validate the suitability of these reference genes, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) was chosen as a target. Significant up-regulation in HSP90 expression level in response to both low and high temperature was observed when using the most suitable reference genes but not when using an arbitrarily selected reference gene. The reference genes identified in this study will provide the basis for future functional genomics research in H. axyridis and will also facilitate the establishment of a standardized qRT-PCR program for other related insects."

In peanut, this practice is being increasingly adopted. In this study we present results of introgression of wild alleles from the wild species Arachis duranensis and A. batizocoi improving photosynthetic traits and yield in a set of lines derived from the cross of an induced allotetraploid and cultivated peanut with selection under water stress. The assays were carried out in greenhouse and field focusing on physiological and agronomic traits. A multivariate model (UPGMA) was adopted in order to classify drought tolerant lines. Several lines showed improved levels of tolerance, with values similar to or greater than the tolerant control. Two BC1F6 lines (53 P4 and 96 P9) were highlighted for good drought-related traits, earliness and pod yield, having better phenotypic profile to the drought tolerant elite commercial cultivar BR1. These lines are good candidates for the creation of peanut cultivars suitable for production in semiarid environments."
https://openalex.org/W2808613716,"Zoonotic tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health disease, but has long been neglected. Information on knowledge and practices of its prevention and influencing factors amongst occupationally exposed individuals is required for designing all-inclusive, informed control programmes. We investigated knowledge and practices related to zoonotic TB prevention and associated determinants amongst herdsmen and abattoir workers in south-western, south-eastern and north-western Nigeria using semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed with STATA 12. A total of 510 respondents (196 herdsmen; 314 abattoir workers) participated in the survey, of which 58.6% and 46.9% respectively were knowledgeable and demonstrated good practices about zoonotic TB prevention. Almost 60% knew that zoonotic TB transmission was preventable and 49.8% knew transmission could be through consumption of infected animal products. However, only 16.7% knew the disease could be transmitted by aerosol. Just 49.4% sought medical check-up when ill, 37.8% used protective clothing and only 29.2% usually condemned TB infected cattle. Respondents with post-primary education were about three times more likely to be knowledgeable (OR = 2.70, 95%CI: 1.68–4.33) and two times more likely to demonstrate good practice (OR = 2.23, 95%CI: 1.45–3.42) than those without formal education. Similarly, abattoir workers were about 6.4 times more likely to be knowledgeable (OR: 6.39, 95%CI: 4.31–9.47) and two times more likely to demonstrate good practice (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.40–2.92) than the herdsmen. There were important knowledge gaps with poor practices about zoonotic TB prevention amongst livestock workers in Nigeria. Strong predictors of knowledge and practice were being an abattoir worker and having post-primary education. Well-designed grassroots enlightenment programmes addressing modes of transmission, handling infected cattle and seeking medical check-up are urgently needed among high risk settings considering the recently launched Road Map for Zoonotic Tuberculosis which resonates that every tuberculosis case counts towards 2030 End-TB Strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2808370596,"Background The viral load (VL) in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the best predictor of treatment outcome. The anticipated benefits of VL monitoring depend on the actual uptake of VL test results for clinical decisions. The objective of this study was to assess the uptake and utilization of VL test results for clinical decisions on HIV treatment in Cameroon, from 2013 to 2017. Methods This was a retrospective cohort analysis of data from files of patients receiving ART at Buea, Limbe, Bamenda and Bafoussam regional hospital HIV treatment centers. A simple random pick of six file blocks was performed in each shelf that corresponded to a year of initiation, and the contents of all selected files were reviewed and the information needed for the study entered a structured questionnaire. The data collected was recorded in Epi Info (version 7.1.5.2), and analyzed using SATA (version 12.1; StataCorp LP). Results Eight hundred and thirty files were reviewed. The mean duration on ART was 39.4±12 months. Viral load testing uptake was 24.33% and only one VL test had been done by all patients. Approximately 65% of the patients did the first VL after more than 24 months on ART. The median turnaround (TAT) time for VL testing was 6 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 3-7days). Among 201 patients who did a VL test, 94.55% had VL suppression (≤1000copies/mm3). Approximately 54% of the patients with virologic failure were switched to a second-line regimen. Conclusions The uptake of viral load testing is low in North West, South West and West Regions of Cameroon. The current TAT for VL testing is plausible. The rate of switch to second line regimen is low. It is time to strengthen the scale up of VL testing and improve the rate of switch to second-line regimen in Cameroon."
https://openalex.org/W2808452625,"Diastolic dysfunction is increasingly prevalent in our ageing society and an important contributor to heart failure. The giant protein titin could serve as a therapeutic target, as its elastic properties are a main determinant of cardiac filling in diastole. This study aimed to develop a high throughput pharmacological screen to identify small molecules that affect titin isoform expression through differential inclusion of exons encoding the elastic PEVK domains. We used a dual luciferase splice reporter assay that builds on the titin splice factor RBM20 to screen ~34,000 small molecules and identified several compounds that inhibit the exclusion of PEVK exons. These compounds belong to the class of cardenolides and affect RBM20 dependent titin exon exclusion but did not affect RBFOX1 mediated splicing of FMNL3. We provide evidence that cardenolides do not bind to the RNA interacting domain of RBM20, but reduce RBM20 protein levels and alter transcription of select splicing factors that interact with RBM20. Cardenolides affect titin isoform expression. Understanding their mode of action and harnessing the splice effects through chemical modifications that suppress the effects on ion homeostasis and more selectively affect cardiac splicing has the potential to improve cardiac filling and thus help patients with diastolic heart failure, for which currently no targeted therapy exists."

Government legislation lists the conservation of the dingo as an important aim, yet little is known about the biogeography of this enigmatic canine, making conservation difficult. Mitochondrial and Y chromosome DNA studies show evidence of population structure within the dingo. Here, we present the data from Illumina HD canine chip genotyping for 23 dingoes from five regional populations, and five New Guinea Singing Dogs to further explore patterns of biogeography using genome-wide data. Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data supported the presence of three distinct dingo populations (or ESUs) subject to geographical subdivision: southeastern (SE), Fraser Island (FI) and northwestern (NW). These ESUs should be managed discretely. The FI dingoes are a known reservoir of pure, genetically distinct dingoes. Elevated inbreeding coefficients identified here suggest this population may be genetically compromised and in need of rescue; current lethal management strategies that do not consider genetic information should be suspended until further data can be gathered. D statistics identify evidence of historical admixture or ancestry sharing between southeastern dingoes and South East Asian village dogs. Conservation efforts on mainland Australia should focus on the SE dingo population that is under pressure from domestic dog hybridization and high levels of lethal control. Further data concerning the genetic health, demographics and prevalence of hybridization in the SE and FI dingo populations is urgently needed to develop evidence based conservation and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2808332184,"Product reviews are the individual’s opinions, judgement or belief about a certain product or service provided by certain companies. Such reviews serve as guides for these companies to plan and monitor their business ventures in terms of increasing productivity or enhancing their product/service qualities. Product reviews can also increase business profits by convincing future customers about the products which they have interest in. In the mobile application marketplace such as Google Playstore, reviews and star ratings are used as indicators of the application quality. However, among all these reviews, hereby also known as opinions, spams also exist, to disrupt the online business balance. Previous studies used the time series and neural network approach (which require a lot of computational power) to detect these opinion spams. However, the detection performance can be restricted in terms of accuracy because the approach focusses on basic, discrete and document level features only thereby, projecting little statistical relationships. Aiming to improve the detection of opinion spams in mobile application marketplace, this study proposes using statistical based features that are modelled through the supervised boosting approach such as the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and the Generalized Boosted Regression Model (GBM) to evaluate two multilingual datasets (i.e. English and Malay language). From the evaluation done, it was found that the XGBoost is most suitable for detecting opinion spams in the English dataset while the GBM Gaussian is most suitable for the Malay dataset. The comparative analysis also indicates that the implementation of the proposed statistical based features had achieved a detection accuracy rate of 87.43 per cent on the English dataset and 86.13 per cent on the Malay dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2807925092,"Water-to-air carbon dioxide fluxes from tropical lakes and reservoirs (artificial lakes) may be an important but understudied component of global carbon fluxes. Here, we investigate the seasonal dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics in a lake and a reservoir on a tropical volcanic island (Bali, Indonesia). Observations were performed over four seasonal surveys in Bali's largest natural lake (Lake Batur) and largest reservoir (Palasari Reservoir). Average CO2 partial pressures in the natural lake and reservoir were 263.7±12.2 μatm and 785.0±283.6 μatm respectively, with the highest area-weighted partial pressures in the wet season for both systems. The strong correlations between seasonal mean values of dissolved oxygen (DO) and pCO2 in the natural lake (r2 = 0.92) suggest that surface water metabolism was an important driver of CO2 dynamics in this deep system. Radon (222Rn, a natural groundwater discharge tracer) explained up to 77% of the variability in pCO2 in the shallow reservoir, suggesting that groundwater seepage was the major CO2 driver in the reservoir. Overall, the natural lake was a sink of atmospheric CO2 (average fluxes of -2.8 mmol m-2 d-1) while the reservoir was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (average fluxes of 7.3 mmol m-2 d-1). Reservoirs are replacing river valleys and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly throughout developing tropical regions. While the net effect of this conversion on atmospheric CO2 fluxes remains to be resolved, we speculate that reservoir construction will partially offset the CO2 sink provided by deep, volcanic, natural lakes and terrestrial environments."

However, whether preexisting DM is a risk factor for acute epiglottitis remains unclear. In this study, our aim was to explore the relationship between preexisting DM and acute epiglottitis in different age and sex groups by using population-based data in Taiwan. Methods We analyzed data between January 2000 and December 2013 obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The case group consisted of 2,393 patients with acute epiglottitis. The control group comprised 9,572 individuals without epiglottitis, frequency matched by sex, age, urbanization level, and income. Underlying DM was retrospectively assessed in the cases and controls. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between underlying DM and acute epiglottitis. Results Of the 2,393 patients, 180 (7.5%) had preexisting DM, whereas only 530 (5.5%) of the 9,572 controls had preexisting DM. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that preexisting DM was significantly associated with acute epiglottitis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15–1.75, P = 0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that the association between DM and epiglottitis remained significant for men (aOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.19–2.08, p = 0.002) but not for women. Age-stratified analysis revealed a significant association between DM and acute epiglottitis in patients aged 35–64 years. Use of anti-diabetic agents was not significantly associated with the development of acute epiglottitis among diabetic patients, including oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) alone (aOR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.53–1.46, p = 0.616), and OHA combined with insulin/ insulin alone (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.76–2.22, p = 0.339). The association between presence of diabetes complications and the occurrence of acute epiglottitis was also not significant among diabetic patients in this study setting (aOR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.59–1.26, p = 0.439). Conclusions The results of our large-scale population-based case–control study indicate that preexisting DM is one of the possible factors associated with the development of acute epiglottitis. Physicians should pay attention to the symptoms and signs of acute epiglottitis in DM patients, particularly in men aged 35–64 years."
https://openalex.org/W2808199516,"Malaria, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is the most prevalent vector borne disease in Baringo County; a region which has varied house designs in arid and semi-arid areas. This study investigated the association between house structures and indoor-malaria vector abundance in Baringo County. The density of malaria vectors in houses with open eaves was higher than that for houses with closed eaves. Grass thatched roof houses had higher density of malaria vectors than corrugated iron sheet roofs. Similarly, mud walled houses had higher vector density than other wall types. Houses in the riverine zone were significantly associated with malaria vector abundance (p<0.000) possibly due to more varied house structures. In Kamnarok village within riverine zone, a house made of grass thatched roof and mud wall but raised on stilts with domestic animals (sheep/goats) kept at the lower level had lower mosquito density (5.8 per collection) than ordinary houses made of same materials but at ground level (30.5 mosquitoes per collection), suggestive of a change in behavior of mosquito feeding and resting. House modifications such as screening of eaves, improvement of construction material and building stilted houses can be incorporated in the integrated vector management (IVM) strategy to complement insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual spray to reduce indoor malaria vector density."
https://openalex.org/W2808493271,"Literature and art have long depicted God as a stern and elderly white man, but do people actually see Him this way? We use reverse correlation to understand how a representative sample of American Christians visualize the face of God, which we argue is indicative of how believers think about God’s mind. In contrast to historical depictions, Americans generally see God as young, Caucasian, and loving, but perceptions vary by believers’ political ideology and physical appearance. Liberals see God as relatively more feminine, more African American, and more loving than conservatives, who see God as older, more intelligent, and more powerful. All participants see God as similar to themselves on attractiveness, age, and, to a lesser extent, race. These differences are consistent with past research showing that people’s views of God are shaped by their group-based motivations and cognitive biases. Our results also speak to the broad scope of religious differences: even people of the same nationality and the same faith appear to think differently about God’s appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2807888860,"Introduction Sarcoma is a rare type of cancer. The incidence increases with age and elderly patients may have comorbidity that affects the prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe the type and prevalence of comorbidity in a nationwide population-based study in Denmark from 2000–2013 and to analyse the impact of the different comorbidities on mortality. Material and methods The Danish Sarcoma Registry is a national clinical database containing all patients with sarcoma in the extremities or trunk wall from 2000 and onwards. By linking data to other registries, we were able to get patient information on an individual level including date and cause of death as well as the comorbidity type up to 10 years prior to the sarcoma diagnosis. Based on diseases in the Charlson Comorbidity Index, we pooled the patients into six categories: no comorbidity, cardiopulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and miscellaneous (diabetes, renal and connective tissue diseases). 2167 patients were included. Results The prevalence of comorbidity was 20%. For patients with localized disease, comorbidity increased the disease-specific mortality significantly (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.36–2.13)). For patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, comorbidity did not affect the disease-specific mortality (HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.78–1.42)). The presence of another cancer diagnosis within 10 years prior to the sarcoma diagnosis was the only significant independent prognostic factor of disease-specific mortality with an increase of 66% in mortality rate compared to patients with no comorbidity (HR 1,66 (95% CI 1.22–2.25)). Conclusion Comorbidity is a strong independent prognostic factor of mortality in patients with localized disease. This study emphasizes the need for optimizing the general health of comorbid patients in order to achieve a survival benefit from treatment of patients with localized disease, as this is potentially modifiable."
https://openalex.org/W2808417509,"Background Pediculosis caused by head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) infestation is still an important health problem in schoolchildren, especially girls, worldwide, including in Thailand. Although pediculicidal agents effectively kill head lice, the re-infestation rate is still high. Thus, prevention is an important strategy for any sustainable control program. We aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a health education program for increasing knowledge, changing attitudes and promoting preventive practices to reduce prevalence of pediculosis among school girls in Amphoe Muang, Khon Kaen, northeastern Thailand. Methodology Six schools were selected using multistage simple randomization and were allocated into intervention or control groups. A total of 267 girls was enrolled from these schools. A “knowledge, attitude and practice” (KAP) questionnaire, consent forms and health education materials were constructed and tested by experts and in one pilot school before the main investigation. Baseline prevalence of adult lice and nits was determined. The health education package was given only to the intervention group. The KAP questionnaire was re-evaluated at two months after intervention. Results At baseline, the prevalence and intensity of head lice infestation, and the KAP scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. After re-evaluation at two months, the KAP score was significantly greater in the intervention group. A significant decrease of the infestation rate from 59% to 44% was observed in the intervention group, whereas infestation increased in the control group (from 56% to 65%). The incidence of new cases in the intervention group (6.14%) was lower than in the control group (12.62%). Conclusion These findings indicated that the newly-established health education package is an effective tool for increasing KAP and reducing head lice infestation in school girls. Efforts to combat pediculosis in schoolchildren elsewhere may consider including this, or a similar, health education package in their programs."
https://openalex.org/W2808094129,"Root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp., RKN) causes a disease that significantly reduces the yield of greenhouse cucumber crops year after year. Chemical control based on a single pesticide is now unreliable mainly due to pest resistance. Fumigant and non-fumigant pesticide combinations can potentially result in effective and economic RKN control.Combining the insecticide abamectin (ABM) with fumigants dazomet (DZ) or chloropicrin (CP) significantly extended the half-life of ABM by an average of about 1.68 and 1.56 times respectively in laboratory trials, and by an average of about 2.02 and 1.69 times respectively in greenhouse trials. Laboratory experiments indicated that all the low rate ABM combination treatments controlled RKN through a synergistic effect. ABM diffused into the nematode epidermis more rapidly when ABM was combined with DZ and CP, giving effective nematode control and an increase cucumber total yield, compared to the use of these products alone. ABM combined with CP or DZ produced significantly higher total cucumber yield than when these products were used alone.A low concentration of ABM combined with DZ in preference to CP would be an economic and practical way to control nematode and soilborne fungi in a greenhouse producing cucumbers."
https://openalex.org/W2808187924,"Background To study structural changes in naïve and surgically treated corneas of aniridia patients with advanced aniridia-related keratopathy (ARK). Methods and findings Two naïve corneal buttons from patients with advanced ARK submitted to penetrating keratoplasty for the first time, one corneal button from an ARK patient that had undergone a keratolimbal allograft (KLAL), two corneal buttons from ARK patients who had previously undergone centered or decentered transplantation and were now retransplanted and two adult healthy donor control corneas were processed for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies against extracellular matrix components in the stroma and in the epithelial basement membrane (collagen I and IV, collagen receptor α11 integrin and laminin α3 chain), markers of fibrosis, wound healing and vascularization (fibronectin, tenascin-C, vimentin, α-SMA and caveolin-1), cell division (Ki-67) and macrophages (CD68) were used. Naïve ARK, KLAL ARK corneas and transplanted corneal buttons presented similar histopathological changes with irregular epithelium and disruption or absence of epithelial basal membrane. There was a loss of the orderly pattern of collagen lamellae and absence of collagen I in all ARK corneas. Vascularization was revealed by the presence of caveolin-1 and collagen IV in the pannus of all ARK aniridia corneas. The changes observed in decentered and centered transplants were analogous. Conclusions Given the similar pathological features of all cases, conditions inherent to the host seem to play an important role on the pathophysiology of the ARK in the long run."

In this context, this study aimed to determine the diversity of resistance mechanisms and investigate clonal dissemination and predominant sequence types (STs) in multidrug-resistant Ab strains of clinical (tracheal aspirate, n = 17) and environmental (surface, n = 6) origins. Additionally, the major clones found in clinical (A) and environmental (H) strains had their complete genomes sequenced. All strains were submitted to polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for the detection of the ISAba1/blaOXA-51-like and ISAba1/blaOXA-23-like genes, while the expression of genes encoding the carO porin, AdeABC (adeB), AdeFGH (adeG), and AdeIJK (adeJ) efflux pumps was determined by real time PCR (qPCR). Most of the strains were characterized as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) with high minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) detected for tigecycline and carbapenems. Associations between ISAba1/OXA-51 and ISAba1/OXA-23 were observed in 91.3% and 52.2% of the strains, respectively. Only the adeB gene was considered hyper-expressed. Furthermore, most of the strains analyzed by the MuLtilocus Sequence-Typing (MLST) were found to belong to the clonal complex 113 (CC113). In addition, a new ST, ST1399, belonging to CC229, was also discovered herein. Strains analyzed by whole genome sequencing presented resistance genes linked to multidrug-resistance phenotypes and confirmed the presence of Tn2008, which provides high levels carbapenem-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2808060318,"Whether iron formulations used therapeutically for a variety of conditions involving iron deficiency can deliver iron to the brain is a significant clinical question given the impact that iron loading has on the brain in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examine the ability of 5 pharmaceutical iron formulations that are given intravenously for treatment of iron deficiency to cross an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. The model uses human brain endothelial cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. We report that, compared to the natural iron delivery proteins, transferrin and H-ferritin, the pharmaceutical iron formulations neither cross the blood-brain barrier model nor significantly load the endothelial cells with iron. Furthermore, we report that mimicking brain iron sufficiency or deficiency by exposing the endothelial cells to apo- or holo-transferrin does not alter the amount of iron compound transported by or loaded into the cells. Coupled with previous studies, we propose that pharmaceutical iron formulations must first be processed in macrophages to make iron bioavailable. The results of this study have significant clinical and mechanistic implications for the use of therapeutic iron formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2808525151,"Integrated computational modeling provides a mechanistic and quantitative framework for describing lung mitochondrial bioenergetics. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a thermodynamically-constrained integrated computational model of the bioenergetics of isolated lung mitochondria. The model incorporates the major biochemical reactions and transport processes in lung mitochondria. A general framework was developed to model those biochemical reactions and transport processes. Intrinsic model parameters such as binding constants were estimated using previously published isolated enzymes and transporters kinetic data. Extrinsic model parameters such as maximal reaction and transport velocities were estimated by fitting the integrated bioenergetics model to published and new tricarboxylic acid cycle and respirometry data measured in isolated rat lung mitochondria. The integrated model was then validated by assessing its ability to predict experimental data not used for the estimation of the extrinsic model parameters. For example, the model was able to predict reasonably well the substrate and temperature dependency of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, kinetics of NADH redox status, and the kinetics of mitochondrial accumulation of the cationic dye rhodamine 123, driven by mitochondrial membrane potential, under different respiratory states. The latter required the coupling of the integrated bioenergetics model to a pharmacokinetic model for the mitochondrial uptake of rhodamine 123 from buffer. The integrated bioenergetics model provides a mechanistic and quantitative framework for 1) integrating experimental data from isolated lung mitochondria under diverse experimental conditions, and 2) assessing the impact of a change in one or more mitochondrial processes on overall lung mitochondrial bioenergetics. In addition, the model provides important insights into the bioenergetics and respiration of lung mitochondria and how they differ from those of mitochondria from other organs. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first for the bioenergetics of isolated lung mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2808071830,"Background Despite the national roll-out of free HIV medicines in Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries, many HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at risk of non-adherence due to poverty and other structural and health system related constraints. However, several patients exhibit resilience by attaining and sustaining high levels of adherence amid adversity. Social capital, defined as resources embedded within social networks, is key in facilitating resilience but the mechanism through which it operates remains understudied. This article provides insights into mechanisms through which social capital enables patients on ART in a resource-poor setting to overcome risk and sustain adherence to treatment. Methodology The article draws from an ethnographic study of 50 adult male and female HIV patients enrolled at two treatment sites in Uganda, 15 of whom were followed-up for an extended period of six months for narrative interviews and observation. The patients were selected purposively on the basis of socio-demographic and treatment related criteria. Findings Social capital protects patients on ART against the risk of non-adherence in three ways. 1) It facilitates access to scarce resources; 2) encourages HIV patients to continue on treatment; and 3) averts risk for non-adherence. Conclusions Social capital is a key resource that can be harnessed to promote resilience among HIV patients in a resource-limited setting amid individual, structural and health system related barriers to ART adherence. Invigoration and maintenance of collectivist norms may however be necessary if its protective benefits are to be fully realized."
https://openalex.org/W2808186351,"Culture shapes social cognition in many ways. Yet cultural impact on face tuning remains largely unclear. Here typically developing females and males from the French-speaking part of Switzerland were presented with a set of Arcimboldo-like Face-n-Food images composed of food ingredients and in different degree resembling a face. The outcome had been compared with previous findings obtained in young adults of the South-West Germany. In that study, males exhibit higher thresholds for face tuning on the Face-n-Food task than females. In Swiss participants, no gender differences exist in face tuning. Strikingly, males from the French-speaking part of Switzerland possess higher sensitivity to faces than their German peers, whereas no difference in face tuning occurs between females. The outcome indicates that even relatively subtle cultural differences as well as culture by gender interaction can modulate social cognition. Clarification of the nature of cultural impact on face tuning as well as social cognition at large is of substantial value for understanding a wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2808258661,"Tryptophan is reportedly the most potent agonist for GPR142. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic beta cells are enhanced by GPR142-mediated signal. It is not clear, however, if GPR142-mediated signals is solely attributable to GSIS enhancement after tryptophan load in various pathophysiological settings. This study aims to reveal the significance of GPR142 signaling in tryptophan-mediated GSIS enhancement in normal and obese mice. Tryptophan significantly improved glucose tolerance in both lean and DIO mice, but the extent of improvement was bigger in DIO mice with augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) enhancement. The same results were obtained in ob/ob mice. GPR142 deletion almost completely blocked tryptophan actions in lean mice, suggesting that GPR142 signaling was solely responsible for the GSIS enhancement. In obese GPR142KO mice, however, a significant amount of tryptophan effects were still observed. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) are also known to recognize tryptophan as ligand. Expression levels of CaSR were significantly elevated in the pancreas of DIO mice, and CaSR antagonist further blocked tryptophan's actions in DIO mice with GPR142 deletion. Although GPR142 signaling had a major role in tryptophan recognition for the enhancement of GSIS in lean mice, other pathways including CaSR signaling also had a significant role in obese mice, which seemed to contribute to the augmented enhancement of GSIS by tryptophan in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2808618956,"Citrus bark cracking viroid (CBCVd), previously called Citrus viroid IV, belongs to the genus Cocadviroid within the family Pospiviroidae. CBCVd has been identified as an important causative agent in citrus and hops. In this study, we obtained the full-length genomes of different variants of all detected citrus viroids from Pakistan through transcriptome sequencing. Different CBCVd variants were first found in Pakistan. These newly discovered Pakistani CBCVd variants were provisionally called ""CBCVd-LSS"" for their low sequence similarity (80.9%-88.9%) with the CBCVd RefSeq sequence (NC_003539). The two most predominant CBCVd sequences from Pakistan had the closest identity, 90.6% and 87.9%, with two CBCVd sequences isolated from hops. Identification and molecular characterization of CBCVd from citrus in Pakistan and China were also reported. The length of CBCVd from China ranged from 282 to 286 nucleotides, while that of the one from Pakistan ranged from 273 to 277 nucleotides. Based on genetic diversity and phylogenetic analysis, two main CBCVd clades were identified. CBCVd sequences from Pakistan, China, and other countries were further divided into six sub-clades. Sequence alignment revealed some nucleotide changes between these sub-clades, and analysis indicated that several mutations could significantly affect the primary and secondary structure of the viroid. Our results indicated that the CBCVd sequences from Pakistan and China were significantly different with respect to genome and secondary structure and Pakistan might be one of the independent geographical origins of CBCVd worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2808137768,"Background HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) frequently co-occur. We conducted HIV diagnostic testing in an assessment of the etiologies of major STI syndromes in Zimbabwe. Methods A total of 600 patients were enrolled at six geographically diverse, high-volume STI clinics in Zimbabwe in 2014–15: 200 men with urethral discharge, 200 women with vaginal discharge, and 100 men and 100 women each with genital ulcer disease (GUD). Patients completed a questionnaire, underwent a genital examination, and had specimens taken for etiologic testing. Patients were offered, but not required to accept, HIV testing using a standard HIV algorithm in which two rapid tests defined a positive result. Results A total of 489 participants (81.5%) accepted HIV testing; 201 (41.1%) tested HIV-1-positive, including 16 (11.9%) of 134 participants who reported an HIV-negative status at study enrollment, and 58 (28.2%) of 206 participants who reported their HIV status as unknown. Of 147 who self-reported being HIV-positive at study enrollment, 21 (14.3%) tested HIV negative. HIV infection prevalence was higher in women (47.3%) than in men (34.8%, p<0.01), and was 28.5% in men with urethral discharge, 40.5% in women with vaginal discharge, 45.2% in men with GUD, and 59.8% in women with GUD (p<0.001). Conclusions The high prevalence of HIV infection in STI clinic patients in Zimbabwe underscores the importance of providing HIV testing and referral for indicated prevention and treatment services for this population. The discrepancy between positive self-reported and negative study HIV test results highlights the need for operator training, strict attention to laboratory quality assurance, and clear communication with patients about their HIV infection status."
https://openalex.org/W2808560651,"Background WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) is a member of CCN protein family and a downstream target of β-catenin. Aberrant WISP1 expression is associated with carcinogenesis. In the current study, we focused on examining WISP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to elucidate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinicopathologic characteristics. Methodology/Principal findings The WISP1 SNPs rs2977530, rs2977537, rs2929973, rs2929970, rs62514004, and rs16893344 were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 332 patients with HCC and 664 cancer-free controls. Results The patients with higher frequencies of WISP1 rs62514004 (AG + GG) and rs16893344 (CT + TT) variants revealed a lower risk to reach a later clinical stage compared with their wild-type carriers. Furthermore, individuals who carried WISP1 rs62514004 and rs16893344 haplotype G-T showed a greater synergistic effect combined with alcohol drinking on HCC development (AOR = 26.590, 95% CI = 9.780–72.295). Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the HCC patients with WISP1 SNPs are associated with HCC development, and WISP1 SNPs may serve as markers or therapeutic targets for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2807854944,"When people make decisions about sequentially presented items in psychophysical experiments, their decisions are always biased by their preceding decisions and the preceding items, either by assimilation (shift towards the decision or item) or contrast (shift away from the decision or item). Such sequential biases also occur in naturalistic and real-world judgments such as facial attractiveness judgments. In this article, we aimed to cast light on the causes of these sequential biases. We first found significant assimilative and contrastive effects in a visual face attractiveness judgment task and an auditory ringtone agreeableness judgment task, indicating that sequential effects are not limited to the visual modality. We then found that the provision of trial-by-trial feedback of the preceding stimulus value eliminated the contrastive effect, but only weakened the assimilative effect. When participants orally reported their judgments rather than indicated them via a keyboard button press, we found a significant diminished assimilative effect, suggesting that motor response repetition strengthened the assimilation bias. Finally, we found that when visual and auditory stimuli were alternated, there was no longer a contrastive effect from the immediately previous trial, but there was an assimilative effect both from the previous trial (cross-modal) and the 2-back trial (same stimulus modality). These findings suggested that the contrastive effect results from perceptual processing, while the assimilative effect results from anchoring of the previous judgment and is strengthened by response repetition and numerical priming."
https://openalex.org/W2808191255,"Low numeracy may skew patient perceptions of information about cancer. This paper examines the relationship between self-reported measures of perceived numeracy and cancer knowledge, beliefs, and affect, using results from 3,052 respondents to the 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS-3). Chi-squared tests were used to identify differences in responses between high- and low-numeracy groups using three measures of perceived numeracy. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the three perceived numeracy measures and cancer information overload, cancer fatalism, cancer prevention knowledge, and cancer worry. Respondents with low perceived numeracy as expressed by discomfort with medical statistics were more likely to report information overload, to display fatalistic attitudes towards cancer, to lack knowledge about cancer prevention, and to indicate that they worried about cancer more frequently. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, this measure of perceived numeracy remained significantly associated with information overload, fatalism, lower prevention knowledge, and worry. The other measures of perceived numeracy, which measured understanding and use of health statistics, were not associated with cancer perceptions. Our findings suggest that individuals with low perceived numeracy broadly differ from individuals with high perceived numeracy in their perceptions of cancer and cancer prevention. By improving our understanding of how perceived numeracy affects patient perceptions of cancer, health providers can improve educational strategies and targeted health messaging."
https://openalex.org/W2808007353,"Self-treatment is a widespread practice among patients with common symptoms and ailments; it is necessary to explore multiple aspects of it. Notably, there is little research into self-treatment among middle-aged and elderly people, who are more likely to fall ill. Our goals are to provide a comprehensive description of self-treatment and explore associated factors with insurance utilization and expenditures among the middle-aged and elderly populations in China.A survey was conducted in July 2016 in Shanxi, China. A stratified sampling scheme was applied to achieve representativeness. A total of 972 subjects were surveyed. Descriptive statistics, t- and Chi-squared tests, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression were utilized.In our study, 772 (79.4%) of the surveyed subjects self-treated during the previous twelve months. Among them, 253 (32.8%) used health insurance. Subjects' characteristics were associated with insurance utilization and expenditures for self-treatment. Total cost was positively associated with insurance utilization. The subjects with a junior high education (p-value < 0.001, aOR = 0.049) and senior high education (p-value = 0.020, aOR = 0.146) had a lower probability of using insurance. For both total costs and out-of-pocket costs, subjects who were 51 to 60 years old had lower costs. The subjects who were seriously sick and had a primary school education, as well as enterprise occupations, had higher costs. Self-treatment times were also positively associated with costs. Finally, it was found that subjects who didn't use insurance had lower total costs.The prevalence of self-treatment was high (79.4%). Some characteristics were associated with insurance utilization and expenditures in self-treatment. Our results may be helpful for policy interventions, which are needed to further improve the effectiveness of health insurance in China."

This study investigated the distribution of TEP and CSP, in the SML and underlying water, as well as their bio-physical controlling factors in Daya Bay, an area impacted by warm discharge from two Nuclear power plants (Npp's) and aquaculture during a research cruise in July 2014. The SML had higher proportions of cyanobacteria and of pico-size Chl a contrast to the underlayer water, particularly at the nearest outlet station characterized by higher temperature. Diatoms, dinoflagellates and chlorophyll a were depleted in the SML. Both CSP and TEP abundance and total area were enriched in the SML relative to the underlying water, with enrichment factors (EFs) of 1.5-3.4 for CSP numbers and 1.32-3.2 for TEP numbers. Although TEP and CSP showed highest concentration in the region where high productivity and high nutrient concertation were observed, EFs of gels and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved acidic polysaccharide (> 1 kDa), exhibited higher values near the outlet of the Npp's than in the adjacent waters. The positive relation between EF's of gels and temperature and the enrichment of cyanobacteria in the SML may be indicative of future conditions in a warmer ocean, suggesting potential effects on adjusting phytoplankton community, biogenic element cycling and air-sea exchange processes."
https://openalex.org/W2807884883,"Introduction Leiomyoma affects up to 50% of fertile women, leading to morbidity such as bleeding or pain. The effect of symptomatic leiomyoma on the productivity of employed women is understudied. The present study investigates productivity loss in a Swedish setting in women with symptomatic leiomyoma compared to healthy women. Material and methods Women seeking care for leiomyoma and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) were recruited at nine Swedish sites. Healthy controls with self-perceived mild to normal menstruation were recruited at routine visits. Cases and controls were employed without option to work from home. After recruitment, all women reported the work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) and pain on the visual analog scale (VAS). Results Women with symptomatic leiomyoma (n = 88) missed more working time during menses compared to asymptomatic controls (n = 34): 7.6 vs 0.2% p = 0.003. The proportion of impairment while working was also significantly higher in women with symptomatic leiomyoma (43.8 vs 12.1% p<0.001). Moreover, cases reported greater activity impairment outside office hours (43.9 vs 12.1%, p<0.001). Among healthy controls, 69.5% reported symptoms of HMB (PBAC>100). Conclusions Symptomatic leiomyoma leads to loss of working hours as well as loss of productivity during working hours, and affects women in other daily activities. Increased awareness of the impact of leiomyomas on women's lives is needed, and timely and appropriate management of the symptomatic leiomyomas could improve work productivity and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2808201760,"Background Smoking rate based on self-reporting questionnaire might be underestimated. Cotinine is the principal metabolite of nicotine and is considered an accurate biomarker of exposure to cigarette smoke. Objectives This study evaluated the prevalence of and factors associated with urinary cotinine-verified smoking in Korean adults. Methods We analyzed data from 12,110 adults in the 2008–2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), using three threshold levels of urinary cotinine ≥100ng/ml, ≥50ng/ml, and ≥30ng/ml. Results The weighted prevalence of urinary cotinine levels of ≥100, ≥50, and ≥30 ng/mL in the whole study population was 34.7%, 37.1%, and 41.1%, respectively. Male sex, younger age, elementary school graduation, household income in the ≤24th percentile, service and sales workers and assembly workers, and high-risk alcohol drinking were associated with a higher prevalence of urinary cotinine level of ≥ 50 or 30 ng/mL, after we adjusted for age, sex, education level, number of family members, household income, occupation, and alcohol drinking. Logistic regression analyses were performed using the aforementioned variables as covariates to identify factors independently associated with cotinine-verified smoking. Men had a higher risk than women of having a urinary cotinine level of ≥50 ng/mL (OR 4.67, 95% CI 4.09–5.32, p < 0.001). When subjects ages 19–29 years were used as controls, adults ages 30–39 years had a 1.19-fold (CI 1.02–1.39, p = 0.026) higher risk of having a urinary cotinine level of ≥50 ng/mL. College graduates had a 32% lower risk of having a urinary cotinine level of ≥50 ng/mL than elementary school graduates (p < 0.001). A household income in the 25–49th percentile (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98, p = 0.026), 50–74th percentile (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53–0.76, p < 0.001), or ≥75th percentile (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53–0.77, p < 0.001) was associated with a lower risk of having a urinary cotinine level of ≥50 ng/mL compared to a household income in the ≤24th percentile. High-risk (OR 2.75, 95% CI 2.37–3.18, p < 0.001) and intermediate-risk (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.82–2.30, p < 0.001) alcohol drinking were associated with having a urinary cotinine level of ≥50 ng/mL compared to low-risk alcohol drinking. Similar to the results of the logistic regression analyses of urinary cotinine ≥50 ng/mL, male sex, younger age, elementary school education, household income in the ≤24th percentile, and high-risk alcohol drinking were significantly associated with having a urinary cotinine level of ≥30 ng/mL. Service and sales workers (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.48, p = 0.041) had a significantly higher risk of having a urinary cotinine level of ≥30 ng/mL. Conclusions Based on a threshold urinary cotinine level of 50 ng/mL, the prevalence of cotinine-verified smoking in a representative sample of Korean adults was 37.1% (men 52.7%, women 15.4%). Younger age, male sex, low education level, service and sales workers, low household income, and high-risk alcohol drinking were associated with the risk of smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2808273838,"Background To evaluate the clinical significance of supraclavicular lymph node (SCLN) in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) receiving curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed all 369 locally advanced ESCC patients treated with CCRT between 2000 and 2015, including 70 patients with SCLN metastasis and 299 patients without SCLN metastasis. Results For these locally advanced ESCC patients treated with curative CCRT, N0-2 were significantly associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in univariate and multivariable analyses. However, there were no significant differences in PFS and OS between the SCLN metastasis and non-SCLN metastasis groups; a subgroup analysis also revealed there was no significant differences in PFS and OS between patients with and without SCLN metastasis either in the N0-2 or in the N3 subgroup analysis. Conclusions Our study suggests that SCLN metastasis is not a prognostic factor in locally advanced ESCC patients receiving curative CCRT, and that SCLNs should be considered to be regional LNs and treated with curative intent."
https://openalex.org/W2808368201,"Macrophages exhibit diverse effector phenotypes depending on the stimuli and their microenvironment. Classically activated macrophages are primed with interferon (IFN)γ and stimulated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. They produce inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12. In the presence of immune complexes (ICs), activated macrophages have decreased IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production and presumably act as regulatory macrophages. Notch signaling has been shown to regulate the effector functions of classically activated macrophages. In this study, we investigated whether Notch signaling is active in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in the presence of ICs. LPS/IC stimulation increased the level of cleaved Notch1 in murine macrophages, while IC stimulation alone did not. Delta-like 4, but not Jagged1, was responsible for generating cleaved Notch1. The activation of Notch signaling by LPS/ICs depended upon NF-κB and MEK/Erk pathway activation. Macrophages with the targeted deletion of Rbpj, which encodes a DNA-binding protein central to canonical Notch signaling, produced significantly less IL-10 upon LPS/IC stimulation. A similar impact on IL-10 production was observed when Notch signaling was inhibited with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI). Defects in NF-κB p50 nuclear localization were observed in GSI-treated macrophages and in Rbpj-/- macrophages, suggesting cross-regulation between the Notch and NF-κB pathways. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Notch signaling regulates the transcription of genes involved in the cell cycle, macrophage activation, leukocyte migration and cytokine production in LPS/IC-stimulated macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the functions of macrophages activated by LPS and ICs."
https://openalex.org/W2808660861,"Background The plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Objective We have investigated associations between the content of ALA in adipose tissue and the risk of ischemic stroke and its subtypes. Methods Incident cases of ischemic stroke among participants enrolled into the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (n = 57,053) were identified by linkage with the Danish National Patient Register. Subsequently, all potential cases were validated and classified into ischemic stroke subtypes. The fatty acid composition of adipose tissue was determined by gas chromatography in cases and in a randomly drawn sub-cohort (n = 3500). Statistical analyses were performed using weighted Cox regression. Results During a median of 13.4 years of follow-up, 1735 cases of total ischemic stroke were identified including 297 cases of large artery atherosclerosis, 772 cases of small-vessel occlusion, 99 cases of cardio-embolism, 91 cases with stroke of other etiology and 476 cases with stroke of undetermined etiology. The median content of ALA in adipose tissue within the sub-cohort was 0.84% (95% central range: 0.53–1.19%). Multivariable analyses showed a U-shaped association between adipose tissue content of ALA and the rate of total ischemic stroke, but this association was not statistically significant (p = 0.172). In analyses of ischemic stroke subtypes, we observed a statistically significant U-shaped association between ALA and the rate of ischemic stroke due to large artery atherosclerosis (p = 0.017), whereas no appreciable association was observed between ALA and the rate of small-vessel occlusion (p = 0.427). A positive but statistically non-significant association was observed between ALA and the rate of ischemic stroke due to cardio-embolism (p = 0.162). Conclusions The content of ALA in adipose tissue was statistically non-significantly U-shaped associated with risk of total ischemic stroke. For ischemic stroke subtypes a statistically significant, U-shaped association with large artery atherosclerosis was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2807798868,"Background and aim Long standing vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets with growth impairment. We investigated whether sub-ischial leg length (SLL) is shorter, and cephalo-caudal length:length (CCL:L) ratio and sitting height:height (SH:H) ratio larger, with lower cord s-25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in the population-based prospective Odense Child Cohort, Denmark. Methods We included healthy singletons born to term with available measures of cord 25OHD and anthropometrics up to three years’ age. Linear regression was stratified by sex a priori and adjusted for maternal ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and smoking during pregnancy, season of blood sampling and child age. Results Median (IQR) cord 25OHD was 48.0 (34.0–62.4) nmol/L. At mean age 19.1 months, n = 504, mean (SD) SLL was 31.7 (1.7) cm; CCL:L-ratio 0.62 (0.01). At 36.3 months, n = 956, mean SLL was 42.9 (2.0) cm; SH:H-ratio 0.56 (0.01). No participants had rickets. In adjusted analyses, 19-months-old boys had 0.1 cm shorter SLL (p = 0.009) and 0.1% higher CCL:L-ratio (p = 0.04) with every 10 nmol/L increase in cord 25OHD. Similar findings were seen for late pregnancy 25OHD. In the highest cord 25OHD quartile (>60.7 nmol/L), SLL was 0.8 cm shorter (95% C.I.: 1.36;-0.29, linear trend, p = 0.004), and CCL:L-ratio 0.8% higher (95% C.I. 8.0x10-05;0.01, linear trend, p = 0.01), compared to lowest quartile (<30.7 nmol/L). Similar associations with cord 25OHD were observed in 3-year-old boys. No consistent associations between 25OHD and anthropometrics were seen in girls at either age. Conclusion No leg shortening was found with decreasing cord s-25OHD in a healthy population of infants. A small, yet significant inverse association between cord 25OHD and SLL in boys 1½-3 years warrants further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2808479649,"DNA methylation is the most characterized epigenetic process exhibiting stochastic variation across different tissues and individuals. In non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) fetal specific methylated regions can potentially be used as biomarkers for the accurate detection of fetal aneuploidies. The aim of this study was the investigation of inter-individual methylation variability of previously reported fetal-specific markers and their implementation towards the development of a novel NIPT assay for the detection of trisomies 13, 18, and 21. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with in-solution targeted enrichment followed by NGS was performed in 29 CVS and 27 female plasma samples to assess inter-individual methylation variability of 331 fetal-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The same approach was implemented for the NIPT of trisomies 13, 18 and 21 using spiked-in (n = 6) and pregnancy samples (n = 44), including one trisomy 13, one trisomy 18 and four trisomy 21. Despite the variability of DMRs, CVS samples showed statistically significant hypermethylation (p<2e-16) compared to plasma samples. Importantly, our assay correctly classified all euploid and aneuploid cases without any false positive results (n = 44). This work provides the starting point for the development of a NIPT assay based on a robust set of fetal specific biomarkers for the detection of fetal aneuploidies. Furthermore, the assay’s targeted nature significantly reduces the analysis cost per sample while providing high read depth at regions of interest increasing significantly its accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2807986212,"As an important way to help express the preference relation between alternatives, distributed preference relation (DPR) can represent the preferred, non-preferred, indifferent, and uncertain degrees of one alternative over another simultaneously. DPR, however, is unavailable in some situations where a decision maker cannot provide the precise degrees of one alternative over another due to lack of knowledge, experience, and data. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose interval-valued DPR (IDPR) and present its properties of validity and normalization. Through constructing two optimization models, an IDPR matrix is transformed into a score matrix to facilitate the comparison between any two alternatives. The properties of the score matrix are analyzed. To guarantee the rationality of the comparisons between alternatives derived from the score matrix, the additive consistency of the score matrix is developed. In terms of these, IDPR is applied to model and solve multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problem. Particularly, the relationship between the parameters for the consistency of the score matrix associated with each decision maker and those for the consistency of the score matrix associated with the group of decision makers is analyzed. A manager selection problem is investigated to demonstrate the application of IDPRs to MCGDM problems."
https://openalex.org/W2807847464,"Previous research shows that endurance performance can be enhanced by placebo ergogenic aids. This study investigates the ergogenic placebo response, which we define as an increase in objective and physiological effort without an increase in subjective effort, in competitive cyclists. The primary objective of this study is to explore the role of supplement salience in the ergogenic placebo response, while the secondary aim is to assess whether believing to have taken an inactive placebo supplement attenuates the desired ergogenic effect.We employed a double-blind placebo-controlled study design and compared a high salience (pudding) to a low salience (capsules) ergogenic placebo supplement and to a no treatment control group. Thirty-four male athletes (30.0 ± 5.7 years) performed two self-regulated time trials on an isokinetic cycling ergometer, one without intervention serving as a baseline and one with intervention according to group assignment. At both time trials, power output (objective effort), blood lactate (physiological effort) and the rating of perceived exertion (subjective effort) were measured.Receiving a high salience supplement can increase physiological and objective effort without a proportional rise in subjective effort, suggesting a decoupling of perceived exertion and endurance performance. Low salience and control group both showed no such ergogenic placebo response. Athletes' belief concerning the true nature of the ergogenic aid (inactive placebo vs. ergogenic supplement) did not influence the ergogenic placebo response.High salience placebo ergogenic aids can elicit enhanced performance without the athlete noticing (exertion), and deception of athletes seems unnecessary as even believing to have received an inactive placebo supplement maintains the ergogenic placebo response."
https://openalex.org/W2808132653,"Barley chromosome 5H, carrying important QTLs for plant adaptation and tolerance to abiotic stresses, is extremely instable in the wheat genetic background and is eliminated in the early generations of wheat-barley crosses. A spontaneous wheat-barley 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation was previously obtained among the progenies of the Mv9kr1 x Igri hybrid. The present work reports on the transfer of the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation into a modern wheat cultivar, Mv Bodri, in order to use it in the wheat breeding program. The comparison of the hybridization bands of DNA repeats HvT01, pTa71, (GAA)n and the barley centromere-specific (AGGGAG)n in Igri barley and the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation, together with the visualization of the barley chromatin made it possible to determine the size of the introgressed barley segment, which was approximately 74% of the whole 5HS. Of the 29 newly developed PCR markers, whose source ESTs were selected from the Genome Zipper of barley chromosome 5H, 23 were mapped in the introgressed 1-0.26 FL 5HS bin, three were located in the missing C-0.26 FL region, while three markers were specific for 5HL. The translocation breakpoint was flanked by markers Hv7502 and Hv3949. A comparison of the parental wheat cultivars and the wheat-barley introgression lines indicated that the presence of the translocation improved tillering ability in the Mv9kr1 and Mv Bodri genetic background. The similar or better yield components under high- or low-input cultivation environments, respectively, indicated that the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation had little or no negative effect on yield components, making it a promising genotype to improve wheat genetic diversity. These results promise to accelerate functional genomic studies on barley chromosome 5H and to support pre-breeding and breeding research on wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2807845003,"Inversion of embryonic turning (inv) cystic mice develop multiple renal cysts and are a model for type II nephronophthisis (NPHP2). The defect of planar cell polarity (PCP) by oriented cell division was proposed as the underlying cellular phenotype, while abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis occur in some polycystic kidney disease models. However, how these cystogenic phenotypes are linked and what is most critical for cystogenesis remain largely unknown. In particular, in early cortical cytogenesis in the inv mutant cystic model, it remains uncertain whether the increased proliferation index results from changes in cell cycle length or cell fate determination. To address tubular cell kinetics, doubling time and total number of tubular cells, as well as amount of genomic DNA (gDNA), were measured in mutant and normal control kidneys. Despite a significantly higher bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-proliferation index in the mutant, total tubular cell number and doubling time were unaffected. Unexpectedly, the mutant had tubular cell loss, characterized by a temporal decrease in tubular cells incorporating 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) and significantly increased nuclear debris. Based on current data we established a new multi-population shift model in postnatal renal development, indicating that a few restricted tubular cell populations contribute to cortical tubular formation. As in the inv mutant phenotype, the model simulation revealed a large population of tubular cells with rapid cell cycling and tubular cell loss. The proposed cellular kinetics suggest not only the underlying mechanism of the inv mutant phenotype but also a possible renal homeostatic mechanism for tubule formation."
