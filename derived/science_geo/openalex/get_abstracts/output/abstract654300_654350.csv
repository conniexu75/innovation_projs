https://openalex.org/W3035090529,"The body plan of the mammalian embryo is shaped through the process of gastrulation, an early developmental event that transforms an isotropic group of cells into an ensemble of tissues that is ordered with reference to three orthogonal axes1. Although model organisms have provided much insight into this process, we know very little about gastrulation in humans, owing to the difficulty of obtaining embryos at such early stages of development and the ethical and technical restrictions that limit the feasibility of observing gastrulation ex vivo2. Here we show that human embryonic stem cells can be used to generate gastruloids—three-dimensional multicellular aggregates that differentiate to form derivatives of the three germ layers organized spatiotemporally, without additional extra-embryonic tissues. Human gastruloids undergo elongation along an anteroposterior axis, and we use spatial transcriptomics to show that they exhibit patterned gene expression. This includes a signature of somitogenesis that suggests that 72-h human gastruloids show some features of Carnegie-stage-9 embryos3. Our study represents an experimentally tractable model system to reveal and examine human-specific regulatory processes that occur during axial organization in early development. Human gastruloids—three-dimensional aggregates derived from human embryonic stem cells—show features of human embryos at around 19–21 days, and provide a model for the study of early human development."

https://openalex.org/W3035239080,"The advent of endothermy, which is achieved through the continuous homeostatic regulation of body temperature and metabolism1,2, is a defining feature of mammalian and avian evolution. However, when challenged by food deprivation or harsh environmental conditions, many mammalian species initiate adaptive energy-conserving survival strategies-including torpor and hibernation-during which their body temperature decreases far below its homeostatic set-point3-5. How homeothermic mammals initiate and regulate these hypothermic states remains largely unknown. Here we show that entry into mouse torpor, a fasting-induced state with a greatly decreased metabolic rate and a body temperature as low as 20 °C6, is regulated by neurons in the medial and lateral preoptic area of the hypothalamus. We show that restimulation of neurons that were activated during a previous bout of torpor is sufficient to initiate the key features of torpor, even in mice that are not calorically restricted. Among these neurons we identify a population of glutamatergic Adcyap1-positive cells, the activity of which accurately determines when mice naturally initiate and exit torpor, and the inhibition of which disrupts the natural process of torpor entry, maintenance and arousal. Taken together, our results reveal a specific neuronal population in the mouse hypothalamus that serves as a core regulator of torpor. This work forms a basis for the future exploration of mechanisms and circuitry that regulate extreme hypothermic and hypometabolic states, and enables genetic access to monitor, initiate, manipulate and study these ancient adaptations of homeotherm biology."

https://openalex.org/W3034410769,"The D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) is a therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease1 and antipsychotic drugs2. DRD2 is activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine and synthetic agonist drugs such as bromocriptine3, leading to stimulation of Gi and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structure of an agonist-bound activated DRD2-Gi complex reconstituted into a phospholipid membrane. The extracellular ligand-binding site of DRD2 is remodelled in response to agonist binding, with conformational changes in extracellular loop 2, transmembrane domain 5 (TM5), TM6 and TM7, propagating to opening of the intracellular Gi-binding site. The DRD2-Gi structure represents, to our knowledge, the first experimental model of a G-protein-coupled receptor-G-protein complex embedded in a phospholipid bilayer, which serves as a benchmark to validate the interactions seen in previous detergent-bound structures. The structure also reveals interactions that are unique to the membrane-embedded complex, including helix 8 burial in the inner leaflet, ordered lysine and arginine side chains in the membrane interfacial regions, and lipid anchoring of the G protein in the membrane. Our model of the activated DRD2 will help to inform the design of subtype-selective DRD2 ligands for multiple human central nervous system disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3028316604,"Following the fast spread of Covid-19 across Europe and North America in March 2020, many people started stockpiling commodities like toilet paper. Despite the high relevance for public authorities to adequately address stockpiling behavior, empirical studies on the psychological underpinnings of toilet paper stockpiling are still scarce. In this study, we investigated the relation between personality traits, perceived threat of Covid-19, and stockpiling of toilet paper in an online survey (N = 996) across 22 countries. Results suggest that people who felt more threatened by Covid-19 stockpiled more toilet paper. Further, a predisposition towards Emotionality predicted the perceived threat of Covid-19 and affected stockpiling behavior indirectly. Finally, Conscientiousness was related to toilet paper stockpiling, such that individuals higher in Conscientiousness tended to stockpile more toilet paper. These results emphasize the importance of clear communication by public authorities acknowledging anxiety and, at the same time, transmitting a sense of control."
https://openalex.org/W3035643422,"Mitochondria, chloroplasts and Gram-negative bacteria are encased in a double layer of membranes. The outer membrane contains proteins with a β-barrel structure1,2. β-Barrels are sheets of β-strands wrapped into a cylinder, in which the first strand is hydrogen-bonded to the final strand. Conserved multi-subunit molecular machines fold and insert these proteins into the outer membrane3-5. One subunit of the machines is itself a β-barrel protein that has a central role in folding other β-barrels. In Gram-negative bacteria, the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) consists of the β-barrel protein BamA, and four lipoproteins5-8. To understand how the BAM complex accelerates folding without using exogenous energy (for example, ATP)9, we trapped folding intermediates on this machine. Here we report the structure of the BAM complex of Escherichia coli folding BamA itself. The BamA catalyst forms an asymmetric hybrid β-barrel with the BamA substrate. The N-terminal edge of the BamA catalyst has an antiparallel hydrogen-bonded interface with the C-terminal edge of the BamA substrate, consistent with previous crosslinking studies10-12; the other edges of the BamA catalyst and substrate are close to each other, but curl inward and do not pair. Six hydrogen bonds in a membrane environment make the interface between the two proteins very stable. This stability allows folding, but creates a high kinetic barrier to substrate release after folding has finished. Features at each end of the substrate overcome this barrier and promote release by stepwise exchange of hydrogen bonds. This mechanism of substrate-assisted product release explains how the BAM complex can stably associate with the substrate during folding and then turn over rapidly when folding is complete."
https://openalex.org/W3034857078,"Many people use the internet to seek information that will help them understand their body and their health. Motivations for such behaviors are numerous. For example, users may wish to figure out a medical condition by searching for symptoms they experience. Similarly, they may seek more information on how to treat conditions they have been diagnosed with or seek resources on how to live a healthy life. With the ubiquitous availability of the internet, searching and finding relevant information is easier than ever before and a widespread phenomenon. To understand how people use the internet for health-related information, we use data from a sample of 1,959 internet users. A unique combination of data containing four months of users’ browsing histories and mobile application use on computers and mobile devices allows us to study which health websites they visited, what information they searched for and which health applications they used. Survey data inform us about users’ socio-demographic background, medical conditions and other health-related behaviors. Results show that women, young users, users with a university education and nonsmokers are most likely to use the internet and mobile applications for health-related purposes. On search engines, internet users most frequently search for pharmacies, symptoms of medical conditions and pain. Moreover, users seem most interested in information on how to live a healthy life, alternative medicine, mental health and women’s health. With this study, we extend the field’s understanding of who seeks and consumes health information online, what users look for as well as how individuals use mobile applications to monitor their health. Moreover, we contribute to methodological research by exploring new sources of data for understanding humans, their preferences and behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3034979705,"Eclipta alba L., also known as false daisy, is well known and commercially attractive plant with excellent hepatotoxic and antidiabetic activities. Light is considered a key modulator in plant morphogenesis and survival by regulating important physiological cascades. Current study was carried out to investigate growth and developmental aspects of E. alba under differential effect of multispectral lights. In vitro derived callus culture of E. alba was exposed to multispectral monochromatic lights under controlled aseptic conditions. Maximum dry weight was recorded in culture grown under red light (11.2 g/L) whereas negative effect was observed under exposure of yellow light on callus growth (4.87 g/L). Furthermore, red light significantly enhanced phenolics and flavonoids content (TPC: 57.8 mg/g, TFC: 11.1 mg/g) in callus cultures compared to rest of lights. HPLC analysis further confirmed highest accumulation of four major compounds i.e. coumarin (1.26 mg/g), eclalbatin (5.00 mg/g), wedelolactone (32.54 mg/g) and demethylwedelolactone (23.67 mg/g) and two minor compounds (β-amyrin: 0.38 mg/g, luteolin: 0.39 mg/g) in red light treated culture whereas stigmasterol was found optimum (0.22 mg/g) under blue light. In vitro based biological activities including antioxidant, antidiabetic and lipase inhibitory assays showed optimum values in cultures exposed to red light, suggesting crucial role of these phytochemicals in the enhancement of the therapeutic potential of E. alba. These results clearly revealed that the use of multispectral lights in in vitro cultures could be an effective strategy for enhanced production of phytochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W3035222942,"For decades, self-report measures based on questionnaires have been widely used in educational research to study implicit and complex constructs such as motivation, emotion, cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies. However, the existence of potential biases in such self-report instruments might cast doubts on the validity of the measured constructs. The emergence of trace data from digital learning environments has sparked a controversial debate on how we measure learning. On the one hand, trace data might be perceived as ""objective"" measures that are independent of any biases. On the other hand, there is mixed evidence of how trace data are compatible with existing learning constructs, which have traditionally been measured with self-reports. This study investigates the strengths and weaknesses of different types of data when designing predictive models of academic performance based on computer-generated trace data and survey data. We investigate two types of bias in self-report surveys: response styles (i.e., a tendency to use the rating scale in a certain systematic way that is unrelated to the content of the items) and overconfidence (i.e., the differences in predicted performance based on surveys' responses and a prior knowledge test). We found that the response style bias accounts for a modest to a substantial amount of variation in the outcomes of the several self-report instruments, as well as in the course performance data. It is only the trace data, notably that of process type, that stand out in being independent of these response style patterns. The effect of overconfidence bias is limited. Given that empirical models in education typically aim to explain the outcomes of learning processes or the relationships between antecedents of these learning outcomes, our analyses suggest that the bias present in surveys adds predictive power in the explanation of performance data and other questionnaire data."
https://openalex.org/W3035276707,"The phylum of annelids is one of the most disparate animal phyla and encompasses ambush predators, suspension feeders and terrestrial earthworms1. The early evolution of annelids remains obscure or controversial2,3, partly owing to discordance between molecular phylogenies and fossils2,4. Annelid fossils from the Cambrian period have morphologies that indicate epibenthic lifestyles, whereas phylogenomics recovers sessile, infaunal and tubicolous taxa as an early diverging grade5. Magelonidae and Oweniidae (Palaeoannelida1) are the sister group of all other annelids but contrast with Cambrian taxa in both lifestyle and gross morphology2,6. Here we describe a new fossil polychaete (bristle worm) from the early Cambrian Canglangpu formation7 that we name Dannychaeta tucolus, which is preserved within delicate, dwelling tubes that were originally organic. The head has a well-defined spade-shaped prostomium with elongated ventrolateral palps. The body has a wide, stout thorax and elongated abdomen with biramous parapodia with parapodial lamellae. This character combination is shared with extant Magelonidae, and phylogenetic analyses recover Dannychaeta within Palaeoannelida. To our knowledge, Dannychaeta is the oldest polychaete that unambiguously belongs to crown annelids, providing a constraint on the tempo of annelid evolution and revealing unrecognized ecological and morphological diversity in ancient annelids. Dannychaeta tucolus, a bristle worm from the early Cambrian period, belongs to crown annelids, and has characters that provide evidence of ecological and morphological diversity in ancient annelids, thus reconciling the fossil record with molecular phylogenetic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3035603470,"Disturbance of circadian rhythms underlies various metabolic diseases. Constant light exposure (LL) is known to disrupt both central and peripheral circadian rhythms. Here, we attempted to determine whether the effects of LL are different between various peripheral tissues and whether time-restricted feeding restores the circadian rhythms especially in white adipose tissue (WAT). Six-week-old mice were subjected to three feeding regimes: ad libitum feeding under light/dark phase (LD), ad libitum feeding under LL cycle, and restricted feeding at night-time under LL cycle with a normal chow. After 3 weeks, we compared body weight, food intake, plasma levels of lipids and glucose, and the expression patterns of the clock genes and the genes involved in lipid metabolism in the liver and WAT. The mice kept under LL with or without time-restricted feeding were 5.2% heavier (p<0.001, n = 16) than the mice kept under LD even though the food intakes of the two groups were the same. Food intake occurred mostly in the dark phase. LL disrupted this pattern, causing disruptions in circadian rhythms of plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and glucose. Time-restricted feeding partially restored the rhythms. LL eliminated the circadian rhythms of the expression of the clock genes as well as most of the genes involved in lipid metabolism in both liver and WAT. More notably, LL markedly decreased not only the amplitude but also the average levels of the expression of the genes in the liver, but not in the WAT, suggesting that transcription in the liver is sensitive to constant light exposure. Time-restricted feeding restored the circadian rhythms of most of the genes to various degrees in both liver and WAT. In conclusion, LL disrupted the peripheral circadian rhythms more severely in liver than in WAT. Time-restricted feeding restored the circadian rhythms in both tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3034965637,"Maternal continuums of care were vital to reducing maternal and neonatal mortalities. While the dropout rate remains high and limited studies were found on risk factors associated with a high dropout rate of the maternal continuum of care.This study aimed to assess the magnitude of dropout rate and its associated factors of maternity continuum of care in Ethiopia, 2016.An in-depth secondary data analysis was conducted from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data. A total of 4,693 women who were booked for antenatal care visit were included to the final analysis. A community-based cross-sectional study design and a pre-tested and standardized questionnaire were used to collect the survey data. Data were weighted using women data weighting variables. Chi-square and multicollinearity assumptions were checked for independent variables. Bi-variable and multivariable logistics regression used to identify associated factors with a cut of the p-value of 0.2 and 0.05 respectively. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95%CI was reported for the final model.Of the total 4,693 women who were booked for antenatal care visits, 2,092(44.58%), 2,183 (46.52%), and 4,086(87.07%) dropped from a recommended number of ANC, Institutional delivery and postnatal care visit respectively. Only 308 (6.56%, 95%CI: 5.89, 7.31) women used all the complete continuum of care. Not married, and poorest wealth index were significantly associated with dropout from ANC visit. Being a protestant religious follower was significantly associated with dropout from PNC after antenatal care booking. While not exposed to media, distance from health facility as a big problem, protestant affiliation, parity of 2 to 4 and above4, Wealth index of the poorest, poorer, middle, and richer significantly associated with dropout from institutional delivery. Not being informed about pregnancy complications during their ANC visit was significantly associated with dropout from ANC, PNC, and institutional delivery.Dropout of women from the maternity continuum of care after antenatal care booking was a public health problem in Ethiopia. Socio-demographic, pregnancy, and health service-related factors were significant determinants of dropout from the maternity continuum of care. Improving the family wealth index, increasing access to health facilities, media exposure, and giving more information during the antenatal care visit is important to reduce the dropout rate from the maternity continuum of care."
https://openalex.org/W3035379047,"Research for biotechnological applications of cyanobacteria focuses on synthetic pathways and bioreactor design, while little effort is devoted to introduce new, promising organisms in the field. Applications are most often based on recombinant work, and the establishment of transformation can be a risky, time-consuming procedure. In this work we demonstrate the natural transformation of the filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium lacuna and insertion of a selection marker into the genome by homologous recombination. This is the first example for natural transformation filamentous non-heterocystous cyanobacterium. We found that Phormidium lacuna is polyploid, each cell has about 20-90 chromosomes. Transformed filaments were resistant against up to 14 mg/ml of kanamycin. Formerly, natural transformation in cyanobacteria has been considered a rare and exclusive feature of a few unicellular species. Our finding suggests that natural competence is more distributed among cyanobacteria than previously thought. This is supported by bioinformatic analyses which show that all protein factors for natural transformation are present in the majority of the analyzed cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3034984422,"Pregnant women who experience psychosocial stressors, such as stressful life events, poor neighborhood quality, and financial hardship, are at an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Yet, few studies have examined associations between multiple stressors from different sources, which may be helpful to better inform causal pathways leading to adverse birth outcomes. Using path analysis, we examined associations between multiple self-reported stressor exposures during and before pregnancy in the Chemicals in Our Bodies-2 study (N = 510), a demographically diverse cohort of pregnant women in San Francisco. We examined associations between eight self-reported exposures to stressors and three responses to stress which were assessed via interview questionnaire at the 2nd trimester. Stressors included: neighborhood quality, stressful life events, caregiving, discrimination, financial strain, job strain, food insecurity, and unplanned pregnancy. Perceived stress, depression, and perceived community status were included as indicators of self-reported stress response. Our model indicated that women who experienced discrimination and food insecurity had a 3.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.60, 5.85) and 2.67 (95% CI = 1.31, 4.04) increase in depression scale scores compared to women who did not experience discrimination and food insecurity, respectively. We additionally identified job strain and caregiving for an ill family member as strong predictors of increased depressive symptoms (β = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.29, 3.07; β = 1.48, 95% CI = 0.19, 2.70, respectively). Discrimination, food insecurity, and job strain also influenced depression indirectly through the mediating pathway of increasing perceived stress, although indirect effects were less precise. In our study population, women who experienced discrimination, food insecurity, job strain and caregiving for an ill family member had an increased number of depressive symptoms compared to women who did not experience these stressors. Results from our study highlight the complex relationships between stressors and stress responses and may help to identify possible mediating pathways leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3035408585,"In this paper, we produced a new family of distribution called Gull Alpha Power Family of distributions (GAPF). A Special case of GAPF is derived by considering the Weibull distribution as a baseline distribution called Gull Alpha Power Weibull distribution (GAPW). The suitability of the proposed distribution derives from its ability to model both the monotonic and non-monotonic hazard rate functions which are a common practice in survival analysis and reliability engineering. Various statistical properties were derived in addition to their special cases. The unknown parameters of the model are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Moreover, the usefulness of the proposed distribution is supported by using two real lifetime data sets as well as simulated data."
https://openalex.org/W3034670553,"Cellular senescence can be triggered by various intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. We previously reported that silencing of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthetase 2 (PAPSS2) induces cellular senescence through augmented fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling. However, the exact molecular mechanism connecting heparan sulfation and cellular senescence remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in augmented FGFR1 signaling and cellular senescence. Depletion of several types of HSPGs revealed that cells depleted of syndecan 1 (SDC1) exhibited typical senescence phenotypes, and those depleted of PAPSS2-, SDC1-, or heparan sulfate 2-O sulfotransferase 1 (HS2ST1) showed decreased FGFR1 internalization along with hyperresponsiveness to and prolonged activation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-stimulated FGFR1- v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) signaling. Clathrin- and caveolin-mediated FGFR1 endocytosis contributed to cellular senescence through the FGFR1-AKT-p53-p21 signaling pathway. Dynasore treatment triggered senescence phenotypes, augmented FGFR1-AKT-p53-p21 signaling, and decreased SDC1 expression. Finally, the replicatively and prematurely senescent cells were characterized by decreases of SDC1 expression and FGFR1 internalization, and an increase in FGFR1-AKT-p53-p21 signaling. Together, our results demonstrate that properly sulfated SDC1 plays a critical role in preventing cellular senescence through the regulation of FGFR1 endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W3034779275,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of age and sex on the taste functions of healthy Taiwanese. Subjects were divided into groups based on their sex and age: 20-39 years, 40-59 years, or ≥ 60 years. We evaluated the taste functions of subjects using the whole mouth suprathreshold taste test and the taste quad test. For the whole-mouth test, subjects were instructed to sip and swish sweet, sour, salty, and bitter solutions, each at 5 different suprathreshold concentrations. Each subject was required to indicate the taste quality, and to rate the intensity and unpleasantness/pleasantness of each taste of the solutions. For the quad test, the 4 quadrants of the tongue surface were tested by applying a drop of one concentration of sweet, sour, salty, or bitter solutions 6 times. Subjects then indicated the taste quality and rated the intensity of the solution. We found that in the whole mouth test, the total correct identification score dropped with age, but the ability to identify sweet and salty qualities was not affected by age. No differences were found between males and females, except women scored better than men for sweetness in the 40-59 years age group. The intensity rating scores were higher in the 20-39 years age group, regardless of sex. With regard to the pleasantness of tastants, female subjects in the 20-39 years age group found sweet solution more pleasant than the older subjects did. In the quad test, the total correct identification score decreased with age, but there were no differences between males and females. Thus, our findings showed that both age and sex affected the taste functions of healthy Taiwanese to some extent, and differences were dependent on tongue region and taste quality."
https://openalex.org/W3035349303,"Studies of gender inequality in film industries have noted the persistence of male domination in creative roles (usually defined as director, producer, writer) and the slow pace of reform. Typical policy remedies are premised on aggregate counts of women as a proportion of overall industry participation. Network science offers an alternative way of identifying and proposing change mechanisms, as it puts emphasis on relationships instead of individuals. Preliminary work on applying network analysis to understand inequality in the film industry has been undertaken. However, in this study we offer a comprehensive approach that enables us to not only understand what inequality in the film industry looks like through the lens of network science but also how we can attempt to address this issue. We offer a data-driven simulation framework that investigates various what-if scenarios when it comes to network evolution. We then assess each of these scenarios with respect to its potential to address gender inequality in the film industry. As suggested by previous studies, inequality is exacerbated when industry networks are most closed. We review evidence from three different national film industries on network relationships in creative teams and identify a high proportion of men who only work with other men. In response to this observation, we test several mechanisms through which industry structures may generate higher levels of openness. Our results reveal that the most critical factor for improving network openness is not simply the statistical improvement of the number of women in a network, nor the removal of men who do not work with women. The most likely behavioural changes to a network will involve the production of connections between women and powerful men."
https://openalex.org/W3034505530,"Stock price movement prediction plays important roles in decision making for investors. It was usually regarded as a binary classification task. In this paper, a recurrent convolutional neural kernel (RCNK) model was proposed, which learned complementary features from different sources of data, namely, historical price data and text data in the message board, to predict the stock price movement. It integrated the advantage of technical analysis and sentiment analysis. Different from previous studies, the text data was treated as sequential data and utilized the RCNK model to train sentiment embeddings with the temporal features. Besides, in the classification section of the model, the explicit kernel mapping layer was used to replace several full-connected layers. This operation reduced the parameters of the model and the risk of overfitting. In order to test the impact of treating the sentiment data as sequential data, the effectiveness of explicit kernel mapping layer and the usefulness integrating the technical analysis and sentiment analysis, the proposed model was compared with the other two deep learning models (recurrent convolutional neural network model and convolutional neural kernel model) and the models with only one source of data as input. The result showed that the proposed model outperformed the other models."
https://openalex.org/W3034539883,"Zebrafish have the ability to regenerate damaged cells and tissues by activating quiescent stem and progenitor cells or reprogramming differentiated cells into regeneration-competent precursors. Proliferation among the cells that will functionally restore injured tissues is a fundamental biological process underlying regeneration. Midkine-a is a cytokine growth factor, whose expression is strongly induced by injury in a variety of tissues across a range of vertebrate classes. Using a zebrafish Midkine-a loss of function mutant, we evaluated regeneration of caudal fin, extraocular muscle and retinal neurons to investigate the function of Midkine-a during epimorphic regeneration. In wildtype zebrafish, injury among these tissues induces robust proliferation and rapid regeneration. In Midkine-a mutants, the initial proliferation in each of these tissues is significantly diminished or absent. Regeneration of the caudal fin and extraocular muscle is delayed; regeneration of the retina is nearly completely absent. These data demonstrate that Midkine-a is universally required in the signaling pathways that convert tissue injury into the initial burst of cell proliferation. Further, these data highlight differences in the molecular mechanisms that regulate epimorphic regeneration in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W3035044856,"Background Patients with epilepsy (PwE) have an increased risk of active and lifetime depression. Two in 10 patients experience depression. Lack of trained psychiatric staff in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) creates a need for screening tools that enable detection of depression in PwE. We describe the translation, validity and reliability assessment of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as a screening tool for depression among PwE in Rwanda. Method PHQ-9 was translated to Kinyarwanda using translation-back translation and validated by a discussion group. For validation, PwE of ≥15 years of age were administered the PHQ-9 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) by trained psychiatry staff at Visit 1. A random sample of 20% repeated PHQ-9 and HDRS after 14 days to assess temporal stability and intra-rater reliability. Internal structure, reliability and external validity were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis, reliability coefficients and HDRS-correlation, respectively. Maximal Youden’s index was considered for cut-offs. Results Four hundred and thirty-four PwE, mean age 30.5 years (SD ±13.3), were included of whom 33.6%, 37.9%, 13.4%, and 15.1% had no, mild, moderate and severe depression, respectively. PHQ-9 performed well on a one-factor model (unidimensional model), with factor loadings of 0.63–0.86. Reliability coefficients above 0.80 indicated strong internal consistency. Good temporal stability was observed (0.79 [95% CI: 0.68–0.87]). A strong correlation (R = 0.66, p = 0.01) between PHQ-9 and HDRS summed scores demonstrated robust external validity. The optimal cut-off for the PHQ-9 was similar (≥5) for mild and moderate depression and ≥7 for severe depression. Conclusion PHQ-9 validation in Kinyarwanda creates the capacity to screen PwE in Rwanda at scores of ≥5 for mild or moderate and ≥7 for severe depression. The availability of validated tools for screening and diagnosis for depression is a forward step for holistic care in a resource-limited environment."
https://openalex.org/W3035464025,"Axonal damage leads to the release of neurofilament light chain (NFL), which enters the CSF or blood. In this work, an assay kit for plasma NFL utilizing immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) was developed. Antibodies against NFL were immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles to develop an IMR NFL kit. The preclinical properties, such as the standard curve, limit of detection (LoD), and dynamic range, were characterized. Thirty-one normal controls (NC), fifty-two patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or PD dementia (PDD) and thirty-one patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were enrolled in the study evaluating the plasma NFL assay using an IMR kit. T-tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to investigate the capability for discrimination among the clinical groups according to plasma NFL levels. The LoD of the NFL assay using the IMR kit was found to be 0.18 fg/ml. The dynamic range of the NFL assay reached 1000 pg/ml. The NC group showed a plasma NFL level of 7.70 ± 4.00 pg/ml, which is significantly lower than that of the PD/PDD (15.85 ± 7.82 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and AD (19.24 ± 8.99 pg/ml, p < 0.001) groups. A significant difference in plasma NFL levels was determined between the PD and AD groups (p < 0.01). Through ROC curve analysis, the cut-off value of the plasma NFL concentration for differentiating NCs from dementia patients (AD and PD/PDD) was found to be 12.71 pg/ml, with a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 73.5% and 90.3%, respectively. The AUC was 0.868. Furthermore, the cut-off value of the plasma NFL concentration for discriminating AD from PD/PDD was found to be 18.02 pg/ml, with a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 61.3% and 65.4%, respectively. The AUC was 0.630. An ultrasensitive assay for measuring plasma NFL utilizing IMR technology was developed. Clear differences in plasma NFL concentrations were observed among NCs and PD and AD patients. These results imply that the determination of plasma NFL is promising not only for screening dementia but also for differential diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2995902651,"Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and wild bees provide critical ecological services that shape and sustain natural, agricultural, and urban landscapes. In recent years, declines in bee populations have highlighted the importance of the pollination services they provide and the need for more research into the reasons for global bee losses. Several stressors cause declining populations of managed and wild bee species such as habitat degradation, pesticide exposure, and pathogens. Viruses, which have been implicated as a key stressor, are able to infect a wide range of species and can be transmitted both intra- and inter-specifically from infected bee species to uninfected bee species via vertical (from parent to offspring) and/or horizontal (between individuals via direct or indirect contact) transmission. To explore how viruses spread both intra- and inter-specifically within a community, we examined the impact of management, landscape type, and bee species on the transmission of four common viruses in Nebraska: Deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Sacbrood virus (SBV). Results indicated the prevalence of viruses is significantly affected (P < 0.005) by bee species, virus type, and season, but not by landscape or year (P = 0.290 and 0.065 respectively). The higher prevalence of DWV detected across bee species (10.4% on Apis mellifera, 5.3% on Bombus impatiens, 6.1% on Bombus griseocollis, and 22.44% on Halictus ligatus) and seasons (10.8% in early-mid summer and 11.4% in late summer) may indicate a higher risk of interspecific transmission of DWV. However, IAPV was predominately detected in Halictus ligatus (20.7%) and in late season collections (28.1%), which may suggest species-specific susceptibility and seasonal trends in infection rates associated with different virus types. However, there were limited detections of SBV and BQCV in bees collected during both sampling periods, indicating SBV and BQCV may be less prevalent among bee communities in this area."
https://openalex.org/W3034866721,"Cuscuta (dodders) is a group of parasitic plants with tremendous economic and ecological significance. Their seeds are often described as “simple” or “unspecialized” because they do not exhibit any classical dispersal syndrome traits. Previous studies of seed morphology and/or anatomy were conducted on relatively few species. We expanded research to 101 species; reconstructed ancestral character states; investigated correlations among seed characters and explored allometric relationships with breeding systems, the size of geographical distribution of species in North America, as well as the survival of seedlings. Seed morphological and anatomical characters permit the separation of subgenera, but not of sections. Identification of Cuscuta species using seed characteristics is difficult but not impossible if their geographical origin is known. Seeds of subg. Monogynella species, exhibit the likely ancestral epidermis type consisting of elongated and interlocked cells, which are morphologically invariant, uninfluenced by dryness/wetness. Subgenera Cuscuta, Pachystigma and Grammica have evolved a seed epidermis with isodiametric cells that can alternate their morphology between two states: pitted when seeds are dry, and papillose after seed imbibition. A seed coat with double palisade architecture throughout the entire seed has also apparently evolved in subgenera Cuscuta, Pachystigma and Grammica, but several species in two clades of the latter subgenus reverted to a single palisade layer outside the hilum area. The same latter species also evolved a peculiar, globose embryo, likely having a storage role, in contrast to the ancestral filiform and coiled embryo present throughout the remainder of the genus. Autogamous species had on average the highest number of seeds per capsule, whereas fully xenogamous taxa had the lowest. No correlation was revealed between the size of the seeds and the size of their geographical distribution in North America, but seedlings of species with larger seeds survived significantly longer than seedlings resulted from smaller seeds. Diversity and evolution of seed traits was discussed in relationship with their putative roles in dormancy, germination and dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W3035169938,"Public pension insurance has become a major form of social protection around the world. However, little is known about the association between public pension expansion and individuals' fertility in developing economies. In this paper, we examine the effects of the New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) on the fertility of married women in rural China. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), the difference-in-differences approach is employed to estimate the impact of NRPS expansion on fertility outcomes. The robustness of results is checked through additional estimations, including difference-in-differences with propensity score matching, fixed-effects model, and instrumental variable approach. Results show that the NRPS expansion has a significantly negative effect on the number of children, and it reduces the likelihood of having a second child. The fertility-reducing effect of the NRPS is larger for the younger, well-educated women and those in high-income families. Considerations of the fertility effects and their population differences are needed in the impact evaluations of relevant public pension reform."
https://openalex.org/W3034269277,"Flavonoids are plant-derived compounds that occur abundantly in fruits and vegetables and have been shown to possess potent anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, their direct targets and molecular mechanism of action are not well characterized, hampering exploitation of the beneficial properties of flavonoids for drug development. Small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1) is attached to target proteins as part of a post-translational modification system implicated in a myriad of cellular processes from nuclear trafficking to transcriptional regulation. Using a combination of surface plasmon resonance, differential scanning fluorimetry and fluorescence quenching studies, we provide evidence for direct binding of the dietary flavonoid fisetin to human SUMO1. Our NMR chemical shift perturbation analyses reveal that binding to fisetin involves four conserved amino acid residues (L65, F66, E67, M82) previously shown to be important for conjugation of SUMO1 to target proteins. In vitro sumoylation experiments indicate that fisetin blocks sumoylation of tumor suppressor p53, consistent with fisetin negatively affecting post-translational modification and thus the biological activity of p53. A series of differential scanning fluorimetry experiments suggest that high concentrations of fisetin result in destabilization and unfolding of SUMO1, presenting a molecular mechanism by which flavonoid binding affects its activity. Overall, our data establish a novel direct interaction between fisetin and SUMO1, providing a mechanistic explanation for the ability of fisetin to modulate multiple key signaling pathways inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W3034575250,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is an important class of noncoding RNA. Current, protocols to detected circRNAs have utilized nonpolyadenylated RNAs, ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA samples (rRNA− library), and rRNA-depleted RNA that has been treated with RNase R to digest linear RNA (rRNA− RNase R+ library). Accumulating evidence suggests the participation of circRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathophysiology, but the details remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidated the brain circRNAs profiles of AD-model and WT mice using two methods of library construction (rRNA− RNase R+ libraries and rRNA− libraries). We focused on the construction of libraries that best allow the identification of circRNAs from next-generation RNA sequencing data. We obtained a significantly higher abundance of circRNAs in the rRNA− RNase R+ libraries than in the rRNA− libraries. Additionally, the rRNA− RNase R+ libraries more clearly revealed differentially expressed circRNAs. We performed a correlation analysis between differentially expressed circRNAs and their parental genes and performed KEGG analysis of the parental genes to explore the role of circRNA in AD. Our results identified significantly dysregulated circRNAs and KEGG analysis revealed that the identified circRNAs are involved in regulating AD development from distinct origins, including cAMP signaling, MAPK signaling, insulin secretion, Axon guidance, Long-term potentiation, dopaminergic synapse, and ErBb signaling pathways. Following rigorous selection, we identified several important circRNAs and mRNAs and propose the circRNAs regulate parental gene transcription or affect variable splicing, which were discovered to be mainly involved in Aβ production and cognitive performance (TRPC6) and neuronal differentiation and development (NME7). These newly identified circRNAs should serve as a valuable resource for the future development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD."
https://openalex.org/W3034816044,"To assess the impact of chemoradiation on pelvic floor (PF) muscle function after the treatment of cervical cancer (CC).We performed a prospective cohort study of women between the ages of 20 and 70 years old who had a diagnosis of CC. Patients were treated with chemoradiation at the Barretos Cancer Hospital (BCH), between August 2016 and July 2017. We performed three evaluations at different time points after chemoradiation treatment to compare changes in muscle function. Pelvic floor muscle function was assessed through perineometry (PNM) and surface electromyography (EMG) at the following time points: Pretreatment Moment 1 (M1): evaluated before chemoradiation; Moment 2 (M2): at the first follow-up medical visit (usually 3 to 4 months after treatment); and Moment 3 (M3): at the second follow-up medical visit (usually after 6 to 9 months after treatment). Mean vaginal squeeze pressure levels were determined by PNM and muscle electromyographic activity by EMG and the results were evaluated by Generalized Linear Model comparisons.Forty-nine patients were evaluated at M1; 35 at M2; and 32 at M3, so that 32 patients had all three muscle evaluations performed. There was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of women with urgency urinary incontinence at the M2 evaluation time (41.9%), compared to pretreatment M1 (18.6%), p<0.001. The means of the vaginal squeeze pressures reduced through M1 to M3 in the phasic (M1: 17.7 mmHg; M3: 11.27mmHg) and tonic contractions (M1: 10.56 mmHg; M3: 7.52mmHg), p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively. There was no difference in pelvic floor function in the three evaluations M1-M3, measured by EMG. The pelvic floor strength assessed by PMN and their interactions with anthropometric, parity and hormonal status variables, showed that a high body mass index (BMI) significantly influenced decreases in pelvic floor muscle function before and after treatment.These results show that chemoradiation causes reduction of muscle function of the pelvic floor, especially in the late phase after the end of treatment. Both the high BMI and urgent urinary incontinence symptoms were related to decreased muscle strength."

https://openalex.org/W3035624548,"Researchers have exerted tremendous efforts to empirically study how habits form and dominate at the expense of deliberation, yet we know very little about breaking these rigid habits to restore goal-directed control. In a three-experiment study, we first illustrate a novel approach of studying well-learned habits, in order to effectively demonstrate habit disruption. In Experiment 1, we use a Go/NoGo task with familiar color-response associations to demonstrate outcome-insensitivity when compared to novel, more flexible associations. Specifically, subjects perform more accurately when the required mapping is the familiar association of green-Go/red-NoGo than when it is red-Go/green-NoGo, confirming outcome-insensitive, habitual control. As a control condition, subjects show equivalent performance with unfamiliar color-response mappings (using the colors blue and purple mapped to Go and NoGo responses). Next, in Experiments 2 and 3, we test a motivation-based feedback manipulation in varying magnitudes (i.e., performance feedback with and without monetary incentives) to break the well-established habits elicited by our familiar stimuli. We find that although performance feedback prior to the contingency reversal test is insufficient to disrupt outcome-insensitivity in Experiment 2, a combination of performance feedback and monetary incentive is able to restore goal-directed control in Experiment 3, effectively breaking the habits. As the first successful demonstration of well-learned habit disruption in the laboratory, these findings provide new insights into how we execute and modify habits, while fostering new and translational research avenues that may be applicable to treating habit-based pathologies."

The fungus and mealy bugs benefit mutually through the gall, which is the key link in the nutritional mechanism of P. portentosus. The cavity of the fungus-insect gall provides an ideal shelter for mealy bugs survival and reproduction, but how does P. portentosus benefit from this symbiotic relationship?Anatomical examination of fungus-insect galls revealed that one or more mealy bugs of different generations were living inside the galls. The mealy bug's mouthpart could penetrate through the mycelium layer of the inside of the gall and suck plant juice from the host plant root. Mealy bugs excreted honeydew inside or outside the galls. The results of both honeydew agar medium and quartz tests showed that the honeydew can attract and promote the mycelial growth of P. portentosus. A test of the relationship between the honeydew and the formation of the fungus-insect gall showed that honeydew promoted gall formation.All experimental results in this study show that the honeydew secreted by mealy bugs can attract and promote the mycelial growth of P. portentosus, forming a fungus-insect gall, because mealy bugs' honeydew is rich in amino acids and sugars."
https://openalex.org/W3034882232,"Background School-based injuries represent a sizeable portion of child injuries. This study investigated the rates of school-based injuries in Lebanon, examining injury mechanisms, outcomes and associated risk factors. Methods Data were prospectively collected by intern school nurses at 11 private schools for the 2018–2019 academic year. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. Chi-square comparisons were conducted to determine the significance of any differences in injury rates between boys and girls for each category of school. Results 4,619 injury cases were collected. The yearly rate for school injuries was 419.1 per 1,000 children for the year 2018–2019. Boys demonstrated a significantly higher injury rate for all mechanisms of injuries, with the exception of being injured while walking, injured in the gym/sports areas, and other areas outside the playground and classroom. Elementary school children had the highest rate of injuries, nearly 2.4 times higher than kindergarten, 2.8 times higher than middle school, and 14.5 times higher than high school. Injuries to the face, upper extremities, and lower extremities were nearly 3 times more common than injuries to other areas of the body. Bumps/hits and bruises were most common—almost 3 times more likely than all other injury types. Injuries were mainly minor or moderate in severity—severe injuries were about 10 times less likely. Most injuries were unintentional, with rates nearly 5 times higher than those with unclear intent and 12 times higher than intentional injuries. Conclusions School injuries represent a relatively common problem. Compliance with playground safety standards coupled with the implementation of injury prevention strategies and active supervision at schools can curtail child injuries and ensure a safe and injury-free school environment."
https://openalex.org/W3035339977,"Urbanization fragments landscapes and can impede the movement of organisms through their environment, which can decrease population connectivity. Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population."
https://openalex.org/W3034611529,"Efforts to expand access to institutional delivery alone without quality of care do not guarantee better survival. However, little evidence documents the quality of childbirth care in Ethiopia, which limits our ability to improve quality. Therefore, this study assessed the quality of and barriers to routine childbirth care signal functions during intra-partum and immediate postpartum period.A sequential explanatory mixed method study was conducted among 225 skilled birth attendants who attended 876 recently delivered women in primary level facilities. A multi stage sampling procedure was used for the quantitative phase whilst purposive sampling was used for the qualitative phase. The quantitative survey recruitment occurred in July to August 2018 and in April 2019 for the qualitative key informant interview and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). A validated quantitative tool from a previous validated measurement study was used to collect quantitative data, whereas an interview guide, informed by the literature and quantitative findings, was used to collect the qualitative data. Principal component analysis and a series of univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to analyze the quantitative data. For the qualitative data, verbatim review of the data was iteratively followed by content analysis and triangulation with the quantitative results.This study showed that one out of five (20.7%, n = 181) mothers received high quality of care in primary level facilities. Primary hospitals (β = 1.27, 95% CI:0.80,1.84, p = 0.001), facilities which had staff rotation policies (β = 2.19, 95% CI:0.01,4.31, p = 0.019), maternal involvement in care decisions (β = 0.92, 95% CI:0.38,1.47, p = 0.001), facilities with maternal and newborn health quality improvement initiatives (β = 1.58, 95% CI:0.26, 3.43, p = 0.001), compassionate respectful maternity care training (β = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.07,0.88, p = 0.021), client flow for delivery (β = 0.19, 95% CI:-0.34, -0.04, p = 0.012), mentorship (β = 0.02, 95% CI:0.01, 0.78, p = 0.049), and providers' satisfaction (β = 0.16, 95% CI:0.03, 0.29, p = 0.013) were predictors of quality of care. This is complemented by qualitative research findings that poor quality of care during delivery and immediate postpartum related to: work related burnout, gap between providers' skill and knowledge, lack of enabling working environment, poor motivation scheme and issues related to retention, poor providers caring behavior, unable translate training into practice, mismatch between number of provider and facility client flow for delivery, and in availability of essential medicine and supplies.There is poor quality of childbirth care in primary level facilities of Tigray. Primary hospitals, facilities with staff rotation, maternal and newborn health quality improvement initiatives, maternal involvement in care decisions, training on compassionate respectful maternity care, mentorship, and high provider satisfaction were found to have significantly increased quality of care. However, client flow for delivery service is negatively associated with quality of care. Efforts must be made to improve the quality of care through catchment-based mentorship to increase providers' level of adherence to good practices and standards. More attention and thoughtful strategies are required to minimize providers' work-related burnout."

https://openalex.org/W3035607833,"Soft robot fabrication by casting liquid elastomer often requires multiple steps of casting or skillful manual labor. We present a novel soft robotic fabrication technique: negshell casting (negative-space eggshell casting), that reduces the steps required for fabrication by introducing 3D-printed thin-walled cores for use in casting that are meant to be left in place instead of being removed later in the fabrication process. Negshell casting consists of two types of cores: sacrificial cores (negshell cores) and structural cores. Negshell cores are designed to be broken into small pieces that have little effect on the mechanical structure of the soft robot, and can be used for creating fluidic channels and bellows for actuation. Structural cores, on the other hand, are not meant to be broken, and are for increasing the stiffness of soft robotic structures, such as endoskeletons. We describe the design and fabrication concepts for both types of cores and report the mechanical characterization of the cores embedded in silicone rubber specimens. We also present an example use-case of negshell casting for a single joint soft robotic finger, along with an experiment to demonstrate how negshell casting concepts can aid in force transmission. Finally, we present real-world usage of negshell casting in a 6 degree-of-freedom three-finger soft robotic gripper, and a demonstration of the gripper in a robotic pick-and-place task.

https://openalex.org/W3035720038,"Sediments from stratified marine environments often show an enhanced preservation of organic matter (OM) which is attributed to the limitation, or absence, of oxygen in the bottom waters and surface sediments. Yet there is still a limited knowledge about the changes that the associated biomarker signals undergo in the different parts of a stratified environment, and as to which extent the situation in the productive upper parts of the water column is eventually reflected in the sedimentary record. To better understand these processes we studied particulate matter samples from the stratified, partly anoxic Eastern Gotland Basin (EGB, Central Baltic Sea) during a strong cyanobacterial bloom in August 2016. Endmember samples representing the main biomass producers within the phytoplankton (cyanobacteria) and mesozooplankton (copepods) were obtained from different levels of the water column. Major extractable lipids (fatty acids, n-alcohols, sterols, and selected hydrocarbons) were analysed from the same materials and compared to samples cored from the underlying surface sediments (0–12 cm). Given the annually recurring phenomenon of cyanobacterial blooms we anticipated to find a considerable lipid footprint of the major primary producers in the sedimentary record of the EGB. Unexpectedly, however, lipids in the surface sediments largely derived from the storage lipids (mainly wax esters) of the copepod Pseudocalanus spp. which thrived in deeper, more saline and oxygen-depleted waters. Carbon number and unsaturation patterns suggest that the component n-alcohols of these wax esters are transformed into the corresponding n-fatty acids prior to further degradation in the sediment. In the EGB deposits, most of the plankton-derived lipids studied appear to be degraded on a time scale of decades. In terms of relative abundances, long-chain n-alkyl lipids and C29 sterols from terrestrial plant sources instead become predominant in the deeper sediment layers. Likewise, higher stanol/sterol ratios of C27-sterols vs. C29-sterols indicate a more intense biodegradation of planktonic OM as compared to terrestrial OM. Our observations indicate that primary produced particulate OM is heavily modified by mesozooplankton grazing. This overprint adds on the influence of heterotrophic microorganisms and, in the sediment, preferential preservation of terrestrial biomarkers. Taken together, these factors result in a major decoupling of the biomarker signals between the productive upper mixed layer and the oxygen-depleted bottom waters and sediments of the EGB."

Reliability was evaluated as internal consistency for the entire sample. Test-retest reproducibility was evaluated for patients who were stable from baseline to week 2 (n = 70). Validity was analysed (n = 124) as baseline correlations with QoL, self-care, self-efficacy, clinical data and psychosocial variables. Sensitivity to change was analysed in terms of effect size for patients who had improved between baseline and week 12 (n = 48).The study was carried out with 124 patients with a diagnosis of heart failure. Cronbach's alpha was high, at >0.9, and the interclass correlation coefficient was low, at 0.47. PELC questionnaire scores showed differences depending on New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.05) and, as posited in the a priori hypotheses, were moderately correlated with emotional dimensions of QoL (0.53) and self-efficacy (0.43).

Twenty-eight pure bacterial strains were collected from four different jackfruit outbreak collection areas in Peninsular Malaysia (Jenderam, Maran, Muadzam Shah and Ipoh). Positive P. stewartii subsp. stewartii verification obtained in the study was based on the phenotypic, hypersensitivity, pathogenicity and molecular tests. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was performed using four housekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB) on all 28 bacterial strains. Single gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB phylogenetic trees analyses revealed the bootstrap value of 99-100% between our bacterial strains with P. stewartii subsp. stewartii reference strains and P. stewartii subsp. indologenes reference strains. On the other hand, phylogenetic tree of the concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes revealed that our 28 bacterial strains were more closely related to P. stewartii subsp. stewartii (99% similarities) compared to its close relative P. stewartii subsp. indologenes, although sequence similarity between these two subspecies were up to 100%. All the strains collected from the four collection areas clustered together, pointing to no variation among the bacterial strains.

However, little is known about BIVA in Asian adults, and even less is known about using standing BIVA devices. Standing impedance analyzer allows quicker and more convenient way to gather data than conventional supine analyzer and is more suitable for clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate the relations between muscle function and BIVA parameters measured with a standing impedance analyzer in healthy Taiwanese adults. Methods A total of 406 healthy subjects (age 34.5 ± 17.3 years, body mass index 24.1 ± 4.1 kg/m2) were recruited for BIVA and handgrip strength (HGS) measurements. Impedance parameters, including resistance (R) and reactance (Xc), were measured and normalized to body size by dividing by height (H). The resulting phase angle (PhA) was calculated. HGS in the dominant, left, and right hands were referred to as HGSDH, HGSLH, and HGSRH, respectively. All subjects were divided into 5 grades according to HGS. Results Muscle strength in the dominant, right, and left arms was correlated with variables in the order of sex, weight, age, height, Xc/H, and R/H (all, p < 0.001). Using all 6 variables, the determination coefficients were 0.792, 0.782, and 0.745, respectively, whereas the standard errors of estimates were 56.89, 58.01, and 56.67 N for HGSDH, HGSLH, and HGSRH, respectively. HGS was positively correlated with PhA, and negatively correlated with Xc/H and R/H. Conclusions BIVA parameters measured with a standing impedance analyzer and anthropometric variables can predict and discriminate muscle function with good performance in healthy Asian adults."

Five homologous repeated sequences (hrs) and two baculovirus repeated ORFs (bro-a and bro-b) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HearNPV-TR is closer to HaSNPV-C1, HaSNPV-G4, HaSNPV-AU and HasNPV. However, there are significant differences in hr3, hr5 regions and in bro-a gene. Pairwise Kimura-2 parameter analysis of 38 core genes sequences of HearNPV-TR and other Helicoverpa NPVs showed that the genetic distances for these sequences were below 0.015 substitutions/site. Genomic differences as revealed by restriction profiles indicated that hr3, hr5 regions and bro-a gene may play a role in the virulence of HearNPV-TR."

A sample of 659 athletes (male = 355, female = 304) aged from 16-34 (M = 20.08, SD = 2.98) participated in this study. The scale was translated into Chinese using forward and back translation procedures by two independent translators. Questionnaires were administered online. Data was analysed using SPSS 19.0 and Mplus 6.0. Results showed that the items were understood by Chinese team sport athletes. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the Chinese version of CREST had two sub-dimensions as it was in the original scale. Confirmatory factor analysis further demonstrated that the two-structure model was confirmed in the Chinese team sports context. The Cronbach's alpha values of the scale was 0.842, and the test-retest reliability coefficient of one-month interval was 0.836. It is concluded that the Chinese version of CREST can be used as a valid and reliable tool to assess team resilience in China and can be helpful and applicable in helping sports psychologists understand team resilience. Future studies should further examine the psychometric properties of the scale among world-class athletes and develop a team resilience measurement tool based on Chinese traditional culture."
https://openalex.org/W3035297945,"We investigated the phenotype and molecular signatures of CD8+ T cell subsets in kidney-transplant recipients (KTRs) with biopsy-proven T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR). We included 121 KTRs and divided them into three groups according to the pathologic or clinical diagnosis: Normal biopsy control (NC)(n = 32), TCMR (n = 50), and long-term graft survival (LTGS)(n = 39). We used flowcytometry and microarray to analyze the phenotype and molecular signatures of CD8+ T cell subsets using peripheral blood from those patients and analyzed significant gene expressions according to CD8+ T cell subsets. We investigated whether the analysis of CD8+ T cell subsets is useful for predicting the development of TCMR. CCR7+CD8+ T cells significantly decreased, but CD28nullCD57+CD8+ T cells and CCR7-CD45RA+CD8+ T cells showed an increase in the TCMR group compared to other groups (p<0.05 for each); hence CCR7+CD8+ T cells showed significant negative correlations to both effector CD8+ T cells. We identified genes significantly associated with the change of CCR7+CD8+ T, CCR7-CD45RA+CD8+ T, and CD28nullCD57+CD8+ T cells in an ex vivo study and found that most of them were included in the significant genes on in vitro CCR7+CD8+ T cells. Finally, the decrease of CCR7+CD8+ T cells relative to CD28nullCD57+ T or CCR7-CD45RA+CD8+ T cells can predict TCMR significantly in the whole clinical cohort. In conclusion, phenotype and molecular signature of CD8+ T subsets showed a significant relationship to the development of TCMR; hence monitoring of CD8+ T cell subsets may be a useful for predicting TCMR in KTRs."
https://openalex.org/W3034675710,"Some patients with a bileaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) show significant increases in the transvalvular pressure drop and abnormal leaflet motion due to a pannus (an abnormal fibrovascular tissue) formed on the ventricular side, even in the absence of physical contact between the pannus and leaflets. We investigate the effects of the pannus shape (circular or semi-circular ring), implantation location and height on the leaflet motion, flow structure and transvalvular pressure drop using numerical simulations. The valve model considered resembles a 25 mm masters HP valve. The mean systolic pressure drop is significantly increased with increasing pannus height, irrespective of its implantation orientation. Near the peak inflow rate, the flow behind the pannus becomes highly turbulent, and the transvalvular pressure drop is markedly increased by the pannus. At the end of valve opening and the start of valve closing, oscillatory motions of the leaflets occur due to periodic shedding of vortex rings behind the pannus, and their amplitudes become large with increasing pannus height. When the pannus shape is asymmetric (e.g., a semi-circular ring) and its height reaches about 0.1D (D (= 25 mm) is the diameter of an aorta), abnormal leaflet motions occur: two leaflets move asymmetrically, and valve closing is delayed in time or incomplete, which increases the regurgitation volume. The peak energy loss coefficients due to panni are obtained from simulation data and compared with those predicted by a one-dimensional model. The comparison indicates that the one-dimensional model is applicable for the BMHV with and without pannus."

The potential for misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment exists in settings with limited testing capacity for Xpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert), phenotypic culture and NTM speciation. We describe treatment outcomes among people living with HIV (PLHIV) who received anti-tuberculosis treatment and were found to have NTM or MTB positive sputum cultures.PLHIV attending one of the 22 participating HIV clinics, who screened positive for ≥1 tuberculosis (TB) symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) were asked to submit sputa for culture and speciation from August 2012 to November 2014. The national intensified TB case finding algorithms were followed: initially symptomatic patients were evaluated by testing sputum samples using a smear (smear-based TB diagnostic algorithm) and, after GeneXpert instruments were installed, by testing with Xpert (Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm). Within the study period, TB diagnostic algorithms used for MTB did not include screening, diagnosis, and management of NTM. Despite MTB negative culture, some symptomatic patients, including those with NTM positive culture, received empirical anti-TB treatment at the discretion of treating clinicians. Per the World Health Organization treatment outcomes classification: died, treatment failure or loss-to-follow-up were classified as unfavorable (unsuccessful) outcome; cured and treatment completed were classified as favorable (successful) outcome. Empiric treatment was defined as initiating treatment without or before receiving a test result indicating MTB. We compare treatment outcomes and characteristics among patients with NTM or MTB positive culture who received anti-TB treatment.Among 314 PLHIV, who were found co-infected with TB, 146 cases had microbiological evidence; and for 131/146 MTB positive cultures were reported. One-hundred fifty-two of the 314 were clinically diagnosed with TB and treated empirically. Among those empirically treated for TB, 36/152 had culture results positive for NTM, and another 43/152 had culture results positive for MTB, reported after patients received empirical anti-TB treatment. Overall, MTB positive culture results were reported for 174 (131 plus 43) patients. Treatment outcomes were available for 32/36 NTM and 139/174 MTB; unfavorable outcomes were 12.5% and 8.7% for NTM and MTB, respectively, p = 0.514, respectively. For 34/36 tested NTM patients, all Xpert results indicated 'no MTB'. Among patients who initially received empiric anti-TB treatment and ultimately were found to have MTB positive culture, the unfavorable outcome was 11.8% (4/34), compared to 12.5% (4/32) of patients with NTM positive culture, Fisher's exact test p = 1.00.While the higher unfavorable outcome was non statistically significant, the impact of inappropriate treatment among NTM patients should not be overlooked. Our findings suggest that Xpert has the potential to rapidly rule-out NTM and avoid sub-optimal treatment; further research is needed to evaluate such potential."
https://openalex.org/W3034759978,"Iron biofortified beans and carotenoid enriched cassava are proposed as a solution to combat iron and vitamin A deficiencies, respectively, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). To inform the need for biofortified foods, we conducted a survey in 2014 in two provinces of the DRC, South Kivu and Kongo Central. Unexpectedly, women of reproductive age (WRA; 15-49 y) and their children (6-59 m) had a low prevalence of biochemical iron and vitamin A deficiency, based on ferritin and retinol binding protein, respectively. To better understand the lack of biochemical deficiency of these nutrients, we examined the prevalence of inadequate intake for these and other select nutrients. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls among 744 mother-child dyads. Repeat recalls on a non-consecutive day were conducted with a subsample of the study population to account for intra-individual variation and estimate usual intake. In WRA, the prevalence of inadequate iron intakes were 33% and 29% in South Kivu and Kongo Central, respecitvely. The prevalence of inadequate vitamin A intakes among WRA was low in South Kivu (18%) and negligible in Kongo Central (1%). Iron inadequacy was highest in infants (6-11 m) at 82% and 64% in South Kivu and Kongo Central, respectively. Among older children (12-59 m) in both provinces, the prevalence of iron inadequacy was similar at ~20%. There was a high prevalence of inadequate zinc intake in women and children (i.e. 79-86% among WRA and 56-91% among children 6-59 m) consistent with our findings of a high prevalence of low serum zinc in the same sample. Dietary data here corroborate the low prevalence of biochemical vitamin A deficiency but not iron. However, any change to the supply of red palm oil (primary source of vitamin A) would dramatically reduce population vitamin A intakes, thus a carotenoid enriched cassava program may be beneficial as a safety net measure. Crops biofortified with zinc also appear warranted. We caution that our findings cannot be extrapolated to the entire Congo where diverse agro-ecological landscape exist or when political and environmental shocks occur which challenge food production."
https://openalex.org/W3035735764,"Traditionally, firm competition has been studied in contexts where the dimensionality of the product attribute space is given, and firms deploy their strategies constrained by this space. However, firms may exert influence on the local structure of the product attribute space by offering product variants with new attributes. As a result, the geometry of the product attribute space would change endogenously through firms’ actions, and this emergent new geometry modifies the conditions for subsequent firm behavior. By focusing on this interplay between actors and conditions, we explore the co-evolution of the firm and the product attribute space. Through a multi-variant Cournot competition framework, we develop a computational model in which firms invest to differentiate their products from other variants, but as minimally as possible so that demand from closely similar existing variants can be stolen. We introduce the fraction dimensionality of the attribute space as our critical independent variable, to reflect saturation of the space with product varieties. The simulation reveals that while new product variants are typically introduced by firms with scale economies, their performance gap with firms without scale economies reduces as fraction dimensionality increases. This indicates that space geometry evolution may favor small-scale players, even when their large-scale competitors are the driving force behind attribute space changes."
