https://openalex.org/W3108896277,"Ageing is a degenerative process that leads to tissue dysfunction and death. A proposed cause of ageing is the accumulation of epigenetic noise that disrupts gene expression patterns, leading to decreases in tissue function and regenerative capacity1-3. Changes to DNA methylation patterns over time form the basis of ageing clocks4, but whether older individuals retain the information needed to restore these patterns-and, if so, whether this could improve tissue function-is not known. Over time, the central nervous system (CNS) loses function and regenerative capacity5-7. Using the eye as a model CNS tissue, here we show that ectopic expression of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4 genes (OSK) in mouse retinal ganglion cells restores youthful DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes, promotes axon regeneration after injury, and reverses vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma and in aged mice. The beneficial effects of OSK-induced reprogramming in axon regeneration and vision require the DNA demethylases TET1 and TET2. These data indicate that mammalian tissues retain a record of youthful epigenetic information-encoded in part by DNA methylation-that can be accessed to improve tissue function and promote regeneration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3109247367,"The standard model of particle physics is remarkably successful because it is consistent with (almost) all experimental results. However, it fails to explain dark matter, dark energy and the imbalance between matter and antimatter in the Universe. Because discrepancies between standard-model predictions and experimental observations may provide evidence of new physics, an accurate evaluation of these predictions requires highly precise values of the fundamental physical constants. Among them, the fine-structure constant α is of particular importance because it sets the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between light and charged elementary particles, such as the electron and the muon. Here we use matter-wave interferometry to measure the recoil velocity of a rubidium atom that absorbs a photon, and determine the fine-structure constant α−1 = 137.035999206(11) with a relative accuracy of 81 parts per trillion. The accuracy of eleven digits in α leads to an electron g factor1,2—the most precise prediction of the standard model—that has a greatly reduced uncertainty. Our value of the fine-structure constant differs by more than 5 standard deviations from the best available result from caesium recoil measurements3. Our result modifies the constraints on possible candidate dark-matter particles proposed to explain the anomalous decays of excited states of 8Be nuclei4 and paves the way for testing the discrepancy observed in the magnetic moment anomaly of the muon5 in the electron sector6. The fine-structure constant is determined with an accuracy of 81 parts per trillion using matter-wave interferometry to measure the rubidium atom recoil velocity."

https://openalex.org/W3108091462,"Mapping the complex biogeography of microbial communities in situ with high taxonomic and spatial resolution poses a major challenge because of the high density1 and rich diversity2 of species in environmental microbiomes and the limitations of optical imaging technology3-6. Here we introduce high-phylogenetic-resolution microbiome mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPR-FISH), a versatile technology that uses binary encoding, spectral imaging and decoding based on machine learning to create micrometre-scale maps of the locations and identities of hundreds of microbial species in complex communities. We show that 10-bit HiPR-FISH can distinguish between 1,023 isolates of Escherichia coli, each fluorescently labelled with a unique binary barcode. HiPR-FISH, in conjunction with custom algorithms for automated probe design and analysis of single-cell images, reveals the disruption of spatial networks in the mouse gut microbiome in response to treatment with antibiotics, and the longitudinal stability of spatial architectures in the human oral plaque microbiome. Combined with super-resolution imaging, HiPR-FISH shows the diverse strategies of ribosome organization that are exhibited by taxa in the human oral microbiome. HiPR-FISH provides a framework for analysing the spatial ecology of environmental microbial communities at single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3107278778,"Animal behaviours that are superficially similar can express different intents in different contexts, but how this flexibility is achieved at the level of neural circuits is not understood. For example, males of many species can exhibit mounting behaviour towards same- or opposite-sex conspecifics1, but it is unclear whether the intent and neural encoding of these behaviours are similar or different. Here we show that female- and male-directed mounting in male laboratory mice are distinguishable by the presence or absence of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)2-4, respectively. These and additional behavioural data suggest that most male-directed mounting is aggressive, although in rare cases it can be sexual. We investigated whether USV+ and USV- mounting use the same or distinct hypothalamic neural substrates. Micro-endoscopic imaging of neurons positive for oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in either the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl) revealed distinct patterns of neuronal activity during USV+ and USV- mounting, and the type of mounting could be decoded from population activity in either region. Intersectional optogenetic stimulation of MPOA neurons that express ESR1 and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) (MPOAESR1∩VGAT neurons) robustly promoted USV+ mounting, and converted male-directed attack to mounting with USVs. By contrast, stimulation of VMHvl neurons that express ESR1 (VMHvlESR1 neurons) promoted USV- mounting, and inhibited the USVs evoked by female urine. Terminal stimulation experiments suggest that these complementary inhibitory effects are mediated by reciprocal projections between the MPOA and VMHvl. Together, these data identify a hypothalamic subpopulation that is genetically enriched for neurons that causally induce a male reproductive behavioural state, and indicate that reproductive and aggressive states are represented by distinct population codes distributed between MPOAESR1 and VMHvlESR1 neurons, respectively. Thus, similar behaviours that express different internal states are encoded by distinct hypothalamic neuronal populations."
https://openalex.org/W3108630191,"Inflammasomes are important sentinels of innate immune defence that are activated in response to diverse stimuli, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)1. Activation of the inflammasome provides host defence against aspergillosis2,3, which is a major health concern for patients who are immunocompromised. However, the Aspergillus fumigatus PAMPs that are responsible for inflammasome activation are not known. Here we show that the polysaccharide galactosaminogalactan (GAG) of A. fumigatus is a PAMP that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. The binding of GAG to ribosomal proteins inhibited cellular translation machinery, and thus activated the NLRP3 inflammasome. The galactosamine moiety bound to ribosomal proteins and blocked cellular translation, which triggered activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In mice, a GAG-deficient Aspergillus mutant (Δgt4c) did not elicit protective activation of the inflammasome, and this strain exhibited enhanced virulence. Moreover, administration of GAG protected mice from colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium in an inflammasome-dependent manner. Thus, ribosomes connect the sensing of this fungal PAMP to the activation of an innate immune response. Galactosaminogalactan of Aspergillus fumigatus acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is crucial for anti-fungal host defence."
https://openalex.org/W3109298913,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the world, with most CVD-related deaths resulting from myocardial infarction or stroke. The main underlying cause of thrombosis and cardiovascular events is atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease that can remain asymptomatic for long periods. There is an urgent need for therapeutic and diagnostic options in this area. Atherosclerotic plaques contain autoantibodies1,2, and there is a connection between atherosclerosis and autoimmunity3. However, the immunogenic trigger and the effects of the autoantibody response during atherosclerosis are not well understood3–5. Here we performed high-throughput single-cell analysis of the atherosclerosis-associated antibody repertoire. Antibody gene sequencing of more than 1,700 B cells from atherogenic Ldlr−/− and control mice identified 56 antibodies expressed by in-vivo-expanded clones of B lymphocytes in the context of atherosclerosis. One-third of the expanded antibodies were reactive against atherosclerotic plaques, indicating that various antigens in the lesion can trigger antibody responses. Deep proteomics analysis identified ALDH4A1, a mitochondrial dehydrogenase involved in proline metabolism, as a target antigen of one of these autoantibodies, A12. ALDH4A1 distribution is altered during atherosclerosis, and circulating ALDH4A1 is increased in mice and humans with atherosclerosis, supporting the potential use of ALDH4A1 as a disease biomarker. Infusion of A12 antibodies into Ldlr−/− mice delayed plaque formation and reduced circulating free cholesterol and LDL, suggesting that anti-ALDH4A1 antibodies can protect against atherosclerosis progression and might have therapeutic potential in CVD. An autoantibody found in a mouse model of atherosclerosis recognizses ALDH4A1, and infusion of the antibody delays plaque formation in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3109103255,"Myosin II is the motor protein that enables muscle cells to contract and nonmuscle cells to move and change shape1. The molecule has two identical heads attached to an elongated tail, and can exist in two conformations: 10S and 6S, named for their sedimentation coefficients2,3. The 6S conformation has an extended tail and assembles into polymeric filaments, which pull on actin filaments to generate force and motion. In 10S myosin, the tail is folded into three segments and the heads bend back and interact with each other and the tail3-7, creating a compact conformation in which ATPase activity, actin activation and filament assembly are all highly inhibited7,8. This switched-off structure appears to function as a key energy-conserving storage molecule in muscle and nonmuscle cells9-12, which can be activated to form functional filaments as needed13-but the mechanism of its inhibition is not understood. Here we have solved the structure of smooth muscle 10S myosin by cryo-electron microscopy with sufficient resolution to enable improved understanding of the function of the head and tail regions of the molecule and of the key intramolecular contacts that cause inhibition. Our results suggest an atomic model for the off state of myosin II, for its activation and unfolding by phosphorylation, and for understanding the clustering of disease-causing mutations near sites of intramolecular interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3108457971,"Sleep remains a major mystery of biology, with little understood about its basic function. One of the most commonly proposed functions of sleep is the consolidation of memory1-3. However, as conditions such as starvation require the organism to be awake and active4, the ability to switch to a memory consolidation mechanism that is not contingent on sleep may confer an evolutionary advantage. Here we identify an adaptive circuit-based mechanism that enables Drosophila to form sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory. Flies fed after appetitive conditioning needed increased sleep for memory consolidation, but flies starved after training did not require sleep to form memories. Memory in fed flies is mediated by the anterior-posterior α'/β' neurons of the mushroom body, while memory under starvation is mediated by medial α'/β' neurons. Sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory rely on distinct dopaminergic neurons and corresponding mushroom body output neurons. However, sleep and memory are coupled such that mushroom body neurons required for sleep-dependent memory also promote sleep. Flies lacking Neuropeptide F display sleep-dependent memory even when starved, suggesting that circuit selection is determined by hunger. This plasticity in memory circuits enables flies to retain essential information in changing environments."
https://openalex.org/W3108681768,"Myosin-2 is essential for processes as diverse as cell division and muscle contraction. Dephosphorylation of its regulatory light chain promotes an inactive, ‘shutdown’ state with the filament-forming tail folded onto the two heads1, which prevents filament formation and inactivates the motors2. The mechanism by which this happens is unclear. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of shutdown smooth muscle myosin with a resolution of 6 Å in the head region. A pseudo-atomic model, obtained by flexible fitting of crystal structures into the density and molecular dynamics simulations, describes interaction interfaces at the atomic level. The N-terminal extension of one regulatory light chain interacts with the tail, and the other with the partner head, revealing how the regulatory light chains stabilize the shutdown state in different ways and how their phosphorylation would allow myosin activation. Additional interactions between the three segments of the coiled coil, the motor domains and the light chains stabilize the shutdown molecule. The structure of the lever in each head is competent to generate force upon activation. This shutdown structure is relevant to all isoforms of myosin-2 and provides a framework for understanding their disease-causing mutations. The structure of myosin-2 in the shutdown state reveals how the shutdown state is stabilized and how phosphorylation of light chains allows myosin to be activated."
https://openalex.org/W3110555577,"Receptors for the peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1R), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIPR), and glucagon (GCGR) are important regulators of insulin secretion and energy metabolism. GLP-1R agonists have been successfully deployed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it has been suggested that their efficacy is limited by target receptor desensitization and downregulation due to recruitment of β-arrestins. Indeed, recently described GLP-1R agonists with reduced β-arrestin-2 recruitment have delivered promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. We therefore aimed to determine if the same phenomenon could apply to the closely related GIPR and GCGR. In HEK293 cells depleted of both β-arrestin isoforms the duration of G protein-dependent cAMP/PKA signaling was increased in response to the endogenous ligand for each receptor. Moreover, in wildtype cells, ""biased"" GLP-1, GCG, and GIP analogs with selective reductions in β-arrestin-2 recruitment led to reduced receptor endocytosis and increased insulin secretion over a prolonged stimulation period, although the latter effect was only seen at high agonist concentrations. Biased GCG analogs increased the duration of cAMP signaling, but this did not lead to increased glucose output from hepatocytes. Our study provides a rationale for the development of GLP-1R, GIPR, and GCGR agonists with reduced β-arrestin recruitment, but further work is needed to maximally exploit this strategy for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3109427724,"The development of biometric applications, such as facial recognition (FR), has recently become important in smart cities. Many scientists and engineers around the world have focused on establishing increasingly robust and accurate algorithms and methods for these types of systems and their applications in everyday life. FR is developing technology with multiple real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a complete FR system using transfer learning in fog computing and cloud computing. The developed system uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) because of the dominant representation; there are some conditions including occlusions, expressions, illuminations, and pose, which can affect the deep FR performance. DCNN is used to extract relevant facial features. These features allow us to compare faces between them in an efficient way. The system can be trained to recognize a set of people and to learn via an online method, by integrating the new people it processes and improving its predictions on the ones it already has. The proposed recognition method was tested with different three standard machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The proposed system has been evaluated using three datasets of face images (SDUMLA-HMT, 113, and CASIA) via performance metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superiority over other algorithms according to all parameters. The suggested algorithm results in higher accuracy (99.06%), higher precision (99.12%), higher recall (99.07%), and higher specificity (99.10%) than the comparison algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3110099115,Photosynthetic reaction centres harvest the energy content of sunlight by transporting electrons across an energy-transducing biological membrane. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography1 using an X-ray free-electron laser2 to observe light-induced structural changes in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Blastochloris viridis on a timescale of picoseconds. Structural perturbations first occur at the special pair of chlorophyll molecules of the photosynthetic reaction centre that are photo-oxidized by light. Electron transfer to the menaquinone acceptor on the opposite side of the membrane induces a movement of this cofactor together with lower amplitude protein rearrangements. These observations reveal how proteins use conformational dynamics to stabilize the charge-separation steps of electron-transfer reactions.
https://openalex.org/W3110597556,"Basal stem cells fuel development, homeostasis, and regeneration of the epidermis. The proliferation and fate decisions of these cells are highly regulated by their microenvironment, including the basement membrane and underlying mesenchymal cells. Basal progenitors give rise to differentiated progeny that generate the epidermal barrier. Here, we present data that differentiated progeny also regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of basal progenitor cells. Using two distinct mouse lines, we found that increasing contractility of differentiated cells resulted in non-cell-autonomous hyperproliferation of stem cells and prevented their commitment to a hair follicle lineage. This increased contractility also impaired movement of basal progenitors during hair placode morphogenesis and diminished migration of melanoblasts. These data suggest that intra-tissue tension regulates stem cell proliferation, fate decisions, and migration and that differentiated epidermal keratinocytes are a component of the stem cell niche that regulates development and homeostasis of the skin."
https://openalex.org/W3110474399,"Species that depend on membership in social groups for survival exhibit changes in neuronal gene expression and behaviour when they face restricted social interactions or isolation1-3. Here we show that, across the lifespan of zebrafish (Danio rerio), social isolation specifically decreased the level of transcription of pth2, the gene that encodes the vertebrate-specific neuropeptide Pth2. However, 30 minutes of exposure to conspecifics was sufficient to initiate a significant rescue of pth2 transcript levels in previously isolated zebrafish. Transcription of pth2 exhibited bidirectional dynamics; following the acute isolation of socially reared fish, a rapid reduction in the levels of pth2 was observed. The expression of pth2 tracked not only the presence of other fish but also the density of the group. The sensory modality that controls the expression of pth2 was neither visual nor chemosensory in origin but instead was mechanical, induced by the movements of neighbouring fish. Chemical ablation of the mechanosensitive neuromast cells within the lateral line of fish prevented the rescue of pth2 levels that was induced by the social environment. In addition, mechanical perturbation of the water at frequencies similar to the movements of the zebrafish tail was sufficient to rescue the levels of pth2 in previously isolated fish. These data indicate a previously underappreciated role for the relatively unexplored neuropeptide Pth2 in both tracking and responding to the population density of the social environment of an animal."

https://openalex.org/W3108200127,"The effects of diet in cancer, in general, and breast cancer in particular, are not well understood. Insulin inhibition in ketogenic, high fat diets, modulate downstream signaling molecules and are postulated to have therapeutic benefits. Obesity and diabetes have been associated with higher incidence of breast cancer. Addition of anti-cancer drugs together with diet is also not well studied.Two diets, one ketogenic, the other standard mouse chow, were tested in a spontaneous breast cancer model in 34 mice. Subgroups of 3-9 mice were assigned, in which the diet were implemented either with or without added rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor and potential anti-cancer drug.Blood glucose and insulin concentrations in mice ingesting the ketogenic diet (KD) were significantly lower, whereas beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were significantly higher, respectively, than in mice on the standard diet (SD). Growth of primary breast tumors and lung metastases were inhibited, and lifespans were longer in the KD mice compared to mice on the SD (p<0.005). Rapamycin improved survival in both mouse diet groups, but when combined with the KD was more effective than when combined with the SD.The study provides proof of principle that a ketogenic diet a) results in serum insulin reduction and ketosis in a spontaneous breast cancer mouse model; b) can serve as a therapeutic anti-cancer agent; and c) can enhance the effects of rapamycin, an anti-cancer drug, permitting dose reduction for comparable effect. Further, the ketogenic diet in this model produces superior cancer control than standard mouse chow whether with or without added rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W3110643125,"Among numerous challenges encountered at the beginning of extrauterine life, the most celebrated is the first breath that initiates a life-sustaining motor activity1. The neural systems that regulate breathing are fragile early in development, and it is not clear how they adjust to support breathing at birth. Here we identify a neuropeptide system that becomes activated immediately after birth and supports breathing. Mice that lack PACAP selectively in neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) displayed increased apnoeas and blunted CO2-stimulated breathing; re-expression of PACAP in RTN neurons corrected these breathing deficits. Deletion of the PACAP receptor PAC1 from the pre-Bötzinger complex-an RTN target region responsible for generating the respiratory rhythm-phenocopied the breathing deficits observed after RTN deletion of PACAP, and suppressed PACAP-evoked respiratory stimulation in the pre-Bötzinger complex. Notably, a postnatal burst of PACAP expression occurred in RTN neurons precisely at the time of birth, coinciding with exposure to the external environment. Neonatal mice with deletion of PACAP in RTN neurons displayed increased apnoeas that were further exacerbated by changes in ambient temperature. Our findings demonstrate that well-timed PACAP expression by RTN neurons provides an important supplementary respiratory drive immediately after birth and reveal key molecular components of a peptidergic neural circuit that supports breathing at a particularly vulnerable period in life."
https://openalex.org/W3109740794,"Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by an absent or ectopic posterior pituitary, interrupted pituitary stalk and anterior pituitary hypoplasia, as well as in some cases, a range of heterogeneous somatic anomalies.

Exome sequencing was performed in 52 (33 boys and 19 girls), including 2 familial cases single center pediatric cases, among them associated 36 (69.2%) had associated symptoms or syndromes. We identified rare and novel variants in genes (37 families with 39 individuals) known to be involved in one or more of the following—midline development and/or pituitary development or function ( BMP4 , CDON , GLI2 , GLI3 , HESX1 , KIAA0556 , LHX9 , NKX2-1 , PROP1 , PTCH1 , SHH , TBX19 , TGIF1 ), syndromic and non-syndromic forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( CCDC141 , CHD7 , FANCA , FANCC , FANCD2 , FANCE , FANCG , IL17RD , KISS1R , NSMF , PMM2 , SEMA3E , WDR11 ), syndromic forms of short stature ( FGFR3 , NBAS , PRMT7 , RAF1 , SLX4 , SMARCA2 , SOX11 ), cerebellum atrophy with optic anomalies ( DNMT1 , NBAS ), axonal migration ( ROBO1 , SLIT2 ), and agenesis of the corpus callosum ( ARID1B , CC2D2A , CEP120 , CSPP1 , DHCR7 , INPP5E , VPS13B , ZNF423 ). Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome is characterized by a complex genetic heterogeneity, that reflects a complex phenotypic heterogeneity. Seizures, intellectual disability, micropenis or cryptorchidism, seen at presentation are usually considered as secondary to the pituitary deficiencies. However, this study shows that they are due to specific gene mutations. PSIS should therefore be considered as part of the phenotypic spectrum of other known genetic syndromes rather than as specific clinical entity."
https://openalex.org/W3107701424,"The Yes-associated protein (YAP), one of the major effectors of the Hippo pathway together with its related protein WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1; also known as TAZ), mediates a range of cellular processes from proliferation and death to morphogenesis. YAP and WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1; also known as TAZ) regulate a large number of target genes, acting as coactivators of DNA-binding transcription factors or as negative regulators of transcription by interacting with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complexes. YAP is expressed in self-renewing embryonic stem cells (ESCs), although it is still debated whether it plays any crucial roles in the control of either stemness or differentiation. Here we show that the transient downregulation of YAP in mouse ESCs perturbs cellular homeostasis, leading to the inability to differentiate properly. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that this transient knockdown caused a genome-wide alteration of the DNA methylation remodeling that takes place during the early steps of differentiation, suggesting that the phenotype we observed might be due to the dysregulation of some of the mechanisms involved in regulation of ESC exit from pluripotency. By gene expression analysis, we identified two molecules that could have a role in the altered genome-wide methylation profile: the long noncoding RNA ephemeron, whose rapid upregulation is crucial for the transition of ESCs into epiblast, and the methyltransferase-like protein Dnmt3l, which, during the embryo development, cooperates with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to contribute to the de novo DNA methylation that governs early steps of ESC differentiation.

Growth Differ. 2017; 59: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), likely because of the induced repression of Sox2 preventing the appearance of the inner cell mass phenotype. At the morula stage, YAP is responsible for the activation of trophoblast master genes, like Cdx2, in the cells of the external layer, thus governing the acquisition of the trophoblast cell identity (9Nishioka N.

Several works aimed at characterizing the function of YAP/TAZ in ESCs. Some results indicated that the suppression of YAP or TEAD resulted in the decreased intensity of alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining of colonies and the downregulation of Oct4 and Sox2, with concomitant expression of differentiation markers, like T, alpha-fetoprotein, and Gata4 (10Lian I.

In vivo analysis showed that high TEAD activity sustains pluripotency in the inner cell mass, whereas cells with low TEAD levels are eliminated (5Hashimoto M. Sasaki H.

However, conflicting results showed that YAP/TAZ depletion had no effects on the stemness of ESCs grown in 2i medium and that, in these 2i conditions, YAP/TAZ downregulation mimics GSK3 inhibitor that blocks the β-catenin pathway (7Azzolin L.

Yap1 is dispensable for self-renewal but required for proper differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in differentiation-inducing conditions, YAP knockdown (KD) results in an insufficient accumulation of differentiation markers, like T, Gata6, and Gata3, although Oct4 and Nanog are normally suppressed (12Chung H. Lee B.K. Uprety N. Shen W. Lee J. Kim J. Yap1 is dispensable for self-renewal but required for proper differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting results could at least in part depend on the multifaceted activities of YAP/TAZ in the various steps of ESC differentiation, whose suppression in different experimental conditions could lead to diverse consequences. To address this point, we explored the effects of a very transient downregulation of YAP on the differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that, although the normal YAP levels are completely rescued during the differentiation process, YAP KD cells show a genome methylation profile significantly different from that of the control cells. Looking at the expression profile of undifferentiated YAP KD cells, we appreciated significant downregulation of Dnmt3l and the ephemeron long noncoding (lncRNA). These findings indicate that YAP expression in undifferentiated ESCs is necessary to sustain the appropriate machinery responsible for the remodeling of the genome methylation patterns taking place at the exit of ESCs from the naive state. We decided to explore the possible long-lasting effects of a transient YAP suppression in ESCs. To this aim, E14Tg2a clones, stably expressing GFP under control of the neural-specific promoter of the α1-tubulin gene (α1T–GFP) (13Parisi S. Passaro F. Aloia L. Manabe I. Nagai R. Pastore L. Russo T. Klf5 is involved in self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Sci. 2008; 121: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with a mixture of siRNAs eliciting a robust suppression of YAP expression (Fig. S1). About 48 h after transfection, YAP KD cells were induced to differentiate toward the neuroectodermal fate (13Parisi S. Passaro F. Aloia L. Manabe I. Nagai R. Pastore L. Russo T. Klf5 is involved in self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Sci. 2008; 121: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and GFP expression was monitored at various time points during the differentiation process. As shown in Fig. 1A, the number of GFP-positive cells was significantly decreased in YAP KD since the very first step of differentiation (day 4), with respect to control KD (CTR KD) cells, transiently transfected with siRNA negative control duplex. Accordingly, at later stages (day 14), the differentiation process in YAP KD was incomplete, with a reduced number of cells expressing β3-tubulin (Fig. 1B). The expression profile of late marker genes also confirmed that the transient KD of YAP severely affects neuroectodermal differentiation (Fig. 1C). The expression profile of YAP over differentiation steps confirmed the transiency of YAP silencing, as its mRNA and protein levels returned at steady state at day 4 of differentiation (Fig. 1, D and E). Nevertheless, the consequences of YAP suppression lasted until the end of the differentiation protocol, strongly suggesting that YAP could play a role in ESCs or in the early steps of their differentiation process and that this activity is determinant for the following events. At this point, we explored the ability of YAP KD cells to differentiate toward the mesendodermal fate to address whether the transient downregulation of YAP expression in ESCs interferes specifically with the pathway of neuroectodermal differentiation or, instead, induces a general perturbation of the differentiation potential of ESCs. To this aim, we transiently transfected with YAP siRNAs, the E14Tg2a clone MLC2v–GFP, in which the expression of GFP is under control of the cardiomyocyte-specific promoter of MLC2v gene (14Testa G. Tarantino C. Parisi S. Galizia G. Passaro F. Della-Morte D. Abete P. Rengo F. Salvatore F. Pastore L. Serum withdrawal after embryoid body formation does not impair cardiomyocyte development from mouse embryonic stem cells.Cytotherapy. 2011; 13: 350-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). About 48 h after transfection, YAP KD cells were induced to differentiate into mesodermal derivatives by embryoid bodies formation in mesodermal culture conditions (15Navarra A. Musto A. Gargiulo A. Petrosino G. Pierantoni G.M. Fusco A. Russo T. Parisi S. Hmga2 is necessary for Otx2-dependent exit of embryonic stem cells from the pluripotent ground state.BMC Biol. 2016; 14: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Again, 8 days after the induction of differentiation, the number of GFP-positive cells was reduced in YAP KD cells (Fig. 1F), and, interestingly, although cardiomyocyte colonies from CTR KD cells showed the expected beating phenotype, almost no beating areas were found in YAP KD cells (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that the transient downregulation of YAP expression compromises the potential of undifferentiated ESCs to undertake differentiation properly. The partial inability of ESCs to undertake differentiation could be due, on the one hand, to premature loss of pluripotency or, on the contrary, to the persistence of stemness despite and after the induction of differentiation. To explore whether YAP plays some role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of ESCs, we transiently silenced YAP expression in E14Tg2a cells by siRNAs or shRNAs (Fig. S2A). After 48 h, KD cells were plated in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for a further 48 h, and RNA samples were analyzed to measure the expression of stemness marker genes. The results shown in Fig. 2A demonstrate that the expression profile of the main stemness markers was not affected by the transient silencing of YAP. These cells were also plated at low density and cultured for 7 more days in the presence of LIF and serum to examine the formation of AP+ colonies. As shown in Fig. 2B, both CTR and YAP KD cells were able to form AP+ colonies with a robust AP staining. However, a difference emerged in the total number of colonies derived from YAP KD cells, which was significantly lower than that of CTR KD (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis showed a certain degree of cell death 48 h after YAP silencing (Fig. 2C) but not so high to support the possibility that the observed decreased number of AP colonies and differentiated cells were exclusively because of cell death. To assess YAP KD cell viability during the early steps of differentiation, YAP KD cells were induced to differentiate toward neuroectodermal fate by the formation of serum-free embryoid bodies (SFEBs) (15Navarra A. Musto A. Gargiulo A. Petrosino G. Pierantoni G.M. Fusco A. Russo T. Parisi S. Hmga2 is necessary for Otx2-dependent exit of embryonic stem cells from the pluripotent ground state.BMC Biol. 2016; 14: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Trypan blue exclusion assay showed an increased number of nonvital cells among those in YAP KD SFEBs with respect to CTR KD SFEBs (Fig. 2D), which were probably responsible for the differences in the size of SFEBs as assessed by measuring the diameter of SFEBs (Fig. 2E), with YAP KD SFEBs appearing smaller than CTR KD SFEBs. Altogether, these results suggest that transient YAP silencing in undifferentiated ESCs causes a perturbation of cellular homeostasis leading to a reduced survival of cells. The latter can in part explain the decrease in the number of total cells when they are replated to examine self-renewal or differentiation. Nevertheless, surviving cells seem to be unable to differentiate properly, suggesting that the transient downregulation of YAP stably affect the signature of selected subpopulations of surviving cells. The phenotypes induced by the transient suppression of YAP are likely because of events that continue to exert their effects also after normal levels of YAP expression are restored. One possibility is that transient YAP silencing could be responsible for deregulation in genome-wide de novo methylation, which is known to take place upon the induction of ESC differentiation (16Petell C.J. Alabdi L. He M. San Miguel P. Rose R. Gowher H. An epigenetic switch regulates de novo DNA methylation at a subset of pluripotency gene enhancers during embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 7605-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Auclair G. Guibert S. Bender A. Weber M. Ontogeny of CpG island methylation and specificity of DNMT3 methyltransferases during embryonic development in the mouse.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we analyzed by bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) the methylation pattern of CTR and YAP KD cell in undifferentiated ESCs (T0) versus cells differentiated as SFEBs (T4). First of all, we analyzed the changes in genomic DNA methylation occurring in CTR cells upon 4 days of differentiation, compared with CTR cells at T0, finding 6661 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with a q value ≤0.05 (Table S1). Then, we performed the same analysis in YAP KD cell at T4 SFEBs with respect to T0, identifying 6898 DMRs (Table S1). Although the number of DMRs was similar in absolute terms between the two conditions, the transient suppression of YAP had a dramatic effect on genome methylation. As shown in Fig. 3A, about 30% of the 6661 DMRs observed in the differentiation of CTR cells led to a gain of methylation, compared with only 13% gain of methylation in the 6898 DMRs observed in YAP KD cells, whereas, on the other hand, most of the DMRs observed in YAP KD cells were loss of methylation (86.9% versus 69.8% in CTR cells), with some chromosomes particularly affected, as in the cases of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, and 14 (Fig. 3B). We then examined the loci showing differences between CTR and YAP KD cells and in particular the loci with differentiation-dependent loss of methylation in YAP KD cells and not in CTR cells and gain of methylation in CTR cells and not in YAP KD cells (Table S1). Considering DMRs with a q value of at least 0.05, there are 2325 loci where the loss of methylation was evident only in YAP KD cells and not in CTR cells and 1218 loci where, on the contrary, there is a gain of methylation in CTR cells and not in YAP KD cells. We retrieved the sets of genes closest to the DMRs and analyzed them by using the protein analysis through evolutionary relationships classification system platform for gene ontology (GO) (18Mi H. Muruganujan A. Huang X. Ebert D. Mills C. Guo X. Thomas P.D. Protocol Update for large-scale genome and gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system (v.14.0).Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14: 703-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed very significant overrepresentation of the Wnt signaling pathway, and the related cadherin pathway, for those genes where the loss of methylation emerged only in YAP KD cells (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrated that the transient downregulation of YAP affects the repatterning of de novo methylation occurring in the very early steps of the differentiation of ESCs. This might ultimately lead to the lack of appropriate governance of the epigenetic dynamics occurring at the exit from pluripotency. Considering that the phenotype we observed is caused by a transient downregulation of YAP, we decided to look at the expression profiles of ESCs 48 h after the transfection with YAP siRNAs, when YAP reaches the minimum levels. Total RNA was isolated from three independent samples each for YAP KD and CTR KD and analyzed by RNA-Seq. As shown in Fig. 4A, the expression of 1196 genes was significantly deregulated in YAP KD cells (p < 0.005; false discovery rate <0.05), with 54% of which resulted in downregulation (Table S2). In parallel, we also analyzed the gene expression profile of ESCs transfected with a YAP-encoding vector (OE YAP) or with the empty vector (OE CTR) (Fig. 4B), again using three independent biological samples. In this case, 488 transcripts were found overexpressed (73%) or underexpressed (27%), as a consequence of YAP ectopic expression (Table S2 and Fig. S3). The comparison between the KD and OE data sets showed that 215 genes were common to both sets, with 134 coherently downregulated in YAP KD cells and upregulated in YAP OE cells, and 46 showing the opposite behavior (Fig. 4C). Protein analysis through evolutionary relationships analysis of the most deregulated genes (0.6 < fold change [FC] > 1.7) in YAP KD cells revealed a statistically significant enrichment (false discovery rate < 0.05) in GO terms related to development and morphogenesis (Fig. 4D). Among the genes downregulated upon YAP KD and upregulated in YAP OE cells, we focused our attention on two genes that could have a role in the altered genome-wide methylation profile we observed in YAP KD cells. The first one is ephemeron (Eprn—D630045M09Rik), which encodes an lncRNA that modulates the dynamics of exit from naive pluripotency (19Li M.A. Amaral P.P. Cheung P. Bergmann J.H. Kinoshita M. Kalkan T. Ralser M. Robson S. von Meyenn F. Paramor M. Yang F. Chen C. Nichols J. Spector D.L. Kouzarides T. et al.A lncRNA fine tunes the dynamics of a cell state transition involving Lin28, let-7 and de novo DNA methylation.eLife. 2017; 6e23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was recently described that Eprn is expressed in undifferentiated mouse ESCs, and its rapid upregulation is crucial for transition of ESCs into Epiblast (19Li M.A. Amaral P.P. Cheung P. Bergmann J.H. Kinoshita M. Kalkan T. Ralser M. Robson S. von Meyenn F. Paramor M. Yang F. Chen C. Nichols J. Spector D.L. Kouzarides T. et al.A lncRNA fine tunes the dynamics of a cell state transition involving Lin28, let-7 and de novo DNA methylation.eLife. 2017; 6e23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Upon removal of 2i and LIF, Eprn deletion delays the extinction of ESC identity by reducing Lin28a expression, with the consequent persistence of let-7 microRNAs. In parallel, the upregulation of de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3a/b is delayed, which retards embryonic stem cell transition (19Li M.A. Amaral P.P. Cheung P. Bergmann J.H. Kinoshita M. Kalkan T. Ralser M. Robson S. von Meyenn F. Paramor M. Yang F. Chen C. Nichols J. Spector D.L. Kouzarides T. et al.A lncRNA fine tunes the dynamics of a cell state transition involving Lin28, let-7 and de novo DNA methylation.eLife. 2017; 6e23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our expression profile of YAP KD cells showed a slight but significant (p = 0.0042) decrease of Lin28a (Table S2). We first confirmed that, in our experimental conditions, Eprn was significantly downregulated in undifferentiated ESCs (Fig. 5A). We also observed that, although Eprn was induced in CTR cells 12 h after LIF removal, this induction was abolished entirely in YAP KD cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, the expression profiles of Lin28a and Lin28b, following LIF withdrawal, were altered in YAP KD cells, with an evident downregulation of Lin28a at T12 and Lin28b at T48. Although not statistically significant, we observed lower mRNA levels also for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in YAP KD cells versus CTR cells (Fig. 5B). Although RNA-Seq data and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays did not show significant changes in the expression of Dnmt3a or b, we found that their activating cofactor, Dnmt3l, was downregulated upon YAP KD and upregulated in YAP OE cells. Dnmt3l encodes a protein that, although lacking enzyme activity, cooperates during the embryo development with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, contributing to the de novo DNA methylation that governs the early steps of ESC differentiation (20Borgel J. Guibert S. Li Y. Chiba H. Schübeler D. Sasaki H. Forné T. Weber M. Targets and dynamics of promoter DNA methylation during early mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Of interest, Dnmt3l is also expressed in undifferentiated ESCs (21Veland N. Lu Y. Hardikar S. Gaddis S. Zeng Y. Liu B. Estecio M.R. Takata Y. Lin K. Tomida M.W. Shen J. Saha D. Gowher H. Zhao H. Chen T. DNMT3L facilitates DNA methylation partly by maintaining DNMT3A stability in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where it hampers the methylation of bivalent gene promoters by interacting with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (22Neri F. Krepelova A. Incarnato D. Maldotti M. Parlato C. Galvagni F. Matarese F. Stunnenberg H.G. Oliviero S. Dnmt3L antagonizes DNA methylation at bivalent promoters and favors DNA methylation at gene bodies in ESCs.Cell. 2013; 155: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We confirmed by qPCR that Dnmt3l was downregulated in ESCs by YAP KD and upregulated upon YAP OE (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, Dnmt3l protein was significantly decreased in YAP KD cells (Fig. 5C). As in the case of Eprn, the expression of Dnmt3l was induced 12 h after LIF withdrawal. However, this induction is not observed in YAP KD cells, where Dnmt3l levels remained very low during all the differentiation process (Fig. 5D). We addressed the question of whether Dnmt3l and/or Eprn are direct targets of YAP. In the experimental conditions we explored, the fraction of ESCs where YAP is clearly present in the nucleus is relatively low (about 20%), whereas nuclear YAP is undetectable in most, if not all, cells upon the induction to differentiation (Fig. S4, A and B). Thus, most of the nuclear effects of transient YAP KD should take place in the undifferentiated cells and/or in the very early steps of differentiation. To address this point, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiments for YAP were run in duplicate in undifferentiated ESCs. We identified 428 bona fide peaks (Table S3) whose transcription start site is located within 500 kbps from the peaks (Fig. S5A and Table S3). GO analysis revealed that putative target genes could be significantly clustered based on biological functions associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, chromatin silencing, as well as chromatin assembly and disassembly (Fig. S5B). By crossing ChIP-Seq with RNA-Seq data, we found 43 putative direct targets (Fig. 6A), which were deregulated by YAP KD or OE and located in the proximity (500 kbps) of significant ChIP peaks. Neither Dnmt3l nor Eprn genes showed significant peaks in the proximity of their transcription start site. However, relaxing the stringency threshold, we identified a peak in the second intron of Eprn gene (Fig. S6A). About 154 of 428 peaks from our data correspond to TEAD peaks present in published ChIP-Seq collections (23Croci O. De Fazio S. Biagioni F. Donato E. Caganova M. Curti L. Doni M. Sberna S. Aldeghi D. Biancotto C. Verrecchia A. Olivero D. Amati B. Campaner S. Transcriptional integration of mitogenic and mechanical signals by Myc and YAP.Genes Dev. 2017; 31: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Table S4), thus we decided to examine whether TEAD transcription factors could interact with YAP in the direct binding to the Epnr gene by ChIP assay, upon silencing of either TEAD1 or TEAD2 (Fig. S5C). As shown in Fig. 6B, we confirmed the binding of YAP to the peak in the second intron of Eprn gene. Moreover, the comparison between the amount of DNA immunoprecipitated in TEADs KD samples with respect to CTR KD revealed that this binding was TEAD dependent. The interaction between YAP and TEADs was confirmed also for a subset of selected peaks from our ChIP-Seq (Fig. S6B). In order to define the contribution of Dnmt3l and Eprn to the phenotype induced by YAP downregulation, α1T–GFP cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs producing a robust suppression of YAP, Dnmt3l, or Eprn expression (Fig. S7A). Two independent siRNAs for each target gene were used. Then, 48 h after transfection, KD cells were induced to differentiate toward the neuroectodermal fate. As shown in Fig. 7A, both Dnmt3l and Eprn transient suppression lead to a phenotype similar to that induced by YAP downregulation, indeed showing decreased number of cells expre"

We find that the total sentiment spillover among crude oil, gold and Bitcoin markets is time-varying and is greatly affected by major market events. The directional sentiment spillovers are also time-varying. On average, the Bitcoin market is the major transmitter of directional sentiment spillovers, whereas the crude oil and gold markets are the major receivers. In particular, the sentiment spillover effects are major created at high-frequency components, implying that the markets rapidly process the sentiment spillover effects and the shock is transmitted over the short-term. Moreover, we also find that the sentiment spillover effects differ significantly in term of intensity and direction when compared with return and volatility spillover effects. The present study has certain applications for investors and policymakers."

In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents ( e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations."

The in vitro and in vivo antifungal activities of UV mutants and characterization of the cyclic lipopeptides produced by a selected mutant were examined. A mutant strain yielding high levels of iturin showed over 2-fold higher antifungal activity than the wild-type against Fusarium oxysporum . A potent suppressive effect of the mutant was also observed on spore germination of Botrytis cinerea , the causative agent of cucumber gray mold, at different butanol extract concentrations. Further analysis of the mutant by real-time PCR and high-performance liquid chromatography revealed increased expression of iturin and surfactin biosynthesis genes as well as enhanced production of iturin and surfactin metabolites. However, the amounts of fengycin obtained from the mutant strain BSM54 were significantly lesser than those of iturin and surfactin. Particularly, iturin A production by the mutant was 3.5-fold higher than that of the wild-type, suggesting that the higher antifungal activity of the mutant against F . oxysporum resulted from the increased expression of biosynthesis genes associated with iturin production. The commercial greenhouse experiment using soil naturally infested with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (sclerotinia rot) and F . oxysporum (fusarium wilt) showed that the mutant strain reduced sclerotinia rot and fusarium wilt diseases ( P = 0.05) more effectively than the wild-type and commercially available product Cillus® in Korea. These results suggest that the mutant with high iturin yield is a potential candidate for the development of a biological control agent in agriculture."

However, whether brain networks connecting spatially distinct brain regions can explain individual differences in motor inhibition is not known. Therefore, we took a graph-theoretic perspective to examine the relationship between the properties of topological organization in functional brain networks and motor inhibition. We analyzed data from 141 healthy adults aged 20 to 78, who underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and performed a stop-signal task along with neuropsychological assessments outside the scanner. The graph-theoretic properties of 17 functional brain networks were estimated, including within-network connectivity and between-network connectivity. We employed multiple linear regression to examine how these graph-theoretical properties were associated with motor inhibition. The results showed that between-network connectivity of the salient ventral attention network and dorsal attention network explained the highest and second highest variance of individual differences in motor inhibition. In addition, we also found those two networks span over brain regions in the frontal-cingulate-parietal network, suggesting that these network interactions are also important to motor inhibition."

Sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) is one of the important vegetable oil supplies in the world. However, the information about WRKY genes in sunflower is limited. In this study, ninety HaWRKY genes were identified and renamed according to their locations on chromosomes. Further phylogenetic analyses classified them into four main groups including a species-specific WKKY group. Besides, HaWRKY genes within the same group or subgroup generally showed similar exon-intron structures and motif compositions. The gene duplication analysis showed that five pairs of HaWRKY genes ( HaWRKY8/9 , HaWRKY53/54 , HaWRKY65/66 , HaWRKY66/67 and HaWRKY71/72 ) are tandem duplicated and four HaWRKY gene pairs ( HaWRKY15/82 , HaWRKY25/65 , HaWRKY28/55 and HaWRKY50/53 ) are also identified as segmental duplication events, indicating that these duplication genes were contribute to the diversity and expansion of HaWRKY gene families. The dN/dS ratio of these duplicated gene pairs were also calculated to understand the evolutionary constraints. In addition, synteny analyses of sunflower WRKY genes provided deep insight to the evolution of HaWRKY genes. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analyses of HaWRKY genes displayed distinct expression patterns in different plant tissues, as well as under various abiotic and biotic stresses, which provide a foundation for further functional analyses of these genes. Those functional genes related to stress tolerance and quality improvement could be applied in marker assisted breeding of the crop."
https://openalex.org/W3109121179,"Island species and habitats are particularly vulnerable to human disturbances, and anthropogenic changes are increasingly overwriting natural island biogeographic patterns. However, quantitative comparisons of how native and alien assemblages respond to human disturbances are scarce. Using data from 6,242 species of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from 7,718 sites on 81 islands, we model how land-use change, human population density and distance to the nearest road affect local assemblages of alien and native species on islands. We found that land-use change reduces both richness and abundance of native species, whereas the number and abundance of alien species are high in plantation forests and agricultural or urban sites. In contrast to the long-established pattern for native species (i.e., decline in species number with island isolation), more isolated islands have more alien species across most land uses than do less isolated islands. We show that alien species play a major role in the turnover of island assemblages: our models show that aliens outnumber natives among the species present at disturbed sites but absent from minimally-disturbed primary vegetation. Finally, we found a homogenization pattern for both native and alien assemblages across sites within most land uses. The declines of native species on islands in the face of human pressures, and the particular proneness to invasions of the more remote islands, highlight the need to reduce the intensity of human pressures on islands and to prevent the introduction and establishment of alien species."

Methods 113 EP-patients aged 18–35 were recruited from the Treatment and Early Intervention in Psychosis Program [TIPP-Lausanne]. Body Mass Index [BMI], Weight Gain [WG] and Waist Circumference [WC] were measured prospectively at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months of weight gain inducing psychotropic treatment. Patients were classified as Early-Trauma and Late-Trauma if the exposure had occurred before age 12 or between ages 12 and 16 respectively. Generalized Linear Mixed-Models were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline BMI, medication and for diagnosis of depression. Results Late-Trauma patients, when compared to Non-Trauma patients showed greater WCs during the follow-up [p = 0.013]. No differences were found in any of the other follow-up measures. Conclusions Exposition to CT during adolescence in EP-patients treated with psychotropic medication is associated with greater WC during the early phase of the disease.

Environmental parameters including water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll a were measured per sampling event. Oysters homogenate and seawater samples were 10-fold serially diluted and directly plated on CHROMagarᵀᴹ Vibrio medium. Presumptive V . parahaemolyticus colonies were counted and at least 20% of these colonies were selected for molecular chracterization. V . parahaemolyticus isolates (n = 165) were screened for the presence of the species-specific thermolabile hemolysin ( tlh ) gene, the pathogenic thermostable direct hemolysin ( tdh )/ thermostable related hemolysin ( trh ) genes, the regulatory transmembrane DNA-binding gene ( toxR ), and V . parahaemolyticus metalloprotease ( vpm ) gene using a conventional PCR. The highest mean levels of the presumptive V . parahaemolyticus were 9.63×10 3 CFU/g and 1.85×10 3 CFU/mL in the oyster and seawater samples, respectively, during the month of July. V . parahaemolyticus levels in oyster and seawater samples were significantly positively correlated with water temperature. Of the 165 isolates, 137 (83%), 110 (66.7%), and 108 (65%) were tlh + , vpm + , and toxR + , respectively. Among the V . parahaemolyticus ( tlh + ) isolates, 7 (5.1%) and 15 (10.9%) were tdh + and trh + , respectively, and 24 (17.5%), only oyster isolates, were positive for both genes. Potential pathogenic strains that possessed tdh and/or trh were notably higher in oyster (39%) than seawater (15.6%) isolates. The occurrence of total V . parahaemolyticus ( tlh + ) was not necessarily proportional to the potential pathogenic V . parahaemolyticus . Co-occurrence of the five genetic markers were observed only among oyster isolates. The co-occurrence of the gene markers showed a relatedness potential of tdh occurrence with vpm . We believe exploring the role of V . parahaemolyticus metalloprotease and whether it is involved in the toxic activity of the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) protein can be of significance. The outcomes of this study will provide some foundation for future studies regarding pathogenic Vibrio dynamics in relation to environmental quality."
https://openalex.org/W3037134143,"In this study, the spread of virus infection was simulated using artificial human networks. Here, real-space urban life was modeled as a modified scale-free network with constraints. To date, the scale-free network has been adopted for modeling online communities in several studies. However, in the present study, it has been modified to represent the social behaviors of people where the generated communities are restricted and reflect spatiotemporal constraints in real life. Furthermore, the networks have been extended by introducing multiple cliques in the initial step of network construction and enabling people to contact hidden (zero-degree) as well as popular (large-degree) people. Consequently, four findings and a policy proposal were obtained. First, “second waves” were observed in some cases of the simulations even without external influence or constraints on people’s social contacts or the releasing of the constraints. These waves tend to be lower than the first wave and occur in “fresh” clusters, that is, via the infection of people who are connected in the network but have not been infected previously. This implies that the bridge between infected and fresh clusters may trigger a new spread of the virus. Second, if the network changes its structure on the way of infection spread or after its suppression, a second wave larger than the first can occur. Third, the peak height in the time series of the number of infected cases depends on the difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member actually meets and the number of people they choose to meet during the period of infection spread. This tendency is observed for the two kinds of artificial networks introduced here and implies the impact of bridges between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the release of a previously imposed constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time series without introducing any constraint so far previously, if the release is introduced at a time close to the peak. Thus, overall, both the government and individuals should be careful in returning to society where people enjoy free inter-community contact."
https://openalex.org/W3107776007,"The genetic mechanisms of childhood development in its many facets remain largely undeciphered. In the population of healthy infants studied in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) program, we have identified a range of dependencies among the observed phenotypes of fetal and early childhood growth, neurological development, and a number of genetic variants. We have quantified these dependencies using our information theory-based methods. The genetic variants show dependencies with single phenotypes as well as pleiotropic effects on more than one phenotype and thereby point to a large number of brain-specific and brain-expressed gene candidates. These dependencies provide a basis for connecting a range of variants with a spectrum of phenotypes (pleiotropy) as well as with each other. A broad survey of known regulatory expression characteristics, and other function-related information from the literature for these sets of candidate genes allowed us to assemble an integrated body of evidence, including a partial regulatory network, that points towards the biological basis of these general dependencies. Notable among the implicated loci are RAB11FIP4 (next to NF1), MTMR7 and PLD5, all highly expressed in the brain; DNMT1 (DNA methyl transferase), highly expressed in the placenta; and PPP1R12B and DMD (dystrophin), known to be important growth and development genes. While we cannot specify and decipher the mechanisms responsible for the phenotypes in this study, a number of connections for further investigation of fetal and early childhood growth and neurological development are indicated. These results and this approach open the door to new explorations of early human development."
https://openalex.org/W3107840886,"Vacuoles are acidic organelles that store FeIII polyphosphate, participate in iron homeostasis, and have been proposed to deliver iron to mitochondria for iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) and heme biosynthesis. Vma2Δ cells have dysfunctional V-ATPases, rendering their vacuoles nonacidic. These cells have mitochondria that are iron-dysregulated, suggesting disruption of a putative vacuole-to-mitochondria iron trafficking pathway. To investigate this potential pathway, we examined the iron content of a vma2Δ mutant derived from W303 cells using Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies and liquid chromatography interfaced with inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. Relative to WT cells, vma2Δ cells contained WT concentrations of iron but nonheme FeII dominated the iron content of fermenting and respiring vma2Δ cells, indicating that the vacuolar FeIII ions present in WT cells had been reduced. However, vma2Δ cells synthesized WT levels of ISCs/hemes and had normal aconitase activity. The iron content of vma2Δ mitochondria was similar to WT, all suggesting that iron delivery to mitochondria was not disrupted. Chromatograms of cytosolic flow–through solutions exhibited iron species with apparent masses of 600 and 800 Da for WT and vma2∆, respectively. Mutant cells contained high copper concentrations and high concentrations of a species assigned to metallothionein, indicating copper dysregulation. vma2Δ cells from previously studied strain BY4741 exhibited iron-associated properties more consistent with prior studies, suggesting subtle strain differences. Vacuoles with functional V-ATPases appear unnecessary in W303 cells for iron to enter mitochondria and be used in ISC/heme biosynthesis; thus, there appears to be no direct or dedicated vacuole-to-mitochondria iron trafficking pathway.

Vacuoles are acidic organelles in fungi and plants that are evolutionarily connected to endosomes and lysosomes in humans. Their acidity is essential for sequestering and storing iron and for participating in cellular iron homeostasis (1Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z.W. Silar P. Thiele D.J.

The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a membrane-bound multisubunit complex that pumps protons from the cytosol into the vacuole.

In contrast, vacuoles of WT cells treated equivalently remained at pH 5.9. V-ATPases consist of two subcomplexes including a peripheral membrane subcomplex V1 and an integral membrane complex Vo. In yeast, V-ATPases are found in vacuolar membranes or vacuole–mitochondria contact sites. Inactivation or deletion of any component subunit leads to a similar mutant phenotype characterized by reduced replicative lifespan, decreased inorganic polyphosphates, sensitivity to oxidative stress, and iron dysregulation. VMA2 encodes subunit B of the V1 subcomplex; the knockout is viable although it lacks V-ATPase activity. Iron-replete WT vacuoles contain high (mM) concentrations of polyphosphate that coordinate FeIII ions (10Cockrell A.L. Holmes-Hampton G.P. McCormick S.P. Chakrabarti M. Lindahl P.A.

Genet. 2018; 64: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a process that depends on the proton gradient generated by V-ATPase. Without this gradient, vma mutants are deficient in polyphosphate ions and are less able to store iron (15Trilisenko L. Tomashevsky A. Kulakovskaya T. Kulaev I.

Thus, polyphosphate ions and protons both impact vacuolar iron metabolism. Iron homeostasis in yeast involves about two dozen genes called the iron regulon (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Iron-regulated DNA binding by the AFT1 protein controls the iron regulon in yeast.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These genes are activated when mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly is compromised (18Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R.

For example, this condition is evident in strains that are deficient in yeast frataxin homolog 1 (Yfh1) (19Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A.B. Camadro J.M. Dancis A.

These cells respond to iron regulon activation by importing excess iron and mobilizing vacuolar iron stores. The iron regulon is activated in vma2Δ cells grown in iron-replete (μM range) media even though their mitochondria are not deficient in proteins involved in ISC assembly (22Milgrom E. Diab H.

This implies that mitochondria cannot assemble sufficient ISCs when the vacuolar lumen is insufficiently acidic, and it highlights an intriguing connection between the two organelles. vma2Δ cells have reduced activities of mitochondrial ISC-containing proteins that are involved in respiration, including aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, and the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (23Diab H.I.

Cysteine toxicity drives age-related mitochondrial decline by altering iron homeostasis.Cell. 2020; 180: 296-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Excess supplemented iron provides the additional iron needed for the biosynthesis of iron-rich mitochondria which are in turn needed for respiration. This requirement is uncompromising, even in WT cells, such that cells grown on iron-deficient minimal medium (MM) succumb to autophagy so that they can recycle sufficient cellular iron for use in mitochondriogenesis (27Horie T. Kawamata T. Matsunami M. Ohsumi Y. Recycling of iron via autophagy is critical for the transition from glycolytic to respiratory growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 8533-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). During autophagy, Smf3 and Fet5/Fth1 iron exporters on the vacuolar membrane pump iron into the cytosol to satisfy mitochondrial demand. Iron-deficient vma mutants have difficulty undergoing autophagy which hinders respiration (27Horie T. Kawamata T. Matsunami M. Ohsumi Y. Recycling of iron via autophagy is critical for the transition from glycolytic to respiratory growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 8533-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When the iron regulon is activated in ISC-mutant cells, the rate of cellular iron import increases dramatically owing to expression of a high-affinity iron importer (composed of Fet3 and Ftr1) on the plasma membrane. Expression of the high-affinity vacuolar iron exporter (composed of Fet5 and Fth1) also increases. Fet3 and Fet5 are paralogous multicopper oxidases controlled by the iron regulon. As a result, the vacuoles of ISC-mutant cells are nearly devoid of iron, and much of the excess iron that flows into the cytosol ultimately accumulates in mitochondria as FeIII oxyhydroxide phosphate–associated nanoparticles (19Lesuisse E. Santos R. Matzanke B.F. Knight S.A.B. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Iron use for haeme synthesis is under control of the yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1).Hum. Mol.

Biophysical characterization of the iron in mitochondria from Atm1p-depleted Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9556-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). vma-mutant cells have difficulty importing extracellular iron because copper-containing Fet3 has difficulty maturing (i.e., metallating with copper) in the Golgi (1Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z.W. Silar P. Thiele D.J.

Whether these cells also have difficulty exporting vacuolar iron is unknown, but this seems likely, given the similarities between Fet3 and Fet5. In any event, the concentration of iron in vma-mutant cells is not excessive relative to WT cells even though the iron regulon is activated. vma2Δ cells reportedly contain only ∼30% more iron than WT cells (23Diab H.I. Kane P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 11366-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, ISC mutants contain an order-of-magnitude more iron than WT cells. The mechanism by which a decline in the acidity of vacuoles causes a decline of mitochondrial function, and how excessive iron rescues this decline, has been investigated by Kane (23Diab H.I. Kane P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2.J. Biol.

Cysteine toxicity drives age-related mitochondrial decline by altering iron homeostasis.Cell. 2020; 180: 296-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both hypothesize that the flow of iron from vacuoles to mitochondria is disrupted in vma-mutant cells and that excess media iron re-establishes this pathway. Besides sequestering iron, vacuoles store amino acids, including cysteine (29Winter G. Cordente A.G. Curtin C. Formation of hydrogen sulfide from cysteine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742: genome wide screen reveals a central role of the vacuole.PLoS One. 2014; 9e113869Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).

One intriguing possibility is that excess cysteine in the cytosol binds iron, thereby blocking import into mitochondria. vma mutants generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are hypersensitive to oxidative stress (5Kane P.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7125-7136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rather, excessive ROS is likely associated with iron dyshomeostasis and increased Fenton chemistry (5Kane P.M. The long physiological reach of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Bioenerg.

Also surprising is that the relationship between vacuolar acidity, cellular iron, mitochondrial function, and ROS damage is related to human aging and longevity. Hughes and Gottschling found that a decline of vacuolar acidity is associated with age-related deterioration of mitochondria (34Hughes A.L. Gottschling D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast.Nature. 2012; 492: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Overexpressing V-ATPase subunits suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction in aging cells by hyperacidifying vacuoles. Young yeast cells treated with a V-ATPase inhibitor and mutant cells lacking V-ATPase subunits both have impaired mitochondrial morphology similar to the organelle in aged cells (34Hughes A.L. Gottschling D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast.Nature. 2012; 492: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to better understand the connection between vacuolar acidity, mitochondrial function, and iron homeostasis by using powerful biophysical and bioanalytical probes, namely Mössbauer (MB) and EPR spectroscopies and liquid chromatography interfaced with inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS). Mitochondria, vacuoles, and the cytosol of vma2Δ cells were isolated and investigated. Our results confirm and extend some but not all relevant previous results, with differences probably due to the background strains and media/conditions used. New insights into the connection between vacuoles and mitochondria are presented, highlighting the potential importance of low-molecular-mass (LMM) iron, copper, and sulfur species in the cytosol of these yeast cells. A haploid VMA2 deletion strain was generated from a W303 parent to allow for direct comparison to previous biophysical studies that used the same genetic background (10Cockrell A.L.

We refer to W303 and the mutant strain as WT and vma2ΔW, respectively. We initially investigated whether the iron content of these two strains differed and whether the pH of the medium influenced that content. WT and vma2ΔW cells were grown in MM containing 2% glucose as the carbon source (fermentation) and supplemented with iron (typically 40 μM 57FeIII citrate). Medium pH was buffered using citric acid and sodium citrate. Under these conditions, vma2ΔW cells grew well at pH values 3, 4, and 5 although growth was inhibited when the medium pH was 6 or 7; in contrast, WT cells grew well in media buffered from pH 3 to 7. Whole-cell iron concentrations (Table 1) revealed no obvious pH dependence; however, some strain-dependent trends were evident. vma2ΔW cells contained 30% less iron, 60% less phosphorus, 6× less manganese, 4× less zinc, and 2.5× more copper than WT cells.

https://openalex.org/W3109238596,"Motivation Access to biological sequence data, such as genome, transcript, or protein sequence, is at the core of many bioinformatics analysis workflows. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Ensembl, and other sequence database maintainers provide methods to access sequences through network connections. For many users, the convenience and currency of remotely managed data are compelling, and the network latency is non-consequential. However, for high-throughput and clinical applications, local sequence collections are essential for performance, stability, privacy, and reproducibility. Results Here we describe SeqRepo, a novel system for building a local, high-performance, non-redundant collection of biological sequences. SeqRepo enables clients to use primary database identifiers and several digests to identify sequences and sequence alises. SeqRepo provides a native Python interface and a REST interface, which can run locally and enables access from other programming languages. SeqRepo also provides an alternative REST interface based on the GA4GH refget protocol. SeqRepo provides fast random access to sequence slices. We provide results that demonstrate that a local SeqRepo sequence collection yields significant performance benefits of up to 1300-fold over remote sequence collections. In our use case for a variant validation and normalization pipeline, SeqRepo improved throughput 50-fold relative to use with remote sequences. SeqRepo may be used with any species or sequence type. Regular snapshots of Human sequence collections are available. It is often convenient or necessary to use a computed digest as a sequence identifier. For example, a digest-based identifier may be used to refer to proprietary reference genomes or segments of a graph genome, for which conventional identifiers will not be available. Here we also introduce a convention for the application of the SHA-512 hashing algorithm with Base64 encoding to generate URL-safe identifiers. This convention, sha512t24u , combines a fast digest mechanism with a space-efficient representation that can be used for any object. Our report includes an analysis of timing and collision probabilities for sha512t24u . SeqRepo enables clients to use sha512t24u as identifiers, thereby seamlessly integrating public and private sequence sets. Availability SeqRepo is released under the Apache License 2.0 and is available on github and PyPi. Docker images and database snapshots are also available.

https://openalex.org/W3106562434,"In the process of software development, regression testing is one of the major activities that is done after making modifications in the current system or whenever a software system evolves. But, the test suite size increases with the addition of new test cases and it becomes in-efficient because of the occurrence of redundant, broken, and obsolete test cases. For that reason, it results in additional time and budget to run all these test cases. Many researchers have proposed computational intelligence and conventional approaches for dealing with this problem and they have achieved an optimized test suite by selecting, minimizing or reducing, and prioritizing test cases. Currently, most of these optimization approaches are single objective and static in nature. But, it is mandatory to use multi-objective dynamic approaches for optimization due to the advancements in information technology and associated market challenges. Therefore, we have proposed three variants of self-tunable Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System i.e. TLBO-ANFIS, FA-ANFIS, and HS-ANFIS, for multi-objective regression test suites optimization. Two benchmark test suites are used for evaluating the proposed ANFIS variants. The performance of proposed ANFIS variants is measured using Standard Deviation and Root Mean Square Error. A comparison of experimental results is also done with six existing methods i.e. GA-ANFIS, PSO-ANFIS, MOGA, NSGA-II, MOPSO, and TOPSIS and it is concluded that the proposed method effectively reduces the size of regression test suite without a reduction in the fault detection rate."
https://openalex.org/W3108293184,"Wild species of Gossypium ssp. are an important source of traits for improving commercial cotton cultivars. Previous reports show that Gossypium herbaceum L. and Gossypium nelsonii Fryx. have better disease resistance characteristics than commercial cotton varieties. However, chromosome ploidy and biological isolation make it difficult to hybridize diploid species with the tetraploid Gossypium hirsutum L. We developed a new allotetraploid cotton genotype (A 1 A 1 G 3 G 3 ) using a process of distant hybridization within wild cotton species to create new germplasms. First of all, G . herbaceum and G . nelsonii were used for interspecific hybridization to obtain F 1 generation. Afterwards, apical meristems of the F 1 diploid cotton plants were treated with colchicine to induce chromosome doubling. The new interspecific F 1 hybrid and S 1 cotton plants originated from chromosome duplication, were tested via morphological and molecular markers and confirmed their tetraploidy through flowrometric and cytological identification. The S 1 tetraploid cotton plants was crossed with a TM-1 line and fertile hybrid offspring were obtained. These S 2 offsprings were tested for resistance to Verticillium wilt and demonstrated adequate tolerance to this fungi. The results shows that the new S 1 cotton line could be used as parental material for hybridization with G . hirsutum to produce pathogen-resistant cotton hybrids. This new S 1 allotetraploid genotype will contributes to the enrichment of Gossypium germplasm resources and is expected to be valuable in polyploidy evolutionary studies."
https://openalex.org/W3108812001,"Endophilin plays key roles during endocytosis of cellular receptors, including generating membrane curvature to drive internalization. Electrostatic interactions between endophilin's BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs domain and anionic membrane lipids have been considered the major driving force in curvature generation. However, the SH3 domain of endophilin also interacts with the proline-rich third intracellular loop (TIL) of various G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and it is unclear whether this interaction has a direct role in generating membrane curvature during endocytosis. To examine this, we designed model membranes with a membrane density of 1400 receptors per μm2 represented by a covalently conjugated TIL region from the β1-adrenergic receptor. We observed that TIL recruits endophilin to membranes composed of 95 mol% of zwitterionic lipids via the SH3 domain. More importantly, endophilin recruited via TIL tubulates vesicles and gets sorted onto highly curved membrane tubules. These observations indicate that the cellular membrane bending and curvature sensing activities of endophilin can be facilitated through detection of the TIL of activated GPCRs in addition to binding to anionic lipids. Furthermore, we show that TIL electrostatically interacts with membranes composed of anionic lipids. Therefore, anionic lipids can modulate TIL/SH3 domain binding. Overall, our findings imply that an interplay between TIL, charged membrane lipids, BAR domain, and SH3 domain could exist in the biological system and that these components may act in coordination to regulate the internalization of cellular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3110155144,"Although sites for clinical or experimental islet transplantation are well established, pancreatic islet survival and function in these locations remain unsatisfactory. A possible factor that might account for this outcome is local hypoxia caused by the limited blood supply. Here, we modified a prevascularized tissue-engineered chamber (TEC) that facilitated the viability and function of the seeded islets in vivo by providing a microvascular network prior to transplantation. TECs were created, filled with Growth Factor-Matrigel ™ (Matrigel ™ ) and then implanted into the groins of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The degree of microvascularization in each TECs was analyzed by histology, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Three hundred syngeneic islets were seeded into each chamber on days 0, 14, and 28 post-chamber implantation, and 300, 200, or 100 syngeneic islets were seeded into additional chambers on day 28 post-implantation, respectively. Furthermore, allogeneic or xenogeneic islet transplantation is a potential solution for organ shortage. The feasibility of TECs as transplantation sites for islet allografts or xenografts and treatment with anti-CD45RB and/or anti-CD40L (MR-1) was therefore explored. A highly developed microvascularized network was established in each TEC on day 28 post-implantation. Normalization of blood glucose levels in diabetic mice was negatively correlated with the duration of prevascularization and the number of seeded syngeneic islets. Combined treatment with anti-CD45RB and MR-1 resulted in long-term survival of the grafts following allotransplantation (5/5, 100%) and xenotransplantation (16/20, 80%). Flow cytometry demonstrated that the frequency of CD4 + Foxp3-Treg and CD4 + IL-4 + -Th2 cells increased significantly after tolerogenic xenograft transplantation, while the number of CD4+IFN-γ-Th1 cells decreased. These findings demonstrate that highly developed microvascularized constructs can facilitate the survival of transplanted islets in a TECs, implying its potential application as artificial pancreas in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3107179393,"Introduction The prevalence of obesity-related disorders has been steadily increasing over the past couple of decades. Diseases that were once only detected in adults are now prevalent in children, such as hyperlipidemia. The adipose tissue-derived hormonal factor C1q TNF Related Protein 3 (CTRP3) has been linked to triglyceride regulation especially in animal models. However, the relationship between circulating CTRP3 levels and obesity-related disorders in human subjects is controversial. CTRP3 can circulate in different oligomeric complexes: trimeric (&lt;100 kDa), middle molecular weight (100–300 kDa), and high molecular weight (HMW) oligomeric complexes (&gt;300 kDa). Previous work has identified that it is not the total amount of CTRP3 present in the serum, but the specific circulating oligomeric complexes that appear to be indicative of the relationship between CTRP3 and serum lipids levels. However, this work has not been examined in children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the levels of different oligomeric complexes of CTRP3 and circulating lipid levels among young children (aged 7–10 years). Methods Morphometric data and serum samples were collected and analyzed from a cross-sectional population of 62 children of self-identified Hispanic origin from a community health center, between 2015 and 2016. Serum analysis included adiponectin, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, glucagon, C-reactive peptide, triglyceride, cholesterol, IL-6, TNF, and CTRP3. Correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between CTRP3 and other biomarkers. Results Total CTRP3 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Whereas, HMW CTRP3 was not significantly associated with any variable measured. Conversely, the middle molecular weight (MMW) CTRP3 was negatively correlated with triglycerides levels, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), insulin, and body mass index (BMI). The negative correlations between MMW CTRP3 and triglycerides and VLDLs were particularly strong (r 2 = -0.826 and -0.827, respectively). Conclusion Overall, these data indicate that the circulating oligomeric state of CTRP3 and not just total CTRP3 level is important for understanding the association between CTRP3 and metabolic diseases. Further, this work indicates that MMW CTRP3 plays an important role in triglyceride and VLDL regulation which requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W3106908816,"The presence of ascites in the peritoneal cavity leads to morphological and functional changes of the peritoneal mesothelial cell layer. Cells loose cell-cell interactions, rearrange their cytoskeleton, activate the production of fibronectin, and change their cell surface morphology in a proinflammatory environment. Moreover, ovarian cancer cell adhesion has been shown to be facilitated by these changes due to increased integrin- and CD44-mediated binding sites. In this study, the biological responsiveness of the human pleural mesothelial cell line MeT-5A to patient-derived and artificial ascites was studied in vitro and adhesion of ovarian cancer cells, i.e. SKOV-3 cells, investigated. Changes were mainly observed in cells exposed to artificial ascites containing higher cytokine concentrations than patient-derived ascites. Interestingly, reduced cell-cell interactions were already observed in untreated MeT-5A cells and effects on tight junction protein expression and permeability upon exposure to ascites were minor. Ascites induced upregulation of CDC42 effector protein 2 expression, which affects stress fiber formation, however significant F-actin reorganization was not observed. Moreover, fibronectin production remained unchanged. Analysis of mesothelial cell surface characteristics showed upregulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, slightly increased hyaluronic acid secretion and decreased microvillus expression upon exposure to ascites. Nevertheless, the observed changes were not sufficient to facilitate adhesion of SKOV-3 cells on MeT-5A cell layer. This study revealed that MeT-5A cells show a reduced biological responsiveness to the presence of ascites, in contrast to published studies on primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3109578833,"Dairy farming systems are evolving. This study presents dairy producers’ perceptions of their ideal future farm ( IFF ) to ensure revenue, and attempts to determine the reasons for this choice, the environmental aspects related to this choice, the proximity between the current farm and the IFF and the requirements for reaching this IFF. Just before the end of the European milk quota, a total of 245 Walloon dairy producers answered a survey about the characteristics of their IFF and other socio-environmental-economic information. A multiple correspondence analysis ( MCA ) was carried out using seven characteristics of the IFF (intensive vs . extensive, specialised vs . diversified, strongly vs . weakly based on new technologies, managed by a group of managers vs . an independent farmer, employed vs . familial workforce, local vs . global market, standard vs . quality-differentiated production) to observe the relationships between them. Based on the main contributors to the second dimension of the MCA, this axis was defined as an IFF gradient between the local-based extensive ( LBE ) producers (26%) and the global-based intensive ( GBI ) producers (46%). The differences of IFF gradient between modalities of categorical variables were estimated using generalised linear models. Pearson correlations were calculated between the scores on the IFF gradient and quantitative variables. Finally, frequencies of IFF characteristics and the corresponding characteristic for the current situation were calculated to determine the percentages of “unhappy” producers. Some reasons for the choice of IFF by the producers have been highlighted in this study. Environmental initiatives were more valued by LBE than GBI producers. Low similarity was observed between the current farm situation of the respondents and their IFF choice. LBE and GBI producers differed significantly regarding domains of formation (technical and bureaucratic vs . transformation and diversification respectively) and paths of formation (non-market vs . market respectively). Two kinds of farming systems were considered by dairy producers and some socioeconomic and environmental components differed between them."
https://openalex.org/W3106577701,"This study describes, for the first time, the experimental and computational investigations for evaluation of kolliphor RH 40 as a fluorescence enhancer surfactant in development of a spectrofluorimetric method for determination of lapatinib (LAP), a tyrosine kinase-inhibitor drug approved for targeted therapy of breast cancer. The investigations involved the ability of kolliphor RH 40 to form micelles with LAP and its enhancing effect on the weak native fluorescence of LAP at 420 nm after its excitation at 292 nm. Different variables were experimentally investigated: types of organized media, diluting solvent, buffer type and its pH value. The optimum values of the most influencing variables on the interaction of kolliphor RH 40 with LAP were refined by the computational response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimized conditions, it was found that kolliphor RH 40 forms micelles with LAP, and its fluorescence enhancing ability was higher than other surfactants tested by ~ 10-folds. This micellar-enhanced effect of kolliphor RH 40 was employed in the development of a new sensitive spectrofluorimetric method for the accurate determination of LAP. The method was validated according to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) for validation of analytical procedures. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) was in excellent linear relationship (correlation coefficient was 0.998) with the LAP concentrations in the range of 50–1000 ng/mL. The method limit of detection (LOD) was 27.31 ng/mL and its accuracy was ≥ 99.82%. The method was successfully applied to the determination of LAP in its pharmaceutical tablets, tablets dissolution testing and content uniformity. The method application was extended to the determination of LAP in urine samples with an accuracy of 99.82 ± 3.45%. The method is considered as an eco-friendly green approach and more efficient alternative method to the existing analytical methodologies for determination of LAP."

Although anecdotal data suggest widely varying practices in the diagnosis and management of food allergies, the diversity and relative frequency of these practices have not been documented. Methods A questionnaire was developed evaluating allergists’ management approaches of individuals with peanut allergy (PA) in Germany (DE), France (FR), and the United Kingdom (UK). Results Here, we report the survey results from a total of 109 allergists from DE, FR and the UK. They reported to confirm PA at initial diagnosis using skin prick test (≥60%), while allergists from DE and FR reported using allergen-specific IgE testing more (&gt;86%) compared to the UK (&lt;50%). At initial diagnosis, oral food challenge was used less in DE (13%) and FR (14%) and very rarely in the UK (3%) to confirm diagnosis. Recognition of acute reactions, use of adrenaline auto-injectors and allergen avoidance were reported to be discussed with the patient/caregiver at the initial office visit by most allergists (&gt;75%). Half of the responders reported assessing the patient’s quality of life. 63% allergists reported retesting for PA resolution at a later date, with 45% allergists indicated to recommend ingestion of a normal serving of peanut regularly upon resolution. Lack of effective PA treatment was reported to be a ‘very significant’ barrier for optimal PA treatment, with allergists being less than ‘moderately familiar’ with data from clinical trials testing new treatments options for PA. Lastly, allergists stated that the severity of patient’s PA ranked as the most important factor in their decision to recommend oral immunotherapy for PA treatment. Conclusions This survey provides essential insights into the practice of allergists and highlights some areas that would inform strategies for education and improving PA healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3108936506,"Background This study investigated the effect of accumulated doses on radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeters (RPLGDs) from measurements involving mega-voltage photons. Methods Forty-five commercially available RPLGDs were irradiated to estimate their dose responses. Photon beams of 6, 10, and 15 MV were irradiated onto the RPLGDs inside a phantom, which were divided into five groups with different doses and energies. Groups 1 and 2 were irradiated at 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 Gy in a sequential manner; Group 3 was irradiated 10 times with a dose of 10 Gy; and Groups 4 and 5 followed the same method as that of Group 3, but with doses of 50 Gy and 100 Gy, respectively. Each device was subjected to a measurement reading procedure each time irradiation. Results For the annealed Group 1, RPLGD exhibited a linearity response with variance within 5%. For the non-annealed Group 2, readings demonstrated hyperlinearity at 6 MV and 10 MV, and linearity at 15 MV. Following the 100 Gy irradiation, the readings for Group 2 were 118.7 ± 1.9%, 112.2 ± 2.7%, and 101.5 ± 2.3% at 6, 10, and 15 MV, respectively. For Groups 3, 4, and 5, the responsiveness of the RPLGDs gradually decreased as the number of repeated irradiations increased. The percentage readings for the 10th beam irradiation with respect to the readings for the primary beam irradiation were 84.6 ± 1.9%, 87.5 ± 2.4%, and 93.0 ± 3.0% at 6 MV, 10 MV, and 15 MV, respectively. Conclusions The non-annealed RPLGD response to dose was hyperlinear for the 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams but not for the 15 MV photon beam. Additionally, the annealed RPLGD exhibited a fading phenomenon when the measurement was repeated several times and demonstrated a relatively large fading effect at low energies than at high energies."
https://openalex.org/W3109642651,"Adoption of a new technology depends on many factors. Marketing, advertising, social interactions, and personal convictions are relevant features when deciding to adopt, or not, a new technology. Thus, it is very important to determine the relative weight of these factors when introducing a new technology. Here we discuss an agent based model to investigate the behavior of agents exposed to advertising and social contacts. Agents may follow the social pressure, or maybe contrarians, acting against the majority, to decide if they adopt or not a new technology. First, we solve analytically the model that relies on the above quoted factors. Then, we compare the theoretical results with empirical data concerning the adoption of innovations by American households during the 20th century. The analysis of the diffusion dynamics process is done either for the whole period, or by periods based on the so-called technical-economic paradigms, according to Freeman and Perez. Three different periods are considered: before 1920, from 1920 to 1970, and after 1970. We study the evolution of the model parameters for each technical-economic period. Finally, by adjusting the key parameters we are able to collapse all the data into a universal curve that describes all the adoption processes."
https://openalex.org/W3107055076,"Introduction Pregnancy planning varies among women with diabetes. Observing that the literature examining the factors affecting diabetic women’s pregnancy intentions in multi-ethnic Asian populations is limited, we sought to explore these factors to give a better perspective on these women’s pregnancy planning. Methods This qualitative study used individual in-depth interviews to capture the views and experiences of non-pregnant diabetic women of reproductive age in four public health clinics in a southwestern state of peninsular Malaysia from May 2016 to February 2017. The participants were purposively sampled according to ethnicity and were interviewed using a semi-structured topic guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, and transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results From the 33 interviews that were analysed, four important factors influencing participants’ decisions regarding pregnancy planning were identified. Participants’ perception of poor pregnancy outcomes due to advanced age and medical condition was found to have an impact. However, despite these fears and negative relationships with doctors, personal, family and cultural influences supported by religious ‘up to God’ beliefs took centre stage in the pregnancy intention of some participants. Participants demonstrated a variety of understandings of pregnancy planning. They outlined some activities for pregnancy preparation, although many also reported limited engagement with pre-pregnancy care. Conclusions This study emphasised the known dilemma experienced by diabetic women considering their desire for an ideal family structure against their perceived pregnancy risks, heterogeneous religious beliefs and the impact of cultural demands on pregnancy intention. This study urges healthcare providers to increase their engagement with the women in pregnancy planning in a more personalised approach."
