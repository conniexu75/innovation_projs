https://openalex.org/W2144235090,"The nutrient- and growth factor-responsive kinase mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates many processes that control growth, including protein synthesis, autophagy, and lipogenesis. Through unknown mechanisms, mTORC1 promotes the function of SREBP, a master regulator of lipo- and sterolgenic gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 regulates SREBP by controlling the nuclear entry of lipin 1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Dephosphorylated, nuclear, catalytically active lipin 1 promotes nuclear remodeling and mediates the effects of mTORC1 on SREBP target gene, SREBP promoter activity, and nuclear SREBP protein abundance. Inhibition of mTORC1 in the liver significantly impairs SREBP function and makes mice resistant, in a lipin 1-dependent fashion, to the hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia induced by a high-fat and -cholesterol diet. These findings establish lipin 1 as a key component of the mTORC1-SREBP pathway.PaperClip/cms/asset/6f07869a-4036-4fa5-aaa5-6e470dac31aa/mmc1.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.05 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2154156417,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) regulates many cell physiological processes such as the internalization of growth factors and receptors, entry of pathogens, and synaptic transmission. Within the endocytic network, clathrin functions as a central organizing platform for coated pit assembly and dissociation via its terminal domain (TD). We report the design and synthesis of two compounds named pitstops that selectively block endocytic ligand association with the clathrin TD as confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Pitstop-induced inhibition of clathrin TD function acutely interferes with receptor-mediated endocytosis, entry of HIV, and synaptic vesicle recycling. Endocytosis inhibition is caused by a dramatic increase in the lifetimes of clathrin coat components, including FCHo, clathrin, and dynamin, suggesting that the clathrin TD regulates coated pit dynamics. Pitstops provide new tools to address clathrin function in cell physiology with potential applications as inhibitors of virus and pathogen entry and as modulators of cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2166919094,"Background Despite over forty years of investigation on low-level light therapy (LLLT), the fundamental mechanisms underlying photobiomodulation at a cellular level remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we isolated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from transgenic NF-kB luciferase reporter mice and studied their response to 810 nm laser radiation. Significant activation of NF-kB was observed at fluences higher than 0.003 J/cm2 and was confirmed by Western blot analysis. NF-kB was activated earlier (1 hour) by LLLT compared to conventional lipopolysaccharide treatment. We also observed that LLLT induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production similar to mitochondrial inhibitors, such as antimycin A, rotenone and paraquat. Furthermore, we observed similar NF-kB activation with these mitochondrial inhibitors. These results, together with inhibition of laser induced NF-kB activation by antioxidants, suggests that ROS play an important role in the laser induced NF-kB signaling pathways. However, LLLT, unlike mitochondrial inhibitors, induced increased cellular ATP levels, which indicates that LLLT also upregulates mitochondrial respiration. Conclusion We conclude that LLLT not only enhances mitochondrial respiration, but also activates the redox-sensitive NFkB signaling via generation of ROS. Expression of anti-apoptosis and pro-survival genes responsive to NFkB could explain many clinical effects of LLLT."

The BMP-induced trophoblast phenotype is a long-standing paradox in stem cell biology. Here we readdressed BMP function in hESCs and mouse epiblast-derived cells. We found that BMP4 cooperates with FGF2 (via ERK) to induce mesoderm and to inhibit endoderm differentiation. These conditions induced cells with high levels of BRACHYURY (BRA) that coexpressed CDX2. BRA was necessary for and preceded CDX2 expression; both genes were essential for expression not only of mesodermal genes but also of trophoblast-associated genes. Maximal expression of the latter was seen in the absence of FGF but these cells coexpressed mesodermal genes and moreover they differed in cell surface and epigenetic properties from placental trophoblast. We conclude that BMP induces human and mouse pluripotent stem cells primarily to form mesoderm, rather than trophoblast, acting through BRA and CDX2.

BMP+FGF induces ESCs to express BRAhi/CDX2+ while Activin+FGF induces BRAlow/SOX17+ BRA and CDX2 are required for mesoderm- and trophoblast-associated gene expression Epigenetic and surface features discern BMP-treated hESCs from in vivo trophoblast BMP-treated hESCs expressing trophoblast-associated genes coexpress mesoderm genes The mesoderm lineage gives rise to the heart, blood, muscle, kidney, and components of most other somatic tissues, plus placental mesenchyme. Cell-based therapy and disease modeling of any of these derivatives thus relies on a thorough understanding of mesodermal origins. Embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm, together with definitive endoderm, emerge during gastrulation via an epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epiblast cells at the primitive streak. In the mouse, epiblast cells poised to enter the distal primitive streak are subject to high Nodal signaling and contribute to definitive endoderm. More proximal epiblast cells are subject to high bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and contribute extensively to mesoderm, including extraembryonic mesoderm, which will form the umbilical cord, the placental mesenchyme, and components of the yolk sack and amnion (Lawson et al., 1991Lawson K.A.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a promising alternative system for understanding the mechanisms controlling early human development. Studies of hESCs have already provided unequivocal evidence for an endoderm-inducing effect of Activin (D'Amour et al., 2005D'Amour K.A. Agulnick A.D. Eliazer S. Kelly O.G. Kroon E. Baetge E.E.

However, BMP4 also induces the expression of genes associated with trophoblast (Xu et al., 2002Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat.

Smithers L.E. Trotter M. Rugg-Gunn P. Weber A. Pedersen R.A. Early cell fate decisions of human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells are controlled by the same signalling pathways.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and it cooperates with Activin to induce differentiation of mesendoderm, the precursor of mesoderm and endoderm (Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Touboul T. Chng Z. Brimpari M. Hannan N. Millan E. Smithers L.E. Trotter M. Rugg-Gunn P. Weber A. Pedersen R.A. Early cell fate decisions of human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells are controlled by the same signalling pathways.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The apparent capacity of hESCs to differentiate into trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm in response to BMP4 is paradoxical, because they are derived by culturing the inner cell mass (ICM) of expanded blastocysts. At this stage, the inner cells (precursors of epiblast and primitive endoderm) of mouse embryos no longer have the capacity for differentiation into trophectoderm (Tarkowski et al., 2010Tarkowski A.K. Suwińska A. Czołowska R. Ożdżeński W. Individual blastomeres of 16- and 32-cell mouse embryos are able to develop into foetuses and mice.Dev. Biol. 2010; 348: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and indeed mESCs only rarely colonize the trophectoderm in chimeras (Beddington and Robertson, 1989Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. An assessment of the developmental potential of embryonic stem cells in the midgestation mouse embryo.Development. 1989; 105: 733-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mouse EpiSCs, which are derived from pre-gastrula-stage late epiblast, also express trophoblast-associated genes in response to BMP (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W.

Early cell fate decisions of human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells are controlled by the same signalling pathways.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of whether the trophoblast-like phenotype induced by BMP in hESCs and EpiSCs represents an artifact related to their derivation and culture (Rossant, 2008Rossant J. Stem cells and early lineage development.Cell. 2008; 132: 527-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Silva and Smith, 2008Silva J. Smith A. Capturing pluripotency.Cell. 2008; 132: 532-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) or alternatively models development of the intact mammalian embryo by inducing expected progeny of the late epiblast. The latter hypothesis would account for the role of BMP4 in the mouse embryo, since homozygous BMP4 mutants have severe defects in embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm, but none in trophoblast (Winnier et al., 1995Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 is required for mesoderm formation and patterning in the mouse.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). BMP4, alone or together with Activin, rapidly induces hESCs to express the transcription factor BRACHYURY (BRA) and other genes characteristic of mesendoderm, the common progenitor of mesoderm and endoderm (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang P. Li J. Tan Z. Wang C. Liu T. Chen L. Yong J. Jiang W. Sun X.

Early cell fate decisions of human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells are controlled by the same signalling pathways.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Progressive differentiation of these cells is evident in expression of genes associated with definitive endoderm, such as SOX17 and FOXA2, or with mid/distal and proximal mesoderm, such as TBX6 or FLK1 (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G.

Growth factors responsible for mesoderm differentiation of hESCs are not well understood, as BMP does not appear to be the sole driver of mesoderm (Vallier et al., 2009Vallier L. Touboul T. Chng Z. Brimpari M. Hannan N. Millan E. Smithers L.E. Trotter M. Rugg-Gunn P. Weber A. Pedersen R.A. Early cell fate decisions of human embryonic stem cells and mouse epiblast stem cells are controlled by the same signalling pathways.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in particular has been used to promote mesoderm specification and proliferation (Yang et al., 2008Yang L. Soonpaa M.H. Adler E.D. Roepke T.K. Kattman S.J. Kennedy M. Henckaerts E. Bonham K. Abbott G.W.

Understanding which growth factors distinguish between mesoderm, endoderm, and trophoblast differentiation of hESCs is key to their ultimate use for cell-based therapies and disease modeling. A recent study used FGF2 to modulate the response of hESCs to BMP4, finding that trophoblast-associated genes were induced by BMP only in the absence of FGF (Yu et al., 2011Yu P. Pan G. Yu J.

FGF2 sustains NANOG and switches the outcome of BMP4-induced human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 326-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although complex trophoblast features, such as giant cell formation and hormone secretion, have been described in BMP-treated hESCs, their trophoblast identity has principally been based on their expression of such trophoblast-associated genes, including CDX2, KRT7, HCGα, and GCM1 (Xu et al., 2002Xu R.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24991-25002Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, these genes are not exclusively expressed in the trophoblast (Roper and Hemberger, 2009Roper S. Hemberger M. Defining pathways that enforce cell lineage specification in early development and stem cells.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CDX2, for example, not only affects trophoblast development but also plays an essential role in mesoderm (Ralston and Rossant, 2008Ralston A. Rossant J.

Indeed, the embryonic expression pattern of Cdx2 and the postimplantation phenotype of the knockout resemble those of Bra (Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004Chawengsaksophak K. de Graaff W. Rossant J.

Moreover, Elf5, a key transcription factor in trophoblast lineage determination (Ng et al., 2008Ng R.K. Dean W. Dawson C. Lucifero D. Madeja Z. Reik W. Hemberger M. Epigenetic restriction of embryonic cell lineage fate by methylation of Elf5.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1280-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), is not expressed in hESCs, in mEpiSCs or in trophoblast-like cells derived from hESCs (Hemberger et al., 2010Hemberger M. Udayashankar R. Tesar P. Moore H. Burton G.J. ELF5-enforced transcriptional networks define an epigenetically regulated trophoblast stem cell compartment in the human placenta.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These findings led us to re-examine whether the trophoblast-associated genes induced by BMP are sufficient to identify the resulting phenotype as trophoblast and to exclude epiblast-derived lineages such as embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm. We studied the response to BMP4 in hESCs, in mEpiSCs, and in explants of mouse late epiblast, using a combination of gene expression analysis, shRNA knockdown, cell surface analysis, and epigenetic characterization. These studies raised doubts that the BMP-induced cells are trophoblast and suggested instead that they are mesodermal in nature. To understand how growth factor signaling regulates mesoderm differentiation we grew hESCs and mEpiSCs in a chemically defined medium (CDM) that has previously been used to determine the requirements for pluripotency and differentiation (Wiles and Johansson, 1999Wiles M.V. Johansson B.M. Embryonic stem cell development in a chemically defined medium.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Vallier et al., 2005Vallier L. Alexander M. Pedersen R.A. Activin/Nodal and FGF pathways cooperate to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4495-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). We used a combinatorial approach to determine the effects of 24 hr treatment with ActivinA (100 ng/ml), BMP4 (10 ng/ml), and/or FGF2 (20 ng/ml), (Figure 1A ; Figures S1A and S1B, available online). As expected, Activin treatment of hESCs induced the expression of SOX17 and FOXA2, reflecting endoderm differentiation. By contrast, expression of BRA, TBX6, and CDX2 were induced by BMP4, reflecting mesoderm and possibly trophoblast differentiation. This response was most pronounced in the presence of FGF2 and absence of Activin. The critical role of FGF in BMP-induced differentiation was evident when the expression of BRA was examined by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Moreover, omission of FGF or treatment with the FGF receptor inhibitor SU5402 (SU) effectively blocked BMP4-induced BRA expression (Figure S1C). These results indicate that FGF, whether provided exogenously or obtained endogenously, was also important for BMP-mediated BRA induction. To further understand the role of FGF in BRA induction we determined which of its effectors mediated this response. We observed high levels of ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation at 24 hr of FGF treatment (Figure 1B) but did not observe increased phosphorylation of JNK1/JNK2 or p38α (Figure S1D). Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous FGF signaling with SU5402 reduced phospho-ERK below the modest level seen in the absence of added FGF (data not shown). In addition, the ERK inhibitor UO126 (Uo) blocked BRA transcript and protein induction by BMP+FGF (Figure 1C). Hence, ERK1/2 activation correlates with FGF signaling and is required for BMP-induced BRA expression. While this study was underway, similar findings were reported on the role of FGF2-ERK in hESCs (Yu et al., 2011Yu P. Pan G. Yu J. Thomson J.A. FGF2 sustains NANOG and switches the outcome of BMP4-induced human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 326-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Independently of FGF, BMP increased the levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8, the transcriptional effectors of canonical BMP signaling (Figure 1B and data not shown). We further found that FGF treatment bypassed the previously described requirement of Activin/Nodal signaling for BMP-induced BRA expression (Nostro et al., 2008Nostro M.C. Cheng X. Keller G.M. Gadue P. Wnt, activin, and BMP signaling regulate distinct stages in the developmental pathway from embryonic stem cells to blood.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 60-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) as cells treated with the Activin/Nodal receptor inhibitor SB431542 (Sb) still upregulated BRA protein production, provided that FGF was present (Figure 1B). The responses to Activin, BMP, and FGF were explored further by simultaneous treatment with LY294002 (Ly), an inhibitor of the PI3 kinase pathway, which facilitates differentiation of hESCs (McLean et al., 2007McLean A.B. D'Amour K.A. Jones K.L. Krishnamoorthy M. Kulik M.J. Reynolds D.M. Sheppard A.M. Liu H. Xu Y. Baetge E.E. Dalton S. Activin a efficiently specifies definitive endoderm from human embryonic stem cells only when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling is suppressed.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (Figure S1E). Induction of endoderm-associated genes (SOX17 and FOXA2) by FGF2 + Ly + Activin (designated “FLyA”) treatment did not require BMP signaling, as demonstrated by use of the BMP inhibitor, Noggin (Figure 1D). Conversely, induction of the mesodermal marker gene TBX6 and of CDX2 by FGF2 + Ly + BMP4 (designated “FLyB”) treatment did not require Activin/Nodal signaling, as it was not blocked by Sb (Figure 1D). Immunostaining confirmed these results and highlighted that BMP also induced CDX2 protein expression (Figure 1E). Similar outcomes were observed when mEpiSCs (Figure S1F and data not shown) or outgrowths of late epiblast layers dissected from pre-gastrula stage mouse embryos (Figure S1G) were treated with these conditions. In summary, endoderm-associated gene expression (SOX17, FOXA2) was induced by Activin + FGF, whereas mesoderm-associated gene expression (TBX6) was induced by BMP + FGF in hESCs, in EpiSCs, and in late epiblast outgrowths. The effect of Activin/Nodal, BMP, and FGF on these pluripotent cells thus appears to be consistent with their effect in gastrulating mouse embryos. The reciprocal effects of Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling as inducers of endoderm and mesoderm gene expression, respectively, prompted a deeper examination of the nature of cells in such conditions. As BRA mRNA peaked between 24 hr and 36 hr of either FLyA or FLyB treatment (Figure S2A), protein analyses were performed at 36 hr. Flow cytometry analysis showed that FLyA and FLyB treatments each generated 65%–90% BRA expressing cells (Figures 2A and 2C ; Figure S2B). However, FLyB induced higher levels of BRA expression than FLyA (Figure 2A; Figure S2C). Moreover, in FLyB-treated hESCs, BRA colocalized with CDX2, while in FLyA-treated hESCs, BRA colocalized with SOX17 (Figure 2A); this result was confirmed in a second hESC line, HuES9 (Figure S2B). Thus, FLyA and FLyB treatments, respectively, evoked two distinct phenotypes: a BRAlow population, a majority of which (55% of the total BRA-positive cells) colocalized with SOX17+, and a BRAhigh population, many of which (45% of the total BRA-positive cells) colocalized with CDX2+ (Figure 2A). As levels of Bra expression in the mouse primitive streak have been shown to influence cell recruitment and their phenotype (Wilson and Beddington, 1997Wilson V. Beddington R. Expression of T protein in the primitive streak is necessary and sufficient for posterior mesoderm movement and somite differentiation.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 36 hr FLyA and FLyB treatments would induce broadly different gene expression profiles. The heat map of predominantly up- or downregulated genes confirmed that characteristic endoderm-associated genes (D'Amour et al., 2005D'Amour K.A. Agulnick A.D. Eliazer S. Kelly O.G. Kroon E. Baetge E.E. Efficient differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to definitive endoderm.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) were upregulated in FLyA and downregulated or absent in FLyB (Figure 2B). Conversely, of numerous genes that were upregulated in FLyB and downregulated or absent in FLyA, many were explicitly mesodermal (e.g., ISL1, TBX6, LMO2) and some were trophoblast associated (e.g., HAND1, CDX2). Other genes were upregulated in both conditions (e.g., BRA, MIXL1, MESP1, EOMES), suggesting that they distinguish a mesendodermal population. To extend these results, we investigated the protein expression of HAND1, MESP1, and FOXA2 in FLyB and FLyA conditions (Figure 2C; Figures S2D and S2E). Flow cytometry analysis showed that, as suggested by the transcriptional profiles, HAND1 and FOXA2 expression were only observed in BMP or in Activin, respectively. As before, both treatments induced a high proportion of BRA-expressing cells (approximately 80%–90%). HAND1 expression in response to FLyB mainly colocalized with BRA in BRAhigh cells and also colocalized with CDX2 (65% of HAND1+ cells). By contrast, FOXA2 expression in response to FLyA mainly colocalized with BRA in BRAlow cells and with SOX17 (65% of FOXA2+ cells). As expected from their transcriptional profiles, both FLyB- and FLyA-treated hESCs expressed MESP1, which colocalized with BRA in both BRAhigh and BRAlow cells. Taken together, these results confirmed that mesoderm and endoderm emerged as two distinct populations in response to treatment with BMP + FGF or Activin + FGF, respectively. The above observations also raised the possibility that trophoblast-associated genes such as CDX2 and HAND1, which are coexpressed with BRA in BRAhigh cells, are expressed in, and play a role in, mesoderm. To test this hypothesis we subjected 36 hr FLyB-treated cells to a longer mesoderm differentiation protocol by exposing them to an additional 3.5 days of BMP + FGF. CDX2 expression was induced by this protocol not only in hESCs (Figure 2D) but also in mEpiSCs (Figure S2F) and in epiblast explants (Figure S2G). Since trophoblast gene expression has been reported in hESCs treated with BMP alone (Xu et al., 2002Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A.

Omission of FGF2 (Figure 2E) revealed its critical role in promoting the expression of ISL1, NKX2.5, CD31, and LMO2 in BMP-treated cells. Each of these is integral to development of one or more embryonic mesoderm subtypes. High expression of CDX2 also depended on FGF signaling and decreased in its absence. In contrast, expression of other trophoblast-associated genes (GCM1, HCGα, KRT7) was highest in the absence of FGF (Figure 2E), as recently also found by Yu et al., 2011Yu P. Pan G. Yu J.

However, FLK1, VCAM1, and TBX4, three BMP-induced genes with essential roles in both embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm (Yamaguchi et al., 1993Yamaguchi T.P. Dumont D.J. Conlon R.A. Breitman M.L.

Collectively, the patterns of gene expression in response to BMP either with or without FGF suggest that these two conditions induce distinct molecular phenotypes, but that both are mesodermal in nature. To test the hypothesis that trophectoderm-associated genes are actually expressed in cells of the mesodermal lineage, we determined their dependence on a BRA-centered regulatory network. This approach was based on observations that there are no trophoblast phenotypes in homozygous Bra mouse mutants (Beddington et al., 1992Beddington R.S. Rashbass P. Wilson V. Brachyury—a gene affecting mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis.Dev. Suppl. 1992; : 157-165PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1993071851,"Recent work has suggested that natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the control of HIV-1 infection through recognition of virally infected cells by both activating and inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Alter et al. present evidence that NK cells select HIV escape mutants by an as-yet-undefined mechanism. This results in the inhibition of NK cell function, enabling HIV-1 to escape the potential protective role of this inhibitory KIR. Natural killer (NK) cells have an important role in the control of viral infections, recognizing virally infected cells through a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors1,2,3. Epidemiological and functional studies have recently suggested that NK cells can also contribute to the control of HIV-1 infection through recognition of virally infected cells by both activating and inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)4,5,6,7. However, it remains unknown whether NK cells can directly mediate antiviral immune pressure in vivo in humans. Here we describe KIR-associated amino-acid polymorphisms in the HIV-1 sequence of chronically infected individuals, on a population level. We show that these KIR-associated HIV-1 sequence polymorphisms can enhance the binding of inhibitory KIRs to HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, and reduce the antiviral activity of KIR-positive NK cells. These data demonstrate that KIR-positive NK cells can place immunological pressure on HIV-1, and that the virus can evade such NK-cell-mediated immune pressure by selecting for sequence polymorphisms, as was previously described for virus-specific T cells and neutralizing antibodies8. NK cells might therefore have a previously underappreciated role in contributing to viral evolution."

A critical step in meiosis is recombination between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers resulting from recombination are essential for the physical links between homologs that mediate their segregation to opposite poles at the first meiotic division. Recombination is initiated by the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by Spo11, a meiosis-specific transesterase highly conserved through evolution (Bergerat et al., 1997Bergerat A. de Massy B.

Mechanism and control of meiotic recombination initiation.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DSB formation also depends on a number of Spo11-accessory proteins, which have largely been identified in budding yeast, but whose function is only partially understood (reviewed in Keeney, 2001Keeney S. Mechanism and control of meiotic recombination initiation.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These accessory proteins interact with each other (Maleki et al., 2007Maleki S. Neale M.J. Arora C. Henderson K.A. Keeney S.

Among these factors, Rec102, Rec104, and Ski8 are required for Spo11 dimerization, DNA binding and efficient nuclear retention (Arora et al., 2004Arora C. Kee K. Maleki S. Keeney S.

In addition to Spo11 and the accessory proteins, which are all essential for DSB formation, a number of other factors are important for wild-type levels and distribution of DSBs (reviewed in Hunter, 2007Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rotshtein R. Homologous Recombination. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2007: 1-62Google Scholar). DSBs occur preferentially in clusters of sites called “hotspots” where, in yeast, the probability of DSB formation is 100–1000 times higher than at other sites (Baudat and Nicolas, 1997Baudat F.

However, factors other than chromatin modifications are required to explain long-range effects, such as the fact that the activation of a hotspot can interfere with that of a neighboring one over distances of many kb (Wu and Lichten, 1995Wu T.C.

Mechanism and control of meiotic recombination initiation.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 52: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomal organization plays an important role for meiotic recombination. DSBs arise concomitantly with the development of axial structures (Padmore et al., 1991Padmore R. Cao L. Kleckner N.

Given that cohesion is established coreplicationally, loops of sister chromatids are expected to be in register (Nasmyth, 2005Nasmyth K. How might cohesin hold sister chromatids together?.Philos.

Co-oriented linear loop arrays are joined at their base by a single axial structure (reviewed in Zickler and Kleckner, 1999Zickler D. Kleckner N.

Structural axes include, among other things, meiosis-specific components such as cohesin Rec8 and, in yeast, the proteins Red1 and Hop1 (Smith and Roeder, 1997Smith A.V. Roeder G.S.

Kleckner N. Meiotic chromosomes: integrating structure and function.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). By midprophase, structural axes of homologous chromosomes are intimately linked by transversal filaments forming the synaptonemal complex (SC). The yeast transversal filament component is Zip1. Early electron microscopy (EM) studies identified nodular structures atop or across the SC, whose number and distribution corresponded to crossovers detected genetically or cytologically. These and subsequent studies showed that recombination occurs in complexes that are physically associated with the chromosome structural axes/SC (reviewed in Zickler and Kleckner, 1999Zickler D. Kleckner N. Meiotic chromosomes: integrating structure and function.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences at which DSBs occur map to positions in between axis-association sites. By implication, the DNA sequences that are directly undergoing biochemical changes for recombination are associated to underlying axes indirectly, with the involved loop sequences tethered to chromosome axes by protein-protein interactions between components of recombination complexes and components of chromosome axes (Blat et al., 2002Blat Y.

Chiasma formation: chromatin/axis interplay and the role(s) of the synaptonemal complex.Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This tethered loop-axis complex (TLAC) model indeed helps to explain several crucial features of meiotic recombination (Kleckner, 2006Kleckner N. Chiasma formation: chromatin/axis interplay and the role(s) of the synaptonemal complex.Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2010Kim K.P. Weiner B.M.

There is indication that chromosome structure influences the pattern of DSB formation. For example, wild-type levels and distribution of DSBs along chromosomes in yeast depend on the chromosome axis proteins Rec8, Hop1, and Red1 (Schwacha and Kleckner, 1997Schwacha A. Kleckner N.

Sister cohesion and structural axis components mediate homolog bias of meiotic recombination.Cell. 2010; 143: 924-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, in C. elegans, the absence of structure component condensin I induces a large-scale modulation of DSB positions (Mets and Meyer, 2009Mets D.G. Meyer B.J. Condensins regulate meiotic DNA break distribution, thus crossover frequency, by controlling chromosome structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 73-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence for pre-DSB establishment of axis association, nor is it known for any stage of recombination which proteins mediate tethering as it evolves through meiotic prophase. A third aspect of meiotic recombination, beyond local biochemical events and association of recombination complexes with chromosome structure components, is the control at domain-wise level. Chromosomes contain recombination-proficient (hot) and recombination-poor (cold) regions, and when an active local hotspot in an active domain is transferred into a cold domain, it acquires the properties of the cold domain (Wu and Lichten, 1995Wu T.C. Lichten M. Factors that affect the location and frequency of meiosis-induced double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1995; 140: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that Red1 localizes preferentially to the DSB-active domains along chromosome III (Blat et al., 2002Blat Y. Protacio R.U. Hunter N. Kleckner N. Physical and functional interactions among basic chromosome organizational features govern early steps of meiotic chiasma formation.Cell. 2002; 111: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) suggests again a role for axial components in this domain-dependent organization, but how chromosome structure and the initiation of recombination are mechanistically coupled is unclear. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarray (ChIPchip) analysis in budding yeast, we show that the Spo11-accessory proteins, Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4 (RMM), whose function was previously unclear, bind stably to DNA at chromosome axis association sites, rather than to loop sequences containing DSB hotspots. We show that this association depends on axis components Hop1 and Red1 and that cohesin modulates both RMM and axis component binding in a domain-wise fashion. Importantly, the chromosomal regions that lose RMM and axial component binding in the absence of cohesin also exhibit a localized reduction in DSBs. Thus, the activation of DSB hotspots requires localized tethering of RMM to the chromosome axis via axial element proteins and cohesin, which implies that loop-axis tethering occurs prior to or at the time of DSB formation. We also show that S-Cdk1 controls recruitment of Spo11 accessory proteins at the interphase between DNA replication and DSB formation. Our results show that the developing chromosome axis plays a critical role in controlling initiation of meiotic recombination, reveal that a central role for RMM proteins is to establish the association between pre-DSB recombinosomes and structural components, implicate this association as a key feature to couple DSB formation to completion of S phase, and suggest that domainal structural organization along chromosomes is linked to domain-wise control of DSB formation. Given that Spo11 is highly conserved and mammalian homologs of the RMM complex have recently been discovered (Kumar et al., 2010Kumar R. Bourbon H.M. de Massy B. Functional conservation of Mei4 for meiotic DNA double-strand break formation from yeasts to mice.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1266-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), these features are likely to be conserved across diverse species. Previous studies defined preferred binding sites for meiotic axis-component Red1 and cohesin on chromosome 3 (Blat et al., 2002Blat Y. Protacio R.U. Hunter N. Kleckner N.

We confirmed and extended these findings using ChIP analysis of Rec8, Red1, Hop1, and Zip1 by high-resolution Affymetrix arrays and compared our genome-wide map to that of the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8 (Glynn et al., 2004Glynn E.F. Megee P.C. Yu H.G. Mistrot C. Unal E. Koshland D.E. DeRisi J.L. Gerton J.L. Genome-wide mapping of the cohesin complex in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E259Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, all ChIPchip samples were collected from synchronous time courses, 4 hr after transfer to sporulation medium (SPM, t4), when DSBs are most abundant in wild- type S. cerevisiae strains under our conditions (data not shown). For all experiments, the progression through nuclear divisions was scored by DAPI (data not shown). Results are presented after noise filtering with a 3 kb sliding window mostly for chromosome 3 (results for all other chromosomes can be accessed online). The 3 kb sliding window was chosen for the purpose of clarity. Analysis at a resolution of 500 bp greatly refined the accuracy of the number and position of peaks, but it did not change the conclusions presented below. As an example of such 500 bp resolution, two profiles obtained from different proteins are provided in Figure S2C (available online) for a selection of small and large chromosomes. Importantly, the close match between the two profiles shows the low level of experimental noise. Two types of statistical analyses were employed to assess the degree of similarities among genome-wide data sets for different proteins. First, the percentage of overlapping peaks was calculated (two peaks are considered overlapping if their maxima are less than 1 kb apart [d < 1 kb], see the Experimental Procedures). An even more stringent method is the Pearson correlation (Pcorr), which measures the linear correlation between two data sets. Pcorr values assume a value of 1 for perfect correlation and −1 for a mirror image. A high Pcorr requires that peaks are at corresponding positions and that their heights are in linear proportion. Pcorr was assessed after noise filtering with a 1 kb sliding window. We found that the DNA binding profiles for Red1, Hop1, Zip1, and Rec8 were largely identical (Figure 1A ; see Table S2 for numerical data for all chromosomes), revealing that the transversal filament component Zip1 contacts chromosomes at cohesin-binding sites. This result was confirmed by our genome-wide statistical analysis. For instance, 80% of Zip1 peaks, 81% of Red1 peaks, and 72% of Hop1 peaks matched Rec8 peaks (d < 1 kb, p < 10−10). Previous analyses showed that Red1 associates preferentially with DSB-rich domains along chromosome 3 (Blat et al., 2002Blat Y. Protacio R.U. Hunter N. Kleckner N. Physical and functional interactions among basic chromosome organizational features govern early steps of meiotic chiasma formation.Cell. 2002; 111: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the present study, Hop1 and Red1 exhibit the same preference for DSB-rich domains throughout the whole genome. Rec8 and Zip1 showed strong centromeric signals on all chromosomes (Figure 1A and Table S2; http://www.univie.ac.at/SFBChromosomeDynamics/documents.html), consistent with their function at centromeres in early prophase (Bardhan et al., 2010Bardhan A. Chuong H. Dawson D.S. Meiotic cohesin promotes pairing of nonhomologous centromeres in early meiotic prophase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found higher Pcorr values between Rec8 and Zip1 (0.68) and between Red1 and Hop1 (0.88), and smaller values for the other combinations. Aside from centromeric regions, Rec8 and Zip1 were distributed more uniformly along the arms than Red1/Hop1. These results further define the positions of axis-association sites, as well as the distribution of axis-association proteins along these sites, on a genome-wide basis. We note that these results represent population average tendencies. The subset of axis sites bound by axis components in individual cells at any given time may vary. Meiotic DSBs occur between axis association sites, in regions that, in organized chromosomes, would comprise the “loop” regions (Baudat and Nicolas, 1997Baudat F. Nicolas A.

It might thus have been expected, analogously, that components required for DSB formation, e.g., Spo11 and its accessory proteins, might also bind these regions. To be able to detect RMM proteins by ChIP analysis, we generated C-terminally tagged versions of Mer2 (tagged with myc9), Rec114 (tagged with myc13) and Mei4 (tagged with HA6) (see the Experimental Procedures); unless specified otherwise, all experiments described in this work were done with these constructs. Unexpectedly, genome-wide ChIPchip profiles of Mer2, Rec114, and Mei4, closely resembled that of Hop1 and Red1 (Figures 2A and 2B ). The association profiles of the three components at t4 were nearly identical (Figure 2A). Almost all the 900 peaks of the three profiles matched (>92%), with a Pcorr > 0.93 for all three pair-wise comparisons (Figure S1). Conversely, these binding signals exhibit local minima of DNA binding in the intervening regions, where DSBs are prominent. Confirming this, genome-wide peak matching revealed an inverse correlation between DSBs and Rec114 binding: 65% of DSB peaks (Buhler et al., 2007Buhler C. Borde V. Lichten M. Mapping meiotic single-strand DNA reveals a new landscape of DNA double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e324Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) matched to local minima of Rec114 (with a relaxed matching distance d < 2 kb), while only 13% of DSB peaks matched a Rec114 peak by the same criterion (chromosome 2 is shown as an example, Figure 2E). We also obtained a negative Pearson coefficient [Pcorr(10kbsw) = −0.37] for the two datasets (see the Experimental Procedures for details). Thus, DNA association peaks of RMM alternate with DSBs.Figure S1Binding Sites of DSB-Promoting Factors Correlate with Cohesin Sites, but Not with Hotspots, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Pair-wise genome-wide comparisons between profiles shown in Figures 2A and 2B.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) acquire chromosomal aberrations in culture, in a process known as culture adaptation (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D.

These aberrations may increase the tumorigenicity of the cells (reviewed in Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011Ben-David U. Benvenisty N. Nat. Rev.

While they are assumed to be acquired stochastically, specific aberrations provide selective advantage, and are thus detected at a much higher frequency than others. Recently, chromosomal aberrations were also documented in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S.

Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), the phenomenon of culture adaptation in human multipotent stem cells is much less explored. Individual cases of chromosomal aberrations have been detected in both human neural stem cells (NSCs) (Sareen et al., 2009Sareen D. McMillan E. Ebert A.D. Shelley B.C. Johnson J.A. Meisner L.F. Svendsen C.N. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Buyanovskaya et al., 2009Buyanovskaya O.A. Kuleshov N.P. Nikitina V.A.

Furthermore, even in cases where the chromosomal integrity of human multipotent stem cells was documented, such analyses were mostly performed at early passages of their growth. Thus, multipotent stem cells, as opposed to PSCs, are generally considered to be genetically stable (Bernardo et al., 2007Bernardo M.E. Zaffaroni N. Novara F. Cometa A.M. Avanzini M.A. Moretta A.

Cell Res. 2004; 294: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and are currently used in clinical trials in humans. We recently developed a method for detecting chromosomal aberrations in human PSCs, based on the gene expression patterns of these cell lines (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Here, we expanded our analysis of human PSCs, and in addition applied the same methodology to carry out a comprehensive analysis of large chromosomal aberrations in 144 samples of MSCs, 97 samples of NSCs, and 177 samples of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), from 45 independent studies (Figure 1A ). We focused on the analysis of the genomic integrity of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms. Only aberrations that met the stringent criteria for statistical significance in both of the bioinformatic tools applied are presented and discussed (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We initially completed a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal aberrations in PSCs. Formerly, we identified three sources for chromosomal aberrations in hiPSCs: aberrations of somatic origin, aberrations that occur during reprogramming, and aberrations acquired in culture (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Here, we greatly expanded our published analysis of the PSC data sets, studying 39 additional hESC samples and 65 additional hiPSC samples from 13 recent studies (see Table S1). Although the most common autosomal aberrations in hESCs are trisomies 12 and 17 (Baker et al., 2007Baker D.E. Harrison N.J. Maltby E. Smith K. Moore H.D. Shaw P.J. Heath P.R. Holden H. Andrews P.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), previous studies failed to detect trisomy 17 in hiPSCs, and suggested this might be a difference between these cell types (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N.

McIntire E.M. Montgomery K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 313-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the current analysis of PSCs, we detected further cases of previously described aberrations (Figure 1B), and identified trisomy 17 in hiPSCs in cell lines generated through reprogramming with synthetic mRNA molecules (Figure 1C). Because this trisomy was not identified in the parental somatic cell line (Warren et al., 2010Warren L. Manos P.D. Ahfeldt T. Loh Y.H. Li H. Lau F. Ebina W. Mandal P.K. Smith Z.D. Meissner A. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 618-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar), and because it appeared in culture at an early passage of the hiPSCs, it appears to be an example of a genomic aberration arising through selective pressure during or immediately following the reprogramming process. This finding also supports the notion that hiPSCs are prone to chromosomal aberrations regardless of the reprogramming method used (Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011Ben-David U. Benvenisty N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, Ben-David et al., 2010Ben-David U. Benvenisty N. Mayshar Y. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4603-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), because we previously identified aberrations in cell lines reprogrammed with integrating viruses, episomal vectors, and recombinant proteins. An ideogram of the chromosomal aberrations identified in PSCs is presented as Figure 2A , and a full analysis of the aberrations detected can be found in Table S1. Large chromosomal aberrations were identified in ∼9% of all the samples analyzed, consistent with our previous report (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Chromosomal aberrations are known to accumulate in various cell types in culture. However, their accumulation in cultures of adult stem cells is still a matter of open debate. Although previous studies have identified chromosomal aberrations in cultured human MSCs (Røsland et al., 2009Røsland G.V. Svendsen A. Torsvik A. Sobala E. McCormack E. Immervoll H. Mysliwietz J. Tonn J.C. Goldbrunner R. Lønning P.E. et al.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5331-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, Ueyama et al., 2011Ueyama H. Horibe T. Hinotsu S. Tanaka T. Inoue T.

Med. 2011; (in press)https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01303.xCrossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), these reports analyzed a rather small number of MSC lines from bone marrow origin only, and were thus limited in their ability to detect recurrent chromosomal aberrations in various types of MSCs. Other studies reported that human MSCs retained chromosomal stability following long-term culture in vitro (Bernardo et al., 2007Bernardo M.E. Zaffaroni N. Novara F. Cometa A.M. Avanzini M.A. Moretta A. Montagna D. Maccario R. Villa R. Daidone M.G. et al.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9142-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2007Zhang Z.X. Guan L.X. Zhang K. Wang S. Cao P.C. Wang Y.H. Wang Z. Dai L.J. Cell Biol. Int. 2007; 31: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed published expression profiles for MSCs from five distinct origins. The MSC data set consisted of 135 human MSC samples and 9 hESC-derived MSCs, all from 22 independent studies. Because human MSCs from various sources (such as bone marrow, adipose, and umbilical cord) clustered together with each other and with hESC-derived MSCs in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Figure 1A), all the MSC types could be analyzed using a single common baseline. The analysis detected two monosomies of chromosome 13 (from two independent studies), as well as four monosomies of chromosome 6q (from two independent studies) (Figures 1D, 2B, and S1A). None of these aberrations was reported in the respective original study. Our analysis also identified one line that acquired gains of chromosomes 7q and 17q (Figure 1E) and one line that acquired trisomy 19 (Figure S1B). The latter aberrations have not been previously identified in MSCs. An ideogram of the chromosomal aberrations identified in MSCs is presented as Figure 2B, and a full analysis of the detected aberrations can be found in Table S1. Overall, we report a frequency of aberrations of ∼4% for MSCs, which could possibly account for the failure of previous smaller studies to detect them. The NSC data set comprised 58 human NSC samples and 39 hESC-derived NSC samples, all from 11 independent studies. The analysis identified a trisomy of chromosome 7 (Figure 1F) and recurrent cases of trisomy 19 (Figures 2C and S1C), aberrations that have been previously described to occur in NSCs (Sareen et al., 2009Sareen D. McMillan E. Ebert A.D. Shelley B.C. Johnson J.A. Meisner L.F. Svendsen C.N. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the detected aberrations had been reported in the original study (Sareen et al., 2009Sareen D. McMillan E. Ebert A.D. Shelley B.C. Johnson J.A. Meisner L.F. Svendsen C.N. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), while the others had not. The analysis of the NSCs also revealed a trisomy and a monosomy of chromosome 18 (Figures 1G and 2C) and a trisomy of chromosome 10 (Figure 2C), which had not been previously reported in NSCs. The analysis of the hESC-derived NSCs also revealed a trisomy of chromosome 20q, which had not been previously identified in NSCs (Figure 2c). Because trisomy 20q is a common aberration in hESCs (Lefort et al., 2008Lefort N. Feyeux M. Bas C. Féraud O. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Tachdjian G. Peschanski M. Perrier A.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1364-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Spits et al., 2008Spits C. Mateizel I. Geens M. Mertzanidou A. Staessen C. Vandeskelde Y. Van der Elst J. Liebaers I. Sermon K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), this aberration probably arose prior to the differentiation of the hESCs. Thus, not surprisingly, hESC-derived NSCs seem to be susceptible to both the typical PSC aberrations and the typical NSC aberrations. The nature of the acquired aberrations in each cell line would probably depend on the time it spent in culture in each of these states. An ideogram of the chromosomal aberrations identified in NSCs is presented as Figure 2C, and a full analysis of the detected aberrations can be found in Table S1. Overall, we report a frequency of aberrations of ∼9% for NSCs, a similar frequency to the one observed for PSCs. Finally, we analyzed a data set of 177 CD34+ HSPC samples from 12 independent studies. Of these, 55 samples were from healthy individuals, and 122 were from karyotyped myeloid dysplasia syndrome (MDS) patients that we could use as controls (Pellagatti et al., 2010Pellagatti A. Cazzola M. Giagounidis A. Perry J. Malcovati L. Della Porta M.G. Jädersten M. Killick S. Verma A. Norbury C.J. et al.Leukemia. 2010; 24: 756-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because CD34+ samples from various sources (bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood) clustered together with each other and with samples from MDS patients in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Figure 1A), all the HSPC types could be readily analyzed using a single common baseline. Our analysis correctly detected 34 out of the 36 reported aberrations in the patient-derived HSPCs (the remaining two were identified by only one of the bioinformatic tests). A full analysis of the detected aberrations can be found in Table S1, and an example is shown in Figure S1D. In contrast to the other stem cells analyzed, and to the HSPCs derived from MDS patients, we could not detect any aberration in the 55 samples of healthy donor-derived HSPCs. Unlike NSCs and MSCs, HSPCs are not routinely propagated in vitro for multiple passages. Hence, the absence of aberrations in these cells does not necessarily suggest that they are less susceptible to chromosomal aberrations in comparison with other multipotent stem cells; rather, it suggests that adult stem cells are generally euploid in vivo, and may acquire large chromosomal aberrations upon in vitro adaptation to culture. A comparison of the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the different types of stem cells reveals a rather similar frequency of aberrations in all the stem cell types that are propagated in culture: 24 aberrations in 19 out of 208 samples (∼9%) in PSCs, 9 aberrations in 9 out of 97 samples (∼9%) in NSCs, and 9 aberrations in 6 out of 144 samples (∼4%) in MSCs. Thus, based on the data set we have analyzed, it seems that NSCs acquire large chromosomal aberrations at a similar frequency to that seen in PSCs, while MSCs acquire large chromosomal aberrations at a somewhat lower frequency. The chromosomal aberrations are not uniformly distributed among the chromosomes (p = 0.043, Chi-square goodness-of-fit test), and the specific aberrations a cell line is likely to acquire depend on the stem cell group to which it belongs (p = 0.007, Fisher's exact test). While PSCs and NSCs tend to acquire trisomies (100% and 89% of the aberrations, respectively), MSCs tend to acquire monosomies (∼67% of the aberrations, p = 0.012, Fisher's exact test), in line with previous reports (Buyanovskaya et al., 2009Buyanovskaya O.A. Kuleshov N.P. Nikitina V.A. Voronina E.S. Katosova L.D. Bochkov N.P. Bull. Exp. Biol. Med. 2009; 148: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most of the identified aberrations are recurrent in a specific cell type, such as trisomy 12 for PSCs, monosomies 6q and 13 for MSCs, and trisomy 19 for NSCs. Moreover, multipotent stem cells that are derived from PCSs also harbor the risk of acquiring the typical chromosomal aberrations of PSCs (such as trisomy 20), probably during their pluripotent stage in culture. Taken together, these data demonstrate that chromosomal aberrations are a common feature of stem cells propagated in vitro, and further suggest that each type of stem cell is prone to acquire a unique set of chromosomal aberrations (illustrated in Figure S2). It is important to stress that the frequencies of the aberrations identified in this study refer only to aberrations that encompass whole chromosomes or chromosome arms, and thus constitute an underestimation of the possible total number of genomic abnormalities in adult stem cells. Recent studies have revealed small copy number variations (CNVs) and coding mutations in hiPSCs, some of which were shown to exist in the fibroblasts of origin and were selected for during reprogramming, while others arose de novo during this process or after the growth of the cells in culture (Gore et al., 2011Gore A. Li Z. Fung H.L. Young J.E. Agarwal S. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Canto I. Giorgetti A. Israel M.A. Kiskinis E. et al.Nature. 2011; 471: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, Hussein et al., 2011Hussein S.M. Batada N.N. Vuoristo S. Ching R.W. Autio R. Närvä E. Ng S.

Harness J.V. Lee S. Barrero M.J. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that CNVs and point mutations would also arise during the culture propagation of multipotent stem cells. We recently reported that trisomy 12 accumulates in PSC cultures rapidly, and could take over the culture within as few as five passages (Mayshar et al., 2010Mayshar Y. Ben-David U. Lavon N. Biancotti J.C. Yakir B. Clark A.T. Plath K. Lowry W.E. Benvenisty N. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In this study, two cell lines that acquired chromosomal aberrations in culture were also analyzed at earlier time points. Thus, we show that in MSCs chromosomal aberrations can take over the culture in as few as seven passages (Figure 1E), and in NSCs, in as few as six passages (Figure 1G). We conclude, therefore, that multipotent stem cells are prone to acquire advantageous chromosomal aberrations, which enable them to rapidly outgrow the normal cell population, at a similar rate as that previously reported for PSCs. We next looked at the relationship between the chromosomal aberrations we detected in stem cell cultures and those seen in human tumors. In order to perform an unbiased quantification of the aberrations in different types of tumors, we gathered data from thousands of tumors of the same tissues as the various stem cells analyzed, using a well-established database of chromosomal aberrations in cancer (Mitelman et al., 2007Mitelman F. Johansson B. Mertens F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, Mitelman et al., 2011Mitelman, F., Johansson, B., and Mertens, F. (2011). Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer. http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitel_Search.Google Scholar). A calculation of the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in these tumors revealed a partial correlation between the lineage-specific aberrations that arise in stem cell cultures and the ones most common in tumors of the respective tissue. The association is most prominent in PSCs: trisomy 12 is the most common aberration in PSC cultures, and is by far the most common aberration in three types of tumors of germ cell tissues (teratomas, seminomas, and ovarian adenomas) (Figure 2D). In MSCs, two aberrations were found to recur in independent studies; one of them, monosomy 13, is also strongly related to mesenchymal tumors, because it was found to be a frequent monosomy in bone and soft tissue tumors (lipomas, as well as chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas) (Figure 2E). In NSCs, the association is weaker: trisomy 19 was found to arise recurrently, but trisomy 7 is the most prevalent in various brain tumors (gliomas, astrocytomas, and medulloblastomas) (Figure 2F). Trisomy 7 was reported to recur in NSCs (Sareen et al., 2009Sareen D. McMillan E. Ebert A.D. Shelley B.C. Johnson J.A. Meisner L.F. Svendsen C.N. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but was identified only once in the current analysis. The associations between chromosomal aberrations in stem cell cultures and in tumors of the same tissues do not necessarily mean that stem cells that acquired these aberrations would be more tumorigenic; they do imply, however, that specific aberrations at least confer growth advantage in a cell lineage-specific manner, both to stem cells in vitro and to tumors in vivo. If this were true, we would expect these two phenomena to share at least some of the genes involved. Supporting this notion, Retinoblastoma (RB1), which is located on 13q14, was found to be downregulated in many mesenchymal tumors with chromosome 13 deletion (Dahlén et al., 2003Dahlén A. Debiec-Rychter M. Pedeutour F. Domanski H.A. Höglund M. Bauer H.C. Rydholm A. Sciot R. Mandahl N. Mertens F. Int. J.

Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2009-2015PubMed Google Scholar), and was also significantly downregulated in the two lines detected in our analysis to harbor monosomy 13 (2.2-fold and 5.3-fold decrease, p = 0.015, Student's t test). Transplantation of human adult stem cells may result in tumor formation (Amariglio et al., 2009Amariglio N. Hirshberg A. Scheithauer B.W. Cohen Y. Loewenthal R. Trakhtenbrot L. Paz N. Koren-Michowitz M. Waldman D. Leider-Trejo L. et al.PLoS Med. 2009; 6: e1000029Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, Casalbore et al., 2009Casalbore P. Budoni M. Ricci-Vitiani L. Cenciarelli C. Petrucci G. Milazzo L. Montano N. Tabolacci E. Maira G. Larocca L.M. Pallini R. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the current analysis we identified stem cell-specific chromosomal aberrations, and compared the frequency, the identity, and the acquisition rate of these aberrations between different types of stem cells. We found that (1) NSCs and MSCs acquire large chromosomal aberrations in culture at a similar (for NSCs) or somewhat lower (for MSCs) frequency to that seen in PSCs; (2) different stem cell types acquire distinct chromosomal abnormalities; and (3) once these aberrations occur, they take over the culture rapidly. Thus, we conclude that, as for pluripotent cells, the genomic stability of multipotent stem cells in culture should also be analyzed carefully and regularly. Large chromosomal aberrations might also arise in HSPCs, once the required conditions for their routine in vitro propagation are finally discovered. Chromosomal aberrations in PSCs have been previously suggested to increase their tumorigenicity (Ben-David et al., 2010Ben-David U. Benvenisty N. Mayshar Y. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4603-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); such aberrations might affect the safety of aberrant multipotent stem cells as well. Thus, validating the genomic integrity of stem cells of all types in culture is crucial, both for the correct interpretation of biological results and for their safe implementation in cell therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2086829676,"Developing animals survive periods of starvation by protecting the growth of critical organs at the expense of other tissues. Here, we use Drosophila to explore the as yet unknown mechanisms regulating this privileged tissue growth. As in mammals, we observe in Drosophila that the CNS is more highly spared than other tissues during nutrient restriction (NR). We demonstrate that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) efficiently protects neural progenitor (neuroblast) growth against reductions in amino acids and insulin-like peptides during NR via two mechanisms. First, Alk suppresses the growth requirement for amino acid sensing via Slimfast/Rheb/TOR complex 1. And second, Alk, rather than insulin-like receptor, primarily activates PI3-kinase. Alk maintains PI3-kinase signaling during NR as its ligand, Jelly belly (Jeb), is constitutively expressed from a glial cell niche surrounding neuroblasts. Together, these findings identify a brain-sparing mechanism that shares some regulatory features with the starvation-resistant growth programs of mammalian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2129030910,"Prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of major interest in AD research. A large number of potential predictors have been proposed, with most investigations tending to examine one or a set of related predictors. In this study, we simultaneously examined multiple features from different modalities of data, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuropsychological and functional measures (NMs), to explore an optimal set of predictors of conversion from MCI to AD in an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. After FreeSurfer-derived MRI feature extraction, CSF and NM feature collection, feature selection was employed to choose optimal subsets of features from each modality. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were then trained on normal control (NC) and AD participants. Testing was conducted on MCIc (MCI individuals who have converted to AD within 24 months) and MCInc (MCI individuals who have not converted to AD within 24 months) groups. Classification results demonstrated that NMs outperformed CSF and MRI features. The combination of selected NM, MRI and CSF features attained an accuracy of 67.13%, a sensitivity of 96.43%, a specificity of 48.28%, and an AUC (area under curve) of 0.796. Analysis of the predictive values of MCIc who converted at different follow-up evaluations showed that the predictive values were significantly different between individuals who converted within 12 months and after 12 months. This study establishes meaningful multivariate predictors composed of selected NM, MRI and CSF measures which may be useful and practical for clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2042451060,"Blood-feeding vampire bats have evolved the ability to detect infrared (IR) radiation as a means of locating hot spots on warm-blooded prey. Only three other vertebrate lineages have this 'sixth' sense: three distantly related groups of snakes (pit vipers, pythons and boas). In all cases, the IR sensor is a highly specialized facial structure called the pit organ. In the snakes, a non-heat-sensitive ion channel (vertebrate TRPA1) has become an infrared detector. As reported in this issue, vampire bats use a slightly different molecular mechanism whereby RNA splicing generates a variant of the ubiquitous TRPV1 heat-sensitive channel that is tuned to lower temperatures. Comparison of this channel's gene sequence with the equivalent in other mammals lends support to the hypothesis based on molecular data that these bats are evolutionarily grouped with horses, dogs, cows, moles and dolphins (in the Laurasiatheria superorder), rather than with humans, monkeys and rodents (in the Euarchontoglires) as originally proposed on anatomical criteria. Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are obligate blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their sanguinary lifestyle1,2,3. Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation1,4. In each case, infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal’s face5,6,7,8,9,10. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector6. Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 °C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres."
https://openalex.org/W2131252553,"In E. coli, MinD recruits MinE to the membrane, leading to a coupled oscillation required for spatial regulation of the cytokinetic Z ring. How these proteins interact, however, is not clear because the MinD-binding regions of MinE are sequestered within a six-stranded β sheet and masked by N-terminal helices. minE mutations that restore interaction between some MinD and MinE mutants were isolated. These mutations alter the MinE structure leading to release of the MinD-binding regions and the N-terminal helices that bind the membrane. Crystallization of MinD-MinE complexes revealed a four-stranded β sheet MinE dimer with the released β strands (MinD-binding regions) converted to α helices bound to MinD dimers. These results identify the MinD-dependent conformational changes in MinE that convert it from a latent to an active form and lead to a model of how MinE persists at the MinD-membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W2037367816,"The neurotrophins NGF and NT3 collaborate to support development of sympathetic neurons. Although both promote axonal extension via the TrkA receptor, only NGF activates retrograde transport of TrkA endosomes to support neuronal survival. Here, we report that actin depolymerization is essential for initiation of NGF/TrkA endosome trafficking and that a Rac1-cofilin signaling module associated with TrkA early endosomes supports their maturation to retrograde transport-competent endosomes. These actin-regulatory endosomal components are absent from NT3/TrkA endosomes, explaining the failure of NT3 to support retrograde TrkA transport and survival. The inability of NT3 to activate Rac1-GTP-cofilin signaling is likely due to the labile nature of NT3/TrkA complexes within the acidic environment of TrkA early endosomes. Thus, TrkA endosomes associate with actin-modulatory proteins to promote F-actin disassembly, enabling their maturation into transport-competent signaling endosomes. Differential control of this process explains how NGF but not NT3 supports retrograde survival of sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2101053825,"The fundamental chemistry underpinning aerobic life on Earth involves reduction of dioxygen to water with concomitant proton translocation. This process is catalyzed by members of the heme-copper oxidase (HCO) superfamily. Despite the availability of crystal structures for all types of HCO, the mode of action for this enzyme is not understood at the atomic level, namely how vectorial H(+) and e(-) transport are coupled. Toward addressing this problem, we report wild type and A120F mutant structures of the ba(3)-type cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus at 1.8 Å resolution. The enzyme has been crystallized from the lipidic cubic phase, which mimics the biological membrane environment. The structures reveal 20 ordered lipid molecules that occupy binding sites on the protein surface or mediate crystal packing interfaces. The interior of the protein encloses 53 water molecules, including 3 trapped in the designated K-path of proton transfer and 8 in a cluster seen also in A-type enzymes that likely functions in egress of product water and proton translocation. The hydrophobic O(2)-uptake channel, connecting the active site to the lipid bilayer, contains a single water molecule nearest the Cu(B) atom but otherwise exhibits no residual electron density. The active site contains strong electron density for a pair of bonded atoms bridging the heme Fe(a3) and Cu(B) atoms that is best modeled as peroxide. The structure of ba(3)-oxidase reveals new information about the positioning of the enzyme within the membrane and the nature of its interactions with lipid molecules. The atomic resolution details provide insight into the mechanisms of electron transfer, oxygen diffusion into the active site, reduction of oxygen to water, and pumping of protons across the membrane. The development of a robust system for production of ba(3)-oxidase crystals diffracting to high resolution, together with an established expression system for generating mutants, opens the door for systematic structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W2116690507,"Objective Children with Down syndrome (DS) have delayed psychomotor development. We investigated levels of development, problem behavior, and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a population sample of Dutch eight-year-old children with DS. Developmental outcomes were compared with normative data of eight-year-old children from the general population. Method Over a three-year-period all parents with an eight-year-old child with DS were approached by the national parent organization. Developmental skills were assessed by means of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Ability. To measure emotional and behavioral problems we used the Child Behavior Checklist. HRQoL was assessed with the TNO-AZL Children's Quality of Life questionnaire. Analyses of variance were applied to compare groups. Results A total of 337 children participated. Mean developmental age was substantially lower than mean calendar age (3.9 years, SD 0.87 and 8.1 years, SD 0.15 respectively). Mean developmental age was significantly lower among boys than girls (3.6 (SD 0.85) and 4.2 years (SD 0.82) respectively; p<0.001). Compared with the general population, children with DS had more emotional and behavioral problems (p<0.001). However on the anxious/depressed scale, they scored significantly more favorably (p<0.001). Significantly lower HRQoL scores for the scales gross motor skills, autonomy, social functioning and cognitive functioning were found (p-values<0.001). Hardly any differences were observed for the scales physical complaints, positive and negative emotions. Conclusion Eight-year-old children with DS have an average developmental delay of four years, more often have emotional and behavioral problems, and have a less favorable HRQoL compared with children from the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2048369796,"The SMN complex mediates the assembly of heptameric Sm protein rings on small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), which are essential for snRNP function. Specific Sm core assembly depends on Sm proteins and snRNA recognition by SMN/Gemin2- and Gemin5-containing subunits, respectively. The mechanism by which the Sm proteins are gathered while preventing illicit Sm assembly on non-snRNAs is unknown. Here, we describe the 2.5 Å crystal structure of Gemin2 bound to SmD1/D2/F/E/G pentamer and SMN's Gemin2-binding domain, a key assembly intermediate. Remarkably, through its extended conformation, Gemin2 wraps around the crescent-shaped pentamer, interacting with all five Sm proteins, and gripping its bottom and top sides and outer perimeter. Gemin2 reaches into the RNA-binding pocket, preventing RNA binding. Interestingly, SMN-Gemin2 interaction is abrogated by a spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-causing mutation in an SMN helix that mediates Gemin2 binding. These findings provide insight into SMN complex assembly and specificity, linking snRNP biogenesis and SMA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039944519,"Background In the field of Plastic Reconstructive Surgery the development of new innovative matrices for skin repair is in urgent need. The ideal biomaterial should promote attachment, proliferation and growth of cells. Additionally, it should degrade in an appropriate time period without releasing harmful substances, but not exert a pathological immune response. Spider dragline silk from Nephila spp meets these demands to a large extent. Methodology/Principal Findings Native spider dragline silk, harvested directly out of Nephila spp spiders, was woven on steel frames. Constructs were sterilized and seeded with fibroblasts. After two weeks of cultivating single fibroblasts, keratinocytes were added to generate a bilayered skin model, consisting of dermis and epidermis equivalents. For the next three weeks, constructs in co-culture were lifted on an originally designed setup for air/liquid interface cultivation. After the culturing period, constructs were embedded in paraffin with an especially developed program for spidersilk to avoid supercontraction. Paraffin cross- sections were stained in Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) for microscopic analyses. Conclusion/Significance Native spider dragline silk woven on steel frames provides a suitable matrix for 3 dimensional skin cell culturing. Both fibroblasts and keratinocytes cell lines adhere to the spider silk fibres and proliferate. Guided by the spider silk fibres, they sprout into the meshes and reach confluence in at most one week. A well-balanced, bilayered cocultivation in two continuously separated strata can be achieved by serum reduction, changing the medium conditions and the cultivation period at the air/liquid interphase. Therefore spider silk appears to be a promising biomaterial for the enhancement of skin regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2068732521,"Anticancer therapies, such as targeting of STAT3 or the use of anthracyclins (doxorubicin), can induce cardiomyopathy. In mice prone to developing heart failure as a result of reduced cardiac STAT3 expression (cardiomyocyte-restricted deficiency of STAT3) or treatment with doxorubicin, we observed impaired endothelial differentiation capacity of Sca-1(+) cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in conjunction with attenuated CCL2/CCR2 activation. Mice in both models also displayed reduced erythropoietin (EPO) levels in the cardiac microenvironment. EPO binds to CPCs and seems to be responsible for maintaining an active CCL2/CCR2 system. Supplementation with the EPO derivative CERA in a hematocrit-inactive low dose was sufficient to upregulate CCL2, restore endothelial differentiation of CPCs, and preserve the cardiac microvasculature and cardiac function in both mouse models. Thus, low-dose EPO treatment could potentially be exploited as a therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of heart failure in certain treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W1985701578,"We have reported that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) improves reproduction, neonatal development, and mitochondrial function in animals by mechanisms that involve mitochondrial related cell signaling pathways. To extend these observations, the influence of PQQ on energy and lipid relationships and apparent protection against ischemia reperfusion injury are described herein. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a nutritionally complete diet with PQQ added at either 0 (PQQ−) or 2 mg PQQ/Kg diet (PQQ+). Measurements included: 1) serum glucose and insulin, 2) total energy expenditure per metabolic body size (Wt3/4), 3) respiratory quotients (in the fed and fasted states), 4) changes in plasma lipids, 5) the relative mitochondrial amount in liver and heart, and 6) indices related to cardiac ischemia. For the latter, rats (PQQ− or PQQ+) were subjected to left anterior descending occlusions followed by 2 h of reperfusion to determine PQQ's influence on infarct size and myocardial tissue levels of malondialdehyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation. Although no striking differences in serum glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels were observed, energy expenditure was lower in PQQ− vs. PQQ+ rats and energy expenditure (fed state) was correlated with the hepatic mitochondrial content. Elevations in plasma di- and triacylglyceride and β-hydroxybutryic acid concentrations were also observed in PQQ− rats vs. PQQ+ rats. Moreover, PQQ administration (i.p. at 4.5 mg/kg BW for 3 days) resulted in a greater than 2-fold decrease in plasma triglycerides during a 6-hour fast than saline administration in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. Cardiac injury resulting from ischemia/reperfusion was more pronounced in PQQ− rats than in PQQ+ rats. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PQQ deficiency impacts a number of parameters related to normal mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2054648595,The lack of understanding of the interplay between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the immune system has severely hampered the stem cell research and practice of transplantation. Major problems for allogeneic transplantation include low levels of donor engraftment and high risks of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transplantation of purified allogeneic HSCs diminishes the risk of GVHD but results in decreased engraftment. Here we show that ex vivo expanded mouse HSCs efficiently overcame the major histocompatibility complex barrier and repopulated allogeneic-recipient mice. An 8-day expansion culture led to a 40-fold increase of the allograft ability of HSCs. Both increased numbers of HSCs and culture-induced elevation of expression of the immune inhibitor CD274 (B7-H1 or PD-L1) on the surface of HSCs contributed to the enhancement. Our study indicates the great potential of utilizing ex vivo expanded HSCs for allogeneic transplantation and suggests that the immune privilege of HSCs can be modulated.
https://openalex.org/W2109014046,"Levels of sequence divergence at mitochondrial loci are frequently used in phylogeographic analysis and species delimitation though single marker systems cannot assess bi-parental gene flow. In this investigation I compare the phylogeographic patterns revealed through the maternally inherited mitochondrial COI region and the paternally inherited 7th intron region of the Dby gene on the Y-chromosome in eight common Neotropical bat species. These species are diverse and include members of two families from the feeding guilds of sanguivores, nectarivores, frugivores, carnivores and insectivores. In each case, the currently recognized taxon is comprised of distinct, substantially divergent intraspecific mitochondrial lineages suggesting cryptic species complexes. In Chrotopterus auritus, and Saccopteryx bilineata I observed congruent patterns of divergence in both genetic regions suggesting a cessation of gene flow between intraspecific groups. This evidence supports the existence of cryptic species complexes which meet the criteria of the genetic species concept. In Glossophaga soricina two intraspecific groups with largely sympatric South American ranges show evidence for incomplete lineage sorting or frequent hybridization while a third group with a Central American distribution appears to diverge congruently at both loci suggesting speciation. Within Desmodus rotundus and Trachops cirrhosus the paternally inherited region was monomorphic and thus does not support or refute the potential for cryptic speciation. In Uroderma bilobatum, Micronycteris megalotis and Platyrrhinus helleri the gene regions show conflicting patterns of divergence and I cannot exclude ongoing gene flow between intraspecific groups. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison across taxa and employs both maternally and paternally inherited gene regions to validate patterns of gene flow. I present evidence for previously unrecognized species meeting the criteria of the genetic species concept but demonstrate that estimates of mitochondrial diversity alone do not accurately represent gene flow in these species and that contact/hybrid zones must be explored to evaluate reproductive isolation."
https://openalex.org/W1972731882,"Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin (ETX) rapidly kills MDCK II cells at 37°C, but not 4°C. The current study shows that, in MDCK II cells, ETX binds and forms an oligomeric complex equally well at 37°C and 4°C but only forms a pore at 37°C. However, the complex formed in MDCK cells treated with ETX at 4°C has the potential to form an active pore, since shifting those cells to 37°C results in rapid cytotoxicity. Those results suggested that the block in pore formation at 4°C involves temperature-related trapping of ETX in a prepore intermediate on the MDCK II cell plasma membrane surface. Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained when the ETX complex in MDCK II cells was shown to be more susceptible to pronase degradation when formed at 4°C vs. 37°C; this result is consistent with ETX complex formed at 4°C remaining present in an exposed prepore on the membrane surface, while the ETX prepore complex formed at 37°C is unaccessible to pronase because it has inserted into the plasma membrane to form an active pore. In addition, the ETX complex rapidly dissociated from MDCK II cells at 4°C, but not 37°C; this result is consistent with the ETX complex being resistant to dissociation at 37°C because it has inserted into membranes, while the ETX prepore readily dissociates from cells at 4°C because it remains on the membrane surface. These results support the identification of a prepore stage in ETX action and suggest a revised model for ETX cytotoxicity, i) ETX binds to an unidentified receptor, ii) ETX oligomerizes into a prepore on the membrane surface, and iii) the prepore inserts into membranes, in a temperature-sensitive manner, to form an active pore."
https://openalex.org/W1996149238,"Highly selective therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains an unmet medical need. In present study, we found that the tumor suppressor microRNA, let-7 was significantly downregulated in a proportion of primary HCC tissues (12 of 33, 36.4%) and HCC cell lines. In line with this finding, we have engineered a chimeric Ad5/11 fiber oncolytic adenovirus, SG7011(let7T), by introducing eight copies of let-7 target sites (let7T) into the 3' untranslated region of E1A, a key gene associated with adenoviral replication. The results showed that the E1A expression (both RNA and protein levels) of the SG7011(let7T) was tightly regulated according to the endogenous expression level of the let-7. As contrasted with the wild-type adenovirus and the control virus, the replication of SG7011(let7T) was distinctly inhibited in normal liver cells lines (i.e. L-02 and WRL-68) expressing high level of let-7 (>300 folds), whereas was almost not impaired in HCC cells (i.e. Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5) with low level of let-7. Consequently, the cytotoxicity of SG7011(let7T) to normal liver cells was successfully decreased while was almost not attenuated in HCC cells in vitro. The antitumor ability of SG7011(let7T)in vivo was maintained in mice with Hep3B xenograft tumor, whereas was greatly decreased against the SMMC-7721 xenograft tumor expressing a high level of let-7 similar with L-02 when compared to the wild-type adenovirus. These results suggested that SG7011(let7T) may be a promising anticancer agent or vector to mediate the expression of therapeutic gene, broadly applicable in the treatment for HCC and other cancers where the let-7 gene is downregulated."
https://openalex.org/W2117388360,"Background There is paucity of data from India on the impact of HIV related immunosuppression in response to TB treatment and mortality among HIV infected TB patients. We assessed the TB treatment outcome and mortality in a cohort of HIV infected TB patients treated with intermittent short course chemotherapy under TB control programme in a high HIV prevalent district of south India. Methodology/ Findings Among 3798 TB patients registered for treatment in Mysore district from July 2007 to June 2008, 281 HIV infected patients formed the study group. The socio-demographic and treatment related data of these patients was obtained from TB and HIV programme records and patient interviews 19 months after TB treatment initiation by field investigators. Treatment success rate of 281 patients was 75% while in smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases it was 62%, attributable to defaults (16%) and deaths (19%). Only 2 patients had treatment failure. Overall, 83 (30%) patients were reported dead; 26 while on treatment and 57 after TB treatment. Association of treatment related factors with treatment outcome and survival status was studied through logistic regression analysis. Factors significantly associated with ‘unfavourable outcome’ were disease classification as Pulmonary [aOR-1.96, CI (1.02–3.77)], type of patient as retreatment [aOR-4.78, CI (2.12–10.76)], and non initiation of ART [aOR-4.90, CI (1.85–12.96)]. Factors associated with ‘Death’ were non initiation of ART [aOR-2.80, CI (1.15–6.81)] and CPT [aOR-3.46, CI (1.47–8.14)]. Conclusion Despite the treatment success of 75% the high mortality (30%) in the study group is a matter of concern and needs immediate intervention. Non initiation of ART has emerged as a high risk factor for unfavourable treatment outcome and mortality. These findings underscore the importance of expanding and improving delivery of ART services as a priority and reconsideration of the programme guidelines for ART initiation in HIV infected TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2058278909,"Nutritional state often modulates olfaction and in Caenorhabditis elegans food stimulates aversive responses mediated by the nociceptive ASH sensory neurons. In the present study, we have characterized the role of key serotonergic neurons that differentially modulate aversive behavior in response to changing nutritional status. The serotonergic NSM and ADF neurons play antagonistic roles in food stimulation. NSM 5-HT activates SER-5 on the ASHs and SER-1 on the RIA interneurons and stimulates aversive responses, suggesting that food-dependent serotonergic stimulation involves local changes in 5-HT levels mediated by extrasynaptic 5-HT receptors. In contrast, ADF 5-HT activates SER-1 on the octopaminergic RIC interneurons to inhibit food–stimulation, suggesting neuron-specific stimulatory and inhibitory roles for SER-1 signaling. Both the NSMs and ADFs express INS-1, an insulin-like peptide, that appears to cell autonomously inhibit serotonergic signaling. Food also modulates directional decisions after reversal is complete, through the same serotonergic neurons and receptors involved in the initiation of reversal, and the decision to continue forward or change direction after reversal is dictated entirely by nutritional state. These results highlight the complexity of the “food signal” and serotonergic signaling in the modulation of sensory-mediated aversive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2086554843,"Marine sponges are frequently inhabited by a wide range of associated invertebrates, including caridean shrimps. Symbiotic shrimps are often considered to be commensals; however, in most cases, the relationship with sponge hosts remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that sponge-inhabiting shrimps are often parasites adapted to consumption of sponge tissues. First, we provide detailed examination of morphology and stomach contents of Typton carneus (Decapoda: Palaemonidae: Pontoniinae), a West Atlantic tropical shrimp living in fire sponges of the genus Tedania. Remarkable shear-like claws of T. carneus show evidence of intensive shearing, likely the result of crushing siliceous sponge spicules. Examination of stomach contents revealed that the host sponge tissue is a major source of food for T. carneus. A parasitic mode of life is also reflected in adaptations of mouth appendages, in the reproduction strategy, and in apparent sequestration of host pigments by shrimp. Consistent results were obtained also for congeneric species T. distinctus (Western Atlantic) and T. spongicola (Mediterranean). The distribution of shrimps among sponge hosts (mostly solitary individuals or heterosexual pairs) suggests that Typton shrimps actively prevent colonisation of their sponge by additional conspecifics, thus protecting their resource and reducing the damage to the hosts. We also demonstrate feeding on host tissues by sponge-associated shrimps of the genera Onycocaris, Periclimenaeus, and Thaumastocaris (Pontoniinae) and Synalpheus (Alpheidae). The parasitic mode of life appears to be widely distributed among sponge-inhabiting shrimps. However, it is possible that under some circumstances, the shrimps provide a service to the host sponge by preventing a penetration by potentially more damaging associated animals. The overall nature of interspecific shrimp-sponge relationships thus warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2048232741,"Multistability of oscillatory and silent regimes is a ubiquitous phenomenon exhibited by excitable systems such as neurons and cardiac cells. Multistability can play functional roles in short-term memory and maintaining posture. It seems to pose an evolutionary advantage for neurons which are part of multifunctional Central Pattern Generators to possess multistability. The mechanisms supporting multistability of bursting regimes are not well understood or classified.Our study is focused on determining the bio-physical mechanisms underlying different types of co-existence of the oscillatory and silent regimes observed in a neuronal model. We develop a low-dimensional model typifying the dynamics of a single leech heart interneuron. We carry out a bifurcation analysis of the model and show that it possesses six different types of multistability of dynamical regimes. These types are the co-existence of 1) bursting and silence, 2) tonic spiking and silence, 3) tonic spiking and subthreshold oscillations, 4) bursting and subthreshold oscillations, 5) bursting, subthreshold oscillations and silence, and 6) bursting and tonic spiking. These first five types of multistability occur due to the presence of a separating regime that is either a saddle periodic orbit or a saddle equilibrium. We found that the parameter range wherein multistability is observed is limited by the parameter values at which the separating regimes emerge and terminate.We developed a neuronal model which exhibits a rich variety of different types of multistability. We described a novel mechanism supporting the bistability of bursting and silence. This neuronal model provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of networks with neurons possessing different types of multistability."

https://openalex.org/W2054140248,"The nonvirion (NV) protein of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) has been previously reported to be essential for efficient growth and pathogenicity of IHNV. However, little is known about the mechanism by which the NV supports the viral growth. In this study, cellular localization of NV and its role in IHNV growth in host cells was investigated. Through transient transfection in RTG-2 cells of NV fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), a nuclear localization of NV was demonstrated. Deletion analyses showed that the 32EGDL35 residues were essential for nuclear localization of NV protein, and fusion of these 4 amino acids to GFP directed its transport to the nucleus. We generated a recombinant IHNV, rIHNV-NV-ΔEGDL in which the 32EGDL35 was deleted from the NV. rIHNVs with wild-type NV (rIHNV-NV) or with the NV gene replaced with GFP (rIHNV-ΔNV-GFP) were used as controls. RTG-2 cells infected with rIHNV-ΔNV-GFP and rIHNV-NV-ΔEGDL yielded 12- and 5-fold less infectious virion, respectively, than wild type rIHNV-infected cells at 48 h post-infection (p.i.). While treatment with poly I∶C at 24 h p.i. did not inhibit replication of wild-type rIHNVs, replication rates of rIHNV-ΔNV-GFP and rIHNV-NV-ΔEGDL were inhibited by poly I∶C. In addition, both rIHNV-ΔNV and rIHNV-NV-ΔEGDL induced higher levels of expressions of both IFN1 and Mx1 than wild-type rIHNV. These data suggest that the IHNV NV may support the growth of IHNV through inhibition of the INF system and the amino acid residues of 32EGDL35 responsible for nuclear localization are important for the inhibitory activity of NV."
https://openalex.org/W1989796002,"Vertebrate embryos are derived from a transitory pool of pluripotent cells. By the process of embryonic induction, these precursor cells are assigned to specific fates and differentiation programs. Histone post-translational modifications are thought to play a key role in the establishment and maintenance of stable gene expression patterns underlying these processes. While on gene level histone modifications are known to change during differentiation, very little is known about the quantitative fluctuations in bulk histone modifications during development. To investigate this issue we analysed histones isolated from four different developmental stages of Xenopus laevis by mass spectrometry. In toto, we quantified 59 modification states on core histones H3 and H4 from blastula to tadpole stages. During this developmental period, we observed in general an increase in the unmodified states, and a shift from histone modifications associated with transcriptional activity to transcriptionally repressive histone marks. We also compared these naturally occurring patterns with the histone modifications of murine ES cells, detecting large differences in the methylation patterns of histone H3 lysines 27 and 36 between pluripotent ES cells and pluripotent cells from Xenopus blastulae. By combining all detected modification transitions we could cluster their patterns according to their embryonic origin, defining specific histone modification profiles (HMPs) for each developmental stage. To our knowledge, this data set represents the first compendium of covalent histone modifications and their quantitative flux during normogenesis in a vertebrate model organism. The HMPs indicate a stepwise maturation of the embryonic epigenome, which may be causal to the progressing restriction of cellular potency during development."

Differences in cellular morphology, uptake, and viability were assessed after treatment with either microencapsulated or unencapsulated dots. Specifically, QDs contained in microcapsules terminated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) mitigate contact with and uptake by cells, thus providing a tool to retain particle luminescence for applications such as extracellular sensing and imaging. The microcapsule serves as the “first line of defense” for containing the QDs. This enables the individual QD coating to be designed primarily to enhance the function of the biosensor."
https://openalex.org/W2050002984,"Spirochetes causing Lyme borreliosis are obligate parasites that can only be found in a tick vector or a vertebrate host. The ability to survive in these two disparate environments requires up and downregulation of specific genes by regulatory circuits that remain largely obscure. In this work on the Lyme spirochete, B. burgdorferi, we show that a disruption of the hrpA gene, which encodes a putative RNA helicase, results in a complete loss in the ability of the spirochetes to infect mice by needle inoculation. Studies of protein expression in culture by 2D gels revealed a change in the expression of 33 proteins in hrpA clones relative to the wild-type parent. Quantitative characterization of protein expression by iTRAQ analysis revealed a total of 187 differentially regulated proteins in an hrpA background: 90 downregulated and 97 upregulated. Forty-two of the 90 downregulated and 65 of the 97 upregulated proteins are not regulated under any conditions by the previously reported regulators in B. burgdorferi (bosR, rrp2, rpoN, rpoS or rrp1). Downregulated and upregulated proteins also fell into distinct functional categories. We conclude that HrpA is part of a new and distinct global regulatory pathway in B. burgdorferi gene expression. Because an HrpA orthologue is present in many bacteria, its participation in global regulation in B. burgdorferi may have relevance in other bacterial species where its function remains obscure. We believe this to be the first report of a role for an RNA helicase in a global regulatory pathway in bacteria. This finding is particularly timely with the recent growth of the field of RNA regulation of gene expression and the ability of RNA helicases to modulate RNA structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1987993382,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the normal development of thyroid gland, but its disregulation provokes the appearance of several types of cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) which are the most common thyroid tumours. The follow-up of PTC patients is based on the monitoring of serum thyroglobulin levels which is regulated by the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1): a tissue-specific transcription factor essential for the differentiation of the thyroid. We investigated whether the Wnt/β-catenin pathway might regulate TTF-1 expression in a human PTC model and examined the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. Immunofluorescence analysis, real time RT-PCR and Western blot studies revealed that TTF-1 as well as the major Wnt pathway components are co-expressed in TPC-1 cells and human PTC tumours. Knocking-down the Wnt/β-catenin components by siRNAs inhibited both TTF-1 transcript and protein expression, while mimicking the activation of Wnt signaling by lithium chloride induced TTF-1 gene and protein expression. Functional promoter studies and ChIP analysis showed that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway exerts its effect by means of the binding of β-catenin to TCF/LEF transcription factors on the level of an active TCF/LEF response element at [-798, -792 bp] in TTF-1 promoter. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a direct and forward driver of the TTF-1 expression. The localization of TCF-4 and TTF-1 in the same area of PTC tissues might be of clinical relevance, and justifies further examination of these factors in the papillary thyroid cancers follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W1979402671,"The pivotal role of spleen CD4(+) T cells in the development of both malaria pathogenesis and protective immunity makes necessary a profound comprehension of the mechanisms involved in their activation and regulation during Plasmodium infection. Herein, we examined in detail the behaviour of non-conventional and conventional splenic CD4(+) T cells during P. chabaudi malaria. We took advantage of the fact that a great proportion of CD4(+) T cells generated in CD1d(-/-) mice are I-A(b)-restricted (conventional cells), while their counterparts in I-A(b-/-) mice are restricted by CD1d and other class IB major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (non-conventional cells). We found that conventional CD4(+) T cells are the main protagonists of the immune response to infection, which develops in two consecutive phases concomitant with acute and chronic parasitaemias. The early phase of the conventional CD4(+) T cell response is intense and short lasting, rapidly providing large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines and helping follicular and marginal zone B cells to secrete polyclonal immunoglobulin. Both TNF-α and IFN-γ production depend mostly on conventional CD4(+) T cells. IFN-γ is produced simultaneously by non-conventional and conventional CD4(+) T cells. The early phase of the response finishes after a week of infection, with the elimination of a large proportion of CD4(+) T cells, which then gives opportunity to the development of acquired immunity. Unexpectedly, the major contribution of CD1d-restricted CD4(+) T cells occurs at the beginning of the second phase of the response, but not earlier, helping both IFN-γ and parasite-specific antibody production. We concluded that conventional CD4(+) T cells have a central role from the onset of P. chabaudi malaria, acting in parallel with non-conventional CD4(+) T cells as a link between innate and acquired immunity. This study contributes to the understanding of malaria immunology and opens a perspective for future studies designed to decipher the molecular mechanisms behind immune responses to Plasmodium infection."
https://openalex.org/W2134433534,"Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB appears to be involved in different stages of atherogenesis. In this paper we investigate the role of NF-κB inhibitor IκBα in atherosclerosis. Myeloid-specific deletion of IκBα results in larger and more advanced lesions in LDL-R-deficient mice without affecting the compositional phenotype of the plaques or systemic inflammatory markers in the plasma. We show that IκBα-deleted macrophages display enhanced adhesion to an in vitro endothelial cell layer, coinciding with an increased expression of the chemokine CCL5. Also, in vivo we found that IκBαdel mice had more leukocytes adhering to the luminal side of the endothelial cell layers that cover the atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, we introduce ER-MP58 in this paper as a new immunohistochemical tool for quantifying newly recruited myeloid cells in the atherosclerotic lesion. This staining confirms that in IκBαdel mice more leukocytes are attracted to the plaques. In conclusion, we show that IκBα deletion in myeloid cells promotes atherogenesis, probably through an induced leukocyte recruitment to plaques."
https://openalex.org/W2050194345,"Gastrulation is the central event in organizing the body plan of the embryo. It transforms a single layer of epithelial cells, called the epiblast, into the three germ layers—ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—that give rise to all of the tissues and organs of the embryo. In addition to changes in gene expression that define the different germ layers, gastrula-tion is also an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that generates migratory cells of the mesoderm and endoderm. The gastrulation EMT in the mouse takes place at a structure called the primitive streak (light blue) at the posterior pole of the embryo. Gastrulation in the mouse initiates at embryonic day 6.25 (e6.25) and continues for several days.Cells adopt different fates depending on when they leave the streak. The first cells to exit from the streak give rise to extraembryonic, cardiac, and cranial mesoderm, as well as definitive endoderm. Later cells give rise to lateral plate and then paraxial mesoderm. Thus, the primitive streak is a stable entity that continually proliferates and generates an ordered series of cell types through an EMT. Recent evidence suggests that, if cells are forced to undergo EMT, they adopt a stem cell-like state and now contribute to a variety of cell fates. This SnapShot depicts the signals and transcription factors, which are required for the establishment, maintenance, and termination of the primitive streak, and illustrates how this process endows stem cell-like fate on the cells that have delaminated from the epiblast."

For successful evolution, the information carrier (either RNA or DNA or their precursor) must be transmitted to the next generation with a minimal number of misprints. In Eigen's theory, the maximum chain length that could be maintained is restricted to nucleotides, while for the most primitive genome the length is around . This is the famous error catastrophe paradox. How to solve this puzzle is an interesting and important problem in the theory of the origin of life. Methodology/Principal Findings We use methods of statistical physics to solve this paradox by carefully analyzing the implications of neutral and lethal mutants, and truncated selection (i.e., when fitness is zero after a certain Hamming distance from the master sequence) for the critical chain length. While neutral mutants play an important role in evolution, they do not provide a solution to the paradox. We have found that lethal mutants and truncated selection together can solve the error catastrophe paradox. There is a principal difference between prebiotic molecule self-replication and proto-cell self-replication stages in the origin of life. Conclusions/Significance We have applied methods of statistical physics to make an important breakthrough in the molecular theory of the origin of life. Our results will inspire further studies on the molecular theory of the origin of life and biological evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2139242225,"Aims TCF7L2 variants have been associated with type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and deficits in proinsulin processing and insulin secretion. Here we sought to test whether these effects were apparent in high-risk individuals and modify treatment responses. Methods We examined the potential role of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant in predicting resistance to weight loss or a lack of improvement of proinsulin processing during 2.5-years of follow-up participants (N = 2,994) from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized controlled trial designed to prevent or delay diabetes in high-risk adults. Results We observed no difference in the degree of weight loss by rs7903146 genotypes. However, the T allele (conferring higher risk of diabetes) at rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting proinsulin at baseline (P<0.001), higher baseline proinsulin∶insulin ratio (p<0.0001) and increased proinsulin∶insulin ratio over a median of 2.5 years of follow-up (P = 0.003). Effects were comparable across treatment arms. Conclusions The combination of a lack of impact of the TCF7L2 genotypes on the ability to lose weight, but the presence of a consistent effect on the proinsulin∶insulin ratio over the course of DPP, suggests that high-risk genotype carriers at this locus can successfully lose weight to counter diabetes risk despite persistent deficits in insulin production."

Combined therapy is envisioned as an ideal approach since it may enhance efficacy by acting upon different cellular targets, may reduce toxicity and minimize the risk of drug resistance. Therefore, we investigated the activity of benznidazole (Bz) in combination with the diamidine prodrug DB289 and in combination with the arylimidamide DB766 upon T. cruzi infection in vivo. The oral treatment of T.cruzi-infected mice with DB289 and Benznidazole (Bz) alone reduced the number of circulating parasites compared with untreated mice by about 70% and 90%, respectively. However, the combination of these two compounds decreased the parasitemia by 99% and protected against animal mortality by 100%, but without providing a parasitological cure. When Bz (p.o) was combined with DB766 (via i.p. route), at least a 99.5% decrease in parasitemia levels was observed. DB766+Bz also provided 100% protection against mice mortality while Bz alone provided about 87% protection. This combined therapy also reduced the tissular lesions induced by T. cruzi infection: Bz alone reduced GPT and CK plasma levels by about 12% and 78% compared to untreated mice group, the combination of Bz with DB766 resulted in a reduction of GPT and CK plasma levels of 56% and 91%. Cure assessment through hemocultive and PCR approaches showed that Bz did not provide a parasitological cure, however, DB766 alone or associated with Bz cured ≥13% of surviving animals."
https://openalex.org/W2028343747,"Ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (IR) produces injury to brain, eye and other tissues, contributing to the progression of important clinical pathologies. The response of cells to IR involves activation of several signaling pathways including those activating hypoxia and heat shock responsive transcription factors. However, specific roles of these responses in limiting cell damage and preventing cell death after IR have not been fully elucidated. Here, we have examined the role of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in the response of zebrafish embryos to hypoxia and subsequent return to normoxic conditions (HR) as a model for IR. Heat shock preconditioning elevated heat shock protein expression and protected zebrafish embryo eye and brain tissues against HR-induced apoptosis. These effects were inhibited by translational suppression of HSF1 expression. Reduced expression of HSF1 also increased cell death in brain and eye tissues of embryos subjected to hypoxia and reperfusion without prior heat shock. Surprisingly, reduced expression of HSF1 had only a modest effect on hypoxia-induced expression of Hsp70 and no effect on hypoxia-induced expression of Hsp27. These results establish the zebrafish embryo as a model for the study of ischemic injury in the brain and eye and reveal a critical role for HSF1 in the response of these tissues to HR. Our results also uncouple the role of HSF1 expression from that of Hsp27, a well characterized heat shock protein considered essential for cell survival after hypoxia. Alternative roles for HSF1 are considered."

Previously, we demonstrated that the G1613A mutation in the HBV negative regulatory element (NRE) is a hotspot mutation in HCC patients. In this study, we further investigated the functional consequences of this mutation in the context of the full length HBV genome and its replication. We showed that the G1613A mutation significantly suppresses the secretion of e antigen (HBeAg) and enhances the synthesis of viral DNA, which is in consistence to our clinical result that the G1613A mutation associates with high viral load in chronic HBV carriers. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of the mutation, we performed the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the recombinant RFX1 protein, a trans-activator that was shown to interact with the NRE of HBV. Intriguingly, RFX1 binds to the G1613A mutant with higher affinity than the wild-type sequence, indicating that the mutation possesses the trans-activating effect to the core promoter via NRE. The trans-activating effect was further validated by the enhancement of the core promoter activity after overexpression of RFX1 in liver cell line. In summary, our results suggest the functional consequences of the hotspot G1613A mutation found in HBV. We also provide a possible molecular mechanism of this hotspot mutation to the increased viral load of HBV carriers, which increases the risk to HCC."

All consecutively registered retreatment TB patients during a defined 15-day period in these 36 districts were contacted and the information on the source of previous treatment sought.Data was collected from all 1712 retreatment TB patients registered in the identified districts during the study period. The data includes information on 595 'relapse' cases, 105 'failure' cases, 437 'treatment after default (TAD)' cases and 575 're-treatment others' cases. The source of most recent previous anti-tuberculosis therapy for 754 [44% (95% CI, 38.2%-49.9%)] of the re-treatment TB patients was from providers outside the TB control programme. A higher proportion of patients registered as TAD (64%) and 'retreatment others' (59%) were likely to be treated outside the National Programme, when compared to the proportion among 'relapse' (22%) or 'failure' (6%). Extrapolated to national registration, of the 292,972 re-treatment registrations in 2010, 128,907 patients would have been most recently treated outside the national programme.Nearly half of the re-treatment cases registered with the national programme were most recently treated outside the programme setting. Enhanced efforts towards extending treatment support and supervision to patients treated by private sector treatment providers are urgently required to improve the quality of treatment and reduce the numbers of patients with recurrent disease. In addition, reasons for the large number of recurrent TB cases from those already treated by the national programme require urgent detailed investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2087341472,"Aims Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)-containing amyloid is frequently found in the elderly heart. No data exist regarding ANP aggregation process and its link to pathologies. Our aims were: i) to experimentally prove the presumptive association of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Isolated Atrial Amyloidosis (IAA); ii) to characterize ANP aggregation, thereby elucidating IAA implication in the CHF pathogenesis. Methods and Results A significant prevalence (85%) of IAA was immunohistochemically proven ex vivo in biopsies from CHF patients. We investigated in vitro (using Congo Red, Thioflavin T, SDS-PAGE, transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy) ANP fibrillogenesis, starting from α-ANP as well as the ability of dimeric β-ANP to promote amyloid formation. Different conditions were adopted, including those reproducing β-ANP prevalence in CHF. Our results defined the uncommon rapidity of α-ANP self-assembly at acidic pH supporting the hypothesis that such aggregates constitute the onset of a fibrillization process subsequently proceeding at physiological pH. Interestingly, CHF-like conditions induced the production of the most stable and time-resistant ANP fibrils suggesting that CHF affected people may be prone to develop IAA. Conclusions We established a link between IAA and CHF by ex vivo examination and assessed that β-ANP is, in vitro, the seed of ANP fibrils. Our results indicate that β-ANP plays a crucial role in ANP amyloid deposition under physiopathological CHF conditions. Overall, our findings indicate that early IAA-related ANP deposition may occur in CHF and suggest that these latter patients should be monitored for the development of cardiac amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998147476,"Background The computation of pattern motion in visual area MT based on motion input from area V1 has been investigated in many experiments and models attempting to replicate the main mechanisms. Two different core conceptual approaches were developed to explain the findings. In integrationist models the key mechanism to achieve pattern selectivity is the nonlinear integration of V1 motion activity. In contrast, selectionist models focus on the motion computation at positions with 2D features. Methodology/Principal Findings Recent experiments revealed that neither of the two concepts alone is sufficient to explain all experimental data and that most of the existing models cannot account for the complex behaviour found. MT pattern selectivity changes over time for stimuli like type II plaids from vector average to the direction computed with an intersection of constraint rule or by feature tracking. Also, the spatial arrangement of the stimulus within the receptive field of a MT cell plays a crucial role. We propose a recurrent neural model showing how feature integration and selection can be combined into one common architecture to explain these findings. The key features of the model are the computation of 1D and 2D motion in model area V1 subpopulations that are integrated in model MT cells using feedforward and feedback processing. Our results are also in line with findings concerning the solution of the aperture problem. Conclusions/Significance We propose a new neural model for MT pattern computation and motion disambiguation that is based on a combination of feature selection and integration. The model can explain a range of recent neurophysiological findings including temporally dynamic behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2020967192,"We explored the use of support vector machines (SVM) in order to analyze the ensemble activities of 24 postural and focal muscles recorded during a whole body pointing task. Because of the large number of variables involved in motor control studies, such multivariate methods have much to offer over the standard univariate techniques that are currently employed in the field to detect modifications. The SVM was used to uncover the principle differences underlying several variations of the task. Five variants of the task were used. An unconstrained reaching, two constrained at the focal level and two at the postural level. Using the electromyographic (EMG) data, the SVM proved capable of distinguishing all the unconstrained from the constrained conditions with a success of approximately 80% or above. In all cases, including those with focal constraints, the collective postural muscle EMGs were as good as or better than those from focal muscles for discriminating between conditions. This was unexpected especially in the case with focal constraints. In trying to rank the importance of particular features of the postural EMGs we found the maximum amplitude rather than the moment at which it occurred to be more discriminative. A classification using the muscles one at a time permitted us to identify some of the postural muscles that are significantly altered between conditions. In this case, the use of a multivariate method also permitted the use of the entire muscle EMG waveform rather than the difficult process of defining and extracting any particular variable. The best accuracy was obtained from muscles of the leg rather than from the trunk. By identifying the features that are important in discrimination, the use of the SVM permitted us to identify some of the features that are adapted when constraints are placed on a complex motor task."

Confocal, two–photon and optical coherence tomography (OCT) based on GRIN optical probes permit in–vivo imaging with penetration depths into tissue up to the centimeter range. However, insertion of the probe can be complicated by the need of several alignment and focusing mechanisms along the optical path. Furthermore, resolution values are generally not limited by diffraction, but rather by optical aberrations within the endoscope probe and feeding optics. Here we describe a multiphoton confocal fluorescence imaging system equipped with a compact objective that incorporates a GRIN probe and requires no adjustment mechanisms.

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare expression of 22 genes among these tissues. Distal carotid and femoral gene expression was not significantly different, permitting the distal carotid segments to be used as a paired control for their corresponding proximal regions. Analysis of the paired plaques revealed differences in 16 genes that impact plaque stability: matrix metalloproteinases (MMP, higher in vulnerable), MMP modulators (inhibitors: lower, activators: higher in vulnerable), activating Fc receptors (FcγR, higher in vulnerable) and FcγR signaling molecules (higher in vulnerable). Surprisingly, the relative expression of smooth muscle cell and macrophage markers in the three plaque types was not significantly different, suggesting that macrophage distribution and/or activation state correlates with (in)stability. Immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophages and smooth muscle cells localize to distinct and non-overlapping regions in all plaques. MMP protein localized to macrophage-rich regions. In vitro, treatment of macrophages with immune complexes, but not oxidized low density lipoprotein, C-reactive protein, or TNF-α, induced a gene expression profile similar to that of the vulnerable plaques. That ligation of FcγR recapitulates the pattern of gene expression in vulnerable plaques suggests that the FcγR → macrophage activation pathway may play a greater role in human plaque vulnerability than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2092060967,"The availability of an adequate blood supply is a critical public health need. An influenza epidemic or another crisis affecting population mobility could create a critical donor shortage, which could profoundly impact blood availability. We developed a simulation model for the blood supply environment in the United States to assess the likely impact on blood availability of factors such as an epidemic. We developed a simulator of a multi-state model with transitions among states. Weekly numbers of blood units donated and needed were generated by negative binomial stochastic processes. The simulator allows exploration of the blood system under certain conditions of supply and demand rates, and can be used for planning purposes to prepare for sudden changes in the public's health. The simulator incorporates three donor groups (first-time, sporadic, and regular), immigration and emigration, deferral period, and adjustment factors for recruitment. We illustrate possible uses of the simulator by specifying input values for an -week flu epidemic, resulting in a moderate supply shock and demand spike (for example, from postponed elective surgeries), and different recruitment strategies. The input values are based in part on data from a regional blood center of the American Red Cross during –. Our results from these scenarios suggest that the key to alleviating deficit effects of a system shock may be appropriate timing and duration of recruitment efforts, in turn depending critically on anticipating shocks and rapidly implementing recruitment efforts."
https://openalex.org/W1965721211,"In many economies, wealth is strikingly concentrated. Entrepreneurs--individuals with ownership in for-profit enterprises--comprise a large portion of the wealthiest individuals, and their behavior may help explain patterns in the national distribution of wealth. Entrepreneurs are less diversified and more heavily invested in their own companies than is commonly assumed in economic models. We present an intentionally simplified individual-based model of wealth generation among entrepreneurs to assess the role of chance and determinism in the distribution of wealth. We demonstrate that chance alone, combined with the deterministic effects of compounding returns, can lead to unlimited concentration of wealth, such that the percentage of all wealth owned by a few entrepreneurs eventually approaches 100%. Specifically, concentration of wealth results when the rate of return on investment varies by entrepreneur and by time. This result is robust to inclusion of realities such as differing skill among entrepreneurs. The most likely overall growth rate of the economy decreases as businesses become less diverse, suggesting that high concentrations of wealth may adversely affect a country's economic growth. We show that a tax on large inherited fortunes, applied to a small portion of the most fortunate in the population, can efficiently arrest the concentration of wealth at intermediate levels."
https://openalex.org/W1980329786,"The cytoplasmic localization of Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NcoA4), also referred to as androgen receptor associated protein 70 (ARA70), indicates it may possess activities in addition to its role within the nucleus as a transcriptional enhancer. Towards identifying novel functions of NcoA4, we performed an in silico analysis of its amino acid sequence to identify potential functional domains and related proteins, and examined its subcellular distribution throughout the cell cycle. NcoA4 has no known or predicted functional or structural domains with the exception of an LxxLL and FxxLF nuclear receptor interaction motif and an N-terminal putative coiled-coil domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NcoA4 has no paralogs and that a region referred to as ARA70-I family domain, located within the N-terminus and overlapping with the coiled-coil domain, is evolutionarily conserved in metazoans ranging from cnidarians to mammals. An adjacent conserved region, designated ARA70-II family domain, with no significant sequence similarity to the ARA70-I domain, is restricted to vertebrates. We demonstrate NcoA4 co-localizes with microtubules and microtubule organizing centers during prophase. Strong NcoA4 accumulation at the centrosomes was detected during interphase and telophase, with decreased levels at metaphase and anaphase. NcoA4 co-localized with tubulin and acetylated tubulin to the mitotic spindles during metaphase and anaphase, and to midbodies during telophase. Consistent with these observations, we demonstrated an interaction between NcoA4 and α-tubulin. Co-localization was not observed with microfilaments. These findings indicate a dynamic distribution of NcoA4 with components of the mitotic apparatus that is consistent with a potential non-transcriptional regulatory function(s) during cell division, which may be evolutionarily conserved."

Funding injections by British Petroleum this summer are fueling studies in the Gulf Coast, raising hopes that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill might provide answers to long-standing questions on the nature of cellular toxicity. Rebecca Alvania investigates. “We saw the oil coming and since we're local we were able to scramble and get out there to get baseline data.” The coastal marshes of South Louisiana are teeming with valuable wildlife, but when Andrew Whitehead, assistant professor at Louisiana State University, dons hip-waders he isn't looking for alligators, shrimp, or crawfish. He's hunting killifish, specifically the Fundulus species. Indigenous throughout the United States, the killifish is well known in toxicology circles for its ability to adapt to heavily polluted environs. And the hundreds of miles of Louisiana wetlands—drenched in last year's Deepwater oil spill—are no exception.Grand Terre Island in Barataria Bay, Louisiana.

The deadline for proposals was this past July, and funds are scheduled to be administered late this summer. Although the research themes are broad, a hefty portion of funds will go to investigating the spill's impact on local organisms. In the past, this has meant monitoring phenotypic changes, but genomic technologies are revamping this approach. Whitehead is part of a new breed of ecological genomicists, who are using microarray analysis, sequencing, and transcriptomics to understand how genomes adapt to environmental stresses, over both physiological and evolutionary timescales. What he and others are realizing is that even sublethal doses of oil can have profound, long-term effects on an animal's ability to cope with its environment. Could this new infusion of BP funds help these researchers fill in some of the blanks between oil spill and phenotype? Crude oil contains thousands of compounds, but in terms of toxicity, polycyclic aryl hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key. PAHs contain benzene rings fused together so that adjacent rings share two carbon bonds. PAHs in oil range in ring number from 2 to 8, with the majority containing 2–4 rings. Higher-molecular-weight PAHs—those with 5 or more rings—are at much lower levels in oil. Historically, smaller PAHs (2–3 rings) are thought to induce a relatively low level of toxicity by generally disrupting cell membranes. In contrast, larger PAHs (>4 rings) are excellent agonists for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and activation of this receptor seems to underlie much of their toxicity. Higher-molecular-weight PAHs enter the cell and bind to the AhR, a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, AhR sits in the cytoplasm as an inactive protein complex with chaperones, such Hsp90, p23, and XAP2. Upon binding to a PAH, the AhR moves into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The pair then activates a battery of genes, including enzymes from the cytochrome p450 superfamily (primarily CYP1A for PAHs), which oxidize compounds into easily secreted metabolites. For some chemicals, these oxidized metabolites are more reactive and toxic than the parent compounds. Although the AhR pathway and PAHs have been studied for decades, recent evidence suggests that what we know about PAH toxicity could be merely the tip of the iceberg. For one, smaller PAHs might not be quite as nonspecific as once thought. John Incardona, a researcher from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle, WA, has been instrumental in assessing the impact of PAHs after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. He found that some small PAHs disrupt the electrical coordination between the atria and ventricles in zebrafish embryos, causing heart defects during morphogenesis (Incardona et al., 2004, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 196, 191–205). Surprisingly, this effect is specific to 3-ring PAHs, suggesting that some cells contain a receptor for this class of PAHs. Incardona is now investigating whether 3-ring PAHs specifically interact with cardiac channels or interfere with their expression levels. According to Incardona, the specificity doesn't stop with ring number. When he exposes zebrafish embryos to three different 4-ring PAHs, each compound localizes to different tissues of the embryo, resulting in unique developmental defects (Incardona et al., 2006, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 217, 308–321). Thus, a complex mixture of PAHs, like in an oil spill, could have an equally complex effect on organisms exposed to it. Interestingly, the developmental impacts of the 4-ring PAHs appear to depend on the AhR but not its well-known target CYP1A, which highlights just how little is known about the AhR. According to Whitehead, the AhR is still quite enigmatic and a major black box to toxicologists. The AhR appears to play important roles in normal development, particularly in the vasculature. More recent evidence ties the AhR to immune responses. However, no endogenous ligands are known for the receptor, and its downstream genes and crosstalk with other pathways are not well characterized. Without these mechanistic details, it's hard to say how AhR activation by one particular PAH causes a specific phenotype. Furthermore, each oil spill contains a unique mixture of PAHs and other toxins. Thus, if researchers want to understand how Deepwater is impacting local organisms, they have to go to the source. For instance, Kevin Kleinow, a veterinarian and toxicologist at Louisiana State University, uses samples of the oil mixture that washed up along the Louisiana coast to study its impact on zebrafish development. He's particularly interested in teasing apart the effects of exposure at different developmental stages, with hopes of extrapolating his results to local organisms. The Gulf is home to an enormous variety of animals that breed at various times. Knowing which species laid eggs around the time of the spill, and the potential developmental impacts of the oil mixture at those stages, could help to anticipate the challenges that the Gulf's ecosystems face during recovery. Kleinow and Whitehead both stress that to understand the acute impact of a spill requires the identification of oil-induced phenotypes. But to predict long-term effects on an ecosystem, scientists need to look for signs of oil exposure that precede observable defects. “Years ago, people defined interaction with oil as either a developmental abnormality or acute toxicity,” says Kleinow. “Now, we're finding that those are gross indicators, and we're looking at the cellular and biochemical level. I think the bar is being lowered so to speak. Usually, cellular or biochemical changes will occur way before physiological effects.” Recently, Incardona and colleagues treated zebrafish embryos with extremely low and transient doses of 3-ring PAHs—similar to what a fish might see after a spill is largely cleaned up. Although animals survived into adulthood, they exhibited subtle changes in heart shape and reduced swimming abilities (Hicken et al., 2011, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108, 7086–7090). Thus, exposure to even minute amounts of PAHs during critical developmental periods could cause phenotypic changes that, although not obvious, could make adult animals less fit. In other words, when it comes to an oil spill, even what you can't see can hurt you. “The public sees birds and other animals covered in oil and dying from acute exposure and think, well once those are gone it's over,” explains Whitehead. “But if we've learned anything from [the Exxon Valdez spill] it's that it's the low level effects that are important in the long term.” The trick is identifying these sublethal impacts, and that's where the killifish comes in. There are ∼1270 killifish species across the United States, and a few populations have independently evolved to live in highly polluted sites. Whitehead has both pollution-tolerant and pollution-sensitive killifish in the lab. He exposes them to toxins and then performs microarray analysis to compare gene expression changes in the two populations (Whitehead et al., 2010, Mol. Ecol. 19, 5186–5203). So far, he's found that tolerant fish repress AhR-dependent transcription, but more work is needed to nail down the mechanism. Ironically, the Deepwater spill occurred while Whitehead was already immersed in these studies, and the ecological genomicist found himself with something that field researchers rarely have: before and after time points. “Having before event data…is pretty rare,” states Whitehead. “Usually you're going in after the event has occurred. But with this we saw the oil coming and since we're local we were able to scramble and get out there to get baseline data. From an environmental and personal perspective, you're thinking ‘I hope nothing gets hit’ but from a scientific perspective you're thinking ‘I hope we get hit’.” Whitehead is now performing microarray analysis on local killifish to identify gene expression changes after exposure to the Deepwater spill. One possibility is that there could be sublethal molecular impacts that make animals more susceptible to a second stressor. An estuary like the Gulf, for instance, has regular changes in salinity. Events that reduce an animal's ability to respond to such fluctuations could make it less fit to live in that environment."
