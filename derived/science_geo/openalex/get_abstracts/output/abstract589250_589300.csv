https://openalex.org/W2694038906,"HP1a can nucleate into foci that display liquid properties during the early stages of heterochromatin domain formation in Drosophila embryos, suggesting that the repressive action of heterochromatin may be mediated in part by emergent properties of phase separation. The gene-silencing action of heterochromatin is thought to arise from the spread of proteins such as HP1 that compact the underlying chromatin and recruit repressors. Two papers in this issue demonstrate that HP1α has the ability to form phase-separated droplets. Gary Karpen and colleagues show that HP1α can nucleate into foci that display liquid properties during the early stages of heterochromatin domain formation in Drosophila embryos. Geeta Narlikar and colleagues demonstrate that human HP1α protein also forms phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation or DNA binding promotes the physical partitioning of HP1α out of the soluble aqueous phase into droplets. These related findings suggest that the repressive action of heterochromatin may be in part mediated by the phase separation of HP1, with the droplets being initiated or dissolved by various ligands depending on nuclear context. Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability1, and silencing of transposon and gene expression2. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA3. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments4. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid–liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions."

Gene silencing by heterochromatin is proposed to occur in part as a result of the ability of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins to spread across large regions of the genome, compact the underlying chromatin and recruit diverse ligands1,2,3. Here we identify a new property of the human HP1α protein: the ability to form phase-separated droplets. While unmodified HP1α is soluble, either phosphorylation of its N-terminal extension or DNA binding promotes the formation of phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation-driven phase separation can be promoted or reversed by specific HP1α ligands. Known components of heterochromatin such as nucleosomes and DNA preferentially partition into the HP1α droplets, but molecules such as the transcription factor TFIIB show no preference. Using a single-molecule DNA curtain assay, we find that both unmodified and phosphorylated HP1α induce rapid compaction of DNA strands into puncta, although with different characteristics4. We show by direct protein delivery into mammalian cells that an HP1α mutant incapable of phase separation in vitro forms smaller and fewer nuclear puncta than phosphorylated HP1α. These findings suggest that heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing may occur in part through sequestration of compacted chromatin in phase-separated HP1 droplets, which are dissolved or formed by specific ligands on the basis of nuclear context."
https://openalex.org/W2700382303,"The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range-which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people."
https://openalex.org/W2670890989,"T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCRβ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2671261300,"T cells are defined by a heterodimeric surface receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), that mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs are generated by genomic rearrangement of the germline TCR locus, a process termed V(D)J recombination, that has the potential to generate marked diversity of TCRs (estimated to range from 1015 (ref. 1) to as high as 1061 (ref. 2) possible receptors). Despite this potential diversity, TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, suggesting that it may be possible to predictively model epitope specificity. Here we report the in-depth characterization of ten epitope-specific TCR repertoires of CD8+ T cells from mice and humans, representing over 4,600 in-frame single-cell-derived TCRαβ sequence pairs from 110 subjects. We developed analytical tools to characterize these epitope-specific repertoires: a distance measure on the space of TCRs that permits clustering and visualization, a robust repertoire diversity metric that accommodates the low number of paired public receptors observed when compared to single-chain analyses, and a distance-based classifier that can assign previously unobserved TCRs to characterized repertoires with robust sensitivity and specificity. Our analyses demonstrate that each epitope-specific repertoire contains a clustered group of receptors that share core sequence similarities, together with a dispersed set of diverse 'outlier' sequences. By identifying shared motifs in core sequences, we were able to highlight key conserved residues driving essential elements of TCR recognition. These analyses provide insights into the generalizable, underlying features of epitope-specific repertoires and adaptive immune recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2628771438,"The functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds is one of the most attractive strategies for molecular construction in organic chemistry. The hydrogen atom is considered to be an ideal coupling handle, owing to its relative abundance in organic molecules and its availability for functionalization at almost any stage in a synthetic sequence. Although many C-H functionalization reactions involve C(sp3)-C(sp2) coupling, there is a growing demand for C-H alkylation reactions, wherein sp3 C-H bonds are replaced with sp3 C-alkyl groups. Here we describe a polarity-match-based selective sp3 C-H alkylation via the combination of photoredox, nickel and hydrogen-atom transfer catalysis. This methodology simultaneously uses three catalytic cycles to achieve hydridic C-H bond abstraction (enabled by polarity matching), alkyl halide oxidative addition, and reductive elimination to enable alkyl-alkyl fragment coupling. The sp3 C-H alkylation is highly selective for the α-C-H of amines, ethers and sulphides, which are commonly found in pharmaceutically relevant architectures. This cross-coupling protocol should enable broad synthetic applications in de novo synthesis and late-stage functionalization chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2654846770,"An individual's chronotype reflects how the circadian system embeds itself into the 24-h day with rhythms in physiology, cognition and behavior occurring accordingly earlier or later. In view of an increasing number of people working at unusual times and linked health and safety risks, the wide range in human chronotypes may provide opportunities to allow people to work (and sleep) at times that are in synch with their circadian physiology. We aimed at estimating the distribution of chronotypes in the US population by age and sex. Twelve years (2003-2014) of pooled diary data from the American Time Use Survey were used to calculate chronotype based on mid-point of sleep on weekends (MSFWe, n = 53,689). We observed a near-normal distribution overall and within each age group. The distribution's mean value is systematically different with age, shifting later during adolescence, showing a peak in 'lateness' at ~19 years, and shifting earlier thereafter. Men are typically later chronotypes than women before 40, but earlier types after 40. The greatest differences are observed between 15 and 25 for both sexes, equaling more than 50% of the total chronotype difference across all age groups. The variability in chronotype decreases with age, but is generally higher in males than females. This is the first study to estimate the distribution and prevalence of individual chronotypes in the US population based on a large-scale, nationally representative sample. Our finding that adolescents are on average the latest chronotypes supports delaying school start times to benefit their sleep and circadian alignment. The generally wide range in chronotypes may provide opportunities for tailored work schedules by matching external and internal time, potentially decreasing long- and short-term health and safety risks."
https://openalex.org/W2685260364,"The inflammasome receptor Nlrp9b defends against enteric viruses by interacting with double-stranded viral RNA-bound helicase Dhx9, triggering gasdermin-D-dependent pyroptotic cell death of infected cells and secretion of Il-18. Rotaviruses cause severe and often fatal gastroenterological illnesses in young children. The mechanism by which such enteric viruses are detected and restricted in vivo is largely unknown. Richard Flavell and colleagues report how the inflammasome receptor Nlrp9 helps to defend against enteric viruses, via RNA helicase Dhx9, by interacting with double-stranded viral RNA. This interaction triggers gasdermin-D-dependent pyroptotic cell death of infected cells and secretion of IL-18. This innate immune signalling functions uniquely in intestinal epithelial cells and could reveal useful targets in the modulation of viral defences. Rotavirus, a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in young children, accounts for around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide1. Rotavirus specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-κB signalling2,3,4,5, raising the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses in intestinal mucosa. The mechanism by which enteric viruses are sensed and restricted in vivo, especially by NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes, is largely unknown. Here we uncover and mechanistically characterize the NLR Nlrp9b that is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and restricts rotavirus infection. Our data show that, via RNA helicase Dhx9, Nlrp9b recognizes short double-stranded RNA stretches and forms inflammasome complexes with the adaptor proteins Asc and caspase-1 to promote the maturation of interleukin (Il)-18 and gasdermin D (Gsdmd)-induced pyroptosis. Conditional depletion of Nlrp9b or other inflammasome components in the intestine in vivo resulted in enhanced susceptibility of mice to rotavirus replication. Our study highlights an important innate immune signalling pathway that functions in intestinal epithelial cells and may present useful targets in the modulation of host defences against viral pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2655264143,"A phase-separation mechanism is proposed for the dominance of the surface tension effect over the solute effect in the observed activation of ultrafine cloud condensation nuclei. Atmospheric cloud droplets form through the spontaneous nucleation of water vapour onto aerosol particles, which act as cloud condensation nuclei. The activation of these nuclei depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension. Surface tension may be lowered by surfactants, amphiphilic (water- and fat-loving) compounds that adsorb at the water–air interface. It is expected that surface tension lowering is rendered ineffective by a simultaneous reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the bulk droplet to the droplet–vapour interface. Here the authors find that in ambient air the surface tension lowering can prevail over the Raoult effect as a result of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to substantial increases in the concentration of cloud droplets. The spontaneous growth of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) into cloud droplets under supersaturated water vapour conditions is described by classic Köhler theory1,2. This spontaneous activation of CCN depends on the interplay between the Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with decreasing surface tension, which is sensitive to surfactants1. Surface tension lowering caused by organic surfactants, which diminishes the Kelvin effect, is expected to be negated by a concomitant reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by the displacement of surfactant molecules from the droplet bulk to the droplet–vapour interface3,4. Here we present observational and theoretical evidence illustrating that, in ambient air, surface tension lowering can prevail over the reduction in the Raoult effect, leading to substantial increases in cloud droplet concentrations. We suggest that consideration of liquid–liquid phase separation, leading to complete or partial engulfing of a hygroscopic particle core by a hydrophobic organic-rich phase, can explain the lack of concomitant reduction of the Raoult effect, while maintaining substantial lowering of surface tension, even for partial surface coverage. Apart from the importance of particle size and composition in droplet activation, we show by observation and modelling that incorporation of phase-separation effects into activation thermodynamics can lead to a CCN number concentration that is up to ten times what is predicted by climate models, changing the properties of clouds. An adequate representation of the CCN activation process is essential to the prediction of clouds in climate models, and given the effect of clouds on the Earth’s energy balance, improved prediction of aerosol–cloud–climate interactions is likely to result in improved assessments of future climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2630161542,"Detailed micro-computed tomography analysis of the skull of Lethiscus stocki places it much earlier in the tetrapod lineage that was previously thought, showing that early tetrapods were more morphologically diverse than has been believed. The aïstopods are a specialized, extinct group of amphibians with elongated bodies and reduced limbs. They are usually placed within the lepospondyl clade, a disparate group of amphibians more or less closely related to amniotes. One of these creatures is Lethiscus stocki, the earliest known tetrapod to post-date the early Carboniferous 'Romer's Gap' that separates the large, archaic early tetrapods from the Devonian from later creatures. Jason Anderson and colleagues digitally dissect a fossil specimen of Lethiscus and show a suite of features that shift it down the evolutionary tree towards the tetrapod base, showing that morphological diversity in the earliest tetrapods was greater than had been thought. The finding also calls for some redefinition of amniotes. Phylogenetic analysis of early tetrapod evolution has resulted in a consensus across diverse data sets1,2,3 in which the tetrapod stem group is a relatively homogenous collection of medium- to large-sized animals showing a progressive loss of ‘fish’ characters as they become increasingly terrestrial4,5, whereas the crown group demonstrates marked morphological diversity and disparity6. The oldest fossil attributed to the tetrapod crown group is the highly specialized aïstopod Lethiscus stocki7,8, which shows a small size, extreme axial elongation, loss of limbs, spool-shaped vertebral centra, and a skull with reduced centres of ossification, in common with an otherwise disparate group of small animals known as lepospondyls. Here we use micro-computed tomography of the only known specimen of Lethiscus to provide new information that strongly challenges this consensus. Digital dissection reveals extremely primitive cranial morphology, including a spiracular notch, a large remnant of the notochord within the braincase, an open ventral cranial fissure, an anteriorly restricted parasphenoid element, and Meckelian ossifications. The braincase is elongate and lies atop a dorsally projecting septum of the parasphenoid bone, similar to stem tetrapods such as embolomeres. This morphology is consistent in a second aïstopod, Coloraderpeton, although the details differ. Phylogenetic analysis, including critical new braincase data, places aïstopods deep on the tetrapod stem, whereas another major lepospondyl lineage is displaced into the amniotes. These results show that stem group tetrapods were much more diverse in their body plans than previously thought. Our study requires a change in commonly used calibration dates for molecular analyses, and emphasizes the importance of character sampling for early tetrapod evolutionary relationships."

The PI3K/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) 1 pathway represents the canonical mechanism for phosphorylation of Akt at its primary activation site, Thr-308. We observed that Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (β) (CaMKK2) is highly expressed in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and we investigated its role in Akt activation in ovarian cancer (OVCa) cell lines (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, and Caov-3). Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of CaMKK2 produced phenotypes expected of Akt inhibition, including reductions in cell growth and cell viability and in the regulation of Akt downstream targets involved in G1/S transition and apoptosis. CaMKK2 knockdown or inhibition decreased Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 to extents similar to those of PDK1 knockdown or PI3K inhibition. Combined CaMKK2 and PDK1 knockdown or CaMKK and PI3K inhibition, respectively, produced additive effects on p-Akt and cell growth, consistent with direct Akt phosphorylation by CaMKK2. This conclusion was supported by the absence of effects of CaMKK2 knockdown/inhibition on alternative means of activating Akt via p-Akt Thr-450, p-PDK1 Ser-241, or p-IRS1 Ser-636/639. Recombinant CaMKK2 directly activated recombinant Akt by phosphorylation at Thr-308 in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. In OVCa cells, p-Akt Thr-308 was significantly inhibited by intracellular Ca2+i chelation or CaM inhibition. Ionomycin-induced Ca2+ influx promoted p-Akt, an effect blocked by PDK1, and/or CaMKK2, siRNAs, and by PI3K and/or CaMKK inhibitors.

CNA of the PI3K/Akt pathway include the PI3K catalytic subunit p110α (PIK3CA) and AKT2. These CNA along with activating mutations in PIK3CA and inactivating mutations of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) are thought to drive ovarian tumorigenesis by promoting Akt hyperactivation (6.Altomare D.A.

The PI3K/Akt pathway is a major signaling network for control of the growth and survival of normal and neoplastic cells and is oncogenic for multiple cancer types, including OVCa (7.Wong K.K.

PI3K/Akt: getting it right matters.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6473-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). PI3K synthesizes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which recruits Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, resulting in PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt at its activation loop site Thr-308. Once phosphorylated at Thr-308, Akt phosphorylates SIN1 of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which activates mTORC2, resulting in phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (9.Humphrey S.J. Yang G. Yang P. Fazakerley D.J. Stöckli J. Yang J.Y. James D.E. Dynamic adipocyte phosphoproteome reveals that Akt directly regulates mTORC2.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for maximal activation. Dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate by PTEN exerts a suppressive effect on the activity of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway. Akt activation results in promotion of protein translation, cell growth, and cell survival. Protein translation is mediated by Akt phosphorylation of PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate 40) leading to the release of mTORC1 from an inhibited state allowing for its phosphorylation of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (10.Wang L.

Akt promotes cell growth and survival by increasing cyclin D1 protein stability and gene transcription and by decreasing the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, through the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a), respectively (11.Kim J.K.

Increased cyclin D1/Cdk4/6 promotes G1/S phase cell cycle transition by hyperphosphorylation of the tumor suppressor Rb, thus inactivating it and allowing transit of E2F to the nucleus to promote transcription of genes required for S phase progression. In addition, Akt promotes cell survival through the inhibition of pro-apoptotic signaling cascades, which include inhibition of the executor caspases and consequent activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) through inhibition of PARP cleavage (7.Wong K.K. Engelman J.A. Cantley L.C. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway in cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 8.Franke T.F. PI3K/Akt: getting it right matters.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6473-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The pathway leading to Akt activation is typically conceptualized with PDK1 as the sole upstream kinase activating Akt by Thr-308 phosphorylation. Thus, PDK1−/− embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to show growth factor (GF)-responsive Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 (13.Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P.

Although it is well established that PDK1 is a major upstream Akt-activating kinase, it is possible that additional kinase(s), which are not expressed developmentally at the ES cell stage, are not GF-responsive, or are overexpressed in cancer, might catalyze Akt phosphorylation. It was previously reported that in neuroblastoma–glioma NG108 cells, Akt is phosphorylated at Thr-308 by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) in response to Ca2+ influx (14.Yano S.

CaMKK1 and CaMKK2 activate both CaMKI and CaMKIV by phosphorylating their activation loop sites (Thr-177 and Thr-200, respectively) (16.Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A.

These latter studies established the precedents that CaMKK2-catalyzed phosphorylation may be directed to a target, which is not itself Ca2+/CaM-dependent, and can occur in cells that express another upstream-activating kinase (STK11/LKB1) (22.Hardie D.G. AMPK–sensing energy while talking to other signaling pathways.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 939-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Akt hyperactivation is thought to be the main contributor to platinum chemotherapeutic resistance in HGSOC (23.Carden C.P. Stewart A. Thavasu P. Kipps E. Pope L. Crespo M. Miranda S. Attard G.

Cancer Ther. 2012; 11: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Underscoring the importance of this pathway for OVCa progression are the multiple clinical trials of PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway inhibitors for OVCa therapy. In this study, we observed high CaMKK2 expression in OVCa clinical specimens and probed its role in Akt activation in multiple platinum-resistant HGSOC cell lines. We report herein evidence that CaMKK2 promotes the growth and survival of platinum-resistant OVCa cells. CaMKK2 phosphorylates and activates Akt, independently of PI3K and PDK1. CaMKK2 activation of Akt is seen in many downstream targets known to mediate Akt's regulation of cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, protein synthesis, and protein stability. Akt phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) chelation or CaM inhibition. Ionomycin-induced Ca2+ influx promoted Akt phosphorylation, an effect blocked by PDK1, and/or CaMKK2, siRNAs, and by PI3K, and/or CaMKK, inhibitors, results suggesting the involvement of both the PI3K/PDK1 and CaMKK pathways in mediation of Ca2+-induced Akt activation. Potentiation of the anti-proliferative and anti-survival effects of carboplatin and the PI3K inhibitor PX-866 (24.Ihle N.T. Williams R. Chow S. Chew W. Berggren M.I. Paine-Murrieta G. Minion D.J.

CaMKK2 is normally expressed at low levels in non-neural tissues (18.Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R.

Specimens from OVCa patients diagnosed with high-grade serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma were subjected to IHC. CaMKK2 expression was significantly higher in malignant ovarian tissue compared with non-malignant stromal elements and showed a cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 1, A and B). CaMKK2 also appears to be well expressed in high-grade OVCa with mucinous features (Fig. 1C). To determine the role of CaMKK2 in the regulation of growth and viability of OVCa cells, CaMKK2 knockdown in OVCAR-3 cells was conducted using siRNAs that target distinct regions of the CaMKK2 mRNA (siRNAs #1 and 2). Using either siRNA, CaMKK2 knockdown decreased the growth rate of OVCAR-3 cells, resulting in significant decreases in the number of viable cells of 54.4% (siRNA #1) and 41.6% (siRNA #2), relative to non-specific (NS) controls (Fig. 2A). Because reduction in the intracellular levels of CaMKK2 protein could exert effects apart from decreasing catalytic activity, for example by disruption of protein-protein interactions or mislocalization of proteins involved in regulating cell growth and viability, we utilized the selective CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 (29.Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. STO-609, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This approach enabled the suppression of catalytic activity without altering the protein levels of CaMKK2. Consistent with the siRNA effects, STO-609 decreased cell growth in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B). Knockdown or inhibition of CaMKK2 also significantly decreased cell viability, indicating that CaMKK2 is required for optimal cell survival (Fig. 2, C and D). To confirm the results obtained with OVCAR-3 cells, we utilized another well-characterized OVCa cell line, SKOV-3 (30.Domcke S. Sinha R. Levine D.A. Sander C. Schultz N. Evaluating cell lines as tumour models by comparison of genomic profiles.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells were derived from malignant ascites of human HGSOC and resistant to cisplatin and other DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Similar to the decrease in growth achieved with STO-609 treatment of OVCAR-3 cells, CaMKK inhibition decreased SKOV-3 cell growth with a comparable IC50 value to that observed in OVCAR-3 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that the effects of silencing CaMKK2 expression or reducing its activity on cell growth may be due to its regulation of both proliferation and viability. To test this hypothesis, S phase DNA synthesis was quantified by incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU). CaMKK2 knockdown significantly decreased EdU incorporation by 44%, confirming the inhibitory effects of CaMKK2 knockdown on proliferation (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the CaMKK2 knockdown-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 2, C and D) in OVCAR-3 cells occurred by apoptosis, we assayed the activity of the executioner caspases, 3 and 7, of the apoptotic cascade. CaMKK2 knockdown increased caspase 3/7 activity by 36% (siRNA #1) and 52% (siRNA #2), indicating that cell death was apoptotic (Fig. 3B). As predicted, knockdown of CaMKK2 in OVCAR-3 cells significantly increased cleavage of pro-caspase 3 and the caspase target, PARP, consistent with an apoptotic mechanism (Fig. 3, C and D). Finally, two-parameter flow cytometry was conducted by quantifying caspase 3/7 intracellular activity and DNA binding of SYTOXTM to distinguish early from late apoptosis. Treatment of OVCAR-3 cells with STO-609 significantly increased the number of cells in both early and late apoptosis and deceased the number of viable cells compared with vehicle control (Fig. 3E). These data indicate that CaMKK2, through its catalytic activity, regulates growth and survival in OVCa cells. Because the deleterious effects produced by silencing CaMKK2 expression or by reducing its activity pharmacologically on OVCAR-3 cell growth and survival strikingly phenocopied those expected of Akt inhibition (Figure 2., Figure 3. and supplemental Fig. S1), we asked whether CaMKK2 is required for optimal Akt phosphorylation. CaMKK2 knockdown in OVCAR-3 cells decreased phosphorylation of Akt at its primary activation site, Thr-308 by 65% (siRNA #1) and 78% (siRNA #2) (Fig. 4A). In addition, CaMKK2 knockdown (siRNA #2) decreased phosphorylation at the Akt secondary activation site (Ser-473) (Fig. 5B). In accord with these results, STO-609 decreased Akt phosphorylation in OVCAR-3 cells at Thr-308 and Ser-473, 65 and 40%, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly, regulation of Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by CaMKK2 in SKOV-3 cells and a third OVCa cell line, Caov-3 was observed (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). Altogether, these data suggest that CaMKK2 plays a significant role in maintaining Akt phosphorylation in OVCa cells.Figure 5.CaMKK2 and PI3K/PDK1 regulate Akt phosphorylation and cell growth in an additive fashion in OVCAR-3 cells. A and B, CaMKK2 and PDK1 additively regulate Akt phosphorylation.

C and D, CaMKK2 and PI3K additively regulate Akt phosphorylation. Cells were treated with vehicle or the pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K, PX-866 (50 nm), and vehicle or STO-609 (25 μm) singly or in combination for 4 h, and phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473 was quantified.

Silencing efficiencies were equivalent between the targets whether they were transfected singly or in combination (supplemental Table S1). We reasoned that if CaMKK2 exerted its effects indirectly on p-Akt via phosphorylation of PDK1, the almost complete absence of PDK1 in the combined knockdown should largely abolish the effect of CaMKK2 knockdown on p-Akt. Conversely, if CaMKK2 phosphorylates Akt directly and independently of PDK1, its knockdown should yield a further decrease in p-Akt when combined with PDK1 knockdown. CaMKK2 and PDK1 single knockdowns produced roughly equivalent decrements in p-Akt Thr-308 and Ser-473 (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that CaMKK2 may be comparable in importance for optimal Akt phosphorylation as its canonical activator PDK1. Consistent with independent actions of PDK1 and CaMKK2, combined knockdowns in OVCAR-3 cells produced a decrease in p-Akt Thr-308 of 81%, significantly greater than that produced by either knockdown alone and virtually identical to the 80% predicted value if the kinases phosphorylate Akt independently (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the combined PDK1 and CaMKK2 knockdown is predicted to yield a decrease in p-Akt Ser-473 of 82%, which was similar to that obtained (78%) and greater than that obtained with either PDK1 or CaMKK2 knockdown alone (although the latter comparison did not achieve statistical significance) (Fig. 5B). In concordance with results in OVCAR-3 cells, combined PDK1 and CaMKK2 knockdowns in SKOV-3 cells produced a 65% reduction in p-Akt Thr-308 corresponding closely to the predicted value of a 68% reduction, based on independent actions of CaMKK2 and PDK1 (supplemental Fig. S2D). Activation of Akt via the PI3K/PDK1 pathway requires the generation of phosphoinositides by PI3K, which allows for membrane recruitment of Akt and PDK1 by their respective PH domains (31.Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Translocation of PDK-1 to the plasma membrane is important in allowing PDK-1 to activate protein kinase B.Curr.

J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To determine whether CaMKK2 activity regulates Akt independently of PI3K activity, Akt phosphorylation was assessed using STO-609 and the PI3K inhibitor, PX-866. Consistent with independent actions of PI3K and CaMKK2, the combined inhibition in OVCAR-3 cells produced a decrease in p-Akt Thr-308 of 69%, significantly greater than that produced by either drug alone, and virtually identical to the 70% predicted value if the kinases regulate Akt phosphorylation independently (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the combined inhibition of PI3K and CaMKK2 led to a decrease in p-Akt Ser-473 of 80%, which was virtually identical to the 79% predicted value for independent actions, and greater than that obtained with either drug alone (Fig. 5D). Finally, the additivity of PI3K and CaMKK inhibition was shown in the third cell line examined, Caov-3 (supplemental Fig. S2E). Together, these results support a mechanism by which CaMKK2 directly phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308 independently of the PI3K/PDK1 pathway, leading to subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-473 presumably as a consequence of the activation of mTORC2. Although these data provide strong evidence for CaMKK2 phosphorylation of Akt being independent of the activity of the PI3K/PDK1 pathway, we considered the possibility that there is a more indirect mechanism by which CaMKK2 might be required for optimal Akt activation. Three possible alternate mechanisms were considered. First, the stability of Akt has been shown to be regulated by its phosphorylation at the turn motif Thr-450 by mTORC2, to facilitate C-terminal folding, and to allow for the turn motif to interact with basic residues of the kinase domain (33.Facchinetti V. Ouyang W. Wei H. Soto N. Lazorchak A. Gould C. Lowry C. Newton A.C. Mao Y. Miao R.Q. Sessa W.C. Qin J. Zhang P. Su B. Jacinto E.

We therefore sought to evaluate whether CaMKK2 phosphorylates Akt at Thr-450 inducing conformational changes exposing Thr-308 to other kinases. However, CaMKK"

Allylic functionalization has long been used in organic chemistry to install new chiral centres. These 'ene' reactions have been well studied, but general methods for using internal alkenes and activation with heteroatom-based electrophiles are largely unprecedented. Here, Uttam Tambar and colleagues report the application of a sulfur-based electrophile to incorporate heteroatoms at the allylic position of internal cis-alkenes via a chiral-Lewis-acid-catalysed hetero-ene reaction. Symmetric and non-symmetric internal alkenes can be functionalized with high regio-, E/Z- and stereoselectivity to a multifunctional building block, from which a series of products including alcohols, amines and thiols can be derived in a stereospecific manner. The stereoselective oxidation of hydrocarbons is one of the most notable advances in synthetic chemistry over the past fifty years1,2,3. Inspired by nature, enantioselective dihydroxylations, epoxidations and other oxidations of unsaturated hydrocarbons have been developed. More recently, the catalytic enantioselective allylic carbon–hydrogen oxidation of alkenes has streamlined the production of pharmaceuticals, natural products, fine chemicals and other functional materials4,5,6,7. Allylic functionalization provides a direct path to chiral building blocks with a newly formed stereocentre from petrochemical feedstocks while preserving the olefin functionality as a handle for further chemical elaboration. Various metal-based catalysts have been discovered for the enantioselective allylic carbon–hydrogen oxidation of simple alkenes with cyclic or terminal double bonds8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. However, a general and selective allylic oxidation using the more common internal alkenes remains elusive. Here we report the enantioselective, regioselective and E/Z-selective allylic oxidation of unactivated internal alkenes via a catalytic hetero-ene reaction with a chalcogen-based oxidant. Our method enables non-symmetric internal alkenes to be selectively converted into allylic functionalized products with high stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. Stereospecific transformations of the resulting multifunctional chiral building blocks highlight the potential for rapidly converting internal alkenes into a broad range of enantioenriched structures that can be used in the synthesis of complex target molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2718067945,"Ribosomes have the capacity to selectively control translation through changes in their composition that enable recognition of specific RNA elements. However, beyond differential subunit expression during development, evidence for regulated ribosome specification within individual cells has remained elusive. Here we report that a poxvirus kinase phosphorylates serine/threonine residues in the human small ribosomal subunit protein, receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1), that are not phosphorylated in uninfected cells or cells infected by other viruses. These modified residues cluster in an extended loop in RACK1, phosphorylation of which selects for translation of viral or reporter mRNAs with 5' untranslated regions that contain adenosine repeats, so-called polyA-leaders. Structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that although RACK1 is highly conserved, this loop is variable and contains negatively charged amino acids in plants, in which these leaders act as translational enhancers. Phosphomimetics and inter-species chimaeras have shown that negative charge in the RACK1 loop dictates ribosome selectivity towards viral RNAs. By converting human RACK1 to a charged, plant-like state, poxviruses remodel host ribosomes so that adenosine repeats erroneously generated by slippage of the viral RNA polymerase confer a translational advantage. Our findings provide insight into ribosome customization through trans-kingdom mimicry and the mechanics of species-specific leader activity that underlie poxvirus polyA-leaders."
https://openalex.org/W2648083391,"Cellular potassium import systems play a fundamental role in osmoregulation, pH homeostasis and membrane potential in all domains of life. In bacteria, the kdp operon encodes a four-subunit potassium pump that maintains intracellular homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under conditions in which potassium is limiting. This membrane complex, called KdpFABC, has one channel-like subunit (KdpA) belonging to the superfamily of potassium transporters and another pump-like subunit (KdpB) belonging to the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Although there is considerable structural and functional information about members of both superfamilies, the mechanism by which uphill potassium transport through KdpA is coupled with ATP hydrolysis by KdpB remains poorly understood. Here we report the 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB. The structure also reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits. Specifically, a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. On the basis of these observations, we propose a mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes."

https://openalex.org/W2718091346,"Changes in maternal innate immunity during healthy human pregnancy are not well understood. Whether basal immune status in vivo is largely unaffected by pregnancy, is constitutively biased towards an inflammatory phenotype (transiently enhancing host defense) or exhibits anti-inflammatory bias (reducing potential responsiveness to the fetus) is unclear. Here, in a longitudinal study of healthy women who gave birth to healthy infants following uncomplicated pregnancies within the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) cohort, we test the hypothesis that a progressively altered bias in resting innate immune status develops. Women were examined during pregnancy and again, one and/or three years postpartum. Most pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, including CCL2, CXCL10, IL-18 and TNFα, was reduced in vivo during pregnancy (20–57%, p<0.0001). Anti-inflammatory biomarkers (sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, and IL-1Ra) were elevated by ~50–100% (p<0.0001). Systemic IL-10 levels were unaltered during vs. post-pregnancy. Kinetic studies demonstrate that while decreased pro-inflammatory biomarker expression (CCL2, CXCL10, IL-18, and TNFα) was constant, anti-inflammatory expression increased progressively with increasing gestational age (p<0.0001). We conclude that healthy resting maternal immune status is characterized by an increasingly pronounced bias towards a systemic anti-inflammatory innate phenotype during the last two trimesters of pregnancy. This is resolved by one year postpartum in the absence of repeat pregnancy. The findings provide enhanced understanding of immunological changes that occur in vivo during healthy human pregnancy."

Melatonin levels, biliary mass, liver fibrosis, angiogenesis and miR-200b expression were evaluated in wild-type and Mdr2-/- mice exposed to darkness or melatonin treatment or in male patients with PSC and healthy controls. Mdr2-/- mice were also treated with miR-200b inhibitor or control before evaluating biliary mass, liver fibrosis, and angiogenesis. After overexpression of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT; the enzyme regulating melatonin synthesis) or inhibition of miR-200b in cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cells in vitro, we evaluated angiogenesis and fibrosis gene expression. After exposure to darkness or administration of melatonin, Mdr2-/- mice show elevated serum melatonin levels and inhibition of biliary mass, along with reduction of liver fibrosis and angiogenesis. MicroRNA PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-200b expression increased in Mdr2-/- mice and patients with PSC compared with controls and decreased in Mdr2-/- mice subjected to dark exposure or melatonin treatment. Inhibition of miR-200b in Mdr2-/- ablates biliary proliferation, liver fibrosis, and angiogenesis. In vitro, overexpression of AANAT or inhibition of miR-200b in cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cells decreased the expression of miR-200b, angiogenesis, and fibrosis genes.

Autophagy plays a key role in activating the antimicrobial host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Whether miRNAs specifically influence the activation of macrophage autophagy during M. tuberculosis infection is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection of macrophages leads to increased expression of miR-144-3p, which targets autophagy-related gene 4a (ATG4a), to inhibit autophagy activation and antimicrobial responses to BCG. Overexpression of miR-144-3p significantly decreased both mRNA and protein levels of ATG4a, inhibited the formation of autophagosomes in RAW264.7 cells and increased intracellular survival of BCG. However, transfection with miR-144-3p inhibitor led to an increase in ATG4a levels, accelerated the autophagic response in macrophages, and decreased BCG survival in macrophages. The experimental results of this study reveal a novel role of miR-144-3p in inhibiting autophagy activation by targeting ATG4a and enhancing BCG infection, and provide potential targets for developing improved treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2710170885,"The histidine-phosphorylatable phosphocarrier protein (HPr) is an essential component of the sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system (PTS) in many bacteria. Recent interactome findings suggested that HPr interacts with several carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, but whether HPr plays a regulatory role was unclear. Here, we provide evidence that HPr interacts with a large number of proteins in Escherichia coli We demonstrate HPr-dependent allosteric regulation of the activities of pyruvate kinase (PykF, but not PykA), phosphofructokinase (PfkB, but not PfkA), glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (NagB), and adenylate kinase (Adk). HPr is either phosphorylated on a histidyl residue (HPr-P) or non-phosphorylated (HPr). PykF is activated only by non-phosphorylated HPr, which decreases the PykF Khalf for phosphoenolpyruvate by 10-fold (from 3.5 to 0.36 mm), thus influencing glycolysis. PfkB activation by HPr, but not by HPr-P, resulted from a decrease in the Khalf for fructose-6-P, which likely influences both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Moreover, NagB activation by HPr was important for the utilization of amino sugars, and allosteric inhibition of Adk activity by HPr-P, but not by HPr, allows HPr to regulate the cellular energy charge coordinately with glycolysis. These observations suggest that HPr serves as a directly interacting global regulator of carbon and energy metabolism and probably of other physiological processes in enteric bacteria."

In this retrospective cohort study, the incidence of and risk factors for ischemic stroke in patients with AF were identified. All patients (≥30 years old) without previous stroke who were diagnosed with AF in 2007–2013 were selected from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. To identify factors that influenced ischemic stroke risk, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted. During a mean follow-up duration of 3.2 years, 1022 (9.6%) patients were diagnosed with ischemic stroke. The overall incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 30.8/1000 person-years. Of all the ischemic stroke that occurred during the follow-up period, 61.0% occurred within 1-year after AF diagnosis. Of the patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2, only 13.6% were receiving warfarin therapy within 30 days after AF diagnosis. Relative to no antithrombotic therapy, warfarin treatment for >90 days before the index event (ischemic stroke in stroke patients and death/study end in non-stroke patients) associated with decreased ischemic stroke risk (Hazard Ratio = 0.41, 95%confidence intervals = 0.32–0.53). Heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus associated with greater ischemic stroke risk. AF patients in Korea had a higher ischemic stroke incidence rate than patients in other countries and ischemic stroke commonly occurred at early phase after AF diagnosis. Long-term (>90 days) continuous warfarin treatment may be beneficial for AF patients. However, warfarin treatment rates were very low. To prevent stroke, programs that actively detect AF and provide anticoagulation therapy are needed."

We evaluated for differences in treatment adherence and response to Peginterferon-alfa-2a/Ribavirin (Peg-IFNα/RBV) in a large urban cohort with and without a history of remote or recent injection drug use.Patient data was retrospectively reviewed for 1000 consecutive patients-608 former (no injecting drug use for 6 months of therapy), 85 recent (injecting drug use within 6 months) PWID, and 307 non-drug users who were treated for chronic hepatitis C with Peg-IFNα/RBV. The groups were compared for baseline characteristics, treatment adherence, and outcome.There was no significant difference in treatment non-adherence between the groups (8.4% in PWID vs 6.8% in non-PWIDs; RR = 1.23, CI 0.76-1.99). The overall SVR rate in PWID (64.2%) was not different from non-PWIDs (60.9%) [RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.95-1.17]. There was no significant difference in SVR rates between the groups controlling for genotype (48.4% vs 48.4% for genotype 1; 74.9 vs 73.3% for genotype 3). Former and recent PWID had similar adherence rates.PWID have comparable treatment adherence and SVR rates when compared to non-drug users treated with Peg-IFNα/RBV. These data support a public health strategy of HCV treatment and eradication in PWID in the DAA era."
https://openalex.org/W2666399940,"To evaluate if plasma kisspeptin concentrations are associated with insulin secretion, as suggested by recent in vitro studies, independently of confounders. 261 nondiabetic subjects were stratified into tertiles according to kisspeptin values. Insulin secretion was assessed using indexes derived from oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, subjects in the highest (tertile 3) kisspeptin group exhibited significantly lower values of insulinogenic index, corrected insulin response (CIR30), and Stumvoll indexes for first-phase and second-phase insulin release as compared with low (tertile 1) or intermediate (tertile 2) kisspeptin groups. Univariate correlations between kisspeptin concentration and metabolic variables showed that kisspeptin concentration was significantly and positively correlated with age, blood pressure, and 2-h post-load glucose, and inversely correlated with BMI, and waist circumference. There was an inverse relationship between kisspeptin levels and OGTT-derived indexes of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A multivariable regression analysis in a model including all the variables significantly correlated with kisspeptin concentration showed thar age (β = -0.338, P<0.0001), BMI (β = 0.272, P<0.0001), 2-h post-load glucose (β = -0.229, P<0.0001), and kisspeptin (β = -0.105, P = 0.03) remained associated with insulinogenic index. These factors explained 34.6% of the variance of the insulinogenic index. In conclusion, kisspeptin concentrations are associated with insulin secretion independently of important determinants of glucose homeostasis such as gender, age, adiposity, 2-h post-load glucose, and insulin sensitivity."

To address this issue, we sought to derive usage patterns that were directly correlated with smartphone dependence based on usage data. This study attempted to classify smartphone dependence using a data-driven prediction algorithm. We developed a mobile application to collect smartphone usage data. A total of 41,683 logs of 48 smartphone users were collected from March 8, 2015, to January 8, 2016. The participants were classified into the control group (SUC) or the addiction group (SUD) using the Korean Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale for Adults (S-Scale) and a face-to-face offline interview by a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist (SUC = 23 and SUD = 25). We derived usage patterns using tensor factorization and found the following six optimal usage patterns: 1) social networking services (SNS) during daytime, 2) web surfing, 3) SNS at night, 4) mobile shopping, 5) entertainment, and 6) gaming at night. The membership vectors of the six patterns obtained a significantly better prediction performance than the raw data. For all patterns, the usage times of the SUD were much longer than those of the SUC. From our findings, we concluded that usage patterns and membership vectors were effective tools to assess and predict smartphone dependence and could provide an intervention guideline to predict and treat smartphone dependence based on usage data."

Lys) requirements of Cobb × Cobb 500 male broilers using different statistical models. For each experiment, 1,200 chicks were housed in 48 floor pens in a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 8 replicates. Broilers were fed diets with increasing dig. Lys levels from 1 to 12 d (Exp. 1), from 12 to 28 d (Exp. 2), and 28 to 42 d (Exp. 3). Increasing dig. Lys levels were equally spaced from 0.97 to 1.37% in Exp. 1, 0.77 to 1.17% in Exp. 2, and 0.68 to 1.07% in Exp. 3. The lowest dig. Lys diets were not supplemented with L-Lysine and all other essential AA met or exceeded recommendations. In Exp. 3, six birds per pen were randomly selected from each replication to evaluate carcass and breast yields. Digestible Lys requirements were estimated by quadratic polynomial (QP), linear broken-line (LBL), quadratic broken-line (QBL), and exponential asymptotic (EA) models. Overall, dig. Lys requirements varied among response variables and statistical models. Increasing dietary dig. Lys had a positive effect on BW, carcass and breast yields. Levels of dig. Lys that optimized performance using QP, LBL, QBL, and EA models were 1.207, 1.036, 1.113, and 1.204% for BWG and 1.190, 1.027, 1.100, and 1.172% for FCR in Exp. 1; 1.019, 0.853, 0.944; 1.025% for BWG and 1.050, 0.879, 1.032, and 1.167% for FCR in Exp. 2; and 0.960, 0.835, 0.933, and 1.077% for BWG, 0.981, 0.857, 0.963, and 1.146% for FCR in Exp. 3. The QP, LBL, QBL, and EA also estimated dig. Lys requirements as 0.941, 0.846, 0.925, and 1.070% for breast meat yield in Exp. 3. In conclusion, Lys requirements vary greatly according to the statistical analysis utilized; therefore, the origin of requirement estimation must be taken into account in order to allow adequate comparisons between references."
https://openalex.org/W2663228963,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health concern worldwide with 240 million individuals chronically infected and at risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current treatments rarely cure chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting the need for new anti-HBV drugs. Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) are phosphorothioated oligonucleotides that have demonstrated a great potential to inhibit infection with several viruses. In chronically infected human patients, NAPs administration lead to a decline of blood HBsAg and HBV DNA and to HBsAg seroconversion, the expected signs of functional cure. NAPs have also been shown to prevent infection of duck hepatocytes with the Avihepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and to exert an antiviral activity against established DHBV infection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the specific anti-HBV antiviral activity of NAPs in the HepaRG human hepatoma cell line and primary cultures of human hepatocytes. NAPs with different chemical features (phosphorothioation, 2'O-methyl ribose, 5-methylcytidine) were assessed for antiviral activity when provided at the time of HBV inoculation or post-inoculation. NAPs dose-dependently inhibited HBV entry in a phosphorothioation-dependent, sequence-independent and size-dependent manner. This inhibition of HBV entry by NAPs was impaired by 2'O-methyl ribose modification. NAP treatment after viral inoculation did not elicit any antiviral activity."

Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3s) in vitro and in vivo and the ω-3 mediator, resolvin D1, in vitro increase Aβ phagocytosis by Mϕs of patients with MCI. We have investigated the unfolded protein response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by Mϕs in a longitudinal study of fish-derived, ω-3-supplemented patients with MCI. Patients in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)e3/e3 subgroup over time exhibited an increase of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) expression, Aβ phagocytosis, intermediate M1-M2 Mϕ type, and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) rate of change of +1.8 points per year, whereas patients in the ApoEe3/e4 subgroup showed individually divergent results with an MMSE rate of change of -3.2 points per year. In vitro treatment of Mϕs by fish-derived ω-3 emulsion increased Aβ phagocytosis, PERK expression, and UPR RNA signature, and decreased ER stress signature. Augmented genes in the UPR signature included chaperones, lectins, foldases, and N-linked glycosylation enzymes. In summary, fish-derived ω-3s increase cytoprotective genes and decrease proapoptotic genes, improve immune clearance of Aβ, and are associated with an improved MMSE rate of change in ApoEe3/e3 vs. ApoEe3/e4 patients.-Olivera-Perez, H.

https://openalex.org/W2639758751,"A host of animals build architectural constructions. Such constructions frequently vary with environmental and individual/colony conditions, and their architecture directly influences behavior and fitness. The nests of ant colonies drive and enable many of their collective behaviors, and as such are part of their 'extended phenotype'. Since ant colonies have been recently shown to differ in behavior and life history strategy, we ask whether colonies differ in another trait: the architecture of the constructions they create. We allowed Temnothorax rugatulus rock ants, who create nests by building walls within narrow rock gaps, to repeatedly build nest walls in a fixed crevice but under two environmental conditions. We find that colonies consistently differ in their architecture across environments and over nest building events. Colony identity explained 12-40% of the variation in nest architecture, while colony properties and environmental conditions explained 5-20%, as indicated by the condition and marginal R2 values. When their nest boxes were covered, which produced higher humidity and lower airflow, colonies built thicker, longer, and heavier walls. Colonies also built more robust walls when they had more brood, suggesting a protective function of wall thickness. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to explicitly investigate the repeatability of nestbuilding behavior in a controlled environment. Our results suggest that colonies may face tradeoffs, perhaps between factors such as active vs. passive nest defense, and that selection may act on individual construction rules as a mechanisms to mediate colony-level behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2722982242,"Prompted by the recent growing evidence of oscillatory behavior involving MAPK cascades we present a systematic approach of analyzing models and elucidating the nature of biochemical oscillations based on reaction network theory. In particular, we formulate a minimal biochemically consistent mass action subnetwork of the Huang-Ferrell model of the MAPK signalling that provides an oscillatory response when a parameter controlling the activation of the top-tier kinase is varied. Such dynamics are either intertwined with or separated from the earlier found bistable/hysteretic behavior in this model. Using the theory of stability of stoichiometric networks, we reduce the original MAPK model, convert kinetic to convex parameters and examine those properties of the minimal subnetwork that underlie the oscillatory dynamics. We also use the methods of classification of chemical oscillatory networks to explain the rhythmic behavior in physicochemical terms, i.e., we identify of the role of individual biochemical species in positive and negative feedback loops and describe their coordinated action leading to oscillations. Our approach provides an insight into dynamics without the necessity of knowing rate coefficients and thus is useful prior the statistical evaluation of parameters."

Since 2012, the Hendra virus sub-unit G vaccine has been available for horse vaccination in Australia. Uptake of the vaccine has been limited and spill-over events of Hendra virus infection in horses continue to occur. We conducted an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study of 376 horse owners belonging to a variety of different equestrian clubs in Queensland, Australia, to identify risk factors for non-vaccination against Hendra virus. A total of 43.1% (N = 162) of horse owners indicated that they currently did not vaccinate against Hendra virus infection, while 56.9% (N = 214) currently vaccinated against Hendra virus infection. A total of 52 risk factors were evaluated relating to equestrian activities, horse management, perceived risk and severity of horse and human infection with Hendra virus, side effects of Hendra vaccination, other vaccinations conducted by horse owners and horse owners' attitudes towards veterinarians. The final multivariable logistics regression model identified the following risk factors associated with increased odds of non-vaccination against Hendra virus: 1) perceived low risk (compared to high) of Hendra virus infection to horses (considering the horse owners' location and management practices) or horse owners were unsure about the risk of infection, 2) perceived moderate severity (compared to very severe or severe) of Hendra virus infection in humans, 3) horse owners non-vaccination of their pets, 4) horse owners non-vaccination against strangles disease in horses, 5) handling of more than three horses per week (compared to one horse only) and 6) perceived attitude that veterinarians had a high motivation of making money from Hendra virus vaccination (compared to veterinarians having a low motivation of making money from Hendra virus vaccination). Horse owners were more likely to vaccinate against Hendra virus if horses were used for dressage, show jumping or eventing. The study also identified horse owners' concerns about side-effects and about the lack of evidence on vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2708010316,"Because sweat secretion is facilitated by mechanical contraction of sweat gland structures, understanding their structure-function relationship could lead to more effective treatments for patients with sweat gland disorders such as heat stroke. Conventional histological studies have shown that sweat glands are three-dimensionally coiled tubular structures consisting of ducts and secretory portions, although their detailed structural anatomy remains unclear. To better understand the details of the three-dimensional (3D) coiled structures of sweat glands, a whole-mount staining method was employed to visualize 3D coiled gland structures with sweat gland markers for ductal luminal, ductal basal, secretory luminal, and myoepithelial cells. Imaging the 3D coiled gland structures demonstrated that the ducts and secretory portions were comprised of distinct tubular structures. Ductal tubules were occasionally bent, while secretory tubules were frequently bent and formed a self-entangled coiled structure. Whole-mount staining of complex coiled gland structures also revealed the detailed 3D cellular arrangements in the individual sweat gland compartments. Ducts were composed of regularly arranged cuboidal shaped cells, while secretory portions were surrounded by myoepithelial cells longitudinally elongated along entangled secretory tubules. Whole-mount staining was also used to visualize the spatial arrangement of blood vessels and nerve fibers, both of which facilitate sweat secretion. The blood vessels ran longitudinally parallel to the sweat gland tubules, while nerve fibers wrapped around secretory tubules, but not ductal tubules. Taken together, whole-mount staining of sweat glands revealed the 3D cell shapes and arrangements of complex coiled gland structures and provides insights into the mechanical contraction of coiled gland structures during sweat secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2664782742,"This study examined longitudinal changes in physical activity, sedentary behavior and body mass index in adolescents, specifically their migrations towards a different weight cluster. A cohort of 755 adolescents participated in a three-year study. A clustering Self-Organized Maps Analysis was performed to visualize changes in subjects' characteristics between the first and second assessment, and how adolescents were grouped. Also a classification tree was used to identify the behavioral characteristics of the groups that changed their weight cluster. Results indicated that boys were more active and less sedentary than girls. Boys were especially keen to technological-based activities while girls preferred social-based activities. A moderate competing effect between sedentary behaviors and physical activities was observed, especially in girls. Overweight and obesity were negatively associated with physical activity, although a small group of overweight/obese adolescents showed a positive relationship with vigorous physical activity. Cluster migrations indicated that 22.66% of adolescents changed their weight cluster to a lower category and none of them moved in the opposite direction. The behavioral characteristics of these adolescents did not support the hypothesis that the change to a lower weight cluster was a consequence of an increase in time devoted to physical activity or a decrease in time spent on sedentary behavior. Physical activity and sedentary behavior does not exert a substantial effect on overweight and obesity. Therefore, there are other ways of changing to a lower-weight status in adolescents apart from those in which physical activity and sedentary behavior are involved."

We demonstrate that delivery of antibody-conjugated nanodiamonds to live mammalian cells using maltotriose-conjugated polypropylenimine dendrimers results in efficient localization of nanodiamonds to the intended cellular target. We further identify signatures of nanodiamonds under TEM that allow for unambiguous identification of individual nanodiamonds from a resin-embedded, OsO4-stained environment. This is the first demonstration of nanodiamonds as labels for nanoscale TEM-based identification of subcellular protein assemblies. These results, combined with the unique fluorescence properties and biocompatibility of nanodiamonds, represent an important step toward the use of nanodiamonds as markers for correlated optical/electron bioimaging."

https://openalex.org/W2705620916,"Access to facilities, services and socio-economic opportunities plays a critical role in the growth and decline of cities and human settlements. Previous attempts to explain changes in socio-economic indicators by differences in accessibility have not been convincing as countries with highly developed transport infrastructure have only seen marginal benefits of infrastructure improvements. Australia offers an ideal case for investigating the effects of accessibility on development since it is seen as home to some of the most liveable cities in the world while, at the same time, it also has some of the most isolated settlements. We investigate herein the connectivity and accessibility of all 1814 human settlements (population centers exceeding 200 persons) in Australia, and how they relate to the socio-economic characteristics of, and opportunities in, each population center. Assuming population as a proxy indicator of available opportunities, we present a simple ranking metric for a settlement using the number of population and the distance required to access all other settlements (and the corresponding opportunities therein). We find a strikingly unequal distribution of access to opportunities in Australia, with a marked prominence of opportunities in capital cities in four of the eight states. The two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne have a dominant position across all socio-economic indicators, compared to all the other cities. In general, we observe across all the settlements that a decrease in access to opportunities is associated with relatively greater socio-economic disadvantage including increased median age and unemployment rate and decreased median household income. Our methodology can be used to better understand the potential benefits of improved accessibility based on infrastructure development, especially for remote areas and for cities and towns with many socio-economically disadvantaged population."

However, information on the genomes and transcriptomes of this insect group is limited. The RNA sequencing study presented here generated the first de novo transcriptome assembly of Cloeon viridulum (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), and compared gene expression signatures among the young larva (YL), mature larva (ML), subimago (SI), and imago (IM) stages of this mayfly. The transcriptome, based on 88 Gb of sequence data, comprised a set of 81,185 high quality transcripts. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in YL vs. ML, ML vs. SI, and SI vs. IM, was 4,825, 1,584, and 1,278, respectively, according to the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads analysis, assuming a false discovery rate <0.05 and a fold change >2. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were enriched in the “chitin metabolic process”, “germ cell development”, “steroid hormone biosynthesis”, and “cutin, suberine, and wax biosynthesis” pathways. Finally, the expression pattern of a selected group of candidate signature genes for Prometabola, including vestigial, methoprene-tolerant, wingless, and broad-complex were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR analysis. The Q-PCR analysis of larval, subimaginal, and imaginal stages of C. viridulum suggests that the development of mayflies more closely resembles hemimetamorphosis than holometamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2638240441,"Foodborne Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infections of the small intestine cause diarrhea especially in children and are a major cause of childhood death in developing countries. EPEC infects the apical membrane of the epithelium of the small intestine by attaching, effacing the microvilli under the bacteria and then forming microcolonies on the cell surface. We first asked the question where on epithelial cells EPEC attaches and grows. Using models of polarized epithelial monolayers, we evaluated the sites of initial EPEC attachment to the apical membrane and found that EPEC preferentially attached over the cell-cell junctions and formed microcolonies preferentially where three cells come together at tricellular tight junctions. The ability of EPEC to adhere increased when host cell polarity was compromised yielding EPEC access to basolateral proteins. EPEC pedestals contain basolateral cytoskeletal proteins. Thus, we asked if attached EPEC causes reorganization the protein composition of the host cell plasma membrane at sites of microcolony formation. We found that EPEC microcolony growth at the apical membrane resulted in a local accumulation of basolateral plasma membrane proteins surrounding the microcolony. Basolateral marker protein aquaporin-3 localized to forming EPEC microcolonies. Components of the basolateral vesicle targeting machinery were re-routed. The Exocyst (Exo70) was recruited to individual EPEC as was the basolateral vesicle SNARE VAMP-3. Moreover, several Rab variants were also recruited to the infection site, and their dominant-negative equivalents were not. To quantitatively study the recruitment of basolateral proteins, we created a pulse of the temperature sensitive basolateral VSVG, VSVG3-SP-GFP, from the trans-Golgi Network. We found that after release from the TGN, significantly more VSVG3-SP-GFP accumulated at the site of microcolony growth than on equivalent membrane regions of uninfected cells. This suggests that trafficking of vesicles destined for the basolateral membrane are redirected to the apical site of microcolony growth. Thus, in addition to disrupting host cell fence function, local host cell plasma membrane protein composition is changed by altered protein trafficking and recruitment of basolateral proteins to the apical microcolony. This may aid EPEC attachment and subsequent microcolony growth."

Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein synthesized in liver and just in choroid plexus.The current study was designed to assess the prognostic value of serum TTR for functional outcome (at the time of hospital discharge) and long-term (one-year) overall mortality in ischemic stroke patients.We conducted a prospective observational study. Patients (n = 81) with acute (< 24 hours of symptoms onset) ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to Stroke Unit were included. An unfavorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥ 3. The relationships between serum TTR levels and clinical outcome were analyzed using multivariate analysis. One-year mortality was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by mean value of TTR.Compared with patients with mRS <3, patients with an unfavorable outcome at hospital discharge had significantly lower TTR levels on admission (P < 0.0001). In non-survivals serum TTR levels were significantly lower compared with patients who survive one year of observation (P = 0.009). Using multivariate analysis, transthyretin emerged as an independent predictor for unfavorable outcome at the day of hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.9-0.99, P <0.05). A one-year mortality of patients with the lower TTR levels was significantly higher than in patients with TTR levels above mean value (P = 0.02).Serum level of TTR at admission was a predictor of functional outcome after ischemic stroke and was also associated with one-year mortality in stroke survivals."

The aim of this study was to examine the association among metabolic status, the different categories of body mass index (BMI), and CRA in a large cohort of adults.We analyzed the association among metabolic status, BMI categories and CRA in asymptomatic adults who underwent a first-time colonoscopy as part of the comprehensive health check-up program at the Health Promotion Center of Samsung Medical Center, from January 2005 to December 2012. Being metabolically healthy was defined as lacking any metabolic syndrome components and having a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <2.5.The prevalence of ""any,"" ""multiple,"" and ""high-risk"" CRA was 25.6%, 8.3%, and 4.4% among 9,182 metabolically-healthy participants, and 35.9%, 12.5%, and 7.0% among 17,407 metabolically-unhealthy participants, respectively. Increased BMI showed a significant dose-dependent relationship with the prevalence of ""any,"" ""multiple,"" and ""high-risk"" CRA, in both metabolically-healthy and unhealthy participants. In multivariable-adjusted models that accounted for potential confounders including age, sex, smoking, alcohol, first-degree family history of colorectal cancer, and aspirin use, the odds ratio (OR) for any CRA comparing MHO with metabolically-healthy normal-weight (MHNW) participants was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.43). Further adjustment for metabolic components associated with obesity did not significantly change the association. Similarly, the ORs for multiple CRAs and high risk CRA were higher in MHO participants than MHNW participants [ORs (95% CI), 1.63 (1.31-2.04) and 1.53 (1.14-2.04), respectively].The MHO phenotype was closely associated with higher prevalence of CRA, including high-risk adenoma. This finding supports the conclusion that MHO increases the risk of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2720156116,"Some parasites have an ability to fabricate the behavior of their host and impel the host to guard parasites' offspring, which is popularly called as bodyguard manipulation. Psalis pennatula larva parasitized by a braconid parasitoid wasp Microplitis pennatula exhibits some behavioral changes including the guarding of the parasitoid pupa from its natural enemies. We hypothesized that these behavioral change exhibited by the parasitized host larva are induced by the parasitoid and can be considered as an example of bodyguard manipulation. Even though hyperparasitoids are the more specialized natural enemy of parasitoids than predators, very few studies tested the success of guarding parasitoid pupa against hyperparasitoids. This study analyzed the success of guarding behavior of the parasitized host against hyperparasitoids. The onsets of parasite-induced phenotypic alterations (PIPAs) in the parasitized host were inspected to analyze whether these behavioral changes in the host larva manifests gradually or abruptly. The study concludes that parasitized host larva defends the parasitoid pupa from hyperparasitoids and the PIPAs in the parasitized host develops abruptly only after the egression of parasitoid prepupa."
https://openalex.org/W2657386311,"Plant cryptochromes (cry) act as UV-A/blue light receptors. The prototype, Arabidopsis thaliana cry1, regulates several light responses during the life cycle, including de-etiolation, and is also involved in regulating flowering time. The cry1 photocycle is initiated by light absorption by its FAD chromophore, which is most likely fully oxidized (FADox) in the dark state and photoreduced to the neutral flavin semiquinone (FADH°) in its lit state. Cryptochromes lack the DNA-repair activity of the closely related DNA photolyases, but they retain the ability to bind nucleotides such as ATP. The previously characterized L407F mutant allele of Arabidopsis cry1 is biologically hyperactive and seems to mimic the ATP-bound state of cry1, but the reason for this phenotypic change is unclear. Here, we show that cry1L407F can still bind ATP, has less pronounced photoreduction and formation of FADH° than wild-type cry1, and has a dark reversion rate 1.7 times lower than that of the wild type. The hyperactivity of cry1L407F is not related to a higher FADH° occupancy of the photoreceptor but is caused by a structural alteration close to the ATP-binding site. Moreover, we show that ATP binds to cry1 in both the dark and the lit states. This binding was not affected by cry1's C-terminal extension, which is important for signal transduction. Finally, we show that a recently discovered chemical inhibitor of cry1, 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole, competes for ATP binding and thereby diminishes FADH° formation, which demonstrates that both processes are important for cry1 function.

https://openalex.org/W2633475803,"Twitter communication has permeated every sphere of society. To highlight and share small pieces of information with possibly vast audiences or small circles of the interested has some value in almost any aspect of social life. But what is the value exactly for a scientific field? We perform a comprehensive study of computer scientists using Twitter and their tweeting behavior concerning the sharing of web links. Discerning the domains, hosts and individual web pages being tweeted and the differences between computer scientists and a Twitter sample enables us to look in depth at the Twitter-based information sharing practices of a scientific community. Additionally, we aim at providing a deeper understanding of the role and impact of altmetrics in computer science and give a glance at the publications mentioned on Twitter that are most relevant for the computer science community. Our results show a link sharing culture that concentrates more heavily on public and professional quality information than the Twitter sample does. The results also show a broad variety in linked sources and especially in linked publications with some publications clearly related to community-specific interests of computer scientists, while others with a strong relation to attention mechanisms in social media. This refers to the observation that Twitter is a hybrid form of social media between an information service and a social network service. Overall the computer scientists’ style of usage seems to be more on the information-oriented side and to some degree also on professional usage. Therefore, altmetrics are of considerable use in analyzing computer science."
https://openalex.org/W2697066943,"Activating mutations in codon 12 and codon 13 of the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) gene are implicated in the development of several human cancer types and influence their clinical evaluation, treatment and prognosis. Numerous different methods for KRAS genotyping are currently available displaying a wide range of sensitivities, time to answer and requirements for laboratory equipment and user skills. Here we present SensiScreen® KRAS exon 2 simplex and multiplex CE IVD assays, that use a novel real-time PCR-based method for KRAS mutation detection based on PentaBase's proprietary DNA analogue technology and designed to work on standard real-time PCR instruments. By means of the included BaseBlocker™ technology, we show that SensiScreen® specifically amplifies the mutated alleles of interest with no or highly subdued amplification of the wild type allele. Furthermore, serial dilutions of mutant DNA in a wild type background demonstrate that all SensiScreen® assays display a limit of detection that falls within the range of 0.25-1%. Finally, in three different colorectal cancer patient populations, SensiScreen® assays confirmed the KRAS genotype previously determined by commonly used methods for KRAS mutation testing, and notably, in two of the populations, SensiScreen® identified additional mutant positive cases not detected by common methods."
https://openalex.org/W2701410739,"Skeletal muscle weakness is a prominent feature in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, we investigated whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) training protects against skeletal muscle dysfunction in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). AIA was produced by intraarticular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the knees of Wistar rats. For NMES training, dorsiflexor muscles were stimulated via a surface electrode (0.5 ms pulse, 50 Hz, 2 s on/4 s off). NMES training was performed every other day for three weeks and consisted of three sets produced at three min intervals. In each set, the electrical current was set to achieve 60% of the initial maximum isometric torque and the current was progressively increased to maintain this torque; stimulation was stopped when the 60% torque could no longer be maintained. After the intervention period, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were excised and used for physiological and biochemical analyses. There was a reduction in specific force production (i.e. force per cross-sectional area) in AIA EDL muscles, which was accompanied by aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and desmin. Moreover, the protein expressions of the pro-oxidative enzymes NADPH oxidase, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, p62, and the ratio of the autophagosome marker LC3bII/LC3bI were increased in AIA EDL muscles. NMES training prevented all these AIA-induced alterations. The present data suggest that NMES training prevents AIA-induced skeletal muscle weakness presumably by counteracting the formation of actin and desmin aggregates. Thus, NMES training can be an effective treatment for muscle dysfunction in patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2696996933,"The analysis of open-minded attitudes towards sexuality in general requires a construct based on attitudinal dimensions. Although several existing studies involve sexual attitudes, they differ substantially and standardized conceptual work is missing. Thus, the authors introduce the latent variable sexual openness to develop a construct based on self-oriented attitudes towards different sexual topics. Available survey data of female German students in a steady relationship allowed providing a first empirical test for the applicability of this construct. Five subdimensions are acknowledged central for sexual openness: sexual practices, masturbation, bisexuality, permissiveness, and pornography consumption. Confirmatory factor analysis and correlations confirmed the idea of an underlying mechanism with an impact on all five variables. Though further validation of the construct of sexual openness is required, the findings strongly support the notion of an overarching latent attitude variable, which influences the individual relation to everything sexual. The results were compared to other studies and potential approaches for future analyses were proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2721544227,"The range of ATP concentrations that can be measured with a fluorescent reagentless biosensor for ATP has been increased by modulating its affinity for this analyte. The ATP biosensor is an adduct of two tetramethylrhodamines with MatB from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Mutations were introduced into the binding site to modify ATP binding affinity, while aiming to maintain the concomitant fluorescence signal. Using this signal, the effect of mutations in different parts of the binding site was measured. This mutational analysis revealed three variants in particular, each with a single mutation in the phosphate-binding loop, which had potentially beneficial changes in ATP binding properties but preserving a fluorescence change of ~3-fold on ATP binding. Two variants (T167A and T303A) weakened the binding, changing the dissociation constant from the parent's 6 μM to 123 μM and 42 μM, respectively. Kinetic measurements showed that the effect of these mutations on affinity was by an increase in dissociation rate constants. These variants widen the range of ATP concentration that can be measured readily by this biosensor to >100 μM. In contrast, a third variant, S170A, decreased the dissociation constant of ATP to 3.8 μM and has a fluorescence change of 4.2 on binding ATP. This variant has increased selectivity for ATP over ADP of >200-fold. This had advantages over the parent by increasing sensitivity as well as increasing selectivity during ATP measurements in which ADP is present."

https://openalex.org/W2686828390,"During the last 25 years angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors spectacularly conquered the field of cardiovascular diseases therapy. Nevertheless, lack of new studies concerning side effects associated with their chronic administration seems to be rather confusing. In our previous research, we proved that the main furnidipines’ metabolite (M-2) possess multiple cardioprotective actions. Currently, we compared effects of post-infarction long-term oral treatment with M-2 and captopril on hemodynamic parameters and “ischemic cardiomyopathy” development in rats. Myocardial infarction was evoked by permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 35 days. Surviving rats were treated with captopril (2 × 25 mg/kg) or M-2 (4 mg/kg) from 6th– 35th day. At 35th day rats’ hearts were tested on working heart setup, where following parameters were measured: heart rate, preload pressure, aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, aortic maximum rise and fall, aortic and coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption and oximetry in perfusate. Subsequently, heart tissue specimens were assessed during morphological estimation. Captopril caused significant heart rate increase and markedly diminished preload pressure in comparison to M-2. Both drugs evoked essential aortic pressure increase. Aortic flow was significantly decreased after M-2, whereas captopril increased this parameter in comparison to M-2. Both agents caused marked coronary flow increase. Morphologic examination in captopril revealed cardiomyopathic process in 70% of hearts, whereas in M-2 this value reached 30%. Neovascularization of post-infarcted myocardium was visible only after M-2 therapy. Concluding, M-2 presented itself as more attractive agent in long-term post-infarction treatment by preventing cardiomyopathy development, angiogenesis stimulation and preserving cardiac performance."
