https://openalex.org/W123626623,"The base sequence of the ribosome binding site region of the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase gene has been determined. The leader peptide sequence of 24 amino acids which precedes the NH2 terminus of extracellular S. aureus beta-lactamase has also been established. This initiation site possesses two unique features not observed for most initiation sites recognized by Escherichia coli ribosomes. A novel initiation codon, UUG, initiates protein synthesis with methionine; and a very strong Shine-Dalgarno complementarity containing five G-C base pairs precedes the UUG initiation codon. The strong Shine-Dalgarno complementarity may explain the reduced translational dependence on initiation factor IF-3 function that has been observed for the beta-lactamase mRNA and other mRNAs from Gram-positive bacteria. We suggest that this extent of complementarity between the mRNA and this extent of complementarity between the mRNA and the ribosome may be a requirement for efficient initiation by Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive ribosomes, and may provide the basis for the observed inability of the Gram-positive systems to translate most of the mRNAs from Gram-negative bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1494267392,"Subperiosteal fetal calf bone is subjected to sequential dissociative extraction in the presence of protease inhibitors first with guanidine HCl and then with guanidine HCl/EDTA. Over two-thirds of the total noncollagenous protein is recovered in the second extraction step, which operationally solubilizes proteins associated with the apatite of mineralized bone lamellae. Three new proteins, comprising over 40% of the fetal bone noncollagenous protein, are purified from the second extract by gel filtration in 4 M guanidine HCl and ion exchange in 7 M urea. These are two glycoproteins both containing organic phosphate at apparent molecular sizes of 32,000 and 62,000 daltons and a protein of 24,000 daltons containing both hydroxyproline and organic phosphate. Of these three proteins, the Mr = 32,000 species binds to apatite and collagen with the greatest affinity. It comprises 25% of the fetal calf bone noncollagenous protein and is selectively adsorbed both by apatite crystals in 4 M guanidine HCl and on gelatin affinity columns at physiological pH and ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2056666582,"Lysis of exponential cultures of B. subtilis follows the addition of reagents that dissipate either the electrical or pH gradients of cellular membranes. Stationary-phase cells or cultures that have been inhibited in division by macromolecular-synthesis inhibitors also lyse when uncoupling agents or ionophores are added to the growth medium. Autolysis occurs after brief starvation for a carbon source. Protoplasts are unaffected by azide or other lysis-inducing agents. Electron-donating agents, such as phenazine methosulfate and ascorbate, are effective in retarding autolysis. The addition of an oxidizable carbon source to starved and lysing cultures prevents their autolysis. These results suggest that cellular lysis in B. subtilis and energized membrane are tightly coupled. The fluorescence intensity and the wavelength of maximal fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, when added to bacterial suspensions, appear to be qualitatively related to the rate of cell lysis. Analyses show that ATP limitations are probably not involved in the elicitation of lysis by ionophores, uncoupling agents or starvation. Measurements of protonmotive forces in the lysis-prone cells suggest that a threshold force of more than 85 mV may be required to maintain cellular integrity. Lipoteichoic acids, polyelectrolytes such as dextran sulfate or phospholipids do not modify the rate of cellular lysis when added to suspensions containing azide or other reagents that eliminate transmembrane protonmotive forces. We interpret the results to suggest that the in vivo control of autolysin activity in B. subtilis is related to the energized membrane"

https://openalex.org/W2085850205,Diet-induced atherosclerosis in macaque monkeys was suppressed by anticalcifying agents without changing abnormal levels of blood cholesterol and lipoprotein. The agents included inhibitors of arterial calcium deposition (diphosphonates) and a calcium ion antagonist (lanthanum). The study suggests that regulation of calcium flux and extracellular deposition in arteries may offer new principles of treatment for cardiovascular disease.
https://openalex.org/W1571327998,"[1-14C]Eicosatetraenoic (arachidonic) acid was incubated with a low speed (17,000 X g) rabbit renal cortical supernatant or with a cortical microsomal suspension fortified with NADPH for 15 min at 37 degrees C. The products which were less polar than prostaglandins on reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both the fortified microsomes and the low speed supernatant formed significant amounts of two novel metabolites, 11,12-dihydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid and 14,15-dihydroxy-5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid. Other identified products were 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 19-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid, and in the low speed supernatant, eicosatetraen-1,20-dioic acid. The metabolites were not formed in significant amounts by high speed cortical supernatant or by nonfortified cortical microsomes. Carbon monoxide inhibited formation of these compounds, indicating that they may be formed by the cytochrome P-450-linked renal monooxygenase systems."
https://openalex.org/W1624875646,"Arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenase was purified from rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The enzyme was recovered in the cytosol fraction after sonication and purified about 250-fold by acetone precipitation, column chromatography on CM52, Sephadex G-150, and hydroxyapatite. The enzyme catalyzed the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), which then decomposed to a mixture of 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), 15-keto-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid, 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxy-5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid, and 11,14,15-trihydroxy-5,8,12-eicosatrienoic acid. The enzyme was specific for oxygenation at carbon 15 of arachidonic acid. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was about 61,000 as measured by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme was sensitive to sulfhydryl-blocking reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid. The enzyme activity was inhibited by eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) or 3-amino-1-(m-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)2-pyrazoline (BW755C), but not by indomethacin up to 200 micrograms/ml."
https://openalex.org/W2093104985,"Low Ca2+ extracts of platelets rapidly form an actin gel when warmed to 25 degrees C. The addition of Ca2+ has three effects. At Ca/EGTA = 0.4, the gel begins to contract. Increasing the Ca2+ concentration increases the rate of contraction and reduces the amount of actomyosin gel. Between Ca/EGTA = 0.4 and 0.5, a protease is activated that selectively degrades polypeptides with molecular weight greater than the myosin heavy chain. At Ca/EGTA = 1, about 70% of the total actin is nonsedimentable. Addition of excess EGTA produces the rapid formation of an actomyosin gel, which is not readily solubilized by re-addition of calcium. Using DNAase l-Sepharose chromatography, we have isolated a protein fraction whose binding to actin is Ca2+ -dependent. This fraction contains a major polypeptide with a molecular weight of 90,000. This fraction increases the rate of development of high sheer viscosity, but lowers the final value if Ca2+ is present. This decrease in viscosity is due to the generation of shorter filaments. In the presence of Ca2+, this protein(s) selectively blocks the addition of actin monomers to the barbed end of glutaraldehyde-fixed S1-decorated actin fragments and will nucleate assembly of filaments. We speculate that this protein(s) may serve as a Ca2+ -dependent nucleation site in situ."

https://openalex.org/W1600027580,"A proteoglycan was isolated from ascites fluid produced by a rat yolk sac tumor. The glycosaminoglycan chains of the proteoglycan are all sensitive to digestion with chondroitinase ABC and about 90% are sensitive to chondroitinase AC. The proteoglycan contains 5% protein. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of serine and glycine which together constitute 37% of the amino acids. Glutamic acid (glutamine) and aspartic acid (asparagine) are also abundant. Galactosamine accounts for 97% of the hexosamine and the remainder is glucosamine. These characteristics indicate that the glycosaminoglycan side chains of this proteoglycan are predominantly chondroitin sulfate with a smaller amount of dermatan sulfate. Antibodies to the proteoglycan were prepared by immunization of a rabbit with purified alkali-treated proteoglycan. Affinity-purified antibodies from the antiserum immunoprecipitated (35S)sulfate-labeled radioactivity from culture media of the yolk sac tumor cells known to contain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This binding was inhibited by the intact purified proteoglycan but not by proteoglycan treated with papain, suggesting dependence of the reactivity of the antibodies on integrity of the protein part of the proteoglycan. Immunofluorescence of the cultured yolk sac tumor cells revealed localization of immune reactive proteoglycans at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2012329279,"An electron microscopic investigation of kinetochore structure during the first meiotic division in male Drosophila melanogaster is presented. The data suggest that the structure that is responsible for initial microtubule attachment and chromosome orientation is a single, bilaminar hemisphere on each half-bivalent. Following the initial attachment this structure undergoes morphogenesis to a double-disc structure that reflects the underlying duality of sister chromatids in the half-bivalent. Thus these data support Darlington's idea that sister chromatids disjoin to the same spindle pole because they share a single kinetochore. Additionally, these data suggest that the meiotic mutations ord and mel-S332 sometimes cause premature ""doubling"" of the kinetochore region though, as discussed, possibly for a trivial reason."
https://openalex.org/W1541157478,"Uptake of calcium by a membrane fraction enriched in basolateral plasma membrane vesicles from rat small intestine has been investigated using a rapid filtration technique. Calcium accumulation is stimulated by ATP and released by the calcium ionophore A23187. Kinetic studies indicate a calcium concentration of 28 nM for half-maximal stimulation of ATP-driven uptake. Transport is minimally inhibited by oligomycin and ouabain but is reduced 40% by lanthanum and abolished by 50 microM vanadate. The ATP-dependent calcium uptake is stimulated by the calcium regulatory protein, calmodulin, in a dose-dependent fashion. Calmodulin increases both the maximal transport rate and the calcium affinity of the transport mechanism. These results are consistent with the existence of an ATP-dependent, calmodulin-regulated calcium transport mechanism in the basolateral plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, and suggests that calmodulin may modulate transepithelial calcium absorption in addition to controlling cytosolic calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1997087750,"Hybrid transducing phages were constructed in vitro that carry the galK gene fused to each of three ribosomal promoters: the promoter for an rRNA operon (rrnE); the promoter for the spc r protein operon; and the promoter for the α r protein operon. We also constructed hybrid transducing phages that carry the lacZ gene fused to the promoter for the rrnE operon or to the promoter for the spc r protein operon. The amounts of galactokinase (or β-galactosidase) were analyzed in lysogens carrying these various transducing phages grown in several different growth media. The synthesis rate of galactokinase (or β-galactosidase) from the fused rrn-gal (or rrn-lac) operon relative to the total protein synthesis rate increased with increasing growth rate, as expected from the transcriptional activity of rRNA operons. In contrast, the relative synthesis rate of galactokinase (or β-galactosidase) from the operon fused to α or spc r protein promoter remained approximately constant with increasing growth rate. These results were interpreted to mean that the characteristic increase in the relative synthesis rate of r protein with increasing growth rate is determined not by transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, but by posttranscriptional mechanisms, which presumably involve the feedback inhibition of r protein mRNA translation by free r proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1548261300,"Abstract Tripeptides containing aromatic residues between basic ones, such as Lys-Trp-Lys and Lys-Tyr-Lys can nick supercoiled or relaxed DNAs containing apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP-sites). The nicking, which is ionic strength-dependent, occurs at AP-sites, since native PM2 DNA is not hydrolyzed. The nicking activity of the tripeptides at AP-sites occurs in total darkness. An activation energy of 21 +/- 2 kcal . mol-1 has been calculated for the incision of PM2 DNA by Lys-Trp-Lys. Tripeptides without aromatic residues, such as Lys-Ala-Lys-O-Methyl and Lys-Lys-Lys, can nick apurinic DNA, although with a much lower efficiency. Relaxed depurinated PM2 DNA is a poor substrate for the tripeptide, indicating that single-stranded regions are better recognition sites. The nicking of the DNA backbone probably occurs by beta elimination, since reduced AP-sites do not act as substrate. The termini generated are 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphoryl."

https://openalex.org/W1521213011,"The biosynthesis of the erythrocyte anion transport protein (Band III) was studied in erythroid precursor cells obtained from the spleens of anemic mice. Newly synthesized Band III was inserted during or immediately after translation into rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The asymmetric orientation of Band III in these membranes resembled that of mature Band III in erythrocyte membranes, with the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule facing the cytoplasm. At this stage Band III contained a high mannose core oligosaccharide, which was susceptible to cleavage by endoglycosidase H. During the next 20 to 30 min, this oligosaccharide was processed to a form resistant to endoglycosidase H degradation, presumably in the Golgi complex. The processed Band III was subsequently expressed on the cell surface, at about 30 to 45 min after synthesis. In many respects, therefore, the biosynthesis of Band III resembles that of cotranslationally inserted proteins whose NH2-terminal portions are exposed on the exterior of the cell, like VSV glycoprotein, HLA-A antigens, and glycophorin."

https://openalex.org/W1530814774,"The cellular distribution in Drosophila Kc cells of [35S]methionine-labeled heat shock proteins has been examined by 0.2% Nonidet P-40-mediated cell lysis and Na-deoxycholate-Tween 40 extraction of the nuclei. The 83,000-dalton heat shock protein was limited to the detergent extracts while the remaining heat shock proteins were found both in a soluble pool in the detergent extracts and in a bound pool in the nuclei. The bound pool included the 70,000-68,000-, 27,000-, 26,000-, 23,000-, and 21,000-dalton heat shock proteins; these proteins accumulated in the nuclei during the time course of heat shock as assayed by [35S]methionine labeling and dye binding on gel electropherograms. DNA and histone-depleted nuclei were prepared by extensive nuclease digestion, 2.0 M NaCl extraction, and sedimentation of the original detergent-washed nuclei. Of the 35S-labeled bound pool, 69% remained associated in a rapidly sedimenting complex that retained only approximately 5% of the DNA. Thus, the binding of the 70,000-68,000-, 27,000-, 26,000-, 23,000-, and 21,000-dalton heat shock proteins appeared primarily to be with the nuclear scaffold rather than the chromatin. We conclude from the mass of heat shock protein synthesis that these proteins probably are structural elements of the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W1530897229,"A synergistic activation of phosphorylase kinase by Ca2+ plus Mg2+ was found to be the primary cause of the hysteresis, or lag, in the phosphorylase kinase reaction. Preincubation of the enzyme for short times with Ca2+ plus Mg2+ resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in the kinase activity in subsequent assays with phosphorylase b or phosphorylase kinase as substrates, whereas preincubation with each metal ion by itself had no effect. Maximal activation through preincubation with Ca2+ plus Mg2+ occurred in 1 min 45 s and was readily reversed by chelation of both metal ions. As a result of the activation, the progress curve of phosphorylase b conversion at pH 6.8 was found to be nearly linear. Activation by Ca2+ plus Mg2+ was not apparent when subsequent assays were carried out at pH 8.2, or when previously autophosphorylated enzyme was used. Furthermore, the synergistic activation was found to occur significantly slower and/or to decrease in the presence of ATP, phosphorylase b, beta-glycerophosphate, and inorganic phosphate. How the synergistic activation by Ca2+ plus Mg2+ relates to autophosphorylation and the lag in the phosphorylase kinase reaction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583375752,"Chemical modification of human degraded form of plasminogen with NH2-terminal lysine (Lys-plasminogen) and the elastase fragments kringle 1 + 2 + 3 and kringle 4 with the tryptophan reagent [14C]dimethyl(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)sulfonium bromide results in the incorporation of label and the parallel loss of lysine binding ability. In the case of kringle 4, only one-half of the lysine binding sites could be inactivated, but the modified and unmodified forms could be separated by affinity chromatography. The modified form contained 1 mol of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl groups/mol of kringle 4 and did not bind to lysine-Sepharose. Lysine analogs such as 6-aminohexanoic acid protected kringle 4 against modification. Peptide-mapping studies on this form showed that essentially all of the label was in two chymotryptic peptides containing a tryptophan corresponding to Trp426 in the plasminogen sequence. Competition experiments with anti-kringle 4 antibodies having an affinity for the lysine binding site showed that the binding of 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl-kringle 4 to antibodies was about 10 times weaker than for unmodified kringle 4. These results indicate that the integrity of specific tryptophan residue is critical to the binding of lysine and related amino acids to kringle 4of human plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1605793001,"The complete primary structure of osteocalcin, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing calcium-binding protein isolated from chicken bone has been determined by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry. The method involves decarboxylation of the dry, intact protein in a low pressure atmosphere of DCl under conditions which quantitatively convert Gla into gamma, gamma-dideuteroglutamic acid residues without resulting in peptide bond cleavage. After partial enzymatic or acidic hydrolysis, the peptide mixtures are converted (without isolation of individual peptides) to the N-trifluorodideuteroethyl O-trimethylsilyl polyamino alcohols and analyzed by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry. Peptide fragments containing former Gla residues behave like Glu-containing peptides, but their mass spectra are shifted upward by 2 mass units/Gla residue. Chicken osteocalcin contains 50 amino acids, three of which are Gla. The structure is highly homologous to the sequence of the corresponding protein isolated from bovine bone, and the relative sequence locations of the Gla residues and the disulfide bridge are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1607158439,"Previous reports, using a variety of myeloma cell lines and activated normal B cells, have shown that different classes of immunoglobulins have different carbohydrate requirements for secretion. Thus, secretion of IgM and IgE was almost totally blocked by the antibiotic tunicamycin, secretion of IgA was partially inhibited, and secretion of IgG was essentially unaffected (Hickman, S., Kulczycki, A., Jr., Lynch, R. G., and Kornfeld, S. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4402-4408; Hickman S., (1978) J. Immunol. 121, 990-996). Here, similar experiments using hybridoma cell lines secreting IgM and IgG or IgD are reported. Tunicamycin prevented the majority of IgM secretion but did not affect IgG secretion in cells producing both isotypes. This shows that the differential effects of tunicamycin on IgM and IgG secretion are due to factors intrinsic to the respective heavy chain polypeptides themselves, rather than to other properties of the producing cells. The secretion of IgD, which is as heavily glycosylated as IgM, was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Thus, the simple degree of immunoglobulin heavy chain glycosylation does not determine the extent of the requirement for glycosylation in the secretion of that isotype."

https://openalex.org/W1549065041,"A23187-treated platelets secrete dense granule constituents during centrifugation, an artifact that is presented by prior formalin fixation (Holmsen, H., and Setkowsky-Dangelmaier, C. A. (1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 497, 46-61). With this improved assay, A23187 induced no secretion in nonaggregating platelets and maximal secretion in aggregating platelets within 3 min. Further incubation gave a slow, submaximal secretion in nonaggregating cells. Acetylsalicylate abolished secretion in both systems. EDTA, but not ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, strongly enhanced secretion in nonaggregating platelets suspended in Mg2+-containing, Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution. Without added Mg2+, A23187 gave maximal secretion in nonaggregating platelets which was abolished by added Mg2+. Preincubation of A23187 and MgCl2 gave inhibition patterns which clearly suggested that formation of Mg.A23187 species was the cause of inhibition. Ca2+, but not Sr2+, inhibited A23187-induced secretion in the same manner as Mg2+. These findings suggest that the platelet plasma membrane has no or very little permeability for Ca2+ . and Mg2+ . A23187 species. In the physiological suspending medium, Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution, A23187-induced platelet secretion is markedly enhanced by close cell contact (aggregation) and has an absolute requirement for production of prostaglandins and/or thromboxanes. Therefore, the widely held view that secretion is directly triggered by A23187-induced increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is not applicable to platelets."

https://openalex.org/W1628429170,"Light-dark-cycled rats were fed a 3% cholesterol-supplemented diet at the beginning of the dark phase. Cholesterol-fed and control animals were taken at intervals throughout the following 12 h and the microsomal and solubilized hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was isolated. Immunotitrations of this microsomal and solubilized enzyme were performed with a monospecific antibody to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In contrast to the specific activity of the enzyme, which differs extremely during the diurnal cycle, the immunotitrations obtained from cholesterol-fed and control animals, yielded in identical antisera equivalence points. On the other hand, when the enzyme was phosphorylated in vitro, the antisera equivalence points corresponded to the alterations of the specific activity. In contrast to the results published by Higgins and Rudney ((1973) Nature New Biol. 246, 60-61), our data prove that even the in vivo short term changes in enzyme activity are due to changes in the quantity of enzyme rather than to a modulation of the catalytic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1495037793,"Pulse-chase experiments utilizing intact Tetrahymena revealed that at least six proteins (molecular weights, 61,000, 56,000, 51,000, 48,000, 42,000, and 38,000) were unstable and underwent proteolytic cleavage during the first 20 min of the chase period. At least 9 product polypeptides (molecular weights, 45,000, 41,000, 25,000, 21,000, 20,000, 18,000, 17,000, 16,000, and 15,000) appeared during the chase. The proposal that the product polypeptides were actually mucocyst constituents was supported by a variety of observations. First, treatment of whole cells in a complete media with dibucaine caused precursor cleavage and product accumulation with kinetics that were consistent with previous morphologic observations on mucocyst formation. Second, the product polypeptides were enriched in a cell fraction containing just cortical components and amorphous material consistent with aggregated mucus. Third, the labeled product polypeptides in the cortex comigrated with partially purified labeled mucus obtained by dibucaine treatment of whole cells. Fourth, one-dimensional peptide mapping of the 45-kilodalton product confirmed that the post-translationally derived product in whole cell pulse-chase experiments was similar to the purified products in the cortex fraction and in dibucaine-released mucus. Two-dimensional peptide mapping of the 125I-labeled tryptic peptides of three pairs of products in the cortex and mucus further suggested a strong homology. The cleavage of mucocyst precursors was blocked by agents which deplete ATP levels and by N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone. Preliminary structural relationships were established between some of the precursors and products by one-dimensional peptide mapping. Models for the biogenesis of mucocysts are discussed, and it is proposed that the additional sequence information present in the precursors may be required for the intracellular transport of these proteins or their insertion and assembly within the mucocyst."
https://openalex.org/W1507570901,"Protein I is a synaptic protein which serves as an endogenous substrate for cyclic AMP- and calcium-dependent protein kinases. Antibodies raised against purified Protein I have been isolated from rabbit antiserum by affinity chromatography on Protein I-conjugated agarose column. The purified antibodies were identified as immunoglobulin G by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion precipitation test. The purified antibodies not only inhibited the phosphorylation of purified Protein I by exogenous cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, but also inhibited specifically the phosphorylation of Protein I by endogenous cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in a synaptic vesicle fraction, synaptic junctional complex fraction, synaptic membrane fraction, and crude homogenate of cerebrum. The purified anti-Protein I antibodies also inhibited with a similar potency calcium-dependent phosphorylation of Protein I without affecting the phosphorylation of other proteins. The Fab(t) fragment of anti-Protein I immunoglobulin G, which was produced by tryptic digestion, retained the ability to inhibit specifically the phosphorylation of Protein I. This substrate-directed, specific inhibitor of the phosphorylation of Protein I may provide a unique probe for investigating the function of Protein I phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1928226134,"We have purified the membrane-extrinsic anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli using a strain harboring a recombinant ColE1:E. coli plasmid carrying the glpA gene. The purified enzyme is composed of subunits of 62,000 and 43,000 molecular weight in 1:1 molar ratio as determined by medium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium, and chemical cross-linking studies. The presence of 20% ethylene glycol stabilizes the enzyme by preventing dissociation of the subunits. The purified enzyme contains 1 mol of noncovalently bound FAD and 2 mol of non-heme iron/dimer. The FAD can be reduced by addition of substrate and resides in the large subunit. Addition of exogenous flavins stimulates the rate of the enzymatic reaction, and the effects of FAD and FMN can be distinguished by the following properties: (i) FAD causes a 20% increase in enzymatic activity with a half-maximal concentration of 200 nM whereas FMN results in a 6-fold increase in activity with a half-maximal concentration of 130 microM. (ii) When methylene blue replaces phenazine methosulfate as an oxidation-reduction coupling dye, FAD stimulates the rate of the reaction, whereas FMN inhibits it. Limited proteolysis or treatment with sulfhydryl reagents does not affect activity but removes capacity for stimulation by exogenous flavins."

Comparison of this sequence with those of C-phycocyanins shows that there are 60 identities between corresponding subunits of these two biliproteins. Of the region between residues 79 and 120, 29 residues are identical in the beta subunits of allophycocyanin and phycocyanin. The character of all 10 charged residues in this region of the beta subunit sequences is completely conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1611863561,"To determine the relative contributions of glucose, insulin, dexamethasone, and triiodothyronine to the induction of hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hepatocytes isolated from normal or adrenalectomized rats, either fasted or fed, were examined in culture. Addition of insulin (42 milliunits/ml, 0.9 microM) and dexamethasone (1 microM) to hepatocytes obtained from 3-day-fasted rats and cultured for 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's medium resulted in a 7- to 11-fold increase in Glc-6-P dehydrogenase specific activity compared with a 2- to 3-fold increase in activity in control cultures incubated without added hormones. The effects of insulin and dexamethasone were independent of DNA synthesis, dose-dependent, and additive; each contributing about one-half of the total response. Medium glucose was neither sufficient nor necessary for the insulin- or dexamethasone-stimulated increase in Glc-6-P dehydrogenase specific activity. Addition of triiodothyronine (10 microM) preferentially blocked the dexamethasone-stimulated increase in Glc-6-P dehydrogenase specific activity. Insulin failed to stimulate the induction of Glc-6-P dehydrogenase in hepatocytes obtained from normal fed rats or from fasted and fed adrenalectomized rats. However, insulin caused a significant increase in the Glc-6-P dehydrogenase specific activity of these cells when dexamethasone was concurrently added to the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2139402451,"Inactive Drosophila heat-shock genes of isolated diploid nuclei can be induced to a transcriptionally active state by exposure to cytoplasmic extracts from heat-shocked Drosophila cells. No effect was observed on histone gene transcription, and extracts from non-heat-shocked cells were ineffective. The factor in the cytoplasmic extract has been partially purified and characterized. It is protease-sensitive and heat-labile. A striking change accompanies in vitro activation that permits transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase of the chromatin 5′-distal to the structural genes at the 87A and 87C heat-shock gene loci; we have previously observed a similar change after in vivo heat-shock induction. That this change occurred in the absence of endogenous RNA polymerase II activity suggests that these changes may reflect the earliest event in gene activation. Inasmuch as activation also took place after histone H1 depletion, this histone does not appear to be essential for this step of gene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2010827712,"In young animals that had received multiple doses of calcium-45, a constant ratio of calcium-45 specific activity in blood to that in bone was found in growing dogs and chicks but not in rats. This steady-state relationship of calcium-45 between bone and blood suggests that during growth in dogs and chicks most of the skeletal calcium is in an active state of turnover. In growing rats, after the first 2 weeks of life, the blood/bone ratio of calcium-45 decreases due to a decrease in bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1510421802,"Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) combine to form three isolatable complexes of molar stoichiometry of 240:1 75:1, and 45:1, respectively. Steady state fluorescence depolarization studies with diphenylhexatriene (DPH) and parinaric acid incorporated into the DMPC/apoA-II complexes reveal that increasing the protein content reduces fluidity and increases the apparent lipid phase transition (Tc). Time-resolved studies with DPH reveal hindered rotational motion and a loss of fluidity with increasing protein content, arising from an increase in the order of the lipid assay. The parinaric acid probes could detect no lateral phase separation of lipid ensembles in the DMPC/apoA-II complexes, suggesting that the DMPC adjacent to the protein is as mobile as bulk lipid. Measurements of the excimer-forming properties of a pyrene lecithin analog show that the increasing protein content in the DMPC/apoA-II complexes reduces lateral diffusion of the lipid."

https://openalex.org/W87789349,"Single bilayer vesicles (d less than 1.02 g/ml) of 3H-glycosphingolipids and [14C]phosphatidylcholine in the molar ratio of 1:7 were prepared by ethanolic injection of the lipid mixture into buffer, concentrated, and incubated with human serum high density lipoprotein-3 (HDL3; d = .14 g/ml) at 37 degrees C. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation of the incubation mixtures on a 0-22% NaBr gradient revealed the presence of three discrete lipid-protein complexes of density 1.03, 1.06, and 1.12 g/ml (Peaks I, II, and III, respectively). Each peak was homogeneous upon reultracentrifugation and the protein and radioactivity eluted as a single peak upon Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. Compositional analysis showed peak I to contain 2.6% protein (apo-A-I peptide) and 4.3% cholesterol, peak II to contain 17.6% protein (apo-A-I peptide) and 6.3% cholesterol, and peak III to have a composition similar to HDL3. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples confirmed the homogeneity of the peaks and the similarity between peak III and HDL3. Peak II particles were larger than HDL3; peak I particles resembled fused or aggregated vesicles which could be removed by ultracentrifugation; disc-shaped particles were not seen in any of the fractions. Direct incubation of HDL3 or human serum with 3H-glycosphingolipid dispersions did not yield a glycolipid . HDL3 complex as judged by density gradient ultracentrifugation and Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. However, incubation of 3H-glycolipid/phosphatidylcholine vesicles with serum did result in transfer of 3H-glycolipid to the HDL fraction. It was concluded that glycolipids incorporated into a lipid membrane structure can interact with, and become incorporated into, high density lipoprotein."
