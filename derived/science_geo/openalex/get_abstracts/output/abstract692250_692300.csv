https://openalex.org/W4224241070,"International policy is focused on increasing the proportion of the Earth's surface that is protected for nature1,2. Although studies show that protected areas prevent habitat loss3-6, there is a lack of evidence for their effect on species' populations: existing studies are at local scale or use simple designs that lack appropriate controls7-13. Here we explore how 1,506 protected areas have affected the trajectories of 27,055 waterbird populations across the globe using a robust before-after control-intervention study design, which compares protected and unprotected populations in the years before and after protection. We show that the simpler study designs typically used to assess protected area effectiveness (before-after or control-intervention) incorrectly estimate effects for 37-50% of populations-for instance misclassifying positively impacted populations as negatively impacted, and vice versa. Using our robust study design, we find that protected areas have a mixed impact on waterbirds, with a strong signal that areas managed for waterbirds or their habitat are more likely to benefit populations, and a weak signal that larger areas are more beneficial than smaller ones. Calls to conserve 30% of the Earth's surface by 2030 are gathering pace14, but we show that protection alone does not guarantee good biodiversity outcomes. As countries gather to agree the new Global Biodiversity Framework, targets must focus on creating and supporting well-managed protected and conserved areas that measurably benefit populations."
https://openalex.org/W4225297234,"Amplification of the CCNE1 locus on chromosome 19q12 is prevalent in multiple tumour types, particularly in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, uterine tumours and gastro-oesophageal cancers, where high cyclin E levels are associated with genome instability, whole-genome doubling and resistance to cytotoxic and targeted therapies1-4. To uncover therapeutic targets for tumours with CCNE1 amplification, we undertook genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based synthetic lethality screens in cellular models of CCNE1 amplification. Here we report that increasing CCNE1 dosage engenders a vulnerability to the inhibition of the PKMYT1 kinase, a negative regulator of CDK1. To inhibit PKMYT1, we developed RP-6306, an orally bioavailable and selective inhibitor that shows single-agent activity and durable tumour regressions when combined with gemcitabine in models of CCNE1 amplification. RP-6306 treatment causes unscheduled activation of CDK1 selectively in CCNE1-overexpressing cells, promoting early mitosis in cells undergoing DNA synthesis. CCNE1 overexpression disrupts CDK1 homeostasis at least in part through an early activation of the MMB-FOXM1 mitotic transcriptional program. We conclude that PKMYT1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for CCNE1-amplified cancers."

https://openalex.org/W4224252863,"Amyloid-beta and tau are key molecules in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it remains unclear how these proteins interact to promote disease. Here, by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal molecular imaging and network connectivity analyses in living humans, we identified two amyloid-beta/tau interactions associated with the onset and propagation of tau spreading. First, we show that the lateral entorhinal cortex, an early site of tau neurofibrillary tangle formation, is subject to remote, connectivity-mediated amyloid-beta/tau interactions linked to initial tau spreading. Second, we identify the inferior temporal gyrus as the region featuring the greatest local amyloid-beta/tau interactions and a connectivity profile well suited to accelerate tau propagation. Taken together, our data address long-standing questions regarding the topographical dissimilarity between early amyloid-beta and tau deposition."
https://openalex.org/W4224293494,"Cellular transformation induces phenotypically diverse populations of tumour-infiltrating T cells1-5, and immune checkpoint blockade therapies preferentially target T cells that recognize cancer cell neoantigens6,7. Yet, how other classes of tumour-infiltrating T cells contribute to cancer immunosurveillance remains elusive. Here, in a survey of T cells in mouse and human malignancies, we identified a population of αβ T cell receptor (TCR)-positive FCER1G-expressing innate-like T cells with high cytotoxic potential8 (ILTCKs). These cells were broadly reactive to unmutated self-antigens, arose from distinct thymic progenitors following early encounter with cognate antigens, and were continuously replenished by thymic progenitors during tumour progression. Notably, expansion and effector differentiation of intratumoural ILTCKs depended on interleukin-15 (IL-15) expression in cancer cells, and inducible activation of IL-15 signalling in adoptively transferred ILTCK progenitors suppressed tumour growth. Thus, the antigen receptor self-reactivity, unique ontogeny, and distinct cancer cell-sensing mechanism distinguish ILTCKs from conventional cytotoxic T cells, and define a new class of tumour-elicited immune response."
https://openalex.org/W4224262640,"Empathic pain has attracted the interest of a substantial number of researchers studying the social transfer of pain in the sociological, psychological, and neuroscience fields. However, the neural mechanism of empathic pain remains elusive. Here, we establish a long-term observational pain model in mice and find that glutamatergic projection from the insular cortex (IC) to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for the formation of observational pain. The selective activation or inhibition of the IC-BLA projection pathway strengthens or weakens the intensity of observational pain, respectively. The synaptic molecules are screened, and the upregulated synaptotagmin-2 and RIM3 are identified as key signals in controlling the increased synaptic glutamate transmission from the IC to the BLA. Together, these results reveal the molecular and synaptic mechanisms of a previously unidentified neural pathway that regulates observational pain in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4224224540,"Abstract Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that open their pores in response to binding of the agonist glutamate 1–3 . An ionic current through a single iGluR channel shows up to four discrete conductance levels (O1–O4) 4–6 . Higher conductance levels have been associated with an increased number of agonist molecules bound to four individual ligand-binding domains (LBDs) 6–10 . Here we determine structures of a synaptic complex of AMPA-subtype iGluR and the auxiliary subunit γ2 in non-desensitizing conditions with various occupancy of the LBDs by glutamate. We show that glutamate binds to LBDs of subunits B and D only after it is already bound to at least the same number of LBDs that belong to subunits A and C. Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine-learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. Conversely, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee maximal channel conductance and favours subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally. The lack of subunit independence and low efficiency coupling of glutamate binding to channel opening underlie the gating of synaptic complexes to submaximal conductance levels, which provide a potential for upregulation of synaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W4226023200,"The adult brain can flexibly adapt behaviors to specific life-stage demands. For example, while sexually naive male mice are aggressive to the conspecific young, they start to provide caregiving to infants around the time when their own young are expected. How such behavioral plasticity is implemented at the level of neural connections remains poorly understood. Here, using viral-genetic approaches, we establish hypothalamic oxytocin neurons as the key regulators of the parental caregiving behaviors of male mice. We then use rabies-virus-mediated unbiased screening to identify excitatory neural connections originating from the lateral hypothalamus to the oxytocin neurons to be drastically strengthened when male mice become fathers. These connections are functionally relevant, as their activation suppresses pup-directed aggression in virgin males. These results demonstrate the life-stage associated, long-distance, and cell-type-specific plasticity of neural connections in the hypothalamus, the brain region that is classically assumed to be hard-wired."
https://openalex.org/W4224237013,"The structure of the human neocortex underlies species-specific traits and reflects intricate developmental programs. Here we sought to reconstruct processes that occur during early development by sampling adult human tissues. We analysed neocortical clones in a post-mortem human brain through a comprehensive assessment of brain somatic mosaicism, acting as neutral lineage recorders1,2. We combined the sampling of 25 distinct anatomic locations with deep whole-genome sequencing in a neurotypical deceased individual and confirmed results with 5 samples collected from each of three additional donors. We identified 259 bona fide mosaic variants from the index case, then deconvolved distinct geographical, cell-type and clade organizations across the brain and other organs. We found that clones derived after the accumulation of 90–200 progenitors in the cerebral cortex tended to respect the midline axis, well before the anterior–posterior or ventral–dorsal axes, representing a secondary hierarchy following the overall patterning of forebrain and hindbrain domains. Clones across neocortically derived cells were consistent with a dual origin from both dorsal and ventral cellular populations, similar to rodents, whereas the microglia lineage appeared distinct from other resident brain cells. Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of brain somatic mosaicism across the neocortex and demonstrate cellular origins and progenitor distribution patterns within the human brain. A comprehensive analysis of brain somatic mosaicism across the neocortex demonstrates the origins and distribution patterns of cells within the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W4224251814,"In December 2017, Lancet called for gender inequality investigations. Holding other factors constant, trends over time for significant author (i.e., first, second, last or any of these authors) publications were examined for the three highest-impact medical research journals (i.e., New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM], Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA], and Lancet).Using randomly sampled 2002-2019 MEDLINE original publications (n = 1,080; 20/year/journal), significant author-based and publication-based characteristics were extracted. Gender assignment used internet-based biographies, pronouns, first names, and photographs. Adjusting for author-specific characteristics and multiple publications per author, generalized estimating equations tested for first, second, and last significant author gender disparities.Compared to 37.23% of 2002 - 2019 U.S. medical school full-time faculty that were women, women's first author publication rates (26.82% overall, 15.83% NEJM, 29.38% Lancet, and 35.39% JAMA; all p < 0.0001) were lower. No improvements over time occurred in women first authorship rates. Women first authors had lower Web of Science citation counts and co-authors/collaborating author counts, less frequently held M.D. or multiple doctoral-level degrees, less commonly published clinical trials or cardiovascular-related projects, but more commonly were North American-based and studied North American-based patients (all p < 0.05). Women second and last authors were similarly underrepresented. Compared to men, women first authors had lower multiple publication rates in these top journals (p < 0.001). Same gender first/last authors resulted in higher multiple publication rates within these top three journals (p < 0.001).Since 2002, this authorship ""gender disparity chasm"" has been tolerated across all these top medical research journals. Despite Lancet's 2017 call to arms, furthermore, the author-based gender disparities have not changed for these top medical research journals - even in recent times. Co-author gender alignment may reduce future gender inequities, but this promising strategy requires further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W4224260750,"Understanding variation in tree functional traits along topographic gradients and through time provides insights into the processes that will shape community composition and determine ecosystem functioning. In montane environments, complex topography is known to affect forest structure and composition, yet its role in determining trait composition, indices on community climatic tolerances, and responses to changing environmental conditions has not been fully explored. This study investigates how functional trait composition (characterized as community-weighted moments) and community climatic indices vary for the tree community as a whole and for its separate demographic components (i.e., dying, surviving, recruiting trees) over eight years in a topographically complex tropical Andean forest in southern Ecuador. We identified a strong influence of topography on functional composition and on species' climatic optima, such that communities at lower topographic positions were dominated by acquisitive species adapted to both warmer and wetter conditions compared to communities at upper topographic positions which were dominated by conservative cold adapted species, possibly due to differences in soil conditions and hydrology. Forest functional and climatic composition remained stable through time; and we found limited evidence for trait-based responses to environmental change among demographic groups. Our findings confirm that fine-scale environmental conditions are a critical factor structuring plant communities in tropical forests, and suggest that slow environmental warming and community-based processes may promote short-term community functional stability. This study highlights the need to explore how diverse aspects of community trait composition vary in tropical montane forests, and to further investigate thresholds of forest response to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W4224297004,"Remarkably well-preserved soft tissues in Mesozoic fossils have yielded substantial insights into the evolution of feathers1. New evidence of branched feathers in pterosaurs suggests that feathers originated in the avemetatarsalian ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs in the Early Triassic2, but the homology of these pterosaur structures with feathers is controversial3,4. Reports of pterosaur feathers with homogeneous ovoid melanosome geometries2,5 suggest that they exhibited limited variation in colour, supporting hypotheses that early feathers functioned primarily in thermoregulation6. Here we report the presence of diverse melanosome geometries in the skin and simple and branched feathers of a tapejarid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous found in Brazil. The melanosomes form distinct populations in different feather types and the skin, a feature previously known only in theropod dinosaurs, including birds. These tissue-specific melanosome geometries in pterosaurs indicate that manipulation of feather colour-and thus functions of feathers in visual communication-has deep evolutionary origins. These features show that genetic regulation of melanosome chemistry and shape7-9 was active early in feather evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4224305838,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; including acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are an important class of biological molecules that play a major role in modulating host-microbiome interactions. Despite significant research into SCFA-mediated biological mechanisms, absolute quantification of these molecules in their native form by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is challenging due to their relatively poor chromatographic properties. Herein, we introduce SQUAD, an isotope-based strategy for absolute quantification of SCFAs in complex biological samples. SQUAD uses aniline derivatization in conjunction with isotope dilution and analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We show that SQUAD enables absolute quantification of biologically relevant SCFAs in complex biological samples with a lower limit of detection of 40 nM and a lower limit of quantification ranging from 160 nM to 310 nM. We observed an intra- and inter-day precision under 3% (relative standard deviation) and errors in intra- and inter-day accuracy under 10%. To demonstrate this quantification strategy, we analyzed SCFAs in the caecal contents of germ free versus conventionally raised specific pathogen free (SPF) mice. We showed that acetate was the most abundant SCFA in both types of mice and was present at 200-fold higher concentration in the SPF mice. We also illustrated the use of our quantification strategy in in vitro microbial cultures from five different species of bacteria grown in Mueller Hinton media. This study illustrates the diverse SCFA production rates across microbial taxa with acetate production serving as one of the key differentiating factors across the species. In summary, we introduce an isotope dilution strategy for absolute quantification of aniline-dativized SCFAs and illustrate the utility of this approach for microbiome research."
https://openalex.org/W4224257854,"By 13,000 BP human populations were present across North America, but the exact date of arrival to the continent, especially areas south of the continental ice sheets, remains unclear. Here we examine patterns in the stratigraphic integrity of early North American sites to gain insight into the timing of first colonization. We begin by modeling stratigraphic mixing of multicomponent archaeological sites to identify signatures of stratigraphic integrity in vertical artifact distributions. From those simulations, we develop a statistic we call the Apparent Stratigraphic Integrity Index (ASI), which we apply to pre- and post-13,000 BP archaeological sites north and south of the continental ice sheets. We find that multiple early Beringian sites dating between 13,000 and 14,200 BP show excellent stratigraphic integrity. Clear signs of discrete and minimally disturbed archaeological components do not appear south of the ice sheets until the Clovis period. These results provide support for a relatively late date of human arrival to the Americas."
https://openalex.org/W4225986827,"Abstract Intragenic regions that are removed during maturation of the RNA transcript—introns—are universally present in the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes 1 . The budding yeast, an otherwise intron-poor species, preserves two sets of ribosomal protein genes that differ primarily in their introns 2,3 . Although studies have shed light on the role of ribosomal protein introns under stress and starvation 4–6 , understanding the contribution of introns to ribosome regulation remains challenging. Here, by combining isogrowth profiling 7 with single-cell protein measurements 8 , we show that introns can mediate inducible phenotypic heterogeneity that confers a clear fitness advantage. Osmotic stress leads to bimodal expression of the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps22B, which is mediated by an intron in the 5′ untranslated region of its transcript. The two resulting yeast subpopulations differ in their ability to cope with starvation. Low levels of Rps22B protein result in prolonged survival under sustained starvation, whereas high levels of Rps22B enable cells to grow faster after transient starvation. Furthermore, yeasts growing at high concentrations of sugar, similar to those in ripe grapes, exhibit bimodal expression of Rps22B when approaching the stationary phase. Differential intron-mediated regulation of ribosomal protein genes thus provides a way to diversify the population when starvation threatens in natural environments. Our findings reveal a role for introns in inducing phenotypic heterogeneity in changing environments, and suggest that duplicated ribosomal protein genes in yeast contribute to resolving the evolutionary conflict between precise expression control and environmental responsiveness 9 ."
https://openalex.org/W4224288147,"Injection drug use poses a public health challenge. Clinical experience indicates that people who inject drugs (PWID) are hospitalized frequently for infectious diseases, but little is known about outcomes when admitted. Charts were identified from local hospitals between 2013-2018 using consultation lists and hospital record searches. Included individuals injected drugs in the past six months and presented with infection. Charts were accessed using the hospital information system, undergoing primary and secondary reviews using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparisons between outcome categories. Categorical data were summarized as count and frequency, and compared using Fisher's exact test. Of 240 individuals, 33% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 36% underwent surgery, 12% left against medical advice (AMA), and 9% died. Infectious diagnoses included bacteremia (31%), abscess (29%), endocarditis (29%), cellulitis (20%), sepsis (10%), osteomyelitis (9%), septic arthritis (8%), pneumonia (7%), discitis (2%), meningitis/encephalitis (2%), or other (7%). Sixty-six percent had stable housing and 60% had a family physician. Fifty-four percent of patient-initiated discharges were seen in the emergency department within 30 days and 29% were readmitted. PWID are at risk for infections. Understanding their healthcare trajectory is essential to improve their care."
https://openalex.org/W4224224299,"Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated when performing contaminated surgeries, when specific surgical implants are placed, and for prolonged surgical procedures. Unnecessary prophylactic antibiotics are often utilized for macaque surgeries, despite medical and veterinary guidelines. In this study we compared complication rates in macaques receiving peripheral lymph node (PLN) and laparoscopic biopsies, with and without antimicrobial prophylaxis. A majority of animals were SIV or SHIV infected at the time of surgery, so we also compared post-operative complication rates based on infection status. We found no significant difference in PLN biopsy complication rates for animals that received antimicrobial prophylaxis versus those that did not. Animals who underwent laparoscopic procedures and received prophylactic antibiotics had a higher complication rate than those who did not receive them. Complication rates did not differ significantly for SIV/SHIV infected versus uninfected animals for both laparoscopic biopsy procedures and PLN biopsy procedures. SIV/SHIV infected animals that underwent PLN biopsies had no significant difference in complication rates with and without antimicrobial prophylaxis, and SIV/SHIV infected animals receiving prophylactic antibiotics for laparoscopic biopsies had a higher complication rate than those that did not. This study suggests that perioperative prophylactic antibiotics have no role in the management of SIV/SHIV-infected and uninfected macaques undergoing clean, minimally invasive surgeries. Additionally, we recommend eliminating unnecessary antibiotic use in study animals due to their potential confounding impacts on research models and their potential to promote antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4224256403,"The objective of this study was to compare the hydrological performance of an irrigated, 127 mm deep green roof, planted with vegetation native to the New York City area, to a conventional, non-irrigated, 100 mm deep green roof, planted with drought-tolerant Sedum spp. Four years of climate and runoff data from both green roofs were analyzed to determine seasonal stormwater retention. Empirical relationships between rainfall and runoff were developed for both roofs, and applied to historical rainfall data in order to compare stormwater retention values for different rainfall depths. Crop coefficients for the vegetation on each green roof were estimated using the soil moisture extraction function. This function was also used to estimate monthly evapotranspiration. Despite being irrigated, the green roof with native vegetation retained more stormwater per annum (64%) than the non-irrigated green roof planted with Sedum spp. (54%). The green roof planted with native vegetation also had approximately twice the crop coefficient (1.13) than the green roof planted with Sedum spp. (0.57), indicating that the New York City native plants transpire more stormwater than the Sedum spp. plants given certain climate and substrate moisture conditions. Overall, the results of the study indicate that, for the New York City climate region, irrigated green roofs of native vegetation have the capacity to better manage stormwater than non-irrigated green roofs planted with drought-tolerant succulents."

Identification of risk factors for poor gestational asthma control is crucial.Examine associations of body composition and gestational weight gain with asthma control in a prospective pregnancy cohort (n = 299).Exposures included pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), first trimester skinfolds, and trimester-specific gestational weight gain. Outcomes included percent predicted forced expiratory volumes (FEV1, FEV6), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), FEV1/FVC, symptoms (activity limitation, nighttime symptoms, inhaler use, and respiratory symptoms), and exacerbations (asthma attacks, medical encounters). Linear and Poisson models examined associations with lung function (β (95% confidence interval (CI)), asthma symptom burden (relative rate ratio (RR (95%CI)), and exacerbations (RR (95%CI)).Women with a BMI ≥ 30 had lower percent predicted FVC across pregnancy (βThirdTrimester: -5.20 (-8.61, -1.78)) and more frequent night symptoms in the first trimester (RR: 1.66 (1.08, 2.56)). Higher first trimester skinfolds were associated with lower FEV1, FEV6, and FVC, and more frequent night symptoms and inhaler use across pregnancy. Excessive first trimester gestational weight gain was associated with more frequent activity limitation in the first trimester (RR: 3.36 (1.15, 9.80)) and inhaler use across pregnancy (RRThirdTrimester: 3.49 (1.21, 10.02)).Higher adiposity and first trimester excessive gestational weight gain were associated with restrictive changes in lung function and symptomology during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4224238488,"Although hyaline cartilage is widely distributed in various invertebrate groups such as sabellid polychaetes, molluscs (cephalopods, gastropods) and a chelicerate arthropod group (horseshoe crabs), the enigmatic relationship and distribution of cartilage in taxonomic groups remains to be explained. It can be interpreted as a convergent trait in animal evolution and thus does not seem to be a vertebrate invention. Due to the poor fossil record of cartilaginous structures, occurrences of mineralized fossil cartilages are important for evolutionary biology and paleontology. Although the biochemical composition of recent cephalopod cartilage differs from vertebrate cartilage, histologically the cartilages of these animal groups resemble one another remarkably. In this study we present fossil material from the late Triassic Polzberg Konservat-Lagerstätte near Lunz am See (Lower Austria, Northern Calcareous Alps). A rich Carnian fauna is preserved here, whereby a morphogroup (often associated with belemnoid remains) of black, amorphous appearing fossils still remained undetermined. These multi-elemental, symmetrical fossils show remarkable similarities to recent cartilage. We examined the conspicuous micro- and ultrastructure of these enigmatic fossils by thin-sectioning and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The geochemical composition analyzed by Microprobe and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) revealed carbonization as the taphonomic pathway for this fossil group. Mineralization of soft tissues permits the 3D preservation of otherwise degraded soft tissues such as cartilage. We examined eighty-one specimens from the Polzberg locality and seven specimens from Cave del Predil (formerly Raibl, Julian Alps, Italy). The study included morphological examinations of these multi-elemental fossils and a focus on noticeable structures like grooves and ridges. The detected grooves are interpreted to be muscular attachment areas, and the preserved branched system of canaliculi is comparable to a channel system that is also present in recent coleoid cartilage. The new findings on these long-known enigmatic structures strongly point to the preservation of cephalic cartilage belonging to the belemnoid Phragmoteuthis bisinuata and its homologization to the cephalic cartilage of modern coleoids."
https://openalex.org/W4224245704,"Self-conscious emotions, such as guilt and shame, motivate the adherence to social norms, including to norms for prosociality. The relevance of an observing audience to the expression of negative self-conscious emotions remains poorly understood. Here, in two studies, we investigated the influence of being observed on 4- to 5-year-old children's (N = 161) emotional response after failing to help someone in need and after failing to complete their own goal. As an index of children's emotional response, we recorded the change in children's upper body posture using a motion depth sensor imaging camera. Failing to help others lowered children's upper body posture regardless of whether children were observed by an audience or not. Children's emotional response was similar when they failed to help and when they failed to complete their own goal. In Study 2, 5-year-olds showed a greater decrease in upper body posture than 4-year-olds. Our findings suggest that being observed is not a necessary condition for young children to express a negative self-conscious emotion after failing to help or after failing to complete their own goal. We conclude that 5-year-olds, more so that 4-year-olds, show negative emotions when they fail to adhere to social norms for prosociality."
https://openalex.org/W4224273563,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic increasingly threatens the public health security worldwide. We aimed to identify high-risk areas of COVID-19 and understand how socioeconomic factors are associated with the spatial distribution of COVID-19 in China, which may help other countries control the epidemic.We analyzed the data of COVID-19 cases from 30 provinces in mainland China (outside of Hubei) from 16 January 2020 to 31 March 2020, considering the data of demographic, economic, health, and transportation factors. Global autocorrelation analysis and Bayesian spatial models were used to present the spatial pattern of COVID-19 and explore the relationship between COVID-19 risk and various factors.Global Moran's I statistics of COVID-19 incidences was 0.31 (P<0.05). The areas with a high risk of COVID-19 were mainly located in the provinces around Hubei and the provinces with a high level of economic development. The relative risk of two socioeconomic factors, the per capita consumption expenditure of households and the proportion of the migrating population from Hubei, were 1.887 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.469~2.399] and 1.099 (95% CI: 1.053~1.148), respectively. The two factors explained up to 78.2% out of 99.7% of structured spatial variations.Our results suggested that COVID-19 risk was positively associated with the level of economic development and population movements. Blocking population movement and reducing local exposures are effective in preventing the local transmission of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4224303982,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral nutrient and one of the key factors determining crop productivity. P-deficient plants exhibit visual leaf symptoms, including chlorosis, and alter spectral reflectance properties. In this study, we evaluated leaf inorganic phosphate (Pi) contents, plant growth and reflectance spectra (420–790 nm) of 172 Thai rice landrace varieties grown hydroponically under three different P supplies (overly sufficient, mildly deficient and severely deficient conditions). We reported correlations between Pi contents and reflectance ratios computed from two wavebands in the range of near infrared (720–790 nm) and visible energy (green-yellow and red edge) ( r &gt; 0.69) in Pi-deficient leaves. Artificial neural network models were also developed which could classify P deficiency levels with 85.60% accuracy and predict Pi content with R 2 of 0.53, as well as highlight important waveband sections. Using 217 reflectance ratio indices to perform genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 113,114 SNPs, we identified 11 loci associated with the spectral reflectance traits, some of which were also associated with the leaf Pi content trait. Hyperspectral measurement offers a promising non-destructive approach to predict plant P status and screen large germplasm for varieties with high P use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4226076678,"Cannabis legalization in North America has coincided with an increase in reports of cannabis-induced toxicosis in pets, but the magnitude of this problem, as well as outcomes of these incidents remain unknown. Therefore, we examined the frequency, diagnostic criteria, clinical signs, and prognoses of cannabis toxicoses in pets in North America. We conducted an online survey between January, 2021 and April, 2021 targeting veterinarians practicing in Canada and the United States (US). Out of the 251 study participants, 191 practiced in Canada. Cannabis toxicosis was most commonly reported in dogs (n = 226 veterinarians), and the number of toxicosis cases increased significantly in Canada (p<0.0001) and the US (p = 0.002) after October, 2018. Frequently reported clinical signs of cannabis toxicosis included: urinary incontinence (n = 195), disorientation (n = 182), ataxia (n = 178), lethargy (n = 150), hyperesthesia (n = 134), and bradycardia (n = 112). Edibles were most commonly suspected to be the cause of toxicosis (n = 116). The most common route of exposure was ingestion (n = 135), while the most cited reason was ingestion while unattended (n = 135). Cannabis toxicosis was mostly diagnosed using supportive clinical signs (n = 229), the most common treatment was outpatient monitoring (n = 182), and pets were most often treated as out-patients (n = 103). The legalization of cannabis use in Canada and the US is likely an important factor associated with the increased cannabis toxicosis cases in pets; however, the legal status may also increase reporting. The medicinal use of cannabis by pet-owners for pets may also contribute to a portion of the reported toxicoses. Most pets that experienced cannabis toxicosis recovered completely, suggesting that most cannabis toxicoses do not result in long-term ill effects. Even though some deaths (n = 16) were reported in association with cannabis toxicosis, the presence of confounders such as toxins, and underlying conditions cannot be ruled out, emphasizing the need for rigorous controlled laboratory studies to investigate this important issue."
https://openalex.org/W4226095842,"Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the main malaria vector control measures deployed in Kenya. Widespread pyrethroid resistance among the primary vectors in Western Kenya has necessitated the re-introduction of IRS using an organophosphate insecticide, pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic® 300CS), as a pyrethroid resistance management strategy. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the combined use of non-pyrethroid IRS and LLINs has yielded varied results. We aimed to evaluate the effect of non-pyrethroid IRS and LLINs on malaria indicators in a high malaria transmission area.We reviewed records and tallied monthly aggregate of outpatient department (OPD) attendance, suspected malaria cases, those tested for malaria and those testing positive for malaria at two health facilities, one from Nyatike, an intervention sub-county, and one from Suba, a comparison sub-county, both located in Western Kenya, from February 1, 2016, through March 31, 2018. The first round of IRS was conducted in February-March 2017 in Nyatike sub-county and the second round one year later in both Nyatike and Suba sub-counties. The mass distribution of LLINs has been conducted in both locations. We performed descriptive analysis and estimated the effect of the interventions and temporal changes of malaria indicators using Poisson regression for a period before and after the first round of IRS.A higher reduction in the intervention area in total OPD, the proportion of OPD visits due to suspected malaria, testing positivity rate and annual malaria incidences were observed except for the total OPD visits among the under 5 children (59% decrease observed in the comparison area vs 33% decrease in the intervention area, net change -27%, P <0.001). The percentage decline in annual malaria incidence observed in the intervention area was more than twice the observed percentage decline in the comparison area across all the age groups. A marked decline in the monthly testing positivity rate (TPR) was noticed in the intervention area, while no major changes were observed in the comparison area. The monthly TPR reduced from 46% in February 2016 to 11% in February 2018, representing a 76% absolute decrease in TPR among all ages (RR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.12-0.46). In the comparison area, TPR was 16% in both February 2016 and February 2018 (RR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.52-2.09). A month-by-month comparison revealed lower TPR in Year 2 compared to Year 1 in the intervention area for most of the one year after the introduction of the IRS.Our findings demonstrated a reduced malaria burden among populations protected by both non-pyrethroid IRS and LLINs implying a possible additional benefit afforded by the combined intervention in the malaria-endemic zone."
https://openalex.org/W4224228523,"Introduction Gendered differences in career paths of medical graduates persist globally. We aim to explore the impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of physicians by studying gendered differences in domestic burdens of physicians as well as differences in perceptions around the impact of domestic work on professional advancement. Methods A web-based survey including 38 questions was sent to all 3866 physician alumni of the top academic medical school in Lebanon. Data was collected between November 2018 and January 2019, with up to three invite reminders. Overall, 382 were included in the final analysis, 124 women (32%), 258 men (68%). Results The study had a response rate of 10.4%. Findings show that a greater percentage of men were married and had children (77.5% vs 62.1%, p = 0.004, 77.9% vs 51.6%, &lt;0.001, respectively). Majority of both women and men held full-time positions (82.1% and 87.1%), having children however reduced the odds significantly [OR = 0.2, 95% CI: (0.1–0.6), p = 0.01]for women, while only older age reduced it for men (OR = 0.1,95% CI: (0.04–0.2), p&lt;0.001]. Among full-time physicians, men and women spent similar time on professional activities (60.2hrs/wk vs 58.3hrs/wk, p = 0.32). Women spent more time on parenting and household work (23.5hrs/wk vs 10.4hrs/wk, &lt;0.001; 8.9hrs/wk vs 6.0hrs/wk, p = 0.001, respectively). Women physicians’ spouses contributed to 14.5 hours/week of total time on domestic activities whereas men physicians’ spouses spent two folds more time on domestic activities (35.0 hours/week, P&lt;0.001). Of physicians with children, a higher percentage of women than men reported that children prevented their career advancement or their participation in development opportunities (43.8% vs 15.9%, p&lt;0.001; 50.0% vs 19.4%, p&lt;0.001, respectively). A greater percentage of women than men scaled back their career after first child (31.3% vs 3.5%, &lt;0.001). Of married/partnered physicians, fewer women than men reported their career took priority over their partner’s when conflicts arose, (52.0% vs 86.0%, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion These findings highlight the heavier impact of domestic tethers on the career paths of women physicians than men physicians. Men are more likely than women to hold full-time positions in the early advancement defining phases of their careers. Full-time women shoulder more domestic work than men and experience more professional advancement concessions. Closing persistent gender gaps in medicine requires addressing inequities in domestic burdens through strategies that include mentorship on domestic tethers, support of on-site child-care and advocacy for parental leave policies that encourage shared care-work."
https://openalex.org/W4224242564,"Controlling persons are the ultimate decision-makers of listed companies. Their illegalities have impacts on investors' wealth, firm development, and capital market's quality. Against this backdrop, we provide a quantitative analysis of the short-term stock price reaction to the criminal detention announcements of controlling persons throughout 2007-2019. We applied the Elman neural network (ENN) model into the classical event study methodology and demonstrated that the combination of them helps to improve the estimation accuracy of the stock price reaction. The results show that the stock price has a significant negative reaction to the criminal detention announcements of listed companies' controlling persons on the announcement day, and the average reaction level is -6.67%. Additionally, the crisis communication measures of the firms could diminish the negative impact of such mandatory disclosure information on their stock price, but the effect is limited. Finally, the 31 companies in our sample cause a total loss of RMB 21.1 billion in market capitalization on the announcement day alone. The above results indicate that the impact of listed companies' controlling persons on the capital market is tremendous, although the number of this group is small. Our work enriches the listed companies' illegalities research and provides a reference for investors' investment choices and follow-up decision making of regulatory authorities. It also provides some guidance for most of the researchers to further explore the application of data mining techniques in nonlinear problems."
https://openalex.org/W4224272607,"This study aims to describe trends and estimate impact of county-level universal health coverage expansion in Kenya on household availability of non-communicable disease medicines, medicine obtainment at public hospitals and proportion of medicines obtained free of charge.Data from phone surveillance of households in eight Kenyan counties between December 2016 and September 2019 were used. Three primary outcomes related to access were assessed based on patient report: availability of non-communicable disease medicines at the household; non-communicable disease medicine obtainment at a public hospital versus a different outlet; and non-communicable disease medicine obtainment free of cost versus at a non-zero price. Mixed models adjusting for fixed and random effects were used to estimate associations between outcomes of interest and UHC exposure.The 197 respondents with universal health coverage were similar on all demographic factors to the 415 respondents with no universal health coverage. Private chemists were the most popular place of purchase throughout the study. Adjusting for demographic factors, county and time fixed effects, there was a significant increase in free medicines (aOR 2.55, 95% CI 1.73, 3.76), significant decrease in medicine obtainment at public hospitals (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47, 0.97), and no impact on the availability of non-communicable disease medicines in households (aβ -0.004, 95% CI -0.058, 0.050) with universal health coverage.Access to universal health coverage caused a significant increase in free non-communicable disease medicines, indicating financial risk protection. Interestingly, this is not accompanied with increases in public hospitals purchases or household availability of non-communicable disease medicines, with public health centers playing a greater role in supply of free medicines. This raises the question as to the status of supply-side investments at the public hospitals, to facilitate availability of quality-assured medicines."
https://openalex.org/W4224280041,"Background The representation of variability in sensitivity to pain by differences in neural connectivity patterns and its association with psychological factors needs further investigation. This study assessed differences in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and its association to cognitive-affective aspects of pain in two groups of healthy subjects with low versus high sensitivity to pain (LSP vs. HSP). We hypothesized that HSP will show stronger connectivity in brain regions involved in the affective-motivational processing of pain and that this higher connectivity would be related to negative affective and cognitive evaluations of pain. Methods Forty-eight healthy subjects were allocated to two groups according to their tolerability to cold stimulation (cold pressor test, CPT, 1°C). Group LSP (N = 24) reached the cut-off time of 180±0 sec and group HSP tolerated the CPT for an average of 13±4.8 sec. Heat, cold and mechanical evoked pain were measured, as well as pain-catastrophizing (PCS), depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21). All subjects underwent resting state fMRI. ROI-to-ROI analysis was performed. Results In comparison to the LSP, the HSP had stronger interhemispheric connectivity of the amygdala (p = 0.01) and between the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc) (p = 0.01). Amygdala connectivity was associated with higher pain catastrophizing in the HSP only (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions These findings suggest that high sensitivity to pain may be reflected by neural circuits involved in affective and motivational aspects of pain. To what extent this connectivity within limbic brain structures relates to higher alertness and more profound withdrawal behavior to aversive events needs to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4224280379,"Alcohol use has been linked to impairment of cognitive and psychomotor driving skills, yet the extent to which skill impairment contributes to actual crashes is unknown. A reasonable assumption is that some driving situations have higher skill demands than others. We contend that intersections, the presence of other vehicles or moving objects, and work zones are examples of common situations with higher skill demands. Accordingly, if skill deficits are largely responsible for alcohol-involved crashes, crashes involving a drinking driver (versus only sober drivers) should be overrepresented in these driving situations.Publicly available FARS data from 2010 to 2017 were collected. Fatal crashes were coded as alcohol-involved (1+ driver with a blood alcohol concentration [BAC] ≥ .05 g/dl) or having no impaired driver (BACs = .000). Drug-positive crashes were excluded. Crashes were also coded as involving moving versus stationary objects, occurring at versus away from intersections, being multivehicle versus single vehicle, occurring at or away from work zones.Across multiple models, controlling for time of day and type of road, alcohol-involved crashes were significantly underrepresented in crashes at intersections, with moving objects, and other vehicles. Most strikingly, alcohol-involved crashes were 24 percentage points more likely to be with a stationary object than a moving object.No evidence supported the idea that skill reductions are a primary contributor to alcohol-involved crashes. Alternative explanations and limitations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4225342687,"Poor access to existing care for diabetic retinopathy (DR) limits effectiveness of proven treatments.We examined whether outreach screening in rural China improves equity of access.We compared prevalence of female sex, age > = 65 years, primary education or below, and requiring referral care for DR between three cohorts with diabetes examined for DR in neighboring areas of Guangdong, China: passive case detection at secondary-level hospitals (n = 193); persons screened during primary-level DR outreach (n = 182); and individuals with newly- or previously-diagnosed diabetes in a population survey (n = 579). The latter reflected the ""ideal"" reach of a screening program.Compared to the population cohort, passive case detection reached fewer women (50·8% vs. 62·3%, p = 0·006), older adults (37·8% vs. 51·3%, p < 0·001), and less-educated persons (39·9% vs. 89·6%, p < 0·001). Outreach screening, compared to passive case detection, improved representation of the elderly (49·5% vs. 37·8%, p = 0·03) and less-educated (70·3% vs. 39·9%, p<0·001). The proportion of women (59.8% vs 62.3%, P>0.300) and persons aged > = 65 years (49.5% vs 51.3%, p = 0.723) in the outreach screening and population cohorts did not differ significantly. Prevalence of requiring referral care for DR was significantly higher in the outreach screening cohort (28·0%) than the population (14·0%) and passive case detection cohorts (7·3%, p<0·001 for both).Primary-level outreach screening improves access for the poorly-educated and elderly, and removes gender inequity in access to DR care in this setting, while also identifying more severely-affected patients than case finding in hospital."
https://openalex.org/W4225467574,"The relationships between Momentary Psychotic-Like Experiences (MPLEs) and HEXACO-complemented by the proneness to PLEs conceptualized as a basic personality trait (Disintegration), and a maladaptive trait (PID-5 Psychoticism)-were investigated in a prospective study that includes experience-sampling methodology (ESM). The main goal was to investigate whether MPLEs are better predicted by HEXACO or measures of the dispositional proneness to PLEs. A sample of 180 participants assessed MPLEs and affective states they experienced in the previous two hours, twice per day, with semi-randomly set assessment time-points, during seven days, by using ESM. Personality inventories were administered 1-2 months earlier. MPLEs were better predicted by the measures of dispositional tendencies toward PLEs than by the HEXACO, no matter whether it was broadly defined as the nine-faceted general tendency toward PLEs (Disintegration), or narrowly as three-faceted positive psychotic-like symptoms of maladaptive personality tendencies (PID-5-Psychoticism)."

Objective Our study aims to figure out the clinical differences and distribution of intestinal microbiota in immunocompromised children with NoV gastroenteritis.Pediatric patients admitted to Shang-Ho Hospital with diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis including different immune status were enrolled and their medical records were reviewed. NoV gastroenteritis was validated using RT-PCR molecular methods. Viral shedding period was determined by real-time RT-PCR assays. Intestinal microbiota enrichment analysis was carried out by next generation sequencing after fecal DNA extraction and subsequent Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) method.Significantly higher frequency of diarrhea [mean, (IQR), 3.8 (3-5) /day] and longer viral shedding time [mean, IQR, 8.5 (5-13) days] was found in immunocompromised NoV infections than in immunocompetent patients without NoV infections (p = 0.013*) and immunocompetent patients with NoV infections (p = 0.030**). The fever prevalence was significantly lower in immunocompromised NoV infections than in different immune or infection status. Intestinal microbiota metagenomics analysis showed no significant community richness difference while the LEfSe analysis showed a significant difference in commensal richness at the phylum level, the family level, and the genus level in patients under different immune status.We evaluated the clinical significances and microbiota composition in immunocompromised children with norovirus gastroenteritis. This will further facilitate studies of the interaction between the intestinal microbiota in such patients with precise determination of their bacterial infection control and probiotic supplements strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4226042743,"With the spread of online behavioral experiments, estimating the effects of experimental situations and sample heterogeneity is increasing in discussions of the generalizability of data. In this study, we examined how the experimental situations (laboratory/online) affected group cooperation and individual performances. The participants were Japanese university students, randomly assigned to laboratory or online experiments. For the group cooperation task, they were asked to perform the public goods game with or without punishment, but no effect of the experimental situation was found both for cooperative and punitive behaviors. For the individual tasks, participants were asked to perform tasks including a creative task and a dull task. We manipulated the presence or absence of an external incentive. As a result, there was no significant difference between the experimental situations with one exception: only in the laboratory situation was the performance of the difficult creative task lower in the presence of an external incentive. Furthermore, we conducted as an additional experiment using the same treatments for a Japanese online-worker sample. This sample was less cooperative in the public goods game than the student sample, both with and without punishment. In addition, the presence of external incentives facilitated performance of the online-worker sample only for the dull task. We discuss the similarities and differences with previous studies that examined the effects of experimental situations and sample heterogeneity, and the implications for remote work in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W4226061812,"Acinetobacter nosocomialis is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, whose ability to cause disease in humans is well recognized. Blue light has been shown to modulate important physiological traits related to persistence and virulence in this microorganism. In this work, we characterized the three Blue Light sensing Using FAD (BLUF) domain-containing proteins encoded in the A. nosocomialis genome, which account for the only canonical light sensors present in this microorganism. By focusing on a light-modulated bacterial process such as motility, the temperature dependence of light regulation was studied, as well as the expression pattern and spectroscopic characteristics of the different A. nosocomialis BLUFs. Our results show that the BLUF-containing proteins AnBLUF65 and AnBLUF46 encode active photoreceptors in the light-regulatory temperature range when expressed recombinantly. In fact, AnBLUF65 is an active photoreceptor in the temperature range from 15°C to 37°C, while AnBLUF46 between 15°C to 32°C, in vitro. In vivo, only the Acinetobacter baumannii BlsA's ortholog AnBLUF65 was expressed in A. nosocomialis cells recovered from motility plates. Moreover, complementation assays showed that AnBLUF65 is able to mediate light regulation of motility in A. baumannii ΔblsA strain at 30°C, confirming its role as photoreceptor and in modulation of motility by light. Intra-protein interactions analyzed using 3D models built based on A. baumannii´s BlsA photoreceptor, show that hydrophobic/aromatic intra-protein interactions may contribute to the stability of dark/light- adapted states of the studied proteins, reinforcing the previous notion on the importance of these interactions in BLUF photoreceptors. Overall, the results presented here reveal the presence of BLUF photoreceptors in A. nosocomialis with idiosyncratic characteristics respect to the previously characterized A. baumannii's BlsA, both regarding the photoactivity temperature-dependency as well as expression patterns, contributing thus to broaden our knowledge on the BLUF family."
https://openalex.org/W4224235180,"This study aimed to examine the satisfaction level differences between urban and rural areas with regard to their walking environment during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. This online cross-sectional research was conducted using a mobile health application. Overall, 1,032 local residents who participated in the mobile healthcare program of a public health center were classified as being from either urban (n = 481, 46.6%) or rural areas (n = 551, 53.4%) for the purpose of this study. The Walkability Checklist, which includes sociodemographic information, was employed using a Chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression to investigate whether or not the participants were satisfied with the environmental factors associated with walking. It was found that both urban and rural areas were more likely to be unsatisfied with walking comfort (adjusted OR: 24.472, 95% CI: 14.937-40.096). Regarding the walking comfort aspects of the walking environment, urban residents chose poor landscape (""needed more grass, flowers, or trees""; aOR: 13.561, 95% CI: 3.619-50.823) as their primary dissatisfaction, and rural residents chose messy streets (""dirty, lots of litter or trash""; aOR: 29.045, 95% CI: 6.202-136.015). Compared with urban residents, rural residents were more discontented with the walking environment. Thus, to promote walking activities at the community level, it is necessary to focus on walking comfort, and implement efforts related to environmental beautification."
https://openalex.org/W4224246363,"Sports facilities have been acknowledged as one of the crucial environmental factors for children’s physical education, physical fitness, and participation in physical activity. Finding a solution for the effective and objective evaluation of the condition of sports facilities in schools (SSFs) with the responding quantitative magnitude is an uncertain task. This paper describes the utilization of an unsupervised machine learning method to objectively evaluate the condition of sports facilities in primary school (PSSFC). The statistical data of 845 samples with nine PSSFC indicators (indoor and outdoor included) were collected from the Sixth National Sports Facility Census in mainland China (NSFC), an official nationwide quinquennial census. The Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm was applied to cluster the samples in accordance with the similarity of PSSFC. The clustered data were visualized by using t -stochastic neighbor embedding ( t -SNE). The statistics results showed that the application of t -SNE and FCM led to the acceptable performance of clustering SSFs data into three types with differences in PSSFC. The effects of school category, location factors, and the interaction on PSSFC were analyzed by two-way analysis of covariance, which indicated that regional PSSFC has geographical and typological characteristics: schools in the suburbs are superior to those in the inner city, schools with more grades of students are configured with better variety and larger size of sports facilities. In conclusion, we have developed a combinatorial machine learning clustering approach that is suitable for objective evaluation on PSSFC and indicates its characteristics."

Standard lymphedema evaluation methodologies are not able to measure tissue fibrosis. The ultrasound aspects related to tissue microstructures of lymphedema are neglected in clinical evaluations. The objective of this study was to identify and measure the degree of impairment, topography, and biophysical alterations of subcutaneous lymphedema tissue secondary to the treatment of breast cancer by ultrasonography. Forty-two women at a mean age of 58 (±9.7) years, with unilateral lymphedema due to breast cancer treatment, were evaluated. The upper limbs were divided into affected (affected by lymphedema) and control (contralateral limb). Each limb was subdivided into seven areas, defined by perimetry, evaluated in pairs. The biophysical characteristics thickness, entropy, and echogenicity were evaluated by ultrasonography. The results showed a significant difference in the echogenicity and thickness variables between the affected and unaffected upper limb, in all the extent of the upper limb, while entropy showed no significant difference. The findings indicate that the data presented were consistent both in identifying and measuring the degree of impairment and biophysical changes in the subcutaneous tissue of lymphedema secondary to the treatment of breast cancer."

In the present preliminary study, we examined the efficacy of a new, inhalable soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (sEHI), 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), to attenuate airway inflammation, mucin secretion, and hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in an ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized murine model. Male BALB/c mice were divided into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), OVA, and OVA+TPPU (2- or 6-h) exposure groups. On days 0 and 14, the mice were administered PBS or sensitized to OVA in PBS. From days 26-38, seven challenge exposures were performed with 30 min inhalation of filtered air or OVA alone. In the OVA+TPPU groups, a 2- or 6-h TPPU inhalation preceded each 30-min OVA exposure. On day 39, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed, and biological samples were collected. Lung tissues were used to semi-quantitatively evaluate the severity of inflammation and airway constriction and the volume of stored intracellular mucosubstances. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples were used to analyze regulatory lipid mediator profiles. Significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated alveolar, bronchiolar, and pleural inflammation; airway resistance and constriction; mucosubstance volume; and inflammatory lipid mediator levels were observed with OVA+TPPU relative to OVA alone. Cumulative findings indicated TPPU inhalation effectively inhibited inflammation, suppressed AHR, and prevented mucosubstance accumulation in the murine asthmatic model. Future studies should determine the pharmacokinetics (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (i.e., concentration/dose responses) of inhaled TPPU to explore its potential as an asthma-preventative or -rescue treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4224266826,"Objective Using stratified analyses, we examined the cost-effectiveness of the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP), from a health care system perspective, among older women and men who have previously fallen. Methods This study was a secondary stratified analysis (by women and men), of a 12-month prospective economic evaluation of a randomized clinical trial (OEP compared with usual care). Three hundred and forty four community-dwelling older adults (≥70; 172 OEP (110 women; 62 men), 172 usual care (119 women; 53 men)) who sustained a fall in the past 12 months and received a baseline assessment at the Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic, Canada were included. A gender by OEP/usual care interaction was examined for the falls incidence rate ratio (IRR). Outcome measures stratified by gender included: falls IRR, incremental cost-per fall prevented (ICER), incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY, ICUR) gained, and mean total health care resource utilization costs. Results Men were frailer than women at baseline. Men incurred higher mean total healthcare costs $6794 (SD: $11906)). There was no significant gender by OEP/usual care interaction on falls IRR. The efficacy of the OEP did not vary by gender. The adjusted IRR for the OEP group demonstrated a 39% (IRR: 0.61, CI: 0.40–0.93) significant reduction in falls among men but not women (32% reduction (IRR: 0.69, CI: 0.47–1.02)). The ICER showed the OEP was effective in preventing falls and less costly for men, while it was costlier for women by $42. The ICUR showed the OEP did not impact quality of life. Conclusion Future studies should explore gender factors (i.e., health seeking behaviours, gender related frailty) that may explain observed variation in the cost-effectiveness of the OEP as a secondary falls prevention strategy.

https://openalex.org/W4224284664,"An association between genetic variants in the genes HFE, HJV, BMP4 and arterial hypertension has been shown earlier. Proteins encoded by these genes participate in the signalling routes leading eventually to the production of the peptide hormone hepcidin. Mutations in these genes have been associated with the abnormal production of hepcidin in the body. This finding led to studies exploring the possible role of hepcidin in regulating the activity of blood pressure related renin-angiotensin system enzymes. We used molecular modelling to find out if it is possible for hepcidin to bind to the active site of the renin-angiotensin system enzymes, especially renin. Fluorometric assays were used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of hepcidin on renin as well as angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Finally, bio-layer interferometry technique was used to study hepcidin binding to renin. The molecular modelling showed that hepcidin seems to have similar binding properties to the renin active site as angiotensinogen does. Based on fluorometric enzyme activity assay, hepcidin has an inhibitory effect on renin in vitro, too. However, angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2 were not inhibited remarkably by hepcidin-25. In bio-layer interferometry analysis hepcidin-renin binding was concentration dependent. Our results suggest that hepcidin could act as an inhibitor to the renin. Nowadays, there is no known biological inhibitor for renin in vivo and our finding may thus have important clinical implications."

We show that 1587 species have 10 languages or more spoken within their distributions. Threatened and migratory species have significantly more languages spoken within their distributions, when controlling for range size. Particularly high numbers of species with many languages within their distribution are found in Eastern Europe, Russia and central and western Asia.

https://openalex.org/W4225997370,"The future of land use and cover change in Brazil, particularly due to deforestation and forest restoration processes, is critical for the future of global climate and biodiversity, given the richness of its five biomes. These changes in Brazil depend on the interlink between global factors due to its role as one of the main exporters of commodities globally and the national to local institutional, socioeconomic, and biophysical contexts. Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global (e.g., GDP growth, population growth, per capita consumption of agricultural products, international trade policies, and climatic conditions) and local factors (e.g., land use, agrarian structure, agricultural suitability, protected areas, distance to roads, and other infrastructure projects), a new set of land-use change scenarios for Brazil were developed that aligned with the global structure Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9 (Sustainable development scenario), SSP2/RCP 4.5 (Middle of the road scenario), and SSP3/RCP 7.0 (Strong inequality scenario). The scenarios were developed by combining the LuccME spatially explicit land change allocation modeling framework and the INLAND surface model to incorporate the climatic variables in water deficit. Based on detailed biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, a mosaic of small land uses, and forestry. The results aim to detail global models regionally. They could be used regionally to support decision-making and enrich the global analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4224215023,"Determination of pathogen-specific bacterial DNA load (BDL) in blood has been shown to be directly correlated with severity of infection in patients with bacteremia. In the diagnostic work-up of patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), determination of the primary focus is imperative, because of implications for treatment duration, and ultimately prognosis. Here we investigate whether measurement of BDL in patients with SAB can distinguish between intravascular and extravascular foci of infection.In a consecutive cohort of 43 patients with positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus, we performed a quantitative PCR on whole blood to detect the bacterial DNA load. Infections were classified into 3 categories: i) soft tissue infections and phlebitis, ii) deep-seated infections and iii) endocarditis and other intravascular infections. Bacterial DNA loads and inflammatory parameters in the three categories were analyzed and compared.Median BDL in patients with endocarditis and other intravascular infections was 1015 cfu/ml, significantly higher than BDL in the other two categories (28 and 31 cfu/ml respectively). In contrast, CRP and leukocytes were not significantly different between the three patient categories. BDL could be detected in all patients with intravascular causes and levels were generally 10-30 times higher than in the other infection categories. Median BDL in non-survivors was 85 cfu/ml, which was higher than in survivors with a median BDL of 29 cfu/ml, although not significant.In Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia pathogen-specific BDL is distinctly higher in patients with intravascular infections compared to extravascular origins. As measurement of BDL by PCR can easily be implemented in routine diagnostics, it can improve the diagnostic work-up of SAB by rapidly identifying the subset of patients who need higher dosages of antibiotics and additional measures to improve outcome."

Nevertheless, the emergency of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) has posed challenges in achieving optimal ART treatment outcomes and is alarmingly increasing globally in general and in Africa in particular. Comprehensive epidemiological data on the magnitude of HIVDR and HIVDR mutations, and predictors of HIVDR are, however, limited in Africa.The main objective of this systematic review will be to estimate the pooled proportion of HIVDR and HIVDR mutations, and identify factors associated with HIVDR among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in Africa.Published Literature from 2000 until 30 October 2021 will be searched in PubMed/Medline Ovid, HINARI, SCOPUS, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Sciences, and Cochrane electronic databases. Initially, the literature will be screened based on title/abstract and followed by full-text appraisal for methodological quality using JBI critical appraisal tools. Data will be extracted from eligible articles after the full-text appraisal. Heterogeneity will be qualitatively assessed by a visual Funnel plot and quantitatively measured by an index of heterogeneity (I2 statistics). Random-effects model will be fitted to estimate the proportion of HIVDR and each HIVDR mutations. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to reduce heterogeneity. Meta-regression will be done by median year of sampling per study to observe the pattern of changes over time. Publication bias will be assessed by egger's statistics. In case of publication bias, Trim and Fill analysis will be conducted to overcome small-study effect. Data analysis will be performed using Stata version 14.As the data sources are published papers, the protocol will not require an ethical approval letter. The final report of the review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal."

Predictors included demographic characteristics, cognition, diabetes distress, depression, and educational attainment.In multivariable analysis, greater educational attainment (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76, 0.99) and poorer cognition (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63, 0.79) were associated with poorer functional health literacy. Age was negatively associated with domains of appraisal of health information and ability to find good health information (both beta = -0.01). Educational attainment was positively associated with four domains, namely having sufficient information to manage my health, actively managing my health, appraisal of and ability to find good health information (beta ranging from +0.03 to 0.04). Diabetes distress was negatively associated with five domains: having sufficient information to manage my health, social support for health, ability to actively engage with healthcare providers, navigating the healthcare system and ability to find good health information (beta ranging from -0.14 to -0.18).Poorer cognition and poorer educational attainment may be detrimental for an individual's functional health literacy, and education, diabetes distress and older age detrimental across multiple health literacy domains. Clinicians and policy makers should be attuned to these factors when communicating with people with diabetes and in designing healthcare systems to be more health-literacy friendly in order to improve diabetes outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4224307140,"Physical parameters of the pathogenic cells, like its volume, shape, and stiffness, are important biomarkers for diseases, chemical changes within the cell, and overall cell health. The response of pathogenic bacteria and viruses to different chemical disinfectants is studied widely. Some of the routinely employed techniques to measure these changes require elaborate and expensive equipment which limits any study to a non-mobile research lab facility. Recently, we showed a micropore-based electro-fluidic technique to have great promise in measuring subtle changes in cell volumes at high throughput and resolution. This method, however, requires commercial amplifiers, which makes this technique expensive and incompatible for in-field use. In this paper, we develop a home-built amplifier to make this technique in-field compatible and apply it to measure changes in bacterial volumes upon exposure to alcohol. First, we introduce our low-cost and portable transimpedance amplifier and characterize the maximum range, absolute error percentage, and RMS noise of the amplifier in the measured current signal, along with the amplifier's bandwidth, and compared these characteristics with the commercial amplifiers. Using our home-built amplifier, we demonstrate a high throughput detection of ~1300 cells/second and resolve cell diameter changes down to 1 μm. Finally, we demonstrate measurement of cell volume changes in E. coli bacteria when exposed to ethanol (5% v/v), which is otherwise difficult to measure via imaging techniques. Our low-cost amplifier (~100-fold lower than commercial alternatives) is battery-run, completely portable for point-of-care applications, and the electro-fluidic devices are currently being tested for in-field applications."
