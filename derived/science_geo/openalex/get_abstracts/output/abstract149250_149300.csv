We compare and contrast the steady state and kinetic properties of these β subunits with the previously cloned mouse β1 (mKCNMB1) and the human β2 subunit (hKCNMB2). Once inactivation is removed, we find that hKCNMB2 has properties similar to mKCNMB1. hKCNMB2 slowsHslo1 channel gating and shifts the current-voltage relationship to more negative potentials. hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4 have distinct effects on slo currents not observed with mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2. Although we found that hKCNMB3 does interact with Hslo channels, its effects on Hslo1 channel properties were slight, increasing Hslo1 activation rates. In contrast, hKCNMB4 slows Hslo1 gating kinetics, and modulates the apparent calcium sensitivity of Hslo1. We found that the different effects of the β subunits on some Hslo1 channel properties are calcium-dependent. mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2 slow activation at 1 μm but not at 10 μm free calcium concentrations. hKCNMB4 decreases Hslo1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. These results suggest that β subunits in diverse tissue types fine-tune slo channel properties to the needs of a particular cell.

In smooth muscle, BK channels regulate constriction in arteries (11.Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J.

Unlike other potassium channel families, BK channels can as yet only be attributed to a single gene, slowpoke (slo), that encodes the pore-forming α subunit of the channel. In light of the broad tissue localization and diverse functional properties, it is not surprising that a number of mechanisms have been identified that alterslo channel properties. These include alternative splicing of the slo RNA (14.Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z. Kavanaugh M.P. Warren R.A. Wu Y.N. Lagrutta A. Bond C.T. North R.A.

Coexpression of the β1 subunit inXenopus oocytes increases the apparent calcium sensitivity, slows activation kinetics, and increases charybdotoxin binding affinity (24.Dworetzky S.I. Boissard C.G.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). β1 subunit mRNA is enriched in smooth muscle (28.Jiang Z. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Genomics. 1999; 55: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and can account for the apparent increased calcium sensitivity of BK channels in that tissue relative to skeletal muscle (29.Nimigean C.M. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30.McManus O.B. Magleby K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 443: 739-777Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) where the β1 gene shows little expression. In the chick cochlea, a spatial gradient of β subunit expression may contribute to the slochannel diversity that underlies electrical tuning (31.Ramanathan K. Michael T.H. Jiang G.J. Hiel H. Fuchs P.A. Science. 1999; 283: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Evidence indicates that additional β subunits may associate withslo channels in different tissues. In brain tissue, biochemical purification of slo channels indicates that a novel 25-kDa subunit is tightly associated with slo α subunits (32.Wanner S.G. Koch R.O. Koschak A. Trieb M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Knaus H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5392-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, a second β subunit homologue, β2, has been cloned that causes inactivation of slo channels in adrenal chromaffin cells (33.Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the higher molecular weight of this β2 subunit indicates it is distinct from the brain β subunit.In an effort to understand the function of β subunits, we have cloned two novel β subunit family members, which we call Hβ3 (KCNMB3) and Hβ4 (KCNMB4). We demonstrate that these subunits interact with and modulate slo channels. In addition, we compare and contrast the four members of the β subunit family (β1 through β4) for their effects on slo channel properties. We find that Mβ1 and Hβ2 have very similar effects on slo currents differing mainly in the ability of Hβ2 to cause inactivation. In contrast, Hβ3 and Hβ4 have distinct and novel effects onslo currents. Our results indicate that the β subunit gene family contributes a high degree of diversity to the functional properties of slo channels.DISCUSSIONThe BK β1 subunit was first identified by copurification withslo α subunits in tracheal smooth muscle (3.Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17274-17278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent characterization of β1/Hslo1 interaction showed that the β1 subunit affects Hslo1 channel pharmacology, gating kinetics, and calcium sensitivity (27.McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, the restricted distribution of β1 subunits to smooth muscle posed the question of whether other β subunits are involved in modulating slofunction in other tissues. The recent cloning of β2 (33.Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and our results extend the BK β gene family to a minimum of four genes. The tissue distribution of the different β family members suggests that β subunits have a broad role in modulating slo channel. In addition, the overlapping tissue distribution creates the possibility that different β subunits coassemble with the same slochannel, further increasing diversity of BK channels.β1 and Hβ2 subunits share the most sequence similarity among the β subunits. With the exception of inactivation, we found these subunits appear to function similarly. Both subunits increase the apparent calcium sensitivity and slow channel gating to similar extents. Hβ3 and Hβ4 are more distantly related on the sequence level and functionally dissimilar as well. Hβ3 speeds activation kinetics, whereas Hβ4 slows gating kinetics and has a complex effect on the apparent calcium sensitivity.The mechanism of β subunit modulation of slo channels has not been extensively studied. Single channel analysis of slocoexpressed with bovine β1 subunits shows that β subunits increase open probability by stabilizing the channel in a bursting state, perhaps by increasing an energetic barrier for leaving the open state (29.Nimigean C.M. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two functional consequences are predicted from these results. The first is that slo/β1 channels have an increased open probability at equivalent voltages compared with slochannels alone. The increased open probability is seen as an apparent increased calcium sensitivity or perhaps more accurately described as a negative shift in the V 12 (since it is not clear whether β1 subunits affect calcium affinity directly). The second is that channels should deactivate more slowly. For Mβ1 and Hβ2′, and Hβ4 at high calcium concentrations, this appears to be the case. However, for Hβ4 at low calcium concentrations, the negative shift in the V 12 and slowed gating kinetics were not correlated, that is at low calcium Hβ4 slowed deactivation kinetics while shifting the V 12 to more positive potentials. Assuming that the mechanism by which the different β subunits affectHslo1 activation, deactivation, or conductance-voltage relationship are conserved, then one explanation would be that β subunits have some effects on Hslo1 channel gating kinetics that are not coupled to the effects observed for steady state conductance-voltage relationships. The difference in the properties of the different β subunits should provide useful tools in molecularly characterizing the structures of the β subunits that confer modulation of slo channels.An interesting observation was that β subunit modulation ofHslo1 channels was, in many aspects, not a uniform shifting of gating time or half-activation voltage but was tuned to calcium concentrations. For example, the effect of Hβ4 on theV 12 was a shift either to positive or negative membrane potentials, depending on the calcium concentrations (Fig.5 E). In addition, Mβ1, Hβ2, and Hβ4 slow activation kinetics at low but not at high calcium concentrations (Fig. 6,A and B). The tuning of α subunit function could be important in different cell types or subcellular locales where the resident β subunit could appropriately modulate BK channel properties to the cellular environment. In nerve terminals, where BK channels are associated with calcium channels (10.Robitaille R. Charlton M.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Robitaille R. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Charlton M.P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 645-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) the calcium microenvironment can vary from 10 to 100 μm during calcium influx through calcium channels (49.Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hβ4 would be expected to steepen the response of BK channels to calcium changes, suppressing BK channels at low calcium, but enhancing BK channel openings as calcium levels reach threshold concentrations.BK channels have been characterized in tissues by differences observed in unitary conductance, gating kinetics, apparent calcium sensitivity, and pharmacology (50.Latorre R. Peracchia C. Handbook of Membrane Channels: Molecular and Cellular Physiology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 79-102Crossref Google Scholar). Much of the differences in electrophysiological properties can be accounted for by the extensive alternative splicing that the slowpoke genes undergo (14.Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z. Kavanaugh M.P.

Sci. 1998; 265: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the effects caused by phosphorylation of the channel (20.Toro L. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21.Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Sansom S.C. Stockand J.D. Hall D. Williams B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9902-9906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that a great deal of BK channel diversity is also produced by association with a large family of β subunits. Recent reports indicate that the extent of β subunit modulation of slochannels is dependent on the alternatively spliced slovariants interacting with the β subunit (31.Ramanathan K. Michael T.H. Jiang G.J. Hiel H. Fuchs P.A. Science. 1999; 283: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), further increasing the diversity possible. Future work should elucidate the effects of the β subunits on the physiology and pharmacology of the slochannels and allow us to ascribe function of the cloned β subunits to the diverse BK channels observed in situ. The large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BK)1 is a unique member of the six transmembrane domain potassium channel family that is activated by voltage and calcium. BK channels are composed of a pore-forming α subunit (1.Knaus H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

DISCUSSIONThe BK β1 subunit was first identified by copurification withslo α subunits in tracheal smooth muscle (3.Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17274-17278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent characterization of β1/Hslo1 interaction showed that the β1 subunit affects Hslo1 channel pharmacology, gating kinetics, and calcium sensitivity (27.McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). However, the restricted distribution of β1 subunits to smooth muscle posed the question of whether other β subunits are involved in modulating slofunction in other tissues. The recent cloning of β2 (33.Xia X.M. Ding J.P. Lingle C.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4137-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and our results extend the BK β gene family to a minimum of four genes. The tissue distribution of the different β family members suggests that β subunits have a broad role in modulating slo channel. In addition, the overlapping tissue distribution creates the possibility that different β subunits coassemble with the same slochannel, further increasing diversity of BK channels.β1 and Hβ2 subunits share the most sequence similarity among the β subunits. With the exception of inactivation, we found these subunits appear to function similarly. Both subunits increase the apparent calcium sensitivity and slow channel gating to similar extents. Hβ3 and Hβ4 are more distantly related on the sequence level and functionally dissimilar as well. Hβ3 speeds activation kinetics, whereas Hβ4 slows gating kinetics and has a complex effect on the apparent calcium sensitivity.The mechanism of β subunit modulation of slo channels has not been extensively studied. Single channel analysis of slocoexpressed with bovine β1 subunits shows that β subunits increase open probability by stabilizing the channel in a bursting state, perhaps by increasing an energetic barrier for leaving the open state (29.Nimigean C.M. Magleby K.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two functional consequences are predicted from these results. The first is that slo/β1 channels have an increased open probability at equivalent voltages compared with slochannels alone. The increased open probability is seen as an apparent increased calcium sensitivity or perhaps more accurately described as a negative shift in the V 12 (since it is not clear whether β1 subunits affect calcium affinity directly). The second is that channels should deactivate more slowly. For Mβ1 and Hβ2′, and Hβ4 at high calcium concentrations, this appears to be the case. However, for Hβ4 at low calcium concentrations, the negative shift in the V 12 and slowed gating kinetics were not correlated, that is at low calcium Hβ4 slowed deactivation kinetics while shifting the V 12 to more positive potentials. Assuming that the mechanism by which the different β subunits affectHslo1 activation, deactivation, or conductance-voltage relationship are conserved, then one explanation would be that β subunits have some effects on Hslo1 channel gating kinetics that are not coupled to the effects observed for steady state conductance-voltage relationships. The difference in the properties of the different β subunits should provide useful tools in molecularly characterizing the structures of the β subunits that confer modulation of slo channels.An interesting observation was that β subunit modulation ofHslo1 channels was, in many aspects, not a uniform shifting of gating time or half-activation voltage but was tuned to calcium concentrations. For example, the effect of Hβ4 on theV 12 was a shift either to positive or negative membrane potentials, depending on the calcium concentrations (Fig.5 E). In addition, Mβ1, Hβ2, and Hβ4 slow activation kinetics at low but not at high calcium concentrations (Fig. 6,A and B). The tuning of α subunit function could be important in different cell types or subcellular locales where the resident β subunit could appropriately modulate BK channel properties to the cellular environment. In nerve terminals, where BK channels are associated with calcium channels (10.Robitaille R. Charlton M.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 297-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Robitaille R. Garcia M.L.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hβ4 would be expected to steepen the response of BK channels to calcium changes, suppressing BK channels at low calcium, but enhancing BK channel openings as calcium levels reach threshold concentrations.BK channels have been characterized in tissues by differences observed in unitary conductance, gating kinetics, apparent calcium sensitivity, and pharmacology (50.Latorre R. Peracchia C. Handbook of Membrane Channels: Molecular and Cellular Physiology. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 79-102Crossref Google Scholar).

Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) E, a protease that cleaves SNAP25 at Arg180-Ile181, completely inhibits this late step in PC12 cell membranes, whereas BoNT A, which cleaves SNAP25 at Gln197-Arg198, is only partially inhibitory. The difference in toxin effectiveness was found to result from a reversal of BoNT A but not BoNT E inhibition by elevated Ca2+ concentrations. BoNT A treatment essentially increased the Ca2+ concentration required to activate exocytosis, which suggested a role for the C terminus of SNAP25 in the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis. Synaptotagmin, a proposed Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis, was found to bind SNAP25 in a Ca2+-stimulated manner. Ca2+-dependent binding was abolished by BoNT E treatment, whereas BoNT A treatment increased the Ca2+concentration required for binding. The C terminus of SNAP25 was also essential for Ca2+-dependent synaptotagmin binding to SNAP25·syntaxin and SNAP25·syntaxin·VAMP SNARE complexes. These results clarify classical observations on the Ca2+ reversal of BoNT A inhibition of neurosecretion, and they suggest that an essential role for the C terminus of SNAP25 in regulated exocytosis is to mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions between synaptotagmin and SNARE protein complexes.

The precise role of synaptotagmin and its Ca2+-dependent interactions with phospholipids or syntaxin in regulated neurosecretion remains to be determined. Studies of regulated exocytosis in membrane preparations from neuroendocrine cells demonstrated that SNAREs are required for a late Ca2+-dependent step that occurs after vesicle docking and ATP-dependent priming and immediately before fusion (28.Banerjee A.

Tetanus toxin and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) B, C1, and E completely inhibited the Ca2+-dependent triggering of exocytosis, which implied that VAMP, syntaxin, and SNAP25 participate in steps close to or at fusion.

In the present study, this domain of SNAP25 is revealed to be essential for Ca2+-dependent interactions with synaptotagmin. This finding clarifies classical observations that BoNT A inhibition of neurosecretion is partially reversed by elevating neuronal Ca2+ levels (32.Lundh H. Leander S. Thesleff S. J. Neurol. Sci. 1977; 32: 29-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results suggest that an important role for the C terminus of SNAP25 in regulated exocytosis is to mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions between synaptotagmin and SNARE protein complexes. PC12 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified culture medium supplemented with 5% horse serum and 5% iron-supplemented calf serum were incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]norepinephrine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) plus 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate for 16 h at 37 oC.

Secretion assays were conducted in 5-min incubations at 30 oC in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.12 m potassium glutamate, 0.02 mpotassium acetate, 0.002 m EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.002 m MgATP, and free Ca2+ adjusted to indicated values. [3H]Norepinephrine was detected in supernatants following centrifugation of reaction mixtures.

Toxin treatment of membrane preparations (at 1–100 nm BoNT) was conducted for 3 min at 30 oC prior to adding Ca2+ for secretion incubations. Mouse SNAP23 is susceptible to proteolysis by BoNT A and E but only at concentrations or in incubations that exceed those used here to cleave SNAP25 by at least 1000-fold (34.Washbourne P.

It is unlikely that the rat SNAP23 protein is the functional target of BoNT inhibition in PC12 cell membranes.

GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using either glutathione for elution or thrombin cleavage for removing the GST. GST-SNAP25 was cleaved by BoNTs by incubation with ∼1 μm toxin for 1 h at room temperature. Standard conditions for binding studies employed 200-μl reactions containing 0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.15m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2.5% bovine serum albumin or 1% cold fish skin gelatin (Sigma). Binary and ternary SNARE complexes were formed by overnight incubation at 4 oC of SNAP25, syntaxin, or VAMP each at 5 μm. Glutathione-agarose beads containing 5–10 μg of GST-synaptotagmin (C2AB) were incubated with 1 μm SNAP25, binary complex or ternary complex. Glutathione-agarose beads containing 5–10 μg of GST-SNAP25 were incubated with 0.5 μm synaptotagmin (C2AB). Incubations were for 1 h at 4 oC following which beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed twice in 400 μl of assay buffer prior to solubilization in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Detection of SDS-resistant heterotrimeric SNARE complexes was by described methods (8.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Electrophoresed samples were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with the following antibodies: a polyclonal rabbit antibody generated with the C2AB regions of synaptotagmin I or III, a polyclonal rabbit antibody generated with a 15-residue N-terminal VAMP peptide sequence conjugated to bovine serum albumin, a polyclonal rabbit antibody generated to a C-terminal SNAP25 peptide (residues 195–206, generously provided by M. Wilson or obtained commercially from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated to GST-SNAP25 (Alomone Labs), a mouse monoclonal antibody to syntaxin 1 (HPC-1, Sigma), or a mouse monoclonal antibody to VAMP (Cl 69.1, generously provided by R. Jahn). 125I-Protein A or goat anti-mouse IgG (NEN Life Science Products) were used as secondary reagents. Autoradiograms were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics SI Densitometer using ImageQuaNT software. Ca2+-dependent binding of native synaptotagmin I to SNAP25 was assessed in binding studies with rat brain detergent extracts incubated with GST-SNAP25 immobilized on glutathione-agarose as described above. Rat brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing rat brains in 0.32 m sucrose using 10 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon glass homogenizer. Following clarification at 5,000 rpm for 2 min in an SS34 rotor, crude synaptosomes were collected by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 12 min and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mNaCl with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Detergent extracts were adjusted to 1 mm EGTA or 1 mmCaCl2 for binding or immunoprecipitation studies. SNAP25 immunoprecipitations were conducted by overnight incubation of detergent extracts at 4 oC with SNAP25 monoclonal antibodies (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc.) or mouse immunoglobulins immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. Studies of the late Ca2+-dependent step of exocytosis in PC12 cells showed that BoNT E completely inhibited Ca2+-triggered fusion, whereas BoNT A was only partially, if at all, inhibitory despite effective cleavage of SNAP25 (28.Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33.Lomneth R. Martin T.F.J. DasGupta B.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An explanation for this difference between toxins was suggested by earlier studies demonstrating that BoNT A inhibition of neurosecretion was unique in being reversed by elevating Ca2+ levels in synapses (32.Lundh H. Leander S. Thesleff S. J. Neurol. Sci. 1977; 32: 29-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of Ca2+ on the BoNT inhibition of regulated norepinephrine secretion in a cell-free assay that utilizes purified PC12 cell plasma membranes containing docked dense-core vesicles (29.Martin T.F.J. Kowalchyk J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14447-14453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BoNT E treatment strongly inhibited Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine release at all Ca2+ concentrations tested (Fig.1, upper panel). In contrast, BoNT A treatment inhibited Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine release at intermediate Ca2+ concentrations, but inhibition was strongly reduced at high Ca2+concentrations. BoNT E and BoNT A were present at maximally effective concentrations and catalyzed similar extents of SNAP25 proteolysis (∼80%, not shown). Treatment with BoNT A essentially increased the apparent EC50 for Ca2+ in triggering exocytosis (from 2.3 ± 0.3 to 4.4 ± 1.1 μm; mean ± S.D. for six experiments). This increase was not simply the result of a partial attenuation of exocytosis at all Ca2+concentrations since the percent inhibition by BoNT A decreased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations unlike that for other BoNTs (Fig. 1, middle panel). The Ca2+ reversal of inhibition by toxin was unique for BoNT A and was not observed for BoNT B, which cleaves VAMP (39.Schiavo G. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Rosetto O. Polverino de Laureto P. DasGupta B.R. Montecucco C. Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), or for BoNT C1, which preferentially cleaves syntaxin (40.Schiavo G. Shone C.C. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These toxins strongly inhibited Ca2+-dependent norepinephrine release at all Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1,lower panel). The unique Ca2+ reversal of BoNT A inhibition of secretion observed in this purified PC12 cell membrane preparation is similar to that reported previously for BoNT inhibition in more complex systems such as the neuromuscular junction or hippocampal and chromaffin cells (32.Lundh H. Leander S. Thesleff S. J. Neurol. Sci. 1977; 32: 29-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41.Sellin L.C. Thesleff S. DasGupta B.R. Acta Physiol.

Because cleavage of SNAP25 by BoNT A increased the EC50 for Ca2+activation of exocytosis, we considered the possibility that SNAP25 was involved in the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis. The Ca2+-binding vesicle protein synaptotagmin has been proposed to function as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis (1.Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar,18.Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 22.Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), so we determined whether synaptotagmin interacts directly with SNAP25. In the absence of Ca2+, recombinant SNAP25 was found to bind an immobilized recombinant synaptotagmin I cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2 A, upper panel) as was previously reported (44.Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the inclusion of Ca2+ in the binding reaction markedly enhanced SNAP25 binding to synaptotagmin I (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). In the reverse orientation, binding of the synaptotagmin I cytoplasmic domain to immobilized SNAP25 was also observed, and the binding was strongly stimulated by inclusion of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Quantitation of several binding experiments in both formats showed that Ca2+ stimulated the interaction of SNAP25 with synaptotagmin I by 2.5–5-fold (Fig. 2 B). Synaptotagmin I binding to SNAP25 in the absence of Ca2+was of relatively low affinity (K D∼1.2 μm), but Ca2+ increased the affinity of the interaction about 6-fold to a K D∼0.2 μm (Fig. 2 C). The stoichiometry of the binding at saturation in the absence or presence of Ca2+approached 1:1. High Ca2+ concentrations were required to stimulate synaptotagmin I binding to SNAP25 with half-maximal stimulation observed at ∼200 μm Ca2+ (Fig.3 A). When tested at 1 mm, Sr2+, Ba2+, and Mg2+ did not stimulate the interaction (not shown). Synaptotagmin I interactions with syntaxin were previously reported to exhibit a very similar Ca2+ dependence and cation specificity (24.Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 25.Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Li C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin contains two C2 domains that mediate Ca2+-dependent activities of the protein (45.Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To define the region of synaptotagmin I required for the Ca2+-stimulated interaction with SNAP25, recombinant proteins representing the full cytoplasmic domain (C2AB), a membrane-proximal region containing the C2A domain (C2A), or a membrane-distal region containing the C2B domain (C2B) were used as immobilized ligands. The C2B protein exhibited virtually no SNAP25 binding in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig.3 B). In contrast, the C2A fusion protein exhibited Ca2+-stimulated interactions with SNAP25 although it did not possess the full activity of the complete cytoplasmic domain (C2AB). These results for SNAP25 were similar to those for synaptotagmin I interactions with syntaxin where the C2A domain exhibited partial Ca2+-dependent binding activity (24.Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 25.Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The syntaxin binding domain of synaptotagmin I has recently been shown to consist of the C2A domain with a linker region plus a portion of the C2B domain (62.Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To define the region of SNAP25 essential for synaptotagmin I binding, immobilized SNAP25 was quantitatively cleaved with BoNT A or BoNT E. SNAP25 truncated by cleavage with either toxin retained its capacity to interact with synaptotagmin I in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.3 C, closed bars) as previously reported (44.Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Ca2+-dependent interaction of SNAP25 with synaptotagmin I was completely abolished by treatment with BoNT E and partially inhibited by treatment with BoNT A (Fig. 3 C, open bars). The extent of inhibition of synaptotagmin I binding observed with BoNT A-treated SNAP25 was dependent upon the Ca2+ concentration in the binding reaction with the inhibition strongly reduced at high Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 A). BoNT A treatment essentially increased the EC50 for Ca2+ stimulation of synaptotagmin I binding to SNAP25. Additional studies on native synaptotagmin I and SNAP25 in brain detergent extracts revealed Ca2+-dependent interactions between these proteins similar to those observed with recombinant proteins (Fig. 4). The specific immunoprecipitation of SNAP25 from rat brain detergent extracts resulted in the co-isolation of synaptotagmin I (Fig.4 A, lane 2), which was markedly enhanced by inclusion of Ca2+ (lane 3 versus 2). The Ca2+-stimulated retention of synaptotagmin I in the SNAP25 immunoprecipitates was largely eliminated by treatment with BoNT E (lane 4). Neither condition altered the recovery of syntaxin in the SNAP25 immunoprecipitates, and neither condition promoted the retention of CAPS, an abundant cytosolic protein. In a similar manner, synaptotagmin I in brain detergent extracts exhibited Ca2+-dependent retention on immobilized GST-SNAP25 (Fig. 4 B). Ca2+ promoted synaptotagmin I binding over the same concentration range (EC50 ∼300 μm) as was observed in binary protein binding studies with the recombinant proteins (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–6; compare with Fig. 3 A). Cleavage of the C terminus of SNAP25 with BoNT A or E markedly reduced the Ca2+-dependent binding of native synaptotagmin I to SNAP25 (Fig. 4 B, lane 6 versus 7and 8). Neither Ca2+ nor toxin treatment markedly affected the binding of native syntaxin to SNAP25. There were considerable similarities between the effects of Ca2+ in reversing BoNT A inhibition of exocytosis (Fig. 1, upper panel) and in reversing BoNT A inhibition of synaptotagmin I-SNAP25 interactions (Fig. 3 A) except that the effective Ca2+concentrations differed. Several synaptotagmin isoforms that differ in Ca2+ sensitivity have been characterized (26.Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 27.Li C. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-2490"

However, recent recognition that coniferyl aldehyde prevents 5-hydroxyferulate biosynthesis in lignifying tissue, and that the hydroxylated form of coniferyl aldehyde, 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde, is an alternative COMT substrate, demands a re-evaluation of the role of COMT during monolignol biosynthesis. Based on recombinant aspen (Populus tremuloides) COMT enzyme kinetics coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, this study establishes for the first time that COMT is in fact a 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde O-methyltransferase (AldOMT), and that 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde is both the preferred AldOMT substrate and an inhibitor of caffeate and 5-hydroxyferulate methylation, as measured by K m andK i values. 5-Hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde also inhibited the caffeate and 5-hydroxyferulate methylation activities of xylem proteins from various angiosperm tree species. The evidence that syringyl monolignol biosynthesis is independent of caffeate and 5-hydroxyferulate methylation supports our previous discovery that coniferyl aldehyde prevents ferulate 5-hydroxylation and at the same time ensures a coniferyl aldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H)-mediated biosynthesis of 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde.

Certain structural constituents of lignin, such as the guaiacyl moiety, promote monomer cross-linkages that increase lignin resistance to degradation (1.Sarkanen K.V. Sarkanen K.V. Ludwig C.H. Lignins: Occurrence, Formation, Structure and Reaction. Wiley-Interscience, New York1971: 639-694Google Scholar, 2.Chang H.M. Sarkanen K.V. Tech. Assoc. Pulp Pap. Ind.

In angiosperms, lignin is composed of a mixture of guaiacyl and syringyl monolignols, and can be degraded at considerably less energy and chemical cost than gymnosperm lignin, which consists almost entirely of guaiacyl moieties (4.Freudenberg K. Science. 1965; 148: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). As a result, there has been long standing incentive to understand the biosynthesis of syringyl monolignol in angiosperm trees in order to genetically engineer more syringyl lignin in trees to facilitate wood processing (5.Trotter P.C.

This methylation pathway has, however, been challenged, as the involvement in this pathway (Fig. 1 A) of the ferulate 5-hydroxylation step (12.Higuchi T. Brown S.A. Can. J. Biochem.

Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Based on mass spectrometry characterization of the biochemical function of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) plant proteins as well as recombinant proteins, Osakabe et al. (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) showed that coniferyl aldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H)-mediated coniferyl aldehyde 5-hydroxylation followed by COMT-catalyzed methylation of 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde would direct syringyl monolignol biosynthesis via sinapyl aldehyde (Fig. 1 B). The evidence also led to the conclusion that in lignifying tissues there is no ferulate 5-hydroxylase per se. When CAld5H substrates coniferyl aldehyde (K m = 2.77 μm) and ferulate (K m = 286 μm) were present together, a situation that is likely to exist in vivo, coniferyl aldehyde completely inhibited ferulate 5-hydroxylation in a noncompetitive manner (K i = 0.59 μm) (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This suggests that 5-hydroxyferulate is not a lignin pathway intermediate and would thus obviate methylation of 5-hydroxyferulate to sinapate as a pathway in vivo. This contrasts with the well documented in vitro evidence that COMT methylates 5-hydroxyferulate for syringyl monolignol biosynthesis (20.Sarkanen K.V. Sarkanen K.V. Ludwig C.H.

In order to resolve this apparent inconsistency, we re-evaluated angiosperm COMT by characterizing the catalytic properties of a recombinant aspen (Populus tremuloides) COMT and of lignifying xylem proteins from a variety of angiosperm tree species. Differentiating stem xylem was collected during the growing season from basswood (Tilia americana), black ash (Fraxinus americana), hophorn beam (Ostrya virginiana), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) trees, grown on the campus of Michigan Technological University. Aspen (P. tremuloides) and Sweetgum (L. styraciflua) xylem tissues were obtained, as described (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L.

The xylem was stored in liquid nitrogen before use, as described (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To a stirred mixture of 5-hydroxyvanillin (168 mg, 1 mmol) (30.Banerjee S.K. Manolopoulo M. Pepper J.M. Can. J. Chem. 1962; 40: 2175-2177Crossref Google Scholar) and monoethyl malonate (31.Struble R.E. Org. Syntheses Coll. 1963; 4: 417-419Google Scholar) (0.17 ml) were added successively pyridine (0.4 ml), piperidine (10 μl), and aniline (10 μl), and the resulting solution was stirred at 55 °C for 40 h, cooled on ice, and diluted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. After acidification with 1 n HCl to pH 2, the resulting mixture was diluted with 10 ml of ethyl acetate and washed with saturated NaCl solution until the washings became neutral, then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After evaporation, crude ethyl 5-hydroxyferulate (257.3 mg) was used to synthesize ethyl bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyferulate without purification. To a stirred suspension of ethyl 5-hydroxyferulate (239 mg) and ethyl vinyl ether (1.65 ml) in CH2Cl2 (4 ml dried over Alumina) at 0 °C, dl-10-camphorsulfonic acid (9.0 mg) was added, and after stirring the resulting solution at 0 °C for 3 h, 0.3 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added. Following stirring for another 20 min,dl-10-camphorsulfonic acid (9.7 mg) was added and the stirring was continued for another 15 min followed by the addition of about 1 ml of triethylamine to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was poured onto a saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with ethyl acetate, and the extracts were washed with a saturated NaCl solution until the washings became neutral and dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of ethyl acetate, crude ethyl bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyferulate was produced and purified by silica gel column chromatography (Kieselgel 60, Merck; solvent, ethyl acetate:n-hexane (1:4)) to give purified ethyl bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyferulate (184.0 mg) for synthesizing bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol. To a stirred solution of ethyl bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyferulate (184 mg, 0.48 mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (4 ml, distilled over CaH2) at −78 °C was added dropwise 1 mdiisobutylaluminum hydride in hexanes (580 μl, 0.58 mmol) over a period of 15 min, and the resulting solution was stirred for an additional 30 min followed by the addition of 1 ml of methanol, and the reaction mixture was poured onto ethyl acetate, and the ethyl acetate was then washed with saturated NaCl solution twice and dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness to afford a mixture of bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde and bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol (160.2 mg), which was purified by silica gel TLC (Kieselgel 60 F254, Merck; solvent, ethyl acetate:n-hexane (1:2)) to give purified bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde (2.1 mg, 1%) and bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol (83.9 mg, 51%) to be oxidized back to bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde. To a stirred solution of bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol (53.7 mg, 0.158 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4 ml, dried over Alumina), activated MnO2 (Aldrich, ∼85%) (316 mg, 3.16 mmol) was added. Following stirring at room temperature for 50 min, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the solvent evaporated to give bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde (55.3 mg, 100%). To a stirred solution of bis(ethoxyethyl)-5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde (50.0 mg) in acetone (2 ml) at 0 °C was added 1 n HCl, and the resulting solution was stirred at 0 °C for 6 min followed by dilution with ethyl acetate and washing successively with water and saturated NaCl solution. The organic layer was then dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to give 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde (33.9 mg, 100%). The structure of 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde was confirmed by 1H and13C NMR, CH-COSY (CH-correlation spectroscopy), COLOC (correlation spectroscopy via long-range coupling), HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity), and MS. NMR spectra were recorded with a JNM-LA400MK FT-NMR System (JEOL). Electron impact mass spectrometry (70 eV) was recorded with a JMS-DX303HF Mass Spectrometer equipped with a JMA-DA5000 Mass Data System (JEOL). 5-Hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde:1H NMR δ (acetone-d 6, carbon numbers are shown in Fig. 1 B), 3.88 (3H, s, OCH3), 6.60 (1H, dd, J = 15.6,J = 7.8, C8H), 6.88 (1H, d,J = 1.7, C6H), 6.95 (1H, d,J = 1.7, C2H), 7.50 (1H, d,J = 15.6, C7H), 9.61 (1H, d,J = 7.8, C9H); 13C NMR δ (acetone-d 6), 56.6 (OCH3), 104.7 (C2), 111.2 (C6), 126.5 (C1), 127.2 (C8), 138.3 (C4), 146.5 (C5), 149.3 (C3), 154.4 (C7), 193.8 (C9); MSm/z (%), 194 (M+, 100), 177 (10.8), 166 (24.4), 151 (53.9), 133 (8.0), 123 (21.1), 105 (7.0). All other chemicals used were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to introduce the SphI site at the 5′-end and HindIII site at the 3′-end of the coding sequence of the aspen COMT (6.Bugos R.C. Chiang V.L. Campbell W.H Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 203-1215Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using a sense primer (5′-ATCCGCATGCGCATGGGTTCAACAGGTGAA-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-GGAAGCTTAGGCCTTCTTGCGGAATTC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was first cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), from which the SphI andHindIII fragment containing the COMT coding region was then cloned into a pQE-32 (Qiagen Inc.) expression vector to fuse a His-tag at the N-terminal of COMT cDNA sequence. After sequencing to confirm the accuracy of the aspen COMT-pQE construct, the construct was transferred into E. coliM15-pREP4 stain. The induction and expression of recombinant aspen COMT were conducted according to Li et al.(32.Li L. Popko J.L. Zhang X.-H. Osakabe K. Tsai C.J. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5461-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The M15-pREP4 cell strain containing pQE-32 vector without a COMT cDNA insert was used as the control. After harvesting by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min), the cell pellet was processed to affinity purify the COMT protein using the HisBind Resin affinity purification system (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, as described (32.Li L. Popko J.L. Zhang X.-H. Osakabe K. Tsai C.J. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5461-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After dialysis, the purified recombinant aspen COMT protein (200 μg/ml) was stored in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 30% glycerol at −20 °C until use for enzyme activity assay. Our established COMT enzymatic activity assay (27.Tsai C.J. Popko J.L. Mielke M.R. Hu W.J. Podila G.K. Chiang V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33.Li L. Osakabe Y. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was modified to allow a direct quantification of the reaction products by HPLC-UV/Mass Spectrometry (MS) analysis for the enzyme kinetic studies. The reaction volume was 300 μl containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μmS-adenosyl-l-methionine, 1 μg of purified recombinant COMT protein (∼24 pmol) (boiled protein was used as the control), and varying concentrations of substrates (caffeate, 10–800 μm; 5-hydroxyferulate, 5–800 μm; 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde, 0.25–50 μm). For inhibition kinetics, two sets of 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde concentrations, (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 μm) and (0.75, 1, 2, and 4 μm), were used to assay the 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde-induced inhibition of COMT-mediated methylation of 5-hydroxyferulate and caffeate, respectively. 5-Hydroxyferulate (10, 50, 100, and 200 μm) was used as the inhibitor for COMT-catalyzed reactions with 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde and caffeate, respectively. Two sets of caffeate concentrations (25, 50, 100, and 150 μm and 10, 50, 100, and 200 μm) were tested for their inhibition effect on COMT-mediated methylation of 5-hydroxyferulate and 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde, respectively. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 12 n HCl, and after adding 500 ng of o-coumarate as the internal standard, the reaction mixture was analyzed directly by HPLC UV/MS. Developing xylem tissue (10 g) from each tree species was ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized at 4 °C for 2 min in 25 ml of extraction buffer (0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 20 mmabsorbic acid, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenate was filtrated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then used for the COMT enzyme assay following the protocols described above, except the concentration of each substrate was fixed at 100 μm and the crude protein quantity at 15 μg (boiled protein was used as the control). The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 30% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and used immediately for the 5-hydroxylation activity assay according to Osakabeet al. (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the reaction mixture was analyzed directly by HPLC UV/MS. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Without solvent extraction, the enzymatic reaction mixture (50 μl) was directly injected onto a Supelcosil ABZ-Plus column (25 cm × 2.1 mm × 5 μm, Supelco) maintained at 40 °C with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and a gradient program of 20% acetonitrile in 10 mm formic acid (pH 2.5) for 12 min and then 20–100% acetonitrile from 12 to 16 min, and held at 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. The column was equilibrated in 20% acetonitrile for 5 min before each injection. The LC system was a Hewlett-Packard LC/MSD 1100 with a diode array detector and atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectral detection. Sinapyl aldehyde: UV (measured in 20% acetonitrile in 10 mm formic acid, pH 2.5) λmax I 244 nm, λmax II 344 nm, λmin 275 nm; MS (70 V)m/z (%), 207 (100), 192 (69.0), 177 (11.Brown S.A. Neish A.C. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1956; 34: 769-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); retention time (Rt) 10.64 min/UV, 10.79 min/MS (the flow path separation between UV detection and MS detection was 0.15 min). Sinapate: UV, λmax I 238 nm, λmax II 322 nm, λmin 264 nm; MS (70 V) m/z (%) 224 (12.Higuchi T. Brown S.A. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1963; 41: 65-76Crossref Google Scholar), 223 (100), 208 (36.0); Rt 9.45 min/UV, 9.59 min/MS. Ferulate: UV λmax I 236 nm, λmax II 322 nm, λmin 262 nm; MS (70 V) m/z (%) 193 (100), 178 (43.Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Nicolary K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 149 (13.Higuchi T. Brown S.A. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1963; 41: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 134 (13.Higuchi T. Brown S.A. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1963; 41: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Rt 10.80 min/UV, 10.95 min/MS. Based on these properties of the authentic compounds, the detection and identification of the reaction products by the diode array detector was at their respective λmax (344 nm for sinapyl aldehyde, 322 nm for sinapate and ferulate) and MS detection was in selective ion monitoring (SIM) negative ion mode (m/z 207.1 for sinapyl aldehyde, 223.1 for sinapate, 193.1 for ferulate, and 163.1 foro-coumarate) with a fragmentor voltage of 70 at which [M − H]− is usually the base peak in the MS spectrum. The identity of the product was further confirmed by comparing the ion fragmentation patterns of the product and authentic standard in MS scanning mode at 70 and 150 V. The product quantity was then obtained based on the response ratio of the authentic compound/internal standard using the UV signal. K m and V maxvalues were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots, andk cat by dividing V max by the enzyme concentration, based on two to three independent assays.K i was derived from the slope of a plot of the apparent K m for the substrate versus the corresponding inhibitor concentration at which the apparentK m was obtained. Traditionally, functional characterization of lignin pathwayO-methyltransferase has not given consideration to the purity and structural identity of enzymatic reaction products in question. In this study an approach to directly quantify the structurally confirmed products was adapted. Non-radioactiveS-adenosyl-l-methionine was used as the methyl donor and the reaction mixture was directly subjected to HPLC separation without solvent extraction to avoid variability in extraction efficiency for different organic compounds. The product structural identity was corroborated by diode array UV and MS signature comparison to authentic compounds. A major advantage of the current approach is that it allows unequivocal quantification of reaction products derived from the simultaneous reaction with an array of substrates. This enabled characterization of the protein-multisubstrate interactions likely to be typical of lignifying tissues where monolignol biosynthetic pathway intermediates, such as coniferyl aldehyde derivatives, are present together (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). 5-Hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde, 5-hydroxyferulate (both were chemically synthesized, see “Experimental Procedures”), and caffeate, were incubated individually with purified recombinant aspen COMT from E. coli. Diode array detector (at 344 nm, the λmax of sinapyl aldehyde) analysis of reaction products from 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde (denoted as Sample ingreen in Fig. 2 A) revealed a single peak with a retention time (Rt) of 10.64 min which co-eluted with authentic sinapyl aldehyde. No such peak could be detected in control (boiled protein) reaction (purple). To confirm the authenticity of this sinapyl aldehyde peak, the control and sample HPLC eluants were analyzed by MS, and the mass spectral data was acquired in the SIM mode targeting the [M − H]−fragment ion of m/z 207 from sinapyl aldehyde. The total ion chromatogram of the sample eluent (red) showed a major peak at 10.79 min, which was absent in the control (black) and corresponds to the sinapyl aldehyde peak at 10.64 min (green) detected by diode array detector. Furthermore, the relative intensities of the fragmented ions (Fig. 2 A,inset) derived from this 10.79-min MS peak were identical to those from authentic sinapyl aldehyde, confirming that the aldehyde precursor can be methylated during monolignol biosynthesis and that COMT can catalyze this reaction. Using the same analytical system, the COMT-catalyzed methylation of 5-hydroxyferulate (Fig. 2 B) and caffeate (Fig. 2 C) for the formation of sinapate and ferulate, respectively, were also confirmed. We then conducted the kinetics of COMT-catalyzed reactions. Lineweaver-Burk analysis indicated that E. coli-expressed COMT recombinant protein exhibited a similar turnover rate with each of the three different phenolic substrates used (Table I). However, COMT showed the highest affinity for 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde with aV max/K m value 5 and 31 times those for 5-hydroxyferulate and caffeate, respectively, overturning the conventional claim that 5-hydroxyferulate is the best COMT substrate (16.Shimada M. Higuchi T. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 2247-2252Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17.Shimada M. Fushiki H. Higuchi T. Mokuzai Gakkuishi. 1973; 19: 13-21Google Scholar, 18.Kuroda H. Shimada M.

The kinetic data further suggest that COMT is more specific for 5-methylation than for 3-methylation, and that, in the presence of all three potential substrates, COMT-catalyzed methylation of 5-hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde would be the dominant reaction leading to syringyl monolignol biosynthesis. In light of the discovery of Osakabe et al. (26.Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we address the minimal composition of the processive elongation complex in the eukaryotes by developing a method for promoter-independent assembly of functional elongation complex of S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II from synthetic DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. We show that only one of the nucleic acid components, the 8-nt RNA:DNA hybrid, is necessary for the formation of a stable elongation complex with RNA polymerase II. The double-strand DNA upstream and downstream of the hybrid does not affect stability of the elongation complex. This finding reveals a significant difference in processivity determinants of RNA polymerase II and E. coli RNA polymerase. In addition, using the imperfect RNA:DNA hybrid disturbed by the mismatches in the RNA, we show that nontemplate DNA strand may reduce the elongation complex stability via the reduction of the RNA:DNA hybrid length.

In addition, using the imperfect RNA:DNA hybrid disturbed by the mismatches in the RNA, we show that nontemplate DNA strand may reduce the elongation complex stability via the reduction of the RNA:DNA hybrid length. The structure of a “minimal stable” elongation complex suggests a key role of the RNA:DNA hybrid in RNA polymerase II processivity. RNA polymerase II elongation complex nucleotide(s) transcription buffer nontemplate DNA strand template DNA strand Characterization of the processivity determinants in yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II)1 is crucial for understanding the mechanisms controlling eukaryotic gene expression at the levels of promoter escape, pausing, arrest, and release of the RNA from transcription terminators (1.Bentley D.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The polymerase proceeds through the nucleosomal structure of the template and survives a prolonged pausing or arrest in the genes without dissociating from the template. Therefore, the formation of a highly stable elongation complex (EC), in which RNA polymerase is tightly bound to the nascent transcript and template, is absolutely required for the enzyme processivity (3.Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The mechanism that reconciles the strong stable binding of Pol II to the DNA with the high speed of forward translocation is unknown.Elongation of a promoter-initiated transcript occurs in the absence of general initiation factors, which dissociate from the enzyme during promoter escape (4.Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Processive elongation by eukaryotic Pol II can also be achieved using purified polymerase in a promoter- and factor-independent transcription system (5.Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the basic processivity function belongs to the core Pol II enzyme. Although it was shown that substantial changes in the nucleic acid array accompany the switch to a processive RNA synthesis (6.Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the role of DNA and RNA in the Pol II EC stability remains speculative (7.Gralla J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of this role has been hampered by the extreme complexity of the native eukaryotic EC, which contains multiple transcription elongation factors (8.Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Differentiation between the effect of elongation factors on EC stability and activity and the role of the Pol II core enzyme interaction with RNA and DNA requires a simple, “minimal” in vitro system. Here, we develop a novel technique for obtaining Pol II ECs, which bypasses the need for protein factors or for introduction of mismatches in DNA to promote transcription initiation. This approach involves a direct assembly of intermediates in the elongation pathway using purified hexahistidine-tagged core Pol II enzyme and synthetic RNA and DNA oligonucleotides. We demonstrate that the resulting complex has structural and functional properties that resemble those of the promoter-initiated ECs in all structural parameters that we have tested. The method allows us to assess the impact of nucleic acids components by introducing various changes to any site of the EC nucleic acid array through the sequence, length, and pairing affinity, which cannot be done using a promoter-initiated system or “artificial transcription bubble templates” (9.Keene R.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10.Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Below, we apply the assembly approach for the analyses of the minimal nucleic acid composition required for formation of a stable EC by the Pol II core enzyme. The interactions of two DNA strands and RNA within the region of the transcription bubble and their role in the maintenance of a stable EC were analyzed in complexes assembled with synthetic RNAs and nontemplate DNA strands fully or partially complementary to the template DNA.DISCUSSIONOne of the most difficult problems in conducting in vitro analysis of transcription elongation in eukaryotes is the formation and isolation of an EC in the absence of multiple auxiliary factors. The current methods for the promoter-less EC formation using the dC-tailed templates (5.Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are either not efficient or yield complexes the structure and activity of which may not be similar to the properties of a native EC. Here, we develop a new method of a promoter- and factor-independent EC formation. This method exploits the ability of Pol II to bind the 3′-end of a short RNA oligonucleotide annealed to a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide serving as a template. This intermediate then accepts the fully complementary nontemplate DNA strand to generate a normal transcription bubble. The assembled complexes quantitatively and sequence-specifically elongate the synthetic RNA primer. Elongation of a transcript results in movement of the polymerase along the template with a coordinate movement of the transcription bubble and displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA from the hybrid with the template. These properties indicate that the structure of the assembled EC closely resembles the structure of the EC obtained by a promoter-specific initiation.In this work, the assembly method is applied to the analyses of the processivity determinants of Pol II ECs. The comparison of properties of ECs formed by E. coli RNA polymerase and S. cerevisiae Pol II reveals a substantial difference in the stability requirements of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ECs. EC8 and EC9 formed on a single-strand template by yeast Pol II are stable (Fig.2 B), whereas the same ECs of bacterial RNA polymerase are unstable (13.Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 2N. Komissarova, unpublished observation. Double-strand DNA downstream from the RNA:DNA hybrid does not increase the stability of the eukaryotic EC as it does for the prokaryotic EC. Thus, an 8-nt RNA:DNA hybrid representing one out of two stability determinants of the bacterial enzyme EC may be considered a main stability determinant of the Pol II EC.The observed difference in EC stability determinants in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is surprising, considering that multiple experimental results indicated a significant homology in the three-dimensional structures of the two enzymes and in the biochemical activities of their ECs (32.Darst S.A. Edwards A.M. Kubalek E.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1991; 66: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33.Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16843-16852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses of transcription performed onE. coli RNA polymerase lead to the conclusion that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes form a sliding clamp around the duplex DNA, which anchors the protein to the template but does not interfere with the lateral motion of the enzyme (Refs. 35.Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 36.Gelles J. Landick R. Cell. 1998; 93: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and references therein).However, structural analyses of yeast Pol II enzyme (37.Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Bushnell D.A. Jensen G.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 799-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as well as a two-dimensional crystal structure of Pol II elongation complex (38.Poglitsch C.L. Meredith G.D. Gnatt A.L. Jensen G.J. Chang W. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 791-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), position the hybrid in the active site cleft in the protein structure. Downstream DNA apparently lies on the Pol II surface and is partially surrounded from above and below by the arms of the enzyme (38.Poglitsch C.L. Meredith G.D. Gnatt A.L. Jensen G.J. Chang W. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 791-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a speculation based on crystallographic analyses of Pol II enzyme (39.Mooney R.A. Landick R. Cell. 1999; 98: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that, at least in the Pol II enzyme, the crucial protein-nucleic acid contact, which is necessary for the processive elongation, is located within the region of the RNA:DNA hybrid, rather than downstream of the hybrid. Based on a significant structural homology of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases, we believe that the requirement of the downstream DNA duplex byE. coli RNA polymerase for the formation of a stable EC may indicate a weaker clamping action of the bacterial enzyme on the RNA:DNA hybrid, which is strengthened by the polymerase interaction with the double-strand DNA downstream. It is necessary to emphasize that the interaction with the downstream DNA duplex is likely to take place both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic ECs and has various functional consequences. For example, Pol II pausing near the end of a linear template (40.Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as a positive effect of the downstream DNA duplex on the catalytic activity of EC formed on a single-strand template and containing a 34-nt transcript, 3M. L. Kireeva, unpublished observation. indicates that the interaction with the front end DNA duplex may be important for modulating catalytic competence of the EC.Although the effect of the Pol II interaction with the duplex DNA downstream from the RNA:DNA hybrid on the Pol II EC stability was not detected in our experimental system, the nontemplate DNA strand is evidently closely involved in the negative regulation of the EC stability. The processivity control by the nontemplate strand, summarized in Fig. 4 C, occurs via modulation of the RNA:DNA hybrid length. Apparently, the mismatched portion of the transcript is actively displaced by the nontemplate strand (Fig. 4 C, EC7+2 DS), making the nucleic acid array in this complex structurally similar to that of the EC with the 7-nt RNA (EC7 DS). Introduction of a corresponding mismatch into the nontemplate DNA strand (Fig. 4 C, EC7+2 Mismatched NDS) abolishes this competition and thereby provides the opportunity for the RNA:DNA hybrid binding site in Pol II to accommodate the mismatched RNA. In this case, EC7+2 may acquire a conformation resembling the stable complex with the 9-nt RNA:DNA hybrid (EC9). Thus, the nontemplate DNA strand interacts with the upstream part of the RNA:DNA hybrid, modulating the EC stability. Yet another example of the positive processivity control by the nontemplate strand is a displacement of nascent RNA in the ECs with transcripts longer than 15–16 nt. In these complexes, the nontemplate DNA strand prevents the formation of an abnormally long RNA:DNA hybrid, which, as shown elsewhere, has a dramatic destabilizing effect on the Pol II EC. 4M. L. Kireeva, submitted for publication. The main prediction of our model is that the length of the RNA:DNA hybrid is a possible target for regulation of the transcription processivity. Our results suggest an active involvement of the nontemplate strand on the upstream edge of the transcription bubble in the induction of transcript release during termination or abortive RNA synthesis (9.Keene R.G.

Experiments are under way to address the issues of how the transcription factors and the phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, which occurs during the escape from promoter, would affect the minimal RNA/DNA requirements for the EC stability and the other properties of the assembled complex. Characterization of the processivity determinants in yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II)1 is crucial for understanding the mechanisms controlling eukaryotic gene expression at the levels of promoter escape, pausing, arrest, and release of the RNA from transcription terminators (1.Bentley D.L.

Experiments are under way to address the issues of how the transcription factors and the phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, which occurs during the escape from promoter, would affect the minimal RNA/DNA requirements for the EC stability and the other properties of the assembled complex. One of the most difficult problems in conducting in vitro analysis of transcription elongation in eukaryotes is the formation and isolation of an EC in the absence of multiple auxiliary factors.

Here, we develop a new method of a promoter- and factor-independent EC formation. This method exploits the ability of Pol II to bind the 3′-end of a short RNA oligonucleotide annealed to a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide serving as a template. This intermediate then accepts the fully complementary nontemplate DNA strand to generate a normal transcription bubble. The assembled complexes quantitatively and sequence-specifically elongate the synthetic RNA primer. Elongation of a transcript results in movement of the polymerase along the template with a coordinate movement of the transcription bubble and displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA from the hybrid with the template. These properties indicate that the structure of the assembled EC closely resembles the structure of the EC obtained by a promoter-specific initiation. In this work, the assembly method is applied to the analyses of the processivity determinants of Pol II ECs. The comparison of properties of ECs formed by E. coli RNA polymerase and S. cerevisiae Pol II reveals a substantial difference in the stability requirements of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ECs. EC8 and EC9 formed on a single-strand template by yeast Pol II are stable (Fig.2 B), whereas the same ECs of bacterial RNA polymerase are unstable (13.Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 2N. Komissarova, unpublished observation. Double-strand DNA downstream from the RNA:DNA hybrid does not increase the stability of the eukaryotic EC as it does for the prokaryotic EC. Thus, an 8-nt RNA:DNA hybrid representing one out of two stability determinants of the bacterial enzyme EC may be considered a main stability determinant of the Pol II EC. The observed difference in EC stability determinants in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is surprising, considering that multiple experimental results indicated a significant homology in the three-dimensional structures of the two enzymes and in the biochemical activities of their ECs (32.Darst S.A. Edwards A.M. Kubalek E.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1991; 66: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33.Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16843-16852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses of transcription performed onE. coli RNA polymerase lead to the conclusion that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes form a sliding clamp around the duplex DNA, which anchors the protein to the template but does not interfere with the lateral motion of the enzyme (Refs. 35.Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 36.Gelles J. Landick R. Cell. 1998; 93: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and references therein). However, structural analyses of yeast Pol II enzyme (37.Fu J. Gnatt A.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 799-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), as well as a two-dimensional crystal structure of Pol II elongation complex (38.Poglitsch C.L. Meredith G.D. Gnatt A.L. Jensen G.J. Chang W. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 791-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), position the hybrid in the active site cleft in the protein structure. Downstream DNA apparently lies on the Pol II surface and is partially surrounded from above and below by the arms of the enzyme (38.Poglitsch C.L. Meredith G.D. Gnatt A.L. Jensen G.J. Chang W. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 98: 791-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a speculation based on crystallographic analyses of Pol II enzyme (39.Mooney R.A. Landick R. Cell. 1999; 98: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that, at least in the Pol II enzyme, the crucial protein-nucleic acid contact, which is necessary for the processive elongation, is located within the region of the RNA:DNA hybrid, rather than downstream of the hybrid. Based on a significant structural homology of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases, we believe that the requirement of the downstream DNA duplex byE. coli RNA polymerase for the formation of a stable EC may indicate a weaker clamping action of the bacterial enzyme on the RNA:DNA hybrid, which is strengthened by the polymerase interaction with the double-strand DNA downstream. It is necessary to emphasize that the interaction with the downstream DNA duplex is likely to take place both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic ECs and has various functional consequences. For example, Pol II pausing near the end of a linear template (40.Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as a positive effect of the downstream DNA duplex on the catalytic activity of EC formed on a single-strand template and containing a 34-nt transcript, 3M. L. Kireeva, unpublished observation. indicates that the interaction with the front end DNA duplex may be important for modulating catalytic competence of the EC. Although the effect of the Pol II interaction with the duplex DNA downstream from the RNA:DNA hybrid on the Pol II EC stability was not detected in our experimental system, the nontemplate DNA strand is evidently closely involved in the negative regulation of the EC stability. The processivity control by the nontemplate strand, summarized in Fig. 4 C, occurs via modulation of the RNA:DNA hybrid length. Apparently, the mismatched portion of the transcript is actively displaced by the nontemplate strand (Fig. 4 C, EC7+2 DS), making the nucleic acid array in this complex structurally similar to that of the EC with the 7-nt RNA (EC7 DS). Introduction of a corresponding mismatch into the nontemplate DNA strand (Fig. 4 C, EC7+2 Mismatched NDS) abolishes this competition and thereby provides the opportunity for the RNA:DNA hybrid binding site in Pol II to accommodate the mismatched RNA. In this case, EC7+2 may acquire a conformation resembling the stable complex with the 9-nt RNA:DNA hybrid (EC9). Thus, the nontemplate DNA strand interacts with the upstream part of the RNA:DNA hybrid, modulating the EC stability. Yet another example of the positive processivity control by the nontemplate strand is a displacement of nascent RNA in the ECs with transcripts longer than 15–16 nt. In these complexes, the nontemplate DNA strand prevents the formation of an abnormally long RNA:DNA hybrid, which, as shown elsewhere, has a dramatic destabilizing effect on the Pol II EC. 4M. L. Kireeva, submitted for publication. The main prediction of our model is that the length of the RNA:DNA hybrid is a possible target for regulation of the transcription processivity. Our results suggest an active involvement of the nontemplate strand on the upstream edge of the transcription bubble in the induction of transcript release during termination or abortive RNA synthesis (9.Keene R.G.

Based upon the observations that COX-2 was overexpressed in 85–90% of human colon cancers (1.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that TGF-β was abnormally expressed in over 90% of human colon cancers (37.Avery A. Paraskeva C. Hall P. Flanders K.C. Sporn M. Moorghen M. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 68: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TGF-β may play a role in the regulation of COX-2 expression during the adenoma to carcinoma sequence of events that are involved in the neoplastic transformation of colonic epithelial cells (4.Shao J. Sheng H. Aramandla R. Pereira A. Lubet R.A. Hawk E. Grogan L. Kirsch I.R. Washington M.K. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This study describes the observation that TGF-β synergistically enhances the expression of COX-2 in conditionally Ha-Ras-transformed intestinal epithelial cells. We have also evaluated the mechanisms by which Ras and TGF-β mediate the induction of COX-2. TGF-β-neutralizing antibody partially inhibits the increased expression of COX-2 after induction of Ha-Ras, suggesting an important autocrine effect of Ras-induced TGF-β1 expression. Both Ha-RasVal12 and TGF-β1-mediated induction of COX-2 involve stabilization of COX-2 mRNA, and the combined effects of Ha-RasVal12 and TGF-β treatment cause a synergistic increase in COX-2 mRNA by prolonging the half-life of the mRNA. Using chimeric reporter constructs containing the COX-2 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) linked to the luciferase reporter gene, we provide the evidence that this region contains thecis-acting elements necessary to confer both Ha-Ras and TGF-β responsiveness. RIE-iRas cell line with an inducible activated Ha-RasVal12 cDNA was generated by using LacSwitch eukaryotic expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). The Ha-RasVal12 cDNA is under the transcriptional control of the Lac operon in rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cells. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG; Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 5 mm was used to induce the expression of mutated Ha-Ras. Anti-TGF-β antibody (R&D Systems, Inc. Minneapolis MN) was used to block the endogenous TGF-β activity. The extraction of total cellular RNA was performed as described previously (7.Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N.

RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (Stratagene). After hybridization and washes, the blots were subjected to autoradiography. 18 S rRNA signals were used as controls to determine integrity of RNA and equality of the loading. For determination of mRNA stability, RIE-iRas cells were treated with IPTG, TGF-β1, or both IPTG and TGF-β1 for 24 h, then the transcription was stopped by the addition of 100 μm DRB (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; Sigma). The RNA samples were isolated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min following the DRB treatment and analyzed for mRNA levels by Northern blotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (38.Ko T.C. Sheng H.M. Reisman D. Thompson E.A. Beauchamp R.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed for 30 min in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate), then clarified cell lysates were denatured and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The filters were then probed with the indicated antibodies, developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation was by densitometry. The anti-COX-2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pan Ras antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Reporter construct phPES2(−327/+59) containing the 5′-flanking region of the human COX-2 gene (nucleotides −327 to +59) was a kind gift of Dr. H. Inoue (National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan) and described previously (39.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). phPES2(−327/+59) was co-transfected with pcDNA3/zeo into RIE-iRas cells. Transfected cells were selected by neomycin (600 μg/ml), hygromycin (150 μg/ml), and zeocin (250 μg/ml). Pooled clones were used for determine the luciferase activity. The construction of reporter expression vectors pLuc+3′-UTR, pLuc+3′-UTRΔARE, and pLuc+ARE was described elsewhere. 2Dixon, D. A., Kaplan, C. D., McIntyre, T. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and Prescott, S. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in press. Briefly, a reporter vector, pLuc, was generated by inserting the luciferase cDNA into pcDNA3/zeo (Invitrogene, Carlsbad, CA). The addition of the COX-2 3′-UTR (1451 bp) was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the COX-2 3′-UTR using XbaI-tailed primers and inserting them adjacent to the luciferase coding region to yield pLuc+3′-UTR. pLuc+3′-UTRΔARE was generated by digesting pLuc+3′-UTR with ApaI and ScaI to release a 1036-bp region of the COX-2 3′-UTR, and this 3′-UTR region was cloned into the ApaI and filled-in XbaI sites of pLuc. For pLuc+ARE, pLuc+3′-UTR was digested with PmeI andScaI to generate a 1818-bp Luc+ARE fragment that was inserted into pcDNA3/zeo vector. RIE-iRas cells were transfected with pLuc (RIE-iRas/luc), pLuc+3′-UTR (RIE-iRas/Luc+3′-UTR), pLuc+3′-UTRΔARE (RIE-iRas/Luc+3′-UTRΔARE), or pLuc+ARE (RIE-iRas/Luc+ARE). The stable transfected clones were selected with neomycin (600 μg/ml), hygromycin (150 μg/ml), and zeocin (250 μg/ml). For the luciferase activity assay, cells were treated for the indicated hours and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison WI). Twenty μl of lysate was used for the firefly luciferase reading by using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a model TD-20/20 luminometer. Firefly luciferase values were standardized to the protein contents and presented as mean ± S.E. of assays performed in triplicate. We previously reported that COX-2 expression is significantly increased in a rat intestinal epithelial cell line stably transformed by Ha-Ras (6.Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and conditional expression of Ha-Ras rapidly induced the expression of COX-2 in rat fibroblasts (7.Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether COX-2 is an early target of oncogenic Ha-Ras in RIE cells, we have introduced the inducible Ha-RasVal12cDNA vectors into the RIE-1 cells (RIE-iRas). Noninduced RIE-iRas cells displayed the same nontransformed morphology as the parental RIE-1 cells. Morphological transformation of the RIE-iRas cells was observed between 24–48 h after IPTG treatment. During this interval, cell-cell contact inhibition was lost. The cells acquired a spindly appearance and grew in overlapping clusters (Fig.1 A). The morphological transformation of RIE-iRas cells could be completely reversed upon withdrawal of IPTG for 72 h (−72 h). As shown in Fig.1 B, the addition of IPTG into the culture medium induced activated Ha-Ras protein by 4 h. Thereafter, the level of Ras protein was continuously elevated for the duration of IPTG treatment. COX-2 was expressed at very low levels in RIE-iRas cells before IPTG treatment. The elevation of COX-2 protein was detected by 8 h after the addition of IPTG. The induction of COX-2 temporally coincided with the induction of Ha-Ras protein. We next investigated whether Ras-induced expression of COX-2 involves signaling through TGF-β. Northern analysis revealed that induction of Ras significantly increased the levels of TGF-β1 mRNA (Fig.2 A). In the absence of Ras induction, the addition of exogenous TGF-β1 transiently increased the levels of COX-2 in RIE-iRas cells, with a peak between 12–24 h following TGF-β treatment (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether endogenous TGF-β mediates a component of the Ras-induced COX-2 expression, TGF-β-neutralizing antibody was added before the IPTG treatment. Indeed, induction of COX-2 by activated Ha-Ras was partially blocked by TGF-β-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2 C), implying a functional autocrine role for TGF-β in Ras-mediated induction of COX-2. Although TGF-β expression is normally restricted to the lumenal one-third of the intestinal epithelium (16.Barnard J.A. Beauchamp R.D. Coffey R.J. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1578-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 40.Barnard J.A. Warwick G.J. Gold L.I. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 67-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the interstitial cells may produce large amounts of paracrine TGF-β. It was of interest to determine whether there was a cooperative effect of exogenous TGF-β1 and oncogenic Ras on the expression of COX-2. The RIE-iRas cells were treated with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 without IPTG, and the levels of COX-2 mRNA were analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, in the absence of Ras induction, treatment with TGF-β1 increased the level of COX-2 mRNA, which reached a peak (3.5-fold) by 8 h after the treatment. Induction of Ras by IPTG treatment increased the levels of COX-2 mRNA by 8 h, and the levels remained at an elevated plateau between 12–72 h. Interestingly, combined treatment with TGF-β1 and IPTG resulted in a marked induction of COX-2. The levels of COX-2 mRNA were synergistically elevated by the combination of TGF-β1 and Ras by 24 h after the combined treatment. A 20–50-fold increase in the levels of COX-2 mRNA was observed between 24–72 h. Western analysis further confirmed that the increased levels of COX-2 mRNA level also reflected an increase in the level of COX-2 protein (Fig. 3 B). We have previously reported that induction of Ha-Ras stabilizes COX-2 mRNA in Rat-1 fibroblasts (7.Sheng H. Williams C.S. Shao J. Liang P. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22120-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism of synergistic induction of COX-2 that results from oncogenic Ras and TGF-β1, we examined the stability of COX-2 mRNA in RIE-iRas cells after TGF-β1 and IPTG treatment. RIE-iRas cells were treated with IPTG, TGF-β1, or both IPTG and TGF-β1 for 24 h, then transcription was stopped by the addition of 100 μmDRB. The RNA samples were isolated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min following the DRB treatment and analyzed for mRNA levels by Northern blotting. As demonstrated in Fig.4, A and B, COX-2 mRNA was rapidly degraded in noninduced RIE-iRas cells (t 12 ∼ 13 min). Individually, either TGF-β1 or IPTG treatment increased the stability of COX-2 mRNA to a similar extent (t 12 ∼ 24–30 min). The COX-2 mRNA from the RIE-iRas cells after combined TGF-β1 and IPTG treatment was extremely stable, and the t 12 was greater than 50 min. To further study transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 in RIE-iRas cells, we transfected the luciferase reporter gene linked with either COX-2 promoter region or 3′-UTR into RIE-iRas cells. The 5′-flanking region of the human COX-2 gene (nucleotides −327 to +59) includes the nuclear factor responsible for Interleukin-6 expression (NF-IL6) site and the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) (39.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This reporter gene exhibited promoter activity that was modestly increased by induction of oncogenic Ras or by the addition of exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig.5 A). Treatment with TGF-β1 for 6 and 24 h did not alter the activity of this promoter region. We next engineered the RIE-iRas cells to express the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene alone (RIE-Ras/luc) or linked with 1.5 kilobases of COX-2 3′-UTR (RIE-iRas/luc+3′-UTR). Stably transfected clones were selected and analyzed. Treatment with IPTG for 24 h increased the luciferase activity by 100% in RIE-iRas/luc+3′-UTR cells but did not alter the luciferase activity in RIE-iRas/luc control cells (Fig. 5 B). These results suggested that induction of Ras stabilized luciferase mRNA via the linked COX-2 3′-UTR and not through a transcriptional induction of the luciferase gene alone. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the increased luciferase activity resulted from an increase in the levels of luciferase mRNA (Fig. 5 C). The level of luciferase mRNA was clearly elevated by 8 h after the induction of Ha-Ras. A 2–3-fold increase in the level of luciferase mRNA was observed between 24–48 h after Ha-RasVal12 was induced by the addition of IPTG (Fig. 5 C). There was no significant induction of luciferase activity in control RIE-iRas/luc cells that were treated with IPTG, TGF-β1, or both IPTG and TGF-β1 for 6, 24, and 72 h (Fig. 5 D). However, the luciferase activity in RIE-iRas/luc+3′-UTR cells was induced by either IPTG or TGF-β1 treatment. The luciferase activity was additively increased by 24 h after combined treatment with TGF-β1 and IPTG. A synergistic increase in luciferase activity was observed by 72 h after the RIE-iRas/luc+3′-UTR cells were treated with both TGF-β1 and IPTG. These results are consistent with the findings of Northern analysis described in Fig. 3 A. The 3′-untranslated region of the COX-2 transcript is extremely AU-rich and contains 14 copies of the Shaw-Kamens sequence (AUUUA), otherwise known as AU-rich elements (AREs) (41.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). To determine whether the stabilization of COX-2 mRNA by oncogenic Ras and TGF-β1 treatment was dependent upon highly conserved AU-rich elements located in the proximal COX-2 3′-UTR (14.Ristimaki A. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we constructed two additional reporter vectors. The pLuc+3′-UTRΔARE construct was derived from pLuc+3′-UTR by removal of a fragment of 415 bp of nucleotide including 8 conserved AU-rich elements from the proximal COX-2 3′-UTR. For the pLuc+ARE, the 415 bp of conserved AU-rich fragment was linked to the downstream of luciferase cDNA in pLuc vector (see “Experimental Procedures”). RIE-iRas cells were transfected with either pLuc+3′-UTRΔARE or pLuc+ARE. Stably transfected clones were selected by the treatment with zeocin, pooled, and referred to as RIE-iRas/Luc+3′-UTRΔARE or RIE-iRas/Luc+ARE. IPTG treatment (Ha-Ras induction) of the RIE-iRas/Luc+3′-UTRΔARE cells resulted in a 44% increase in luciferase activity after 24 h (Fig. 6 A) and a 3-fold increase after 72 h (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of the RIE-iRas/Luc+3′-UTRΔARE cells with TGF-β1 alone altered luciferase activity by no more than 27%, and the combination of TGF-β1 and IPTG did not increase the levels over that observed with IPTG alone (Fig. 6,A and B). In contrast, in the RIE-iRas/Luc+ARE cells, IPTG treatment increased luciferase activity 5.4-fold by 24 h (Fig. 6 A) and 7.2-fold by 72 h (Fig. 6 B). TGF-β1 treatment of the RIE-iRas/Luc+ARE cells increased luciferase activity 4.7-fold by 24 h (Fig. 6 A) and 2.9-fold by 72 h (Fig. 6 B) after treatment. Treatment of RIE-iRas/Luc+ARE cells with the combination of IPTG and TGF-β1 increased the luciferase activity 15.7-fold by 24 h (Fig.6 A) and 23-fold by 72 h (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the conserved 415-bp ARE region of the COX-2 3′-UTR appears to be necessary for the synergistic increase in expression caused by the combination of activated Ras and TGF-β1. Numerous studies have suggested that cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis may be involved in intestinal carcinogenesis. COX-2 expression is increased in human colorectal adenocarcinomas when compared with normal adjacent colonic mucosa (1.Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N.

Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar), increases tumor cell invasiveness (43.Tsujii M. Sunao K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). The importance of cyclooxygenase function in colorectal tumorigenesis is further supported by the observations that chronic ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in humans (45.Thun M.J. Namboodiri M.M. Calle E.E. Flanders W.D. Heath C.W.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1322-1327PubMed Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also significantly inhibit colorectal tumorigenesis in animal models (46.Rao C.V. Rivenson A. Simi B. Zang E. Kelloff G. Steele V. Reddy B.S.

Several recent reports have suggested that the formation of this complex may serve additional functions. We have used cDNA arrays to study differential gene expression in response to the interaction of activated FVII (FVIIa) with TF on a human keratinocyte cell line. Of 931 mRNA species observed up to 6 h after FVIIa (10 nm) addition, 24 were significantly up-regulated in what may resemble a wound-type response. Responders included mRNA species coding for transcription regulators (c-fos, egr-1, ETR101,BTEB2, c-myc, fra-1, and tristetraproline), growth factors (amphiregulin, hbEGF, CTGF, and FGF-5), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, LIF, and MIP2α), proteins involved in cellular reorganization/migration (RhoE, uPAR, and collagenases 1 and 3), and others (PAI-2, cyclophilin, GADD45, Jagged1, and prostaglandin E2 receptor). The transcriptional response to FVIIa was abrogated by antibodies to TF and left unaffected by hirudin. The pattern of genes induced suggests that the FVIIa·TF complex may play an active role in early wound repair as well as hemostasis.

Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TF then acts as a cofactor supporting activation of the zymogen serine protease FVII to FVIIa as well as the activity of FVIIa toward its substrates. Once formed, the FVIIa·TF complex triggers activation of zymogen coagulation proteases, which ultimately serve to cleave fibrinogen and generate a fibrin clot. Acting in concert with the accumulation of platelets, this is the main line of protection against blood loss after injury.Recent reports have shown that FVIIa can also induce TF-dependent cellular signaling independent of downstream activation of the coagulation cascade (3.Røttingen J.-A.

We have recently shown (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol.

Here we report the use of cDNA expression arrays to look for further differential gene expression resulting from FVIIa binding to TF on HaCaT cells. Importantly, the concentration of FVIIa used (10 nm) corresponds to the plasma concentration of zymogen FVII (10.Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the FVIIa·TF complex induces signaling via three different MAPKs (6.Camerer E.

Several of these genes are involved in the earliest steps of the wound reaction and may also mediate other effects ascribed to TF on tumor development and metastasis.DISCUSSIONCellular activation by FVIIa binding to TF was first described in the form of Ca2+ signaling in endothelial cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (3.Røttingen J.-A.

We have recently found the EC50 for FVIIa-induced up-regulation of the immediate early gene egr-1 (3 nm) to be an order of magnitude lower than for triggering a Ca2+response in the same cells (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol.

Lund-Hansen T. Paborsky L. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9980-9988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling requires a yet unidentified, transducing component and does not occur via TF itself. It is clearly independent of downstream formation of thrombin (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Studies examining effects of FVIIa·TF signaling on gene transcription reported induction of four different genes in three different cell types (fibroblast, colon cancer, and keratinocyte). Three of these genes (vascular endothelial growth factor (11.Ollivier V. Bentolila S. Chabbat J. Hakim J. de Prost D. Blood. 1998; 91: 2698-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), uPAR (12.Taniguchi T. Kakkar A.K. Tuddenham E.G.D. Williamson R.C.N. Lemoine N.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4461-4467PubMed Google Scholar), and egr-1 (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) were identified studying candidate genes, and a more general differential display approach led to the report of only one gene product (poly(A) polymerase) (13.Pendurthi U.R. Alok D. Rao L.V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12598-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These reports did not reveal any pattern that might suggest a physiological function of FVIIa·TF signaling. We have taken an expanded candidate approach to identify gene targets for FVIIa-induced signaling in cells known to be responsive to the protease. All 931 genes were studied over a period of 6 h, and all strong responders were included in further analyses. Supporting the value of this screen was the fact that we picked up two of the four genes previously reported to be induced by FVIIa (uPAR andegr-1). The genes induced were all classifiable as immediate early response genes based on the effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The pattern of gene induction observed shows great likeness to a wound-type response (16.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar). This may provide a good starting point for looking at FVIIa·TF signaling in vivo.Not much is known about regulation of transcription in response to epithelial wounding. Egr-1 and c-Fos are two factors suggested to be active (16.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar, 17.Pawar S. Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18.Dieckgraefe B.K. Weems D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G322-G330PubMed Google Scholar). We show up-regulation of c-fos, ETR101, and TTP mRNA in response to FVIIa, with rapid and transient kinetics almost identical to those recently reported for the egr-1gene product (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Three other transcription regulator genes, c-myc, BTEB2, and fra-1, were induced somewhat later, peaking at 1.5 h after FVIIa addition. c-myc is induced in migrating renal epithelial cells after wounding (17.Pawar S. Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the c-Myc protein has been implicated in growth factor-induced migration (19.Koster R.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The fra-1 gene codes for a c-Fos homologue, which also heterodimerizes with Jun but lacks a transactivating domain (21.Wisdon R. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7429-7438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may act as a repressor when binding to AP-1 recognition sites in complex with Jun (22.Yoshioka K. Deng T. Cavigelli M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4972-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Expression of transfected fra-1 in epithelioid cells induced motility and invasiveness in vitro (23.Kustikova O. Kramerov D. Grigorian M. Berezin V. Bock E. Lukanidin E. Tulchinsky E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7095-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).The induction of genes coding for growth factors (hbEGF, AR, CTGF, and FGF-5) and proinflammatory cytokines (LIF, IL-8, MIP2α, and IL-1β) had similar kinetics to the two late transcription factors Fra-1 and c-Myc. Growth factors of the EGF family are thought to be key regulators of keratinocyte proliferation at the wound edge (16.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar). Two members of this family (hbEGF and AR) were induced by FVIIa. hbEGF is found in wound fluids and is a powerful mitogen and chemotactic factor for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and keratinocytes, acting on the EGF receptor (24.Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 133: 179-199Google Scholar). AR is also a heparin-binding EGF receptor ligand; both are thought to be important for autocrine-driven keratinocyte proliferation (25.Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CTGF and the fibroblast mitogen FGF-5 promote growth of connective tissue and angiogenesis (26.Zahn X. Bates B. Hu X. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27.Giordano F.J. Ping P. McKirnan M.D. Nozaki S. DeMaria A.N. Dillmann W.H. Mathieu-Costello O.

Like the EGF ligands, CTGF is induced during wound repair (17.Pawar S. Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30.Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). LIF is a member of the IL-6 family of neuropoetic cytokines that exert similar effects on a variety of tissues through binding to receptor complexes that all contain the transducing subunit gp130 (31.Patterson P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7833-7835Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). IL-8 and MIP2α are two closely related CXC chemokines that both act on IL-8 receptors (32.Vita M. Lefort S. Brouillaud M.J. Magazin M. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1993; 4: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar). Together with IL-1β these are major proinflammatory cytokines commonly induced during trauma, which may act on a wide variety of cells.Several of the genes induced by FVIIa code for proteins related to cellular reorganization or migration. RhoE is a member of the Rho GTPase family, which is known to be involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. RhoE induces cell spreading when injected into macrophages or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, suggesting a role in cell migration (33.Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Jagged1 is a membrane-bound ligand for the developmentally important Notch transmembrane receptor, which acts in intercellular communication (34.Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The uPAR is expressed at the leading edge during keratinocyte re-epithelialization of mouse skin wounds (35.Rømer J. Lund L.R. Eriksen J. Pyke C. Kristensen P. Danø K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 192: 519-522Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The uPAR·uPA complex activates plasminogen. The resulting plasmin may both activate various metalloproteases and lyse the fibrin clot. It is indispensable for wound healing (36.Rømer J. Bugge T.H. Pyke C. Lund L.R. Flick M.J. Degen J.L. Danø K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling plasmin-mediated proteolysis, the uPA·uPAR complex has been suggested to act directly in cell adhesion to vitronectin (37.Chang A.W. Kuo A. Barnathan E.S. Okada S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1855-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Also a member of the fibrinolytic system, and probably the main regulator of pericellular uPA activity in keratinocytes (38.Reinartz J. Schaefer B. Bechtel M.J. Kramer M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), is PAI-2, which was strongly induced by formation of the FVIIa·TF complex. PAI-2 can associate with fibrin to inhibit uPA-mediated fibrin clot lysis (39.Ritchie H. Robbie L.A. Kinghorn S. Exley R. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To induce PAI-2 at the same time as uPAR is probably essential to prevent lysis of the fibrin clot in the initial phase of wound healing, prior to closure of the epithelial layer. Collagenases 1 and 3 preferentially degrade collagen type III and II, respectively (40.Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Knauper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Collagenase 1 also supports migration of keratinocytes on type I collagen (42.Pilcher B.K. Dumin J.A. Sudbeck B.D. Krane S.M. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). They can both degrade various other structural proteins and activate other metalloproteases and are likely to be active in keratinocyte migration during wound healing (40.Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Knauper V. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The PGE2R EP2 subtype is one of a family of four receptors for PGE2, which is functionally coupled to an increase in cyclic AMP (43.Bastein L. Sawyer N. Grygorzyk R. Metters K.M. Adam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 has numerous functions in immunosupression, vasodilation, and wound healing and is likely to be present in an inflammatory setting such as in a wound. TTP is a zinc finger protein that binds AU-rich elements and is involved in RNA destabilization (44.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and cyclophilin is a peptidyl-prolylcis-transisomerase, an intracellular binding protein for cyclosporin A (45.Gothel S. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and is possibly also involved in mRNA processing. GADD45 is one of five growth arrest and stress/damage-inducible genes (46.Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo I.J. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 47.Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar).In an epidermal wound scenario (16.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar), the genes we have identified that respond to formation of the FVIIa·TF complex on HaCaT cells all appear to fit different parts of a reparative response. Moreover, a number of the genes or their respective protein products have been demonstrated to be up-regulated in various models of epithelial and endothelial wounding (see above). The FVIIa·TF interaction would occur immediately upon wounding, and FVIIa·TF might thus provide a very early signal in this process.A potentially important consequence of our findings is the possible contribution of a FVIIa·TF-induced transcriptional response to disease states associated with aberrant TF expression (48.Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A.C. Peer G. Li A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Taubman M.B. Fallon J. Schecter A.D. Giesen P. Mendlowitz M. Fyfe B. Marmur J.D. Nemerson Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 88: 200-204Google Scholar, 50.Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).In vivo studies of FVIIa·TF signaling and its contribution to such conditions are complicated by the fact that TF exposure will usually be coupled to both thrombin generation and platelet activation, where release of growth factors and cytokines from the platelets and direct actions of thrombin are hard to distinguish from the direct actions of FVIIa·TF. Moreover, yet another function for TF has recently been described in cell adhesion (51.Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most compelling observation suggesting that FVIIa·TF signaling may be active in vivo comes from studies of the effects of specific inhibitors of different components of the coagulation cascade on the outcome of Escherichia coli-induced sepsis in baboons (48.Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A.C. Peer G. Li A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition downstream of the FVIIa·TF complex would inhibit the coagulopathic response to E. coli without inhibiting lethality, whereas direct inhibition of FVIIa·TF would inhibit both, suggesting a direct role for FVIIa·TF in the lethal response (48.Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A.C. Peer G. Li A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by the cytokine release patterns, which showed a late response in IL-6 and IL-8, apparently attributable to a direct effect of TF and/or FVIIa (48.Taylor Jr., F.B. Chang A.C. Peer G. Li A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus intriguing to observe that FVIIa·TF signaling can lead to induction of LIF, IL-8, and IL-1β, which are three of the main cytokines induced during sepsis. We are currently looking into whether these are also induced by FVIIa in endotoxin-treated endothelial cells or monocytes. TF protein is accumulated in atherosclerotic plaques and is clearly central in plaque thrombogenicity (49.Taubman M.B. Fallon J. Schecter A.D. Giesen P. Mendlowitz M. Fyfe B. Marmur J.D. Nemerson Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 88: 200-204Google Scholar), although its significance in atherogenesis is not known. FVIIai or the TF pathway inhibitor have been demonstrated to markedly attenuate stenosis induced by balloon injury (49.Taubman M.B. Fallon J. Schecter A.D. Giesen P. Mendlowitz M. Fyfe B. Marmur J.D. Nemerson Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 88: 200-204Google Scholar, 52.Jang Y. Guzman L.A. Lincoff A.M. Gottsauner-Wolf M. Forudi F. Hart C.E. Courtman D.W. Ezban M. Ellis S.G. Topol E.J. Circulation. 1995; 92: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In a recent study, FVIIa and recombinant full-length TF together, but not independently, were shown to induce vascular smooth muscle cell migration in vitro (53.Sato Y. Asada Y. Marutsuka K. Hatakeyama K. Kamikubo Y. Sumiyoshi A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TF is expressed in various malignant tumors (54.Rao L.V.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 249-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and may promote tumor angiogenesis and hematogeneous metastasis (50.Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 55.Zang Y. Deng Y. Luther T. Mueller M. Ziegler R. Waldherr R. Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin.

Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Induction of growth factors, several of which have been implicated in angiogenesis (FGF-5, CTGF, and VEGF) and associated with atherosclerosis (CTGF and hbEGF), cytokines, metalloproteases, and other proteins (such as uPAR and c-myc) by FVIIa·TF signaling, may be important in some or all of these settings.In conclusion, we describe in this study the induction of a number of genes secondary to FVIIa binding to TF on keratinocytes. At least two of the three MAPK pathways activated (6.Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) by the formation of this complex are involved in the signaling. The pattern of genes induced may suggest a role for FVIIa·TF signaling in wound repair, and the ability of FVIIa·TF to induce these genes adds a level of complexity to many of the physiological and pathophysiological settings where FVIIa will be allowed to interact with TF. The studies need to be expanded to other cells and in vivo models to understand the importance and extent of FVIIa·TF signaling. Tissue factor (TF)1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is constitutively expressed at high levels in tissues surrounding inner and outer bodily surfaces but not in cells that are in direct contact with blood (1.Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Disruption of these boundaries or induction of TF synthesis in monocytes (2.Rivers R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2079493210,"NFκB is an essential survival factor in several physiological conditions such as embryonal liver development and liver regeneration. However, NFκB is also a main mediator of the cellular response to a variety of extracellular stress stimuli, and it has been shown that some viral-induced host cell apoptosis appears to be dependent on NFκB activation. The activation of NFκB upon viral infection may be a rapid way of initiating an innate immune response against the viral particles. We have assessed the role of NFkB during the early phase of adenoviral hepatitis in a nude mouse model using an adenoviral vector expressing a mutant form of IκBα. Administration of a LacZ-expressing adenoviral vector induces NFkB DNA and correlates with the up-regulation of Fas (CD95) mRNA, but not FasL (CD95L) mRNA, during the early phase of adenoviral hepatitis. The rapid increase in NFκB DNA binding after adenoviral infection of the liver could be very effectively inhibited by IκBα. Compared with the LacZ control virus, the IκBα-expressing adenoviral vector inhibits the increase of Fas (CD95) mRNA expression, in particular in the very early phase of the hepatitis. Reporter gene experiments in hepatoma cell lines with a Fas promoter-luciferase construct indicated that the repression of Fas (CD95) mRNA by IκBα was transcriptionally mediated. The functional relevance of the NFκB-dependent increase in Fas (CD95) transcription was assessed by caspase 3 assays and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling tests. Compared with the control, IκBα adenoviral infection resulted in reduced caspase 3 activity during the early phase of viral hepatitis and in a prevention of liver cell apoptosis 24 h after adenoviral administration. Therefore our study demonstrates a new pro-apoptotic function of NFκB in Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes. Interestingly, NFκB mediates liver cell apoptosis upon viral infection even in a phase where tumor necrosis factor-α is already induced, as shown by the time curves of tumor necrosis factor-α serum levels. Therefore, the pro- or anti-apoptotic role of NFκB appears to be more determined by the nature of the death stimulus than by the origin of the tissue.

Although these vectors are widely used for liver gene therapy, adenovirus-mediated toxicity has to be considered. Application of high titer first generation adenoviral vectors in mice elicits a stress response in hepatocytes and may result in severe hepatitis and hepatic failure (4.Gao G.G. Yang Y. Wilson J.M.

Viral protein expression further contributes to an innate and specific immune response, leading to the elimination of transduced cells. One of the molecular mechanisms of this elimination was attributed to T-lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis of transduced cells involving the Fas (CD95) and the perforin/granzyme pathway (7.Yang X.Z.

Apoptosis is a highly conserved physiological process important in normal development and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms. In addition, the molecular mechanisms of cell suicide are necessary for maintaining the integrity of the genome and for the defense of microorganisms. In normal as well as in transformed cells, signals released from the cytoplasm and/or from the cell membrane can trigger suicide pathways, leading to the activation of caspase (cysteine aspartase) cascades, which execute apoptotic cell death (for review, see Refs. 17.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 18.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 19.Evan G.

Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). One central molecule in the control of apoptosis induced by loss of cellular integrity is the transcription factor p53. A variety of different stimuli, which are recognized as “danger signals” by the cell, can activate the latent transcription factor p53 and in turn cause apoptosis by transcriptional (for review, see Ref. 22.El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and nontranscriptional mechanisms (23.Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In contrast to the general “guardian of the genome” p53, different membrane molecules known as death receptors regulate the cell suicide machinery instructively in development, tissue homeostasis, and immune defense (for review, see Refs. 18.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 24.Nagata S.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The evolution of these death receptors enables the organism actively to direct individual cells to suicide. These receptors can activate caspases within seconds of ligand binding, causing cell suicide within hours. Death receptors are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1receptor gene superfamily and contain cysteine-rich extracellular domains and homologous cytoplasmatic sequences termed death domains. Among the members of this family, an important role in the apoptosis of hepatocytes has been demonstrated for TNFR1 and Fas (CD95). The mechanisms of TNFα-mediated apoptosis in liver failure have been studied in several animal models (26.Tiegs G. Hentschel J. Wendel A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 27.Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kündig T.M. Wakeha A. Kishiara K. Shahinian A. Wiegman K. Ohashi P.S. Krönke M. Mak T.W.

Most of the physiological activities of TNFα including apoptosis, antiviral activity, and NFκB activation are mediated by TNFR1. After TNFα ligation, TRADD is efficiently bound to TNFR1, where it then serves to recruit the death domain protein FADD as well as the RING domain adaptor protein TRAF2. FADD binding is necessary for procaspase 8 cleavage, the beginning of the caspase cascade activation. In contrast to TNFR1, Fas (CD95) binds FADD via direct interaction between the death domains. Thus, Fas and TNFR1 use FADD as a common signal transducer and share the signaling machinery downstream of caspase 8. Primary murine and human hepatocytes have been demonstrated to be very sensitive for Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis (31.Ni R. Tomita Y. Matsuda K. Ichihara A. Ishimura K. Ogasawara J. Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Galle P.R. Hofmann W.J. Walczak H. Schaller H. Otto G. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Runkel L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Mice injected intraperitoneally with agonistic Fas (CD95) antibody rapidly developed acute liver failure and died within hours (33.Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunnaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Several studies in humans showed that apoptosis of hepatocytes in Wilson's disease, toxic liver damage and viral hepatitis is triggered through the Fas (CD95) pathway (32.Galle P.R. Hofmann W.J.

However, in contrast to Fas (CD95), TNFR1 is a strong inducer of NFkB. NFkB activation through the TNFR1 is, at least in part, mediated by TRAF2. Signals from TRAF2 result in phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and subsequent translocation of NFkB into the nucleus. The activation NFκB appears to be a very strong antiapoptotic signal in the TNF1 pathway (35.Antwerp D.J.V. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 36.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 37.Liu Z.G. Hsu H.

It has been demonstrated that the activity of NFkB prevents TNFα-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes during normal liver regeneration (39.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and during embryonic liver development (40.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S.

Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). However, our results show that NFkB is activated at early stages in the early time course during adenoviral hepatitis and up-regulates the Fas (CD95) receptor by transcriptional mechanisms. Therefore, in contrast to the anti-apoptotic activity of NFkB in TNFα-induced liver damage, our results define a new pro-apoptotic role for NFkB in mediating Fas (CD95)-dependent apoptosis of hepatocytes. The human hepatoma cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 and the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Glutamax, Life Technologies, Inc., supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.)), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The plasmid pFLF 1 used for luciferase assays was a pGV-B vector containing a luciferase reporter gene driven by the −1435 base pair/+236 base pair region of the human Fas (CD95) gene. The plasmid pFLF 1 was kindly provided by Dr. Nakanishi, Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan. The adenoviral vectors Ad5-CMVLacZ and Ad5-CMVIκBα were kindly provided by Dr. D. Brenner, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC (39.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To generate high titer viral stocks, 2 × 108 293 packaging cells at 90% confluency were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 pfu/cell. The infected cells were grown for 3–5 days until a strong cytopathic effect could be observed and about 50% cells were detached. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, and viral particles were released by 4 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and rapid thawing at 37 °C. For further purification, the virus preparation was subjected to a 2-fold CsCl banding. CsCl banding and determination of infectivity by viral plaquing were performed according to standard protocols as described previously (42.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Endotoxin contamination was monitored by the LAL-test kit (Chromogenix), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. All virus preparations used for infection experiments and luciferase assays were lipopolysaccharide-free. Virus preparations were stored at −20 °C in 25% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2. 6 × 105 Huh7 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of pFLF1 using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and an overnight incubation at 3% CO2and 35 °C. After transfection, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for at least 4 h. The cells were then infected with Ad5-CMVLacZ and Ad5-CMVIκBα at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. The adenoviral infection was repeated every 4 h. Cell layers were harvested at the indicated time points following the initial infection. Cellular extracts were obtained according to standard procedures (43.Kubicka S. Kühnel F. Zender L. Rudolph K.L. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 32137-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and measured for luciferase activity using a Berthold Lumat LB9501. Luciferase activity was normalized against the protein concentration, determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Pathogen-free male NMRI-nu/nu mice (age 6–8 weeks) were obtained from the Animal Research Institute of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. All experiments were performed in agreement with the German legal requirements. For infection experiments, viruses Ad5-CMVLacZ and Ad5-CMVIκBα were prepared, purified, and titered as described above. Before infection, the virus was dialyzed twice against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 140 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Infection of the mice was carried out by administration of 0.25 ml of virus solution into the tail vein at a total virus load of 1 × 108 pfu/g of body weight, calculated for about 80% transduction of liver hepatocytes. The reliability of the infection in vivo was controlled by X-gal-stained liver sections of Ad5-CMVLacZ-infected mice. At the time points indicated in the figure legends, the mice were sacrificed, and the livers were harvested for the preparation of nuclear extracts, RNA preparations, and cryosections (see below). Nuclear extracts were isolated from mouse liver as described by Lichtsteiner and Schiebler (44.Lichtsteiner T. Schiebler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiments, nuclear extracts from liver tissue or hepatoma cell lines were used. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were prepared using the Dignam C method as described before (43.Kubicka S. Kühnel F. Zender L. Rudolph K.L. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 32137-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiments were performed using nuclear extracts as indicated and 1 ng of end-labeled DNA. The NFκB site (′5-TAG-TTG-AGG-GGA-CTT-TCC-CAG-GCA-3′) was used as the cognate DNA binding sequence for NFκB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Supershift experiments were performed with antibodies directed against p50 and p65 (NFκB p65 (A) sc-109 and NFκB p50 (NLS) sc-114x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures. Total RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 15 μg of total RNA was analyzed by separation on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, followed by transfer to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mouse Fas (CD95), the mouse FasL (CD95), and the β-actin cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]ATP according to random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Freshly harvested liver tissue was subjected to a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin at a w/v ratio of 1:3. For preparing a cytosolic extract, the tissue was then homogenized on ice with a few strokes in a Elvehjem homogenizer and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 10 min (4 °C). The supernatant was subjected to caspase measurements using the CaspACETM assay system (Promega). The assay was performed following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. TNFα was measured in blood serum of infected mice at time points indicated in the figure legend. Serum samples were obtained by punctuation of the mouse heart and a subsequent 5-min centrifugation at 6000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge. TNFα concentration was determined using the QuantikineTM M mouse TNFα immunoassay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Liver tissue of infected mice was embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura, Netherlands) and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at −80 °C. 7-μm sections were prepared and fixed in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde solution (4%) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by covering the sections with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were again washed with phosphate-buffered saline and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling-stained with the in Situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche), following the manufacturer's protocol. Since it has been demonstrated that Fas plays an important role in human viral hepatitis, we used a mouse model of adenoviral hepatitis to explore the contribution of the Fas pathway in hepatocytes during the early time course of virus-mediated acute liver failure. The aim was to investigate the early molecular mechanisms in hepatocytes that were triggered through viral infection and, in turn, mediate apoptotic cell death. Therefore, to rule out immunological influences, we used nude mice for our experiments. In vivo infection of mouse liver with recombinant adenovirus was performed by the administration of 0.3 ml of a solution containing 1 × 109 pfu/g into the tail vein. X-gal staining of a specimen of the liver demonstrated that approximately 80% of the hepatocytes are infected with viral particles (43.Kubicka S. Kühnel F. Zender L. Rudolph K.L. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 32137-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points after viral infection, and the livers were harvested for isolation of nuclear extracts and total RNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated an up-regulation of Fas (CD95) mRNA at early stages of the hepatitis with a maximum at 8 h after adenoviral administration (Fig.1 A). One transcription factor that is known to be activated in many cell types through viral infection and may therefore mediate the increase of Fas (CD95) mRNA in virus-infected liver is NFκB. To investigate the activation of NFκB in the mouse liver, we performed gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts and a consensus NFκB DNA binding site. These experiments showed a rapid activation of NFκB DNA binding activity with a maximum at 8 h after adenovirus administration (Fig.1 B). In the promoters of Fas (CD95) as well as FasL (CD95L), NFkB binding sites have been described that seem to be functionally relevant during cytokine stimulation, oxidative stress, or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in distinct cell types, particularly in T-cells (45.Kimura K.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether NFκB may be involved in the regulation of the Fas pathway in the liver during the early time course of adenoviral hepatitis, we used an adenoviral vector expressing the super-repressor form of IκBα (39.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The IκBα super repressor is a nondegradable mutant of IκBα. To determine if the IκBα adenovirus was effective in inhibiting NFκB at early time points after infection, we harvested the liver of mice 4 h after the administration of 1 × 109 pfu/g of adenoviral particles into the tail vein and performed gel shift experiments with nuclear extracts and NFκB binding sites. As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, the IκBα super repressor inhibited the activation of NFκB after adenoviral liver infection. Next we determined whether the IκBα-encoding adenovirus would have an influence on mRNA expression of the Fas (CD95) and the FasL (CD95L) after liver infection. As demonstrated by Northern blot analysis, up-regulation of Fas (CD95) mRNA could be very efficiently repressed through the IκBα adenovirus vector, in particular, in the very early time course of the infection (Fig.2 B). However, we found no adenovirus-mediated up-regulation of the FasL (CD95L) mRNA, and in contrast to Fas (CD95), the IκBα super repressor did not reduce the expression level of FasL (CD95L) mRNA in the infected livers (Fig. 2 C). To assess whether the decrease of Fas (CD95) mRNA expression level was transcriptionally mediated through the Fas promoter, we transiently transfected a reporter plasmid with a luciferase gene linked to the human Fas promoter in Huh7 hepatoma cells. 4 h after transfection, the cells were infected with adenovirus lacZ or IκBα adenovirus. Cells were harvested at several time points after virus infection. As shown in Fig. 2 D the Fas-promoter was strongly activated following adenoviral infection. Furthermore, the transactivation could be significantly repressed by the IκBα super repressor, which indicates that, at least in part, the activation of Fas (CD95) mRNA in the early time course of adenoviral hepatitis was transcriptionally mediated by NFκB. In conclusion with the results obtained by Northern blot analysis, the transcriptional repression mediated through the iκBα super repressor was only evident at early time points (i.e. <16 h) after adenoviral infection (Fig.2 B). However, at later time points after adenoviral administration, we observed an enhanced Fas (CD95) mRNA expression using the IκBα adenovirus compared with the LacZ control adenovirus (Fig. 2 B). Since the maximum of the Fas (CD95) activation occurs at 8 h post-infection, the physiological relevance and the molecular explanation of the IκBα-mediated counter regulation at late time points, where much lower Fas (CD95) mRNA is expressed, remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that Fas (CD95) mRNA is transcriptionally activated in the liver by NFκB during the early time course of adenoviral hepatitis. However, other factors might contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the Fas (CD95) promoter observed at later stages of liver damage. Since we revealed a strong inhibition of Fas (CD95) mRNA transcription by the IκBα super repressor in the early phase of the adenovirus-mediated stress response but an enhanced transcriptional activation of Fas (CD95) at later time points, we next investigated the effect of the iκBα adenovirus on liver cell apoptosis compared with the LacZ adenoviral vector. The apoptotic signal triggered by ligation of the Fas (CD95) death receptor is very rapidly promoted through sequential activation of caspases. Caspase 3, 6, and 7 are involved in the execution of apoptosis in response to many stimuli, including ligation"
https://openalex.org/W2083885997,"Photosystem II core dimers (450 kDa) and monomers (230 kDa) consisting of CP47, CP43, the D1 and D2 proteins, the extrinsic 33-kDa subunit, and the low molecular weight polypeptides PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbI, PsbK, PsbL, PsbTc, and PsbW were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The photosystem II core dimers were treated with phospholipase A2 (PL-A2), which cuts phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine molecules at the<i>sn</i>-2 position. The PL-A2-treated dimers dissociated into two core monomers and further, yielding a CP47-D1-D2 subcomplex and CP43. Thin layer chromatography showed that photosystem II dimers contained four times more PG than their monomeric counterparts but with similar levels of phosphatidylcholine. Consistent with this was the finding that, compared with monomers, the dimers contained a higher level of trans-hexadecanoic fatty acid (C16:1Δ3tr), which is specific to PG of the thylakoid membrane. Moreover, treatment of dimers with PL-A2 increased the free level of this fatty acid specific to PG compared with untreated dimers. Further evidence that PG is involved in stabilizing the dimeric state of photosystem II comes from reconstitution experiments. Using size exclusion chromatography, it was shown that PG containing C16:1Δ3tr, but not other lipid classes, induced significant dimerization of isolated photosystem II monomers. Moreover, this dimerization was observed by electron crystallography when monomers were reconstituted into thylakoid lipids containing PG. The unit cell parameters, p2 symmetry axis, and projection map of the reconstituted dimer was similar to that observed for two-dimensional crystals of the native dimer."
https://openalex.org/W2074215405,"We investigated the mechanism of endothelin receptor type A (ETA) internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells using two assays; flow cytometric quantification of cell surface myc-ETA and in situ localization of Cy5-labeled ET-1. In both assays, agonist-dependent internalization of myc-ETA was inhibited by nystatin and filipin, both of which disrupt internalization via caveolae, whereas it was barely affected by chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose, both of which disrupt internalization via clathrin-coated pits. In addition to myc-ETA, ET-1 caused intracellular translocation of caveolin-1 and this translocation was also blocked by nystatin but not by chlorpromazine. These results strongly argue that ETA is internalized via caveolae but not clathrin-coated pits. Treatment of the cells with cholesterol oxidase reduced cellular cholesterol and caused intracellular translocation of caveolin-1 but did not affect cell surface localization of myc-ETA. In cholesterol oxidase-treated cells, however, both chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose effectively blocked ET-1-induced myc-ETA internalization and nystatin was less effective than in untreated cells. Accordingly, expression of a dominant negative form of β-arrestin blocked myc-ETA internalization in cholesterol oxidase-treated cells but not in untreated cells. These results suggest that, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, 1) agonist-occupied ETA can be internalized either via caveolae or clathrin-coated pits; 2) of the two, the former is the default pathway; and 3) the oxidative state of cell surface cholesterol is one of the factors involved in the pathway selection.

The molecular mechanism for sequestration of agonist-occupied GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits has been best studied for β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) (2.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 5.Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In brief, upon binding of an agonist, β2AR is phosphorylated by a GPCR kinase (GRK) and the phosphorylated receptors bind β-arrestin, which then targets the receptors to clathrin-coated pits. Various GPCRs other than β2AR have been shown to be phosphorylated by GRK and thought to be targeted to clathrin-coated pits in a similar manner (6.Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P.

Caveolae are small flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, characterized by high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and also by the presence of caveolin, a 20–24-kDa integral membrane protein (2.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 3.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Although much less is known about the molecular mechanism involved, sequestration of agonist-occupied GPCRs to this microdomain has been demonstrated both by morphological and biochemical methods. For example, electron microscopic studies showed that both agonist-occupied β2AR and bradykinin B2 receptors were localized in caveolae (10.Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg D. Benedetti E.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K.

For other GPCRs such as angiotensin II type 1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, agonist-dependent sequestration in this microdomain was demonstrated by the recovery of receptor proteins in caveolin-rich fractions (13.de Weerd W.F.C.

Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Apart from the molecular mechanisms involved in the individual internalization pathways, the presence of the two distinct pathways raises a problem of pathway selection, at least for some types of GPCRs. A typical example is again β2AR; some types of cells internalize agonist-occupied β2AR via clathrin-coated pits (2.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 5.Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and others via caveolae (10.Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg D. Benedetti E.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and it remains unknown how the distinct pathway is utilized in the individual cell type. The endothelins (ETs) have a wide variety of biological effects in various tissues and cell types, which are mediated by specific GPCR subtypes, ETA and ETB (17.Masaki T. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Like other GPCRs, agonist-occupied ET receptors are rapidly internalized and the same problem of pathway selection can be addressed at least for ETA, because previous studies have provided evidence both for the clathrin-coated pits and caveolae as an internalization pathway of this receptor subtype. ETA can be phosphorylated by a subtype of GRK (18.Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when expressed in COS cells, ETA colocalizes with caveolin-1 on the cell surface and binds caveolin-1 either in a direct or indirect way (19.Chun M. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unknown whether ETA can be internalized both via caveolae and clathrin-coated pits in a given cell type, or alternatively, the internalization pathway may differ between the cell types. To address the question of pathway selection, we asked whether ETA is internalized via clathrin-coated pits and/or caveolae in CHO cells. CHO cells were used because of the presence of both internalization pathways (20.Ishii I. Saito E. Izumi T. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and also because of our previous characterization of agonist binding and signaling of ETA expressed in this cell type (21.Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By applying both pharmacological and molecular manipulations to selectively disrupt the internalization pathways, we found that the internalization pathway of agonist-occupied ETA can be switched from caveolae to clathrin-coated pits by oxidation of cell surface cholesterol. LipofectAMINE and blasticidin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan); synthetic human ET-1 and BQ123 were from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan); Cy5 reactive dye pack, Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Cy2-avidin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK); 125I-transferrin (260 GBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products (Tokyo, Japan); mouse monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ETA was kindly provided by Drs. S. Hori and M. Takimoto (Takarazuka Research Institute, Novartis Pharma K. K., Takarazuka, Japan); nystatin, filipin, chlorpromazine, cholesterol, and 4-cholesten-3-one (cholestenone) was from Sigma; cholesterol oxidase (Nocardia erythropolis) was from Wako (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. For epitope-tagging of ETA, a double-strand oligonucleotide that encodes a myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted in frame by PCR between nucleotides 69 and 70 (amino acids 23 and 24) of the human ETA cDNA (22.Hosoda K. Nakao K. Arai H. Suga S. Ogawa Y. Mukoyama M. Shirakami G. Saito Y. Nakanishi S. Imura H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The insertion site was chosen to place the epitope at the N terminus of expressed receptors without interfering with signal peptide cleavage between amino acids 21 and 22. The myc-tagged ETA cDNA was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pME18Sf to give pME/myc-ETA (23.Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa Y. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-oka T. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8547-8553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the insertion was verified by direct sequencing. A cDNA fragment that corresponds to amino acids 319–418 of human β-arrestin (24.Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was obtained from a brain cDNA library using PCR. The PCR primers were designed to place a methionine residue on the N terminus, and a stop codon on the C terminus of the expressed protein. The PCR product was verified by sequencing and subcloned into pME18Sf to give pME/arrestin-(319–418). CHO cells were routinely maintained in Ham's F-12/10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with pME/myc-ETA together with pSVbsr using LipofectAMINE. Cell populations expressing bsr gene product were selected by blasticidin (10 μg/ml), and clonal cell lines were isolated by colony lifting. The density of receptors expressed in each clone was determined by saturation isotherms of 125I-ET-1 binding to crude membrane preparations as described (21.Takagi Y. Ninomiya H. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10072-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transient expression of pME/arrestin-(319–418) and pEGFP (CLONTECH) was also done with LipofectAMINE. Prior to ET-1 or125I-transferrin application, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Krebs-Hepes buffer (KHB: 140 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 11.7 mmglucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing nystatin (50 μg/ml), filipin (5 μg/ml), chlorpromazine (25 μg/ml), or sucrose (0.4m). Every agent was included in the medium throughout the subsequent incubations. None of them was toxic to the cells at the concentrations used as determined by a lactic dehydrogenase cytotoxic assay (data not shown). Stock solutions of nystatin and filipin were made in Me2SO. Me2SO at the final concentration of 0.1% affected neither the binding nor internalization of ET-1 and125I-transferrin (data not shown). Cells in six-well plates were washed and incubated at 37 °C in KHB containing ET-1 (100 nm) or BQ123 (1 μm). At the indicated time, the cells were rapidly cooled on ice and collected by incubation in PBS, 5 mm EGTA followed by centrifugation. They were stained with anti-myc (4 μg/ml) in PBS, 3% FCS, followed by Cy2-labeled anti-mouse IgG, each at 4 °C for 1 h. They were resuspended in ice-cold PBS, 3% FCS containing propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) and analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co., Mansfield, MA). Cy2 fluorescence was acquired from 5,000–10,000 live cells gated by exclusion of propidium iodide. The specific Cy2 fluorescence was calculated as the difference between the mean fluorescence from cells stained by both primary and secondary antibodies and that from those stained without the primary antibody. ET-1 was labeled with Cy5 using a reactive dye pack (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exactly as described (25.Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21589-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The specificity of Cy5-ET-1 binding to CHO/myc-ETA cells was verified by its absence in native CHO cells and by displacement by unlabeled ET-1 (data not shown). Cells on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were washed with ice-cold KHB and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the same buffer containing 10 nm Cy5-ET-1. To facilitate internalization of the bound ligand, the cells were washed and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. In some experiments, a lysosomal marker dye lysotracker green (1 μm, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was included in the medium at the 37 °C incubation. At the end of the 4 °C or 37 °C incubation, fluorescent images were obtained with a MRC1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Osaka, Japan). Cells in 24-well plates were washed and kept in KHB at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 125I-transferrin (10 nm) and was terminated by rapid cooling of the cells on ice. After washing with ice-cold KHB, the cells were incubated twice in 1 ml of 50 mm glycine (pH 2.5) at 4 °C for 2 min, and the residual radioactivities were recovered in 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH. Radioactivities recovered in glycine (acid-sensitive) and NaOH (acid-resistant) were defined as cell surface and internalized radioactivities, respectively. Nonspecific binding in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled transferrin was always less than 5% of the total radioactivities recovered. Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed and incubated in KHB with or without 2 units/ml cholesterol oxidase at 37 °C for 2 h. Where indicated, 25 μg/ml cholesterol was added simultaneously with the enzyme. Cholesterol was dissolved in ethanol at 10 mg/ml. The vehicle (0.25% ethanol) did not affect the cellular contents of cholesterol or cholestenone (data not shown). To examine the recovery from cholesterol oxidation, a set of dishes were washed with KHB and incubated in F-12, 10% FCS in a CO2 incubator up to 1 h. Extraction of total lipids and TLC analysis were done as described (26.Koike T. Ishida G. Taniguchi M. Higaki K. Ayaki Y. Saito M. Sakakihara Y. Iwamori M. Ohno K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, lipids were extracted from cell pellets in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). After saponification with NaOH, samples were dried under N2, dissolved in chloroform/methanol, and separated on HPTLC Silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The solvent was 100% dichloromethane, which gave the best separation of cholestenone from other lipids in pilot experiments. Pure cholesterol and cholestenone were dissolved in chloroform/methanol and used as standards. Lipids were visualized by charring the plate with CuSO4 and heating at 180 °C. Densitometric analysis was done using NIH Image software. Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions of cell lysate were prepared as described (27.Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In brief, cells in 100-mm dishes were harvested by incubation for 10 min in MES-buffered saline (MBS, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) plus 1 mm EDTA. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of MBS plus 1% Triton X-100, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The samples were Dounce homogenized 20 times and spun for 5 min at 16,000 × g to give a Triton-soluble fraction (supernatant). The pellets were suspended in MBS plus 1% Triton X-100 by sonication to give a Triton-insoluble fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples were dissolved by SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was probed with anti-caveolin-1 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and bound antibody was detected using an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were stained with anti-ETA or anti-caveolin-1 using an indirect fluorescent technique. In brief, cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS, 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 50% ethanol, and incubated in Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Suita, Japan). They were then incubated with anti-ETA (1 μg/ml) or anti-caveolin-1 (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected with a biotinylated secondary antibody and Cy2-avidin, and fluorescent images were obtained with a confocal microscope. Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis of the results. p values of < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Since it has been shown that ET-1/ETA binding is unusually stable and even resistant to acidic conditions (28.Takasuka T. Adachi M. Miyamoto C. Furuichi Y. Watanbe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), conventional internalization assays using 125I-labeled ligand appear inapplicable. To quantify cell surface ETA, we generated a CHO cell line stably expressing an ETA variant that is tagged with a myc epitope on its N-terminal extracellular domain.125I-ET-1 binding to membrane preparations form CHO/myc-ETA revealed an irreversible binding interaction between125I-ET-1 and myc-ETA. The binding was saturable with a binding capacity of 3.2 ± 0.3 pmol/mg protein (mean ± S.E.,n = 3), and a half-maximum binding was obtained at the ligand concentration of 63 ± 4 pm. Signaling activities of both ET-1 and ET-3 on [Ca2+]i and cAMP pathways were indistinguishable between wild type ETA and myc-ETA (data not shown). Anti-myc immunostaining of the cells followed by flow cytometry successfully detected cell surface myc-ETA (Fig.1 a). As expected, exposure to ET-1 caused a leftward shift of the fluorescent peak, which indicates agonist-induced reduction of cell surface receptors (Fig.1 a). This reduction did not occur at 4 °C (data not shown) and was not elicited by an ETA-selective antagonist BQ123 (Fig.1 b), excluding inhibition of anti-myc binding to the epitope by ET-1. Time-dependent determinations showed that, upon ET-1 binding, cell surface myc-ETA decreased within 10 min and reached a plateau at 30 min (Fig. 1 b). As an alternative assay for myc-ETA internalization, we took advantage of the irreversible nature of ET-1/ETA binding and visualized the localization of myc-ETA using fluorescent dye-labeled ET-1 (Fig.2). When CHO/myc-ETA cells were incubated with Cy5-ET-1 at 4 °C for 1 h, Cy5-ET-1 showed a homogeneous distribution on the plasma membrane. Subsequent incubation at 37 °C elicited internalization of the surface-bound ligand, and, after 30 min, the ligand showed a patchy distribution around the nucleus. Anti-ETA immunostaining showed co-localization of Cy5-ET-1 with myc-ETA on the cell surface at 4 °C and in the intracellular compartment at 37 °C, indicating that internalization of cell surface ETA can be followed by Cy5-ET-1. In the cells incubated at 4 °C, anti-ETA also gave clear intracellular staining (Fig. 2, upper panels). Since this antibody recognizes the C terminus of the receptor, this staining is likely to represent ETA being glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus. These “reserve” receptors may be responsible for the anti-ETA staining that does not colocalize with Cy5-ET-1 at the 37 °C incubation (Fig. 2, lower panels). To determine the internalization pathway of myc-ETA, we examined the effects of nystatin and filipin, both of which disrupt internalization via caveolae (29.Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 30.Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), and chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose, both of which disrupt internalization via clathrin-coated pits (32.Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 33.Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12117-12122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). None of these drug treatments altered ET-1 binding capacities of the cells as examined by125I-ET-1 binding assays (data not shown). Quantification of cell surface myc-ETA by flow cytometry showed that ET-1-induced internalization was significantly inhibited both by nystatin and filipin, whereas it was barely affected by chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that myc-ETA is internalized via caveolae but not clathrin-coated pits. In both the case of nystatin and filipin, the inhibition was not complete. Alternative usage of clathrin-coated pits, however, seemed unlikely because simultaneous application of chlorpromazine with nystatin caused no further inhibition (Fig.3 a). The results from Cy5-ET-1 internalization assays were rather more clear-cut; the internalization was almost completely blocked by nystatin but not at all by chlorpromazine (Fig.3 b). As control experiments, we tested the effects of the same treatments on internalization of 125I-transferrin, a ligand internalized via clathrin-coated pits (35.Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 9681-9689Crossref Scopus (896) Google Scholar). As expected,125I-transferrin internalization was effectively inhibited by chlorpromazine and hypertonic sucrose but not by nystatin nor filipin (Fig. 3 c). CHO cells express a relatively high level of caveolin-1 (36.Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). To obtain further evidence for myc-ETA internalization via caveolae, we tested whether it was accompanied by caveolin-1 translocation. Anti-caveolin-1 immunostaining showed that, after the binding of Cy5-ET-1 at 4 °C, caveolin-1 was localized both in the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Fig. 4 a). The intracellular caveolin-1 is likely to reside in the Golgi apparatus (27.Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Subsequent incubation for 30 min at 37 °C caused disappearance of caveolin-1 from the plasma membrane, indicating ET-1-induced intracellular translocation of caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 a). As in the case of myc-ETA, this translocation was blocked by nystatin but not by chlorpromazine (Fig. 4 b). Final destinations of caveolin-1 and ET-1/myc-ETA complexes, however, appeared to be different from each other because, although there was a partial overlap, the intracellular distribution of anti-caveolin-1 immunoreactivity was obviously different from that of Cy5-ET-1 at the end of the 37 °C incubation (Fig. 4 a). The integrity of caveolae appears to be dependent on cell surface cholesterol (3.Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar), and oxidation of caveolar cholesterol translocates caveolin-1 to the Golgi region (27.Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To further delineate the role of caveolae in ETA internalization, we tested the effect of cholesterol oxidase treatment of the cells on ET-1-induced myc-ETA internalization. TLC analyses of total cellular lipids showed that cholesterol oxidase (applied at 2 units/ml for 2 h) caused an obvious decrease in the level of cholesterol and generation of cholestenone, an oxidation product of cholesterol (Fig. 5,a and b). Neither effects were observed when the enzyme was inactivated with Triton X-100 (38.Pollegioni L. Gadda G. Ambrosius D. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar) prior to application (data not shown). Simultaneous addition of free cholesterol (25 μg/ml) with the enzyme partially blocked the reduction of cellular cholesterol but did not affect the generation of cholestenone. The effects of the enzyme were reversible; the cholesterol content returned to a normal level and cholestenone disappeared within 1 h after removal of the enzyme and incubation in F12/10% FCS (serum chase, Fig.5, a and b). Anti-caveolin-1 Western blotting showed that, as reported for primary-cultured fibroblasts (27.Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), cholesterol oxidase treatment caused translocation of caveolin-1 from a Triton-insoluble fraction to a soluble fraction (Fig. 5 c). In accordance, immunostaining showed intracellular accumulation of caveolin-1 in cholesterol oxidase-treated cells (Fig. 5 d). Both Western blotting and cell staining showed that this translocation was blocked by simultaneous addition of free cholesterol. As in the case of the effects on cellular lipids, the translocation was reversible; caveolin-1 disappeared from the Triton-soluble fraction within 1 h of serum chase (Fig. 5 c), and the intracellular accumulation disappeared within the same time range (Fig.5 d). Cholesterol oxidase treatment did not affect the 125I-ET-1 binding capacity of the cells (data not shown). Anti-myc flow cytometry showed that, in the enzyme-treated cells, ETA was still internalized upon binding of ET-1. In contrast to that in untreated cells (Fig.3 b); however, myc-ETA internalization was significantly inhibited both by chlo"

Cardiovascular helix-loop-helix factor 1 (CHF1) is distantly related to the hairy family of transcriptional repressors. We analyzed its expression pattern during mouse embryo development. At day 8.5, the expression of CHF1 is first detected in the primitive ventricle of the primordial heart tube and persists throughout gestation. In rat hearts, this expression is down-regulated after birth, concurrent with terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes. In the developing vasculature, CHF1 first appears in the dorsal aorta at day 9.0, which precedes the reported expression of smooth muscle cell markers, and persists into adulthood. In an in vitro system of smooth muscle cell differentiation, CHF1 mRNA was barely detectable in undifferentiated cells but was induced highly in differentiated smooth muscle cells. To determine whether CHF1 might affect the function of ARNT, we performed transfection studies. Co-transfection of CHF1 inhibited ARNT/EPAS1-dependent transcription by 85%, and this inhibition is dose-dependent. In electrophoretic mobility studies, CHF1 inhibited the binding of the ARNT/EPAS1 heterodimer to its target site. Our data suggest that CHF1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and may play an important role in cardiovascular development.

However, the present picture is incomplete, particularly with regard to transcriptional control of smooth muscle differentiation in the developing vasculature. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 proteins have been implicated in control of lineage commitment and differentiation in several cell types such as neurons, B cells, and skeletal muscle cells (9.Bain G. Engel I. Robanus Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P. Voland J.R. Sharp L.L. Chun J. Huey B. Pinkel D. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Ma Q. Kintner C.

Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle cells, the best studied proteins are the muscle regulatory factors such as MyoD and myogenin, which serve as nodal regulators for myogenesis by turning on the transcription of a cascade of skeletal muscle-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 13.Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To date, no proteins that function analogously in cardiomyocytes or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) have been identified. Although most bHLH proteins function as transcriptional activators, some bHLH proteins function as transcriptional repressors, including MyoR (14.Lu J. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the hairy family of bHLH factors. Hairy-related factors have been implicated in the control of neuronal differentiation in developing mice (15.Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 16.Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Members of the hairy family of transcriptional repressors have three functional domains. They contain a proline in the basic region of the bHLH that affects the DNA-binding specificity, an Orange domain, and a WRPW motif at or adjacent to the carboxyl terminus (reviewed in Ref.17.Fisher A. Caudy M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The bHLH region of the hairy proteins binds to class B E-boxes or N-boxes (18.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 19.Ohsako S. Hyer J. Panganiban G. Oliver I. Caudy M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2729-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Orange domain mediates interaction with specific transcriptional activators (21.Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The WRPW motif is critical for recruitment of members of the groucho family of corepressors (22.Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although initially identified in Drosophila, members of the hairy family are present in many species including humans. All hairy family members identified to date are expressed primarily in the nervous system where they are thought to inhibit differentiation. In mammals, the evidence for such a role comes primarily from studies of HES-1, the first mammalian homologue of hairy to be identified (18.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HES-1 in the developing brain of mice leads to delayed neuronal differentiation (16.Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of theHES-1 gene in mice leads to up-regulation of the proneural gene MASH-1 and premature neuronal differentiation, resulting in severe neural tube defects (15.Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). HES-1 has also been implicated as a downstream effector of Notch in the lateral inhibition pathway (23.Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 pheochromocytoma cells that overexpress Wnt-1, HES-1 is up-regulated and the cells fail to differentiate in response to nerve growth factor (24.Issack P.S. Ziff E.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 837-845PubMed Google Scholar). To identify novel helix-loop-helix factors present in the cardiovascular system, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the bHLH/PAS domain of ARNT as a bait to probe a human heart cDNA library. ARNT has previously been shown to have an important role in gene regulation by heterodimerization with several other factors, including the tissue-specific factor EPAS1 (25.Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 26.Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We identified two novel cDNAs that interact with ARNT in yeast. At the sequence level, these proteins are closely related to each other and distantly related to the hairy family of transcriptional repressors. Their patterns of expression are predominantly cardiovascular during development, consequently we named them “cardiovascular helix-loop-helix Factor 1 and 2” (CHF1 and CHF2). Because CHF1 is expressed at high levels in the adult aorta we focused our initial efforts on CHF1. We found that CHF1 was highly expressed in developing cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells but was down-regulated in adult heart when cardiac myocytes became terminally differentiated. CHF1 inhibited ARNT/EPAS1-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, CHF1, like other hairy family members, can function as a repressor of transcription. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, CHF1 inhibited the binding of the ARNT/EPAS1 heterodimer to its target DNA-binding site. Taken together, these data suggest that CHF1 is likely to play an important role in cardiovascular development. A human heart cDNA library cloned into the yeast vector pACT2 was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The yeast strain YRG-2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was made competent by the lithium acetate method (29.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Approximately 1010 yeast cells were transformed with 100 μg of the ARNT bait plasmid pBDGAL4-ARNT and 100 μg of library plasmid followed by plating on SD medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Surviving clones were then replated, transferred to paper filters, and screened for β-galactosidase activity as described (30.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Clones that remained positive were then grown in liquid medium and yeast miniprep DNA containing the cDNAs were prepared as described (30.Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Yeast miniprep DNA was used to transform ultracompetent XL-1 blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA inserts were then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method with Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with an automated sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Licor, Lincoln, NE). The interactions were verified by a quantitative β-galactosidase assay (31.Schneider S. Buchert M. Hovens C.M. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mouse homologues of CHF1 and CHF2 were cloned by low stringency screening of a mouse 11-day embryo library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with radiolabeled probes derived from the human cDNAs. A 0.3-kb EcoRI toBamHI fragment of the hCHF1 cDNA encoding the bHLH region was labeled with a random priming kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Approximately 1.6 million phage were plated and screened. Filters were washed with 0.5 × SSC (75 mm sodium chloride, 7.5 mmsodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. To obtain the entire mouse CHF1 cDNA sequence, the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mouse cDNA were obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To clone mouse CHF2, the entire 2.2-kb hCHF2 cDNA was used as a probe. The screening strategy was identical to that for mCHF1 except that the low stringency wash consisted of 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Sequence analysis, protein alignment, and phylogenetic relationships were determined using the MegAlign module of the Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the Clustal V algorithm included within this module. The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis are: mHES-1, D16464; rHES-1, L04527; hHES-1, L19314; zfHER-6, X97333; x-hairy1, U36194; c-hairy1, AF032966; deadpan, S48025; hairy, X15904; lin-22, AF020555; rHES-2, D14029; Espl-m5, X16552; Espl-m8, X16550; Espl-m7, X16553; zfHER-3, X97331; rHES-3, D13418; zfHER-2, X97330; zfHER-4, X97332; mHES-5, Q03062; zfHER-5, X95301; zfHER-1, X97329. The human ARNT cDNA (25.Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) was a gift from Oliver Hankinson (Los Angeles, CA). The ARNT bait plasmid pBDGAL4-ARNT was constructed by amplification of cDNA nucleotides 262 to 1581 encoding amino acids 70–508 of the human ARNT protein by the polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATAGTCGACACGATAAGGAGCGGT-3′ and 5′-ATAGTCGACGACAAACGACAACGACGACG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI site of the commercially available yeast bait vector pBDGAL4 Cam (Stratagene). The hCHF1 expression plasmid pcDNA-CHF1 was created by cloning a 0.6-kbBamHI-Acc65I fragment from the original yeast library clone pACT-CHF1 and a 0.8-kb Acc65I-XhoI fragment into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mammalian expression vector for E12 was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of full-length E12 and cloning into pCR3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The yeast bait construct was made by taking an E12 insert encoding amino acids 477–654, which contains the bHLH region, from a previously described plasmid, pEG202-E12 (32.Kho C.J. Huggins G.S.

The cytomegalovirus promoter/MyoD expression plasmid pCS2MyoD6MT was obtained from Andrew Lassar (Boston, MA). The yeast GAL4 activation domain vector, pGAD424 was obtained commercially (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The deletion mutants of hCHF1 were generated by cloning restriction fragments of the hCHF1 cDNA into the expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). This plasmid contains the human cytomegalovirus promoter and an NH2-terminal methionine-FLAG epitope to allow expression of DNA fragments that do not contain an initiation codon. For amino acids 38–337, a 1.1-kb EcoRI to XhoI cDNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the vector. For amino acids 147–337, a 0.7-kb BamHI toXhoI fragment was cloned into the BglII andSalI sites of the vector. For amino acids 38–146, a 0.3-kbEcoRI to BamHI fragment was cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector.

The mCHF1 riboprobe was derived from a 0.5-kbEcoRI to Acc65I fragment encoding the bHLH domain cloned into pBluescript II SK. 33P-Labeled RNA probes were synthesized with T7 or T3 polymerase according to the kit manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). Embryo sections were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI) and deparaffinized prior to use according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SM22α and cyclin A probes for Northern analysis have been described previously (34.Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L.

NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated onto 6-well trays 1 day prior to transfection and were transfected with the indicated plasmids mixed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (36.Chin M.T.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro transcribed and translated ARNT and EPAS1 binding to the HIF1-binding site were performed as described (28.Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed and translated hCHF1 and E12 were generated using the plasmids pcDNA-hCHF1 and pCR3-E12, respectively (see above). All in vitro transcription and translation reactions were verified by SDS-PAGE. Out of approximately 2 × 106 independent transformants, 230 yeast colonies initially grew on selective media. These colonies were then tested for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay. Of the 22 β-galactosidase positive clones, one represented the entire open reading frame of hCHF1 and two represented full-length hCHF2. After screening of 1.6 million plaques from the mouse 11-day embryo library with the human CHF1 probe, a total of 6 positive plaques were isolated, 3 were sequenced and one clone containing the entire open reading frame was characterized further. After sequencing this clone, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed on 11-day mouse embryo RNA. Both 5′- and 3′-specific bands were isolated that overlapped with the original phage clone and gave a total length of 2,541 nucleotides, consistent with the predicted mRNA size on Northern blots. The same library was screened with the human CHF2 probe. A total of 9 clones were isolated, 2 were sequenced, and 1 represented a 2.2-kb full-length mCHF2 cDNA. To verify that CHF1 and CHF2 interact with ARNT, quantitative yeast β-galactosidase assays were performed. The yeast strain YRG-2 was transformed with plasmids pBDGAL4-ARNT and pACT-CHF1, pACT-CHF2 or pGAD424 (a GAL4 activation domain vector). As a negative control, YRG-2 was also transformed with pBDGAL4-E12, containing the human E12 cDNA and either pACT-CHF1 or pACT-CHF2. Binding between SV40 T antigen and p53 was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig.1, the combination of either CHF1 or CHF2 with ARNT but not E12 were sufficient to activate the endogenous β-galactosidase gene, indicating specific binding of CHF1 and CHF2 to ARNT in yeast. Computer data base searching initially revealed weak homology between hCHF1 and members of the hairy family of transcription factors at the protein level. A search with hCHF2 gave similar results. In order to determine the homology of CHF1 and CHF2 to other members of the hairy family, protein alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed. In Fig.2 A, we aligned the open reading frame of hCHF1, hCHF2, and hHES-1, the first mammalian member of the hairy family to be identified (18.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). CHF1 and CHF2 are most homologous to hHES-1 in the bHLH region. CHF1 and CHF2 are distinct from hHES-1 and other hairy family members by the substitution of glycine for proline in the basic region and by the presence of a YRPW motif in place of the canonical WRPW at the COOH terminus. Similarly, the Orange domains (implicated in protein-protein interaction (21.Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)) of CHF1 and CHF2 are highly related to each other and divergent from that of HES-1. CHF1 and CHF2 share an overall amino acid similarity of 51.3% while their similarities to hHES-1 are 22.9 and 23.9%, respectively. Because of these divergent features, which suggest that CHF1 and CHF2 are distinct from other members of the hairy family, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, CHF1 and CHF2 are most closely related to each other, and diverge early from other members of the hairy family. Previously described hairy-related genes are expressed primarily in the nervous system. To determine the expression pattern of CHF1 in adult mice, Northern analysis was performed using RNA prepared from different mouse organs and a mouse CHF1 probe derived from the coding region (Fig.3). This probe hybridized to an approximately 2.6-kb band expressed most abundantly in the adult aorta, with lower expression detected in the heart, brain, and lung. Similar results were obtained with a probe derived from the 3′-untranslated region (data not shown). CHF2 showed much lower expression in the adult heart and aorta (data not shown), so our initial efforts focused primarily on CHF1. Given the importance of bHLH proteins in cell type specification and the established role of hairy-related genes in embryonic development, we examined the timing and tissue distribution of CHF1 expression in developing mouse embryos. As shown in Fig.4, a very low level of CHF1 message was detected in whole embryos by Northern blot analysis as early as embryonic day 7.5. This low level expression of CHF1 persisted until day 11.5, when CHF1 mRNA was markedly increased. At this time point, there is a marked reorganization in branchial arch arteries, and septation begins within the heart and outflow tract. To identify the tissues expressing CHF1 in the developing mouse embryo, we performedin situ hybridization. CHF1 expression was detected in the developing ventricle as early as day 8.5, but was not detected in the neural tube and the bulbus cordis (Fig.5). Expression of CHF1 at this time is concurrent with the reported expression of MLC2v, the earliest known marker of ventricular specification (37.O'Brien T.X. Lee K.J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5157-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). At day 9.0, CHF1 mRNA was also detected in the developing paired dorsal aorta prior to fusion. CHF1 expression was observed primarily in the cells surrounding the primitive aortic endothelial tube, presumably in cells committed to the VSMC lineage. Its expression in this location occurred prior to the reported appearance of the smooth muscle markers SM22α and smooth muscle α-actin at day 9.5 (38.Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), CRP2/SmLIM at day 10 (39.Jain M.K. Kashiki S. Hsieh C.-M. Layne M.D. Yet S.F. Sibinga N.E. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Woo I. Maas R.L. Haber E. Lee M.-E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain at day 10.5 (40.Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Ligon K.L. Periasamy M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). At later stages of development (embryonic day 11.5–16.5), expression of CHF1 persisted in the ventricle and aorta (Fig. 5, and data not shown). At embryonic day 11.5, abundant CHF1 message was detected in mesenteric arteries, indicating that the expression of CHF1 in developing vessels is not limited to the aorta. At these time points, ARNT expression overlaps that of CHF1, suggesting that their interaction is biologically relevant (41.Jain S. Maltepe E. Lu M.M. Simon C. Bradfield C.A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Figure 5In situ analysis of CHF1 expression in developing mouse embryos.

We have previously reported that the Monc-1 neural crest-derived cell line can be induced to differentiate with high efficiency into smooth muscle cells (34.Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, CHF1 is up-regulated within 24 h of induction of smooth muscle differentiation and the CHF1 mRNA abundance persists at day 6, when Monc-1-derived VSMC are highly differentiated. This pattern of induction during the onset of differentiation in vitro is similar to the expression pattern in vivo (Fig. 5) and suggests an important role for CHF1 in VSMC differentiation. To explore the regulation of CHF1 expression in hearts during the transition from a proliferative to a terminally differentiated phenotype, we performed Northern blot analysis of RNA derived from rat hearts harvested at various time points before and after birth. As shown in Fig. 7, CHF1 RNA is abundant in fetal rat hearts and is markedly down-regulated 2 days after birth. It is noteworthy that down-regulation of CHF1 correlates with down-regulation of cyclin A, cell cycle withdrawal, and terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes (35.Yoshizumi M. Lee W.S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CHF1 interacts directly with ARNT, but the functional consequences of this binding are unknown. Others have shown that ARNT heterodimerizes with a variety of partners, such as the arylhydrocarbon receptor (25.Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (26.Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 28.Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to activate transcription of target genes. We have previously shown that ARNT and EPAS1 together heterodimerize and activate the VEGF promoter by binding to the HIF1-binding site (28.Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of CHF1 on ARNT/EPAS1-dependent transcription, we transfected a plasmid containing the VEGF promoter and luciferase reporter gene with different combinations of expression plasmids encoding ARNT, EPAS1, and CHF1 into NIH3T3 cells, which do not express endogenous CHF1. As shown in Fig. 8 A, ARNT and EPAS1 increase the VEGF promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells by 5-fold. In the presence of CHF1, induction of VEGF promoter activity is decreased by 85%. This inhibition is specific to CHF1 because E12 and MyoD expression plasmids did not block induction of the VEGF promoter (Fig.8 A). In contrast, these E12 and MyoD expression plasmids are able to increase the activity of the myogenin promoter (data not shown). The effect of CHF1 on ARNT-dependent transcription is also dose-dependent, as shown in Fig. 8 B. The HIF1 site in the VEGF promoter is known to confer inducibility by facilitating the binding of ARNT/EPAS1 or ARNT/HIF1α heterodimers (28.Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to determine the mechanism by which CHF1 inhibits VEGF promoter activation, we performed EMSAs to determine the effect of CHF1 on the binding of the ARNT/EPAS1 heterodimer to the HIF1-binding site. As shown in Fig. 9,in vitro transcribed and translated ARNT + EPAS1 form a protein-DNA complex with the HIF1 oligonucleotides and CHF1 abolishes this complex. To demonstrate that CHF1 inhibition is specific, a parallel reaction was performed with E12, which did not inhibit complex formation. To verify that this band is a specific complex, unlabeled HIF1 oligonucleotides (specific competitor) were also added to the reaction and inhibited formation of the ARNT/EPAS1-labeled complex. In contrast, a nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide did not inhibit formation of the observed complex. As a first step in mapping the domain of CHF1 required for transcriptional repression, we generated a series of deletion mutants, as shown in Fig.10. In transient transfection analysis, full-length CHF1 abolished ARNT/EPAS1-dependent transcription. Deletion of amino acids 1–37 had no effect. In contrast, deletion of amino acids 1–146, removing the bHLH domain and part of the Orange domain, abolished repression. Deletion of amino acids 1–37 and 147–337, leaving primarily the bHLH domain, also abolished repression. Taken together, these results suggest that the bHLH domain is necessary but not sufficient for repression and an intact Orange domain or other domains in the COOH terminus are also required for repression of ARNT-dependent transcription. We have isolated two novel cDNAs from a human heart library encoding developmentally regulated bHLH proteins that interact with the bHLH-PAS motif of ARNT in yeast (Fig. 1). At the amino acid level, these proteins are most related to the hairy family of transcriptional repressors, which have been implicated in the control of neuronal differentiation. CHF1 and CHF2 diverge from other members by the presence of a glycine in place of proline within the basic region, and by the presence of a YRPW motif in place of the WRPW motif at or near the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2 A). The proline residue appears to be critical for DNA-binding specificity, and is thought to explain the divergent binding specificity of hairy-related proteins from other bHLH proteins. In general, members of the hairy family bind to class B E-box motif of the consensus sequence CA(C/T)GTG as well as the N-box sequence CACNAG. Interestingly, recombinant CHF1 and CHF2 do not bind to E-boxes and N-boxes. 2M. T. Chin and M.-E. Lee, unpublished results. Thus, they may regulate a different set of genes via an as yet unidentified binding site. In all hairy family members, the WRPW motif is critical for interaction with members of the groucho family of transcriptional co-repressors (22.Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the YRPW motif in CHF1 and CHF2 can also interact with groucho-related proteins. Of note, the related sequence WRPY in the runt family of transcription factors can also interact with groucho, and the interaction may be regulated (42.Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In Drosophila hairy, the Orange domain, in conjunction with the bHLH domain, is thought to mediate repression of specific transcriptional activators, such as Scute (21.Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our analysis of the interaction between CHF1 and ARNT/EPAS1 is consistent with these findings. Because the bHLH and Orange domain are not highly conserved between CHF1 and other hairy family members, CHF1 may regulate a specific class of transcriptional activators that are distinct from those regulated by other hairy family members. We have also cloned the mouse homologue of CHF1 and determined its expression in mouse embryos and adults. CHF1 is expressed early in the developing ventricle and vasculature and this pattern of expression persists into adulthood (Figs. 3 and 5). Expression of CHF1 is correlated with the onset of smooth muscle differentiation in developing vasculature and in an in vitro model of smooth muscle differentiation (Figs. 5 and 6). In the developing ventricle, CHF1 expression correlates with the reported expression of early ventricular markers such as MLC2v (37.O'Brien T.X. Lee K.J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5157-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CHF1 expression is down-regulated in isolated rat hearts as a function of age (Fig. 7). The time course of down-regulation correlates with down-regulation of cyclin A and withdrawal from the cell cycle (35.Yoshizumi M. Lee W.S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the adult, CHF1 is down-regulated in the heart but continues to be expressed highly in the aorta. Since cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated and have lost the capacity to divide, while VSMCs in the aorta retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle, it is tempting to speculate that CHF1 may function as a repressor to prevent terminal differentiation. We have found that CHF1 and CHF2 interact with ARNT in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig. 1). This interaction with ARNT is specific, as CHF1 and CHF2 do not interact with the bHLH protein E12. In transient transfection assays, CHF1 functions as a transcriptional repressor by interfering with ARNT-dependent activation of the VEGF promoter, while E12 and MyoD do not (Fig. 8). The mechanism by which this occurs is through inhibition of ARNT/EPAS1 binding to the HIF1 site (Fig. 9). Targeted disruption of the ARNT gene in mice has been shown to cause defects in yolk sac angiogenesis (43.Maltepe E. Schmidt J.V. Baunoch D. Bradfield C.A. Simon M.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In the yolk sac vessels of knockout mice, the smooth muscle layer is deficient. It is believed that the vascular phenotype in ARNT-null mice can be attributed, at least partially, to reduction of VEGF, which is critical for normal blood vessel development (44.Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M. Fahrig M. Vandenhoeck A. Harpal K. Eberhardt C. Declercq C. Pawling J. Moons L. Collen D. Risau W. Nagy A.

Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Our findings that CHF1 is expressed in developing vasculature, regulates ARNT/EPAS1-dependent activation of the VEGF promoter (and other as yet unidentified promoters) suggest a potential mechanistic link between this protein and vascular development. For example, one potential role for CHF1 may be to control the timing of smooth muscle development in the medial layer, in a manner analogous to the function of HES-1 in the developing nervous system. To our knowledge, CHF1 is the first tissue-restricted bHLH protein to be expressed in vascular smooth muscle. In the future, we hope to determine the contribution of CHF1 and CHF2 to organismal development by targeted disruption of their genes in mice. We also hope to elucidate the role of CHF1 in the adult vasculature by identification of its downstream target genes.

https://openalex.org/W1986582680,"Formation of peroxynitrite from NO and O⨪2 is considered an important trigger for cellular tyrosine nitration under pathophysiological conditions. However, this view has been questioned by a recent report indicating that NO and O⨪2generated simultaneously from (Z)-1-{N-[3-aminopropyl]-N-[4-(3-aminopropylammonio)butyl]-amino}diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate] (SPER/NO) and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase, respectively, exhibit much lower nitrating efficiency than authentic peroxynitrite (Pfeiffer, S. and Mayer, B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27280–27285). The present study extends those earlier findings to several alternative NO/O⨪2-generating systems and provides evidence that the apparent lack of tyrosine nitration by NO/O⨪2is due to a pronounced decrease of nitration efficiency at low steady-state concentrations of authentic peroxynitrite. The decrease in the yields of 3-nitrotyrosine was accompanied by an increase in the recovery of dityrosine, showing that dimerization of tyrosine radicals outcompetes the nitration reaction at low peroxynitrite concentrations. The observed inverse dependence on peroxynitrite concentration of dityrosine formation and tyrosine nitration is predicted by a kinetic model assuming that radical formation by peroxynitrous acid homolysis results in the generation of tyrosyl radicals that either dimerize to yield dityrosine or combine with ⋅NO2 radical to form 3-nitrotyrosine. The present results demonstrate that very high fluxes (>2 μm/s) of NO/O⨪2 are required to render peroxynitrite an efficient trigger of tyrosine nitration and that dityrosine is a major product of tyrosine modification caused by low steady-state concentrations of peroxynitrite.

Nitration of specific tyrosine residues has been reported to affect protein structure and function (3.Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), suggesting that 3-nitrotyrosine formation may not only be a disease marker but could be causally involved in the pathogenesis of certain disease states. Peroxynitrite, formed in a nearly diffusion-controlled reaction from NO and O⨪2, is considered a potent pathophysiologically relevant cytotoxin. Besides oxidation reactions resulting in dysfunction of various biomolecules, nitration of free and protein-bound tyrosine to yield 3-nitrotyrosine is a well established reaction of peroxynitrite that may contribute to NO cytotoxicity (1.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar). The nitration reaction has been extensively studied in vitro by bolus addition of synthetic peroxynitrite to tyrosine-containing samples including purified proteins, cells, and tissues (3.Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 4.van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem.

In situ, 3-nitrotyrosine was most frequently visualized with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (2.Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), but the identity of the product has been confirmed by several laboratories using sophisticated gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy and HPLC1 methods (7.Leeuwenburgh C.

Thus, there is general agreement that (i) authentic peroxynitrite is a potent nitrating agent that converts free and protein-bound tyrosine to the corresponding 3-nitro derivative, and that (ii) 3-nitrotyrosine does occur in vivo. The conclusion that peroxynitrite is the main cause for in vivo nitration may thus seem obvious, but is not supported by experimental data. In fact, several recent studies have identified alternative pathways of tyrosine nitration (9.Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and we found that nitration by simultaneously generated NO and O⨪2 is much less efficient than the reaction triggered by authentic peroxynitrite (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the latter results has been disputed, and a number of points have been raised questioning their validity. One point was related to the possibility that urate formed in the XO reaction might have scavenged peroxynitrite and thus prevented tyrosine nitration in long term (12 h) experiments. Concerning data interpretation, we had suggested that NO and O⨪2 may combine totrans-peroxynitrite, the rapid protonation of which prevents formation of the nitrating CO⨪2 adduct. However, thermodynamic calculations have unambiguously identified the cis-rotamer as the more stable conformation of peroxynitrite in both gas phase (11.Tsai J.H.M. Harrison J.G. Martin J.C.

Mayer, unpublished data. rendering our initial hypothesis untenable. We hope to settle both issues with the present study in which we extend our earlier findings to other, urate-free NO/O⨪2-generating systems and demonstrate that the low nitrating efficiency of NO/O⨪2 is explained by an unexpected dependence of nitration yields on peroxynitrite steady-state concentrations. It is shown that the reaction between tyrosine and peroxynitrite yields almost exclusively dityrosine at peroxynitrite concentrations ≤5 μm, whereas product yields were progressively shifted toward 3-nitrotyrosine at higher concentrations of peroxynitrite.

DEA/NO (0.1 mm) and FMN (0.1 mm) were incubated with 1 mm tyrosine at ambient temperature for 1 h in 0.1mK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of visible light from a tungsten lamp (60 watts). NO released from DEA/NO (0.1 mm) was measured with a Clark-type NO-sensitive electrode (Iso-NO, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany) in the absence or presence of FMN as described (16.Schmidt K. Mayer B. Titherage M.A. Nitric Oxide Protocols. 100. Humana Press Inc., Totowa1997: 101-109Google Scholar). 5-μl aliquots of a 1 mm FMN solution were added to 495-μl of 0.1 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm DEA/NO in the absence or presence of visible light. SOD (1,000 units/ml) was added where indicated. The rates of O⨪2 release from XO with hypoxanthine or acetaldehyde were determined by monitoring the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm. Flux rates of O⨪2 were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 for reduced cytochrome c (17.Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at ambient temperature in a total volume of 0.2 ml of a 50 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm hypoxanthine or acetaldehyde, 20 μm ferricytochrome c, and variable amounts of XO. Oxidation of DHR was monitored at 501 nm as described (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18.Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The amount of oxidized DHR was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 78.78 mm−1cm−1. For measurements, 200-μl aliquots were taken every 10–20 min from 3-ml samples. Total incubation time was 3 h. SPER/NO (1 mm) or hypoxanthine/XO (28 milliunits/ml) alone led to DHR oxidation rates of <0.06 and <0.3 μm × min−1, respectively. The infusion experiments were performed with a Merck-Hitachi HPLC pump (655A-11) provided with Peek capillaries (internal diameter, 0.25 mm) under constant stirring of the tyrosine-containing solutions at ambient temperature. Peroxynitrite (2 ml of a 0.1 mm stock solution) was infused at increasing rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.8 ml/min) into 18 ml of 0.1mK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm tyrosine, followed by the determination of 3-nitrotyrosine as described below. HPLC analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine was performed on a C18 reversed phase column with 0.1 mKH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer (pH 3) containing 6% (v/v) methanol at 0.7 ml/min and detection at 274 nm, as described (19.Pfeiffer S. Leopold E. Hemmens B. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In some experiments 3-nitrotyrosine was detected with a dual-channel electrochemical detector (ESA, Coulochem II, Chelmsford, MA) set to 600 mV and 850 mV (20.Skinner K.A. Crow J.P. Skinner H.B. Chandler R.T. Thompson J.A. Parks D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oxidation of 3-nitrotyrosine was followed at 850 mV. A guard cell placed between the solvent delivery system and injector was set to 1000 mV. Calibration curves were recorded daily with authentic 3-nitrotyrosine (2 nm–0.5 μm and 60 nm--5 μm for electrochemical and UV-visible detection, respectively). HPLC analysis of dityrosine was performed on a C18 reversed phase column with 50 mmKH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer (pH 3) containing 1% (v/v) methanol at 0.7 ml/min and fluorescence detection (Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F 1050; excitation 285 nm, emission 410 nm) as described (4.van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Calibration curves were recorded with authentic dityrosine (50 nm–5 μm). The rate of peroxynitrite decay was determined by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy at 302 nm (Bio-Sequential SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) at 22 °C. Reservoir 1 contained peroxynitrite (0.2 mm) in 0.01 m NaOH, and reservoir 2, the buffer solution (0.2 mK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4), containing 2 mm tyrosine). Ak av value of 0.27 ± 0.05 s−1(mean ± S.D.; n = 9) was calculated from the initial rates of first order peroxynitrite decay. The peroxynitrite steady-state concentrations obtained in the infusion experiments were calculated by dividing infusion rates (nm s−1) by 0.27 s−1. Kinetic simulations of tyrosine nitration were performed using the software package Mathematica (Version 2.2.2., Wolfram Research Inc., Champaign, IL). The model was based on peroxynitrite decomposition (k = 0.27 s−1) via homolysis producing ⋅ OH and⋅NO2 radicals with 30% yields (21.Merenyi G. Lind J. Goldstein S. Czapski G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 712-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22.Coddington J.W. Hurst J.K. Lymar S.V. J. Am. Chem.

The following second order rate constants (m−1s−1) were used to account for the reactions of⋅NO2 with tyrosine, tyrosyl radical, and⋅NO2, respectively: 3.2 × 105(24.Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), 3 × 109 (24.Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), 9 × 108 (24.Prütz W.A. Mönig H. Butler J. Land E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A second order rate constant of 2.25 × 108m−1 s−1 was used to account for the dimerization of tyrosyl radicals to dityrosine (25.Hunter E.P. Desrosiers M.F. Simic M.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The formation of 3-nitrotyrosine was measured in the presence of four different NO/O⨪2-generating systems. As shown in TableI, incubation of SPER/NO (1 mm; initial rate of NO release ∼100 nms−1) with tyrosine (1 mm) led to the formation of 1.8 μm ± 0.18 μm 3-nitrotyrosine within 3 h. As observed earlier (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), nitration yield was markedly reduced (54.7 ± 13.15 nm) upon simultaneous generation of O⨪2 from XO/hypoxanthine. Based on the total amount of peroxynitrite that had been formed (32.5 ± 5.3 μm), the nitrating efficiency of this system was 0.17%. The XO reaction results in an accumulation of urate, a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite (26.Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 27.Vasquez-Vivar J. Santos A.M. Junqueira B.C. Augusto O. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were performed in the presence of 0.1 units/ml uricase, an enzyme that oxidizes urate to allantoin and H2O2 (28.Mahler J.L. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1963: 285-296Google Scholar). Allantoin (0.1 mm) had no effect on tyrosine nitration mediated by authentic peroxynitrite (data not shown). In the presence of uricase, the amount of detectable peroxynitrite was approximately doubled, accompanied by a 6-fold increase in 3-nitrotyrosine formation. The corresponding nitrating efficiency was 0.54%. These results suggested that accumulation of urate does indeed contribute to the low nitrating efficiency of the applied NO/O⨪2-generating system, but the nitration yield was still about 10-fold lower than that obtained with 70 μm authentic peroxynitrite (3.41 ± 0.63 μm, corresponding to 4.9%) and about 5-fold lower than the nitration triggered with SPER/NO alone. It was conceivable that this difference was caused by residual urate, because uricase did not completely consume the accumulated urate under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Therefore, two urate-free NO/O⨪2-generating systems were additionally tested.Table IPeroxynitrite formation and tyrosine nitration by NO/O⨪2-generating systemsNO donorO⨪2 generating systemNOO⨪2ONOO−3-NitrotyrosineNitrating efficiencynms −1nms −1μmnm%SPER/NO (1 mm)None96.2 ± 8.31864 ± 177SPER/NO (1 mm)XO (28 milliunits/ml)92.1 ± 0.694.5 ± 8.332.5 ± 5.354.7 ± 13.20.17a100% = accumulated ONOO− measured as DHR oxidation.Hypoxanthine (1 mm)SPER/NO (1 mm)XO (28 milliunits/ml)97.5 ± 11.497.2 ± 1064.1 ± 8.0344 ± 16.00.54a100% = accumulated ONOO− measured as DHR oxidation.Hypoxanthine (1 mm) + uricase (0.1 units/ml)SPER/NO (0.3 mm)None29.5 ± 1.7165 ± 43.6SPER/NO (0.3 mm)XO (50 milliunits/ml) CH3CHO (1 mm)35.3 ± 13.325.5 ± 3.345.9 ± 6.916.6 ± 1.50.04a100% = accumulated ONOO− measured as DHR oxidation.DEA/NO (0.1 mm)None137.8 ± 8.386.1 ± 29.5DEA/NO (0.1 mm)FMN (0.1 mm)NDNDND678 ± 90.80.67b100% = 0.1 mm.Tyrosine (1 mm) was incubated at ambient temperature for 3 h in 0.1 mK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of additives as indicated.

ONOO−, peroxynitrite; ND, not determined. Acetaldehyde is known to function as an alternative substrate of XO albeit at much lower turnover numbers (29.Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 51-53Google Scholar). Incubation of 1 mm acetaldehyde with 50 milliunits/ml XO resulted in formation of 25.5 ± 3.3 nm O⨪2s−1, a rate that was approximately matched by the rate of NO released from 0.3 mm SPER/NO (∼30 nms−1). At this concentration, the NO donor alone led to formation of 165.5 ± 43.6 nm 3-nitrotyrosine (Tab.1). The 11-fold decrease in nitration upon an only 3.3-fold decrease in the SPER/NO concentration supports our earlier proposal (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that NO-induced nitration is mediated by a product of NO autoxidation, a reaction that follows second order kinetics with respect to NO. Coincubation of SPER/NO with the XO/acetaldehyde system resulted in formation of 45.9 ± 6.9 μm peroxynitrite (measured as DHR oxidation) and an about 11-fold reduction of 3-nitrotyrosine formation, corresponding to a nitrating efficiency of 0.04%. As expected from recent reports on the slow reaction of peroxynitrite with aldehydes (30.Uppu R.M. Winston G.W. Pryor W.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31.Nakao L.S. Ouchi D. Augusto O. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), tyrosine nitration by authentic peroxynitrite was only slightly inhibited to about 75% of controls by 1 mmacetaldehyde (data not shown). Finally, we used illuminated FMN as a nonenzymatic source of O⨪2 (32.Misra H.P. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 188-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of O⨪2 was assessed indirectly by measuring NO release from DEA/NO with a Clark-type NO electrode in the absence and presence of FMN in light and dark conditions with and without SOD (Fig. 1A). FMN had no significant effect on NO autoxidation in dark conditions (tracea versus b) but led to a rapid apparently zero order decay of NO upon illumination (tracec), an effect that was largely (∼73%) inhibited by SOD (trace d), confirming that FMN might be a useful source for O⨪2 in our experiments. Incubation of DEA/NO (0.1 mm) with 1 mmtyrosine in the absence and presence of 0.1 mm FMN led to formation of 86.1 ± 29.5 nm and 678 ± 90.8 nm 3-nitrotyrosine, respectively. The effect of FMN was concentration-dependent; maximal effects were obtained with ≥0.1 mm, the apparent EC50 was 57.5 ± 7.0 μm (Fig. 1 B). FMN did not significantly increase DEA/NO-mediated nitration in dark conditions (data not shown). Due to a strong interference of FMN with the DHR assay, 3S. Pfeiffer and B. Mayer, unpublished data. it was not possible to measure apparent peroxynitrite formation by this system, but the DEA/NO-FMN system allowed us for the first time to demonstrate a stimulation of NO-mediated nitration by co-generation of O⨪2, indicating that the in situ generation of peroxynitrite does lead to tyrosine nitration under certain experimental conditions. Intriguing data were obtained when the nitrating efficiencies of NO/O⨪2-generating systems were studied in the presence of bicarbonate (CO⨪2). CO⨪2 is known to react rapidly with peroxynitrite to yield the potent nitrating adduct nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONO2CO2−) (33.Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8867-8868Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Therefore, depending on the buffer concentrations of CO2 (34.Lemercier J.N. Padmaja S. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), tyrosine nitration by authentic peroxynitrite is increased 2- to 4-fold upon the addition of 0.25–50 mm bicarbonate (5.Gow A. Duran D. Thom S.R. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 35.Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K.

Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The data obtained with four NO/O⨪2-generating systems tested for tyrosine nitration with and without 25 mm bicarbonate (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrated that CO2 had no effect whatsoever on nitration by NO/O⨪2, although it produced a consistent stimulation of nitration triggered by authentic peroxynitrite added as a bolus at concentrations approximately matching those formed by the respective NO/O⨪2-generating systems. The nitrating efficiency of NO/O⨪2 varied from 0.04% (SPER/NO plus XO/acetaldehyde) to 0.68% (DEA/NO plus FMN) but never approached the efficiency of authentic peroxynitrite (7–10%). Since CO⨪3 radicals formed by homolysis of ONO2COO2−may be essential to nitration (38.Lymar S.V. Hurst J.K. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 294-301Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the data suggest that CO⨪3was efficiently scavenged by an unknown competing reaction under our experimental conditions. We considered several possibilities to explain the poor nitrating efficiency of NO/O⨪2. Unfortunately, however, most hypotheses, including the proposal of a distinct chemical species that is formed from NO/O⨪2 in situ (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), are in conflict with the known theoretical background of NO/O⨪2 and/or peroxynitrite chemistry. One remaining possibility was that tyrosine nitration required a certain threshold steady-state level of peroxynitrite to become significant. This would explain the observed differences between bolus addition and continuous generation of peroxynitrite. We have addressed this issue using two experimental approaches. First we studied the nitrating efficiency of increasing peroxynitrite concentrations (5–1,000 μm) added as a bolus to buffer solutions containing 1 mm tyrosine. As expected, the total amount of 3-nitrotyrosine gradually increased with increasing concentrations of added peroxynitrite (46.23 ± 1.59 μm at 1 mm; data not shown). It was surprising, however, to find that the nitrating efficiency of peroxynitrite increased from 1.4 ± 0.3 to 5.4 ± 0.4% when the peroxynitrite concentration was increased from 5 μmto 100 μm and leveled off at higher concentrations (Fig.3 A). In another set of experiments 2 ml of a 0.1 mm stock solution of peroxynitrite was infused at increasing rates (8.33 nms−1, 16.67 nm s−1, 33.33 nm s−1, 41.67 nm s−1, and 66.67 nm s−1) into tyrosine-containing buffer solutions (10 μm peroxynitrite final in each case). The respective steady-state concentrations of peroxynitrite were calculated from the rate of first order decomposition measured by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy under identical conditions (k av = 0.27 ± 0.05 s−1; data not shown). Fig. 3 B shows that the nitrating efficiency of infused peroxynitrite increased about 3-fold (from 0.22 ± 0.05 to 0.64 ± 0.08%) when the steady-state concentrations were increased from 30.7 to 247 nm. Since dityrosine is another product of the reaction between tyrosine and peroxynitrite (4.van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 35.Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we speculated that the tyrosine dimerization reaction may be predominant at low peroxynitrite concentrations. To test this hypothesis, we measured dityrosine formation from 1 mm tyrosine treated with increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite. As shown in Fig.4, a maximal yield of 17.0 ± 3.8% dityrosine was obtained with the lowest peroxynitrite concentration that has been tested (1 μm) and decreased down to less than 1% at ≥1 mm peroxynitrite. The replot of the 3-nitrotyrosine data (open symbols in Fig. 4) demonstrates that dityrosine is indeed the major product of tyrosine reacting with low concentrations of peroxynitrite. This study extends our previous observations showing that the nitrating efficiency of simultaneously generated NO/O⨪2 is much lower than that of authentic peroxynitrite (10.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J.

Because AP-2 and clathrin are the major protein components on clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the cell surface, much work over the past decade has centered on carefully dissecting the specific roles that these proteins play in ordered coat assembly and the protein sorting process.

Although dynamin and synaptojanin each exhibit hydrolytic (GTPase and inositol-5-phosphatase, respectively) activity, the other endocytic proteins appear to be primarily involved in establishing an extensive array of complex protein-protein interactions that appear necessary to construct a clathrin-coated vesicle. For example, amphiphysin is able to interact with dynamin, synaptojanin, AP-2, and clathrin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (19.Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Thus, an emerging consensus from these more recent studies is that highly coordinated, multivalent protein-protein interactions are likely to contribute to the dynamics of AP-2-dependent clathrin coat formation that occurs during rapid endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Epsin was recently identified in screens for proteins that interact with the eps15 homology (EH) domain of eps15 (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P.

The carboxyl-terminal portion of epsin 1, the so-called NPF domain, contains three repeats of the tripeptide motif asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These repeats facilitate binding to the eps15 homology (EH) domains of not only eps15 but also to the eps15 homology (EH) domains of the recently identified intersectin/Ese protein family (10.Yamabhai M.

Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The central region of the epsin 1 molecule binds to the α subunit of AP-2, in an apparently phosphorylation-dependent manner (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In fact, epsin was first discovered as a novel binding partner of the globular appendage domain of the AP-2 α chain (25.Wang L.-H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This report describes the ability of epsin 1 to also interact directly with clathrin and identifies linear sequences within the epsin 1 (and epsin 2) primary structure that are responsible for this association. One binding site is adjacent to but distinct from the AP-2-binding site located within the central portion of the protein. A second site is upstream of the first NPF repeat within the carboxyl-terminal NPF domain. Thus, like AP-2, clathrin, amphiphysin, eps15, and β-arrestin, epsin is also capable of forming a multivalent protein network that likely influences the endocytic process. In addition, the potential relevance of related clathrin-binding sequences present in several additional proteins that participate in clathrin-coat assembly is also discussed. The anti-α subunit mAb1 100/2 and the anti-β1/β2 subunit mAb 100/1 were generously provided by Ernst Ungewickell. Polyclonal anti-μ2 subunit antiserum was a gift from Juan Bonifacino. The affinity-purified anti-AP-1 γ subunit antibody, AE/1, has been described elsewhere (26.Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4933-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The anti-AP-2 α subunit mAb AP.6, the clathrin heavy chain mAb X22, and mAb TD.1, which recognizes the clathrin-terminal domain, were kindly provided by Frances Brodsky, and the antibody specific for the clathrin light chain neuronal-specific insert, mAb Cl57.3, was from Reinhard Jahn. Polyclonal anti-epsin antibodies from rabbits injected with residues 229–575 of rat epsin 1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were affinity purified from serum on either purified epsin DPW domain immobilized on nitrocellulose or on histidine-tagged epsin 1 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 6MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyclonal anti-peptide (RVDASDEDRISEVRKVLC) antibodies against synaptojanin were also raised in rabbits and affinity purified on the immunizing peptide immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The pan-arrestin mAb F4C1 was kindly provided by Larry Donoso, whereas the polyclonal anti-β-arrestin serum was a gift from R. Lefkowitz. Monoclonal antibodies specific for amphiphysin, AP180, and the γ subunit of AP-1 (mAb 88) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. A cDNA encoding residues 229–407 of rat epsin 1 cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (GST-DPW) was kindly provided by Pietro de Camilli. A construct containing residues 1–579 of the bovine clathrin heavy chain cloned into pGEX-2T, was kindly provided by Jim Keen. Mutagenesis of epsin 1 was performed using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) with the GST-DPW plasmid as the template. The sense primers used were 5′-GGCAAGGAGGAGTCATCTGCCGCGGCTCTTGCTGACGTCTTC-3′ for the GST-DPW (257LMD → AAA) substitution, 5′-GAGTCATCTCTTATGGATGCTGCCGCGGCCTTCACAACCCCAGCC-3′ for the GST-DPW (260LADV → AAAA) substitution and 5′-GGAGGAGTCATCTCTTTTGGATCTTATGGACGCCTTAACAACCCCAGCCC-3′ for the GST-DPW (1 → 2) substitution. The GST-DPW(2 → STOP), (4 → STOP), (6 → STOP), and (8 → STOP) constructs were all generated by converting the relevant TGG tryptophan codon in the GST-DPW plasmid to a TAA stop codon using the QuikChange system. The GST-ETLLDLDF, GST-SSLMDLADV, and GST-AALVDLDS constructs were each prepared by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides and ligating the double-stranded product into EcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-1. The pGEX plasmid encoding the final eight amino acids (RGYTLIDL) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ent1p fused to GST was kindly provided by Beverly Wendland (27.Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). All of the constructs and mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. GST and the various GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The standard induction protocol entailed shifting log-phase cultures (A 600 = ∼0.6) from 37 °C to room temperature and adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 3–5 h at room temperature with constant shaking, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm (JA-14 rotor) at 4 °C for 15 min and stored at −80 °C until used. GST fusion proteins were collected on glutathione Sepharose 4B after lysis of the bacteria in B-PER reagent (Pierce) and removal of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (JA-20 rotor) at 4 °C for 15 min. Where necessary, proteins were cleaved with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from GST while still immobilized on glutathione Sepharose. The conditions for the thrombin digestion were as recommended by the manufacturer, followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 25 μm. To prepare the TD-Sepharose, thrombin-cleaved TD was coupled onto CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B to a density of ∼5 mg/ml using standard procedures. Rat brain cytosol was prepared from either fresh or frozen rat brains (PelFreez) exactly as described previously (28.Traub L.M. Bannykh S.I. Rodel J.E. Aridor M. Balch W.E. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Before use, the cytosol was adjusted to 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged at 245,000 × g max (70,000 rpm, TLA-100.3 rotor) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove insoluble material. Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from fresh rat brain by standard procedures (29.Campbell C. Squicciarini J. Shia M. Pilch P.F. Fine R.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4420-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For the preparation of purified clathrin, a crude coat extract was prepared from clathrin-coated vesicles using 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 followed by gel filtration in 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (30.Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Clathrin-containing fractions were pooled, the clathrin trimers were concentrated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation, and then cages were assembled by dialysis against 100 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C. The association of AP-2, clathrin, and other endocytic accessory proteins with the various GST fusion proteins was assayed in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (assay buffer) in a final volume of 600 μl. Routinely, GST and the GST fusion proteins were first each immobilized on 50 μl of packed glutathione Sepharose to concentrations of ∼2–6 mg/ml. The immobilized proteins were then washed and resuspended to 100 μl in assay buffer. Rat brain cytosol was added, and the tubes were then incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with continuous gentle mixing. The Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g max for 1 min, and 30-μl aliquots of each supernatant were removed and adjusted to 100 μl with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After washing the Sepharose pellets four times each with ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS by centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated, and each pellet was resuspended to a volume of 150 μl in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Unless otherwise indicated, 10-μl aliquots, equivalent to 1200 of each supernatant and 115 of each pellet, were loaded on the gels. For the clathrin-cage binding experiments, preassembled cages were mixed with GST-DPW fusion proteins that had been centrifuged at 245,000 × g max for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The binding assays were performed in 100 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 100 μl. After 20 min at room temperature, the cages were recovered by centrifugation at 245,000 ×g max for 10 min, and then equal aliquots of the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Samples were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels prepared with an altered acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (30:0.4) ratio stock solution. The decreased cross-linking generally improves resolution but also affects the relative mobility of several proteins, most noticeably AP180 and epsin 1. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose in ice-cold 15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine. Blots were blocked overnight in 5% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and then portions were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in the individual figure legends. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Normal rat kidney cells were grown on 12-mm round glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were fixed either in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min or in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated in 10% normal goat serum, 0.2% saponin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with a mixture of affinity-purified anti-epsin 1 antibodies and mAb X22, mAb AP.6, or mAb 88 diluted in 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS. After ∼60 min at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with a mixture of goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 and sheep anti-rabbit Alexa 596 (Molecular Probes) conjugates diluted 1:250 in 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% saponin in PBS. After ∼30 min at room temperature, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted on Cytoseal. The central portion of rat epsin 1 (residues 249–401) contains eight repeats of the tripeptide motif aspartic acid-proline-tryptophan (DPW) (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This region, termed the DPW domain, interacts with the AP-2 adaptor complex by binding directly to the carboxyl-terminal appendage of the α subunit (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 31.Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

A. 1999; 96: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After a GST-DPW fusion protein is incubated with rat brain cytosol, a group of ∼100-kDa polypeptides associate with the sedimented glutathione-Sepharose (Fig.1 A, lane d). Immunoblotting with antibodies to the adaptor α and β subunits confirm the identity of these bands as the large subunits of AP-2 (Fig.1 B, lane d compared with lanes b andf). An anti-μ2 subunit antibody verifies the presence of this AP-2 subunit as well. The blots probed with the anti-adaptor β subunit antibody reveal that both the β1 chain of the AP-1 complex and the β2 chain of AP-2 are found with the GST-DPW fusion-protein pellet (Fig. 1 B, lane d). In rat brain sections, some epsin 1 staining has been observed in the perinuclear region and, when full-length epsin 1 was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the protein was also found in clathrin-coated structures at thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) (9.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because epsin binds to the carboxyl-terminal appendage of the α subunit of AP-2, targeting to the TGN could be via an analogous recognition site on the appendage domain of the γ subunit of the AP-1 adaptor complex. We therefore checked for the presence of AP-1 complexes bound to the epsin construct using an antibody against the γ subunit of AP-1 and, surprisingly, find that only limited amounts of the Golgi-adaptor associate with the GST-DPW (Fig. 1 C, lane d). The steady-state distribution of epsin 1 in normal rat kidney cells also indicates that only minor amounts of epsin 1 are associated with the clathrin-coated structures forming at the TGN (Fig. 2). In cells double-labeled for epsin 1 and AP-2, the staining patterns are almost identical (panels A and B). Cells labeled for both clathrin and epsin 1 (panels C and D) show that although almost all the peripheral clathrin-positive structures also contain epsin, the compact perinuclear clathrin population on the TGN is largely devoid of co-localizing epsin. This is evident despite the diffuse perinuclear epsin signal that corresponds to the soluble form of the protein. Staining of the AP-1 adaptor complex, concentrated at the TGN, is again clearly distinct from the staining pattern of epsin 1 (panels E and F). Together, these experiments suggest that AP-1 and AP-2 do not associate with the DPW domain of epsin 1 with similar affinities and instead argue that the bulk of the β1 subunit bound to the GST-DPW is most likely explained by the promiscuity of β1 subunit incorporation into brain AP-2 complexes noted previously by us (28.Traub L.M.

The relative lack of epsin recruitment onto the TGN agrees well with the absence of eps15R on the clathrin coats assembling at the TGN (35.Coda L. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci G. Sorkina T.

Methanol-fixed (A–D) or formaldehyde-fixed (E and F) normal rat kidney cells were double labeled with affinity-purified antibodies against epsin (B, D, and F) and either mAb AP.6, against the α subunit of AP-2 (A) or mAb X22 directed against the clathrin HC (C) or mAb 88, against the γ subunit of AP-1 (E). Arrowheadspoint to representative examples of co-localization of epsin with AP-2- and clathrin-containing structures. Notice that in addition to the epsin found concentrated at clathrin bud sites on the cell surface, a pool of soluble epsin is also visible in the central region of each cell (B, D, and F). Careful inspection indicates that this staining pattern is, in general, quite distinct from that of the clathrin/AP-1 assembled at the TGN, however.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the subunits of the AP-2 heterotetramer that associate with the immobilized GST-DPW fusion protein, a prominent ∼180-kDa protein is also found in the pellet (Fig. 1 A, lane d). The binding of both AP-2 and the ∼180-kDa protein is dependent on both the epsin portion of the fusion protein and cytosol as neither is found on the control GST Sepharose (lane b) or on GST-DPW Sepharose incubated without cytosol (lane f). To determine the identity of the large polypeptide, immunoblots were probed with antibodies against the clathrin heavy chain, AP180, and synaptojanin. Strong reactivity with the anti-clathrin antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane d) indicates that this protein is likely the clathrin heavy chain. Unlike clathrin, neither AP180 nor synaptojanin are found in the pellet (lane d), although both proteins are seen in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 1 C, lanes a and c), as expected. The simultaneous appearance of clathrin light chains in the pellet (Fig. 1 B, lane d) confirms the association of clathrin with the DPW domain of epsin 1. Incubating brain cytosol with increasing amounts of the GST-DPW fusion shows that the association of clathrin with epsin is dose-dependent, as is the binding of AP-2 (Fig. 3, lanes c–h). It is important to note, however, that although clathrin binding is still detectable when 25 μg of the GST-DPW fusion is immobilized (lane e), the association of clathrin trimers with the GST-DPW appears significantly more sensitive to dilution than the binding of soluble AP-2 (lanes d–h). The sequence 257LMDLADVF precedes the array of eight DPW repeats in the central portion of the rat epsin 1 molecule. A related sequence, 283LLDLMDAL is found in rat epsin 2 (TableI). These short regions of alternating aliphatic hydrophobic and acidic residues are similar to the clathrin-binding sequences found in the β1, β2, and β3 subunits of the adaptor complexes (36.Shih W. Galluser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37.Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S.

To test whether this region of epsin 1 facilitates the association with clathrin, we separately mutated the 257LMD or 260LADV sequences to alanines in the context of the GST-DPW fusion protein. Either substitution causes a dramatic reduction in clathrin binding (Fig. 4 A, lanes dand e) compared with the GST-DPW (lane c). By contrast, the association of AP-2 with the epsin mutants (lanes d and e) is indistinguishable from native fusion protein (lane c). This rules out the possibility that clathrin simply associates with epsin only indirectly by interacting solely with the bound AP-2 adaptor. It also argues against gro"
https://openalex.org/W2084814544,"The direct modulation of N-type calcium channels by G protein βγ subunits is considered a key factor in the regulation of neurotransmission. Some of the molecular determinants that govern the binding interaction of N-type channels and Gβγ have recently been identified (see, i.e., Zamponi, G.

Here we report that a protein of the presynaptic vesicle release complex, syntaxin 1A, mediates a crucial role in the tonic inhibition of N-type channels by Gβγ. When syntaxin 1A was coexpressed with (N-type) α1B + α2-δ + β1b channels in tsA-201 cells, the channels underwent a 18 mV negative shift in half-inactivation potential, as well as a pronounced tonic G protein inhibition as assessed by its reversal by strong membrane depolarizations. This tonic inhibition was dramatically attenuated following incubation with botulinum toxin C, indicating that syntaxin 1A expression was indeed responsible for the enhanced G protein modulation. However, when G protein βγ subunits were concomitantly coexpressed, the toxin became ineffective in removing G protein inhibition, suggesting that syntaxin 1A optimizes, rather than being required for G protein modulation of N-type channels. We also demonstrate that Gβγ physically binds to syntaxin 1A, and that syntaxin 1A can simultaneously interact with Gβγ and the synprint motif of the N-type channel II-III linker. Taken together, our experiments suggest a mechanism by which syntaxin 1A mediates a colocalization of G protein βγ subunits and N-type calcium channels, thus resulting in more effective G protein coupling to, and regulation of, the channel. Thus, the interactions between syntaxin, G proteins, and N-type calcium channels are part of the structural specialization of the presynaptic terminal. The direct modulation of N-type calcium channels by G protein βγ subunits is considered a key factor in the regulation of neurotransmission. Some of the molecular determinants that govern the binding interaction of N-type channels and Gβγ have recently been identified (see, i.e., Zamponi, G. W., Bourinet, E., Nelson, D., Nargeot, J., and Snutch, T. P. (1997)Nature 385, 442–446); however, little is known about cellular mechanisms that modulate this interaction.

Upon activation of G protein-coupled seven-helix transmembrane receptors, both N-type and P/Q-type channels undergo a pronounced voltage-dependent inhibition (26.Ikeda S.R. Schofield G. J.

This inhibition is likely caused by direct binding of G protein βγ subunits to the calcium channel α1subunit with 1:1 stoichometry, which results in a stabilization of the deep closed states of the channel (31.Patil P.G. deLeon M.

This effect can be reversed by strong membrane depolarizations, resulting in an apparent facilitation of calcium currents after application of depolarizing prepulses (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W.

Recent molecular biological evidence indicates that the G protein βγ subunits interact with the calcium channel α1 subunit at multiple points, in particular, the I-II linker and the carboxyl tail regions (34.Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35.DeWaard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P.

Catterall W.A Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cleavage of the synaptic vesicle release protein syntaxin 1A with botulinum toxin C1 (BTC1)1abolishes the ability of N-type channels to undergo G protein modulation (37.Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Syntaxin is a cytoplasmically oriented membrane protein that is involved in synaptic vesicle release triggered by the influx of calcium through voltage-dependent calcium channels. Proteolysis by BTC1 completely and irreversibly inhibits synaptic release. Because syntaxin 1A is known to physically bind to these channels (19.Sheng Z. Rettig T. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 20.Yokoyama C.T. Sheng Z. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6929-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Stanley and Mirotznik (37.Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggested that syntaxin 1A might facilitate the co-localization of Gβγ and the channel, but no direct evidence for this has been presented. Furthermore, because G protein modulation of transiently expressed N-type channels does not require coexpression with syntaxin 1A (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,34.Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), it is unclear why the cleavage of syntaxin 1A in the native neuronal environment would lead to the loss of G protein modulation. Here, we present evidence that syntaxin 1A augments, but is not required per se for G protein modulation of transiently expressed calcium channels. Human embryonic kidney cells do not endogenously express syntaxin 1A; however, coexpression of N-type calcium channels with Gβ1γ2 resulted in a pronounced inhibition of N-type currents. Upon coexpression of syntaxin 1A, N-type channels underwent a large tonic G protein inhibition even in the absence of exogenous G protein βγ subunits. This inhibition was sensitive to botulinum toxin C1. However, the effect of the toxin was abolished upon overexpresssion of exogenous Gβγ subunits. Biochemical data show that syntaxin 1A is able to physically interact concomitantly with both Gβγ and the calcium channel. Overall, our data are consistent with a model in which syntaxin 1A physically localizes free endogenous G protein βγ subunits into the vicinity of the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit, thus increasing the effective local Gβγ concentration near the channel and thereby facilitating the interactions between the channel and the G protein. P/Q-type calcium channels regulate syntaxin 1A expression (51.Sutton K.G. McRory J.E. Guthrie H. Murphy T.H. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which would in turn modulate tonic inhibition of N-type calcium channels by Gβγ. In that context, our data suggest a potential feedback mechanism by which expression of one calcium channel type regulates the activity of another. Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown in standard DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were grown to 85% confluence, split with trypsin-EDTA, and plated on glass coverslips at 10% confluence 12 h before transfection. Immediately prior to transfection, the medium was exchanged and a standard calcium phosphate protocol was used to transfect the cells with cDNAs encoding for calcium channel subunits (α1B + α2-δ + β1b), green fluorescent protein (EGFP;CLONTECH), and as appropriate with Gβ1, Gγ2, and/or syntaxin 1A. After 12 h, the cells were washed with fresh DMEM and allowed to recover for 12 h. Subsequently the cells were incubated at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–3 days prior to recording. For experiments examining protein levels of syntaxin 1A and Gβ, an analogous protocol was used; however, the cells were plated directly on the bottom of the culture dish. Immediately prior to recording, individual coverslips were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution comprised of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mmtetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with TEA-OH). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP v 6.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150–86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller, fire polished using a Narashige microforge, and showed typical resistances of 3–4 megaohms. The internal pipette solution contained 108 mm CsMS, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and fitted using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Steady state inactivation curves were fitted with the Boltzman equationI peak (normalized) = 1/(1 + exp((V − V h)z/25.6)) where V and V h are, respectively, the conditioning and the half-inactivation potential, and z is a slope factor.

A forward primer containing a 5′NotI restriction site (5′-GCGGCCGCATGAAGGACCGAACCCAGGAGCTCCGC-3′) and a reverse primer containing a 5′ KpnI restriction site (5′-GGTACCTTTCTATCCAAAGATGCCCCCGATGGTGG-3′) directed against the 5′ and 3′ sequences of rat syntaxin 1A were purchased from University Core DNA services (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Rat hypothalamus cDNA was kindly provided by Bob Winkfein. All PCR reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise stated. The PCR reaction solution, in a volume of 50 μl, consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, dNTPs (0.2 mm each), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of platinum Taq DNA polymerase, 20 pmol of each primer, and 50 ng of cDNA. Using a PTC-100HB thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA), the reaction was hot-started, and held at 94 °C for 2 min. 34 cycles were conducted, which consisted of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 65 °C, and extension for 1.25 min at 72 °C. The resultant syntaxin 1A DNA product was run on a 0.8% agarose gel, extracted, and purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction (Quigen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), ligated into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced to rule out PCR errors. The syntaxin 1A-T-Easy construct was digested byKpnI and NotI, and the syntaxin 1A DNA was ligated into pMT2SX for subsequent expression. cDNAs coding for bovine brain Gβ1 and Gγ2 in pBluescript II KS(-) were kindly provided by Dr. T. P. Snutch. The Gβ1-pBS construct was digested by SmaI andXbaI to excise Gβ1, which was then ligated into similarly digested pSL1180. This Gβ1-pSL1180 construct was then digested by KpnI and SalI, and the Gβ1 fragment was then ligated into the polycloning site of pMT2SX. The Gγ2-pBS construct was digested byEcoRV and XbaI to liberate Gγ2, which was then ligated into similarly digested pSL1180. This Gβ1-pSL1180 construct was then digested byKpnI and SalI, and the Gγ2 fragment was then ligated into the polycloning site of pMT2SX. The pMT2 constructs containing Gβ1 and Gγ2 were used for transient transfection of HEK cells. A forward primer containing an XhoI restriction site (5′-CACTCGAGAGGAGTTGACCAAGGATGAAGAGGAGATGG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CTATCTTGCGCGACGCTCGCCCTTGGG-3′) were used in PCR to amplify a segment of recombinant α1B cDNA corresponding to the synprint site (amino acids 718–963) using the same conditions as described for the PCR of syntaxin 1A. The resultant synprint DNA product was run on a 0.8% agarose gel, extracted and purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction (Qiagen), ligated into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and sequenced. The synprint-T-Easy construct was then digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into similarly digested bacterial expression vector pTrcHis C (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This construct was transformed into TOP10Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Induction and preparation of a cell lysate were performed using conditions adapted from the manufacturer. tsA-201 cells were transfected, as described above. Following the 2-day incubation at 28 °C, the DMEM media was washed off and 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added and the cells were incubated for 3 min. 8 ml of PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4-7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4) was added, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.3, 8% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 30 μg of leupeptin, 30 μg of pepstatin, 3 μg of aprotonin, 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by three rapid freeze-thaw cycles between a dry ice-methanol slurry and 37 °C water. The preparation was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and this supernatant was then spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was then treated with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue), and shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. The proteins were denatured at 95 °C for 1 min and loaded for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from the gel to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) at 30 V for 10 h. Transfer buffer was removed by two washes with PBS, and the membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk powder in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h. The volume of the blocking solution was reduced to 10 ml, and the primary antibody (mouse anti-syntaxin 1A (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) or rabbit anti-Gβγ (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA)) was added at a concentration of 1:1000. After 2 h of incubation, the membrane was washed twice with PBST for 10 min and twice with PBS for 10 min, and subsequently incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, or goat anti-rabbit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2% skim milk powder in PBST at a concentration of 1:5000 for 2 h. The membrane was again washed twice with PBST for 10 min and twice with PBS for 10 min. Following the final wash, the blot was subjected to chemiluminescence analysis using ECL plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected on film, or via Storm Scan 860. Rat hippocampi were hand homogenized with a Teflon-coated homogenizer in 0.32m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 μm microcystin, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (2 ml/hippocampus). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g and the supernatant collected and subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g (4 °C). The pellet containing the synaptic proteins was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 4.5 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 μm microcystin, 1 μmokadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following solubilization, large membrane fragments were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant is a crude hippocampal homogenate containing synaptic proteins. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 were prepared as described previously (49.Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A. Bennett M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins encoding the cytoplasmic portions of syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 were constructed in the vector pGEX-KG (50.Guan K.L. Dickson J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) and expressed in AB1899 strain of E. coli. After induction of expression with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranside for 5 h, the bacteria were suspended in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and lysed by two passages through a French press (Spectronic Instruments Inc.). The fusion protein was recovered by binding of the GST domain to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The fusion protein beads were washed extensively and finally resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 4.5 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically at constant voltage from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm) in 20 mmTris, 150 mm glycine, 12% methanol. Transferred proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding using 5% milk, 0.15% Tween 20, PBS solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.3)) and incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:1000). The membranes were washed four times in the above milk/Tween 20/PBS solution and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase. Antigen was detected using chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands were visualized following exposure of the membranes to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP. Alternatively, for the synprint-syntaxin 1A-Gβγ binding assay, bacterial cell lysate of the 6×His-synprint peptide was batch-bound to 50% (v/v) ProBond Ni2+-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and washed four times with three buffers of pH levels 7.8, 6.0, and 5.5, containing 20 mm Na3PO4 and 500 mm NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The beads were then washed and equilibrated with TBST-Ca (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 15 μm CaCl2). Bound 6×His fusion protein from a fraction of the beads was eluted and quantified by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The 6×His fusion protein bound to beads was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 40 μg of rat hippocampal homogenate; bound proteins were subsequently eluted and immunoassayed for both Gβγ and syntaxin 1A. Before loading on SDS-PAGE, protein samples were treated with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, rotated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C, denatured at 95 °C for 1 min, and loaded. Transfer from SDS-PAGE to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequent immunodetection was performed as described above. It is well established that N-type calcium channels transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney tsA-201 (HEK) cells are subject to potent inhibition by G protein βγ subunits upon either activation of seven helix transmembrane receptors (33.Hamid J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), or via transient overexpression of Gβγ (38.Herlitze S. Hockermann G.H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39.Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). One characteristic feature of this type of inhibition is its reversal following a strong membrane depolarization (termed facilitation). Such an experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. In the absence of exogenous Gβγ, application of a strong depolarizing prepulse (+150 mV, 50 ms) to N-type (α1B + β1b + α2-δ) channels has little effect on peak current amplitude, or current waveform. However, upon cotransfection with Gβ1γ2, peak current amplitude is increased by almost 2-fold subsequent to application of the prepulse, thus reflecting relief of the tonic inhibition of the channel induced by Gβ1γ2. The experiments of Stanley and Mirotznik (37.Stanley E.F. Mirotznik R.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) suggested that syntaxin 1A might be a prerequisite for G protein modulation of N-type calcium channels, and if so, this would imply that HEK cells should endogenously express syntaxin 1A. To examine this possibility, we carried out an immunoblot for syntaxin 1A in HEK cells under several different conditions. As seen in Fig.1 B, syntaxin 1A could only be detected when transfected, indicating that syntaxin 1A is not present endogenously in HEK cells. In Fig. 1 B, we also see that syntaxin 1A expression is not triggered by overexpression of Gβγ or secondarily by expression of N-type calcium channels as described recently for P/Q-type calcium channels (51.Sutton K.G. McRory J.E. Guthrie H. Murphy T.H. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Under the same experimental conditions, we could not detect any expression of nSec-1 or SNAP-25, even following transfection with syntaxin 1A (data not shown), indicating that HEK cells lack many of the proteins responsible for vesicle release in neurons, and that the exogenous expression of syntaxin 1A does not result in the concomitant expression of other proteins important for vesicle release. Shown in Fig. 1 C, syntaxin 1A transfection did not mediate a detectable change in the amount of endogenous Gβγ present in HEK cells. However, this result needs to be viewed cautiously, because high endogenous Gβγ levels could mask small increases in exogenous Gβγ, and Western blot analysis does not evaluate how much Gβγ is complexed with Gα subunits in the cell. Overall, the data shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the presence of syntaxin 1A, or SNAP-25 and nSec-1, is not required for N-type channels to undergo G protei"

Regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics include the Rho-like small GTP-binding proteins and their exchange factors. Kalirin is a brain-specific protein, first identified through its interaction with peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase. In this study, we cloned rat Kalirin-7, a 7-kilobase mRNA form of Kalirin. Kalirin-7 contains nine spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl homology domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain. We found that the majority of Kalirin-7 protein is associated with synaptosomal membranes, but a fraction is cytosolic. We also detected higher molecular weight Kalirin proteins. In rat cerebral cortex, Kalirin-7 is highly enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. In primary cultures of neurons, Kalirin-7 is detected in spine-like structures, while other forms of Kalirin are visualized in the cell soma and throughout the neurites.

Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar). Kalirin, a Dbl family member, was first identified as an interactor with the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of membrane peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase, an important neuropeptide-processing enzyme (9.Alam M.R.

Northern blot analysis identified several forms of Kalirin mRNA, with expression restricted to the central nervous system and highest levels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The Dbl homology (DH)1 domain of Kalirin, with its adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, is conserved among all Dbl family members (Fig. 1). Several Dbl family members, including Ost (11.Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Tiam (12.Ehler E. van Leeuwen F. Collard J.G. Salinas P.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), are expressed in the brain, but only Kalirin is restricted to the central nervous system. AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells overexpressing one form of Kalirin (Kalirin-8) and peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase developed longer and more branched neuritic processes (10.Alam M.R.

Both AtT-20 and Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing Kalirin-8 displayed rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton (13.Mains R.E. Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Back N. Hand T.A. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2929-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Along with its DH and PH domains, Kalirin-8 has nine spectrin-like repeats, an Src homology 3 domain, and two putative PEST sequences (Fig. 1). A human protein, DUO, identified through its interaction with Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (14.Colomer V. Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Duan K. Cooper J.K. Lanahan A. Lyford G. Worley P. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is 98% identical with rat Kalirin-8 over the overlapping region but differs from Kalirin-8 at both its NH2- and COOH-terminal ends. Kalirin and DUO are closely related to human TRIO, an interactor with LAR, a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase thought to be a regulator of cell-matrix interactions (15.Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). TRIO has a structure similar to that of Kalirin but is larger and contains additional functional domains (Fig. 1). UNC-73, a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of Kalirin and TRIO, is a regulator of the cytoskeleton during cell and growth cone migration and is required for axon guidance (16.Steven R. Kubiseski T.J. Zheng H. Kulkarni S. Mancillas J. Ruiz Morales A. Hogue C.W. Pawson T. Culotti J. Cell. 1998; 92: 785-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Two forms of UNC-73 have been identified; UNC-73B has a domain structure similar to Kalirin-8, while UNC-73A contains an additional DH and PH domain (Fig.1). Little is known about the natural forms of Dbl family proteins and their functions in neurons, since the majority of studies have utilized transfected cells, and endogenous proteins have been difficult to detect. We first searched for a form of rat Kalirin equivalent to human DUO. We demonstrate that a 7-kb transcript encodes a rat protein (Kalirin-7) equivalent to human DUO. Using a general Kalirin antiserum, we identify a family of endogenous Kalirin proteins in adult rat brain. Using an antiserum specific to the COOH terminus of Kalirin-7, we show that Kalirin-7 is highly enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction. We use cultured neurons to localize Kalirin-7 to spine-like structures and show that other forms of Kalirin are localized in the cell soma and neurites. We explore the ability of Kalirin-7 and its DH-PH domain to induce formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling by transient expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and demonstrate that the DH-PH domain is an active guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1. Kalirin-7 may tether membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, potentially providing a link between postsynaptic membrane signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements involved in neurite growth and synaptic function.

The plasmid encoding constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1-Q61L) (5.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Anirvan Ghosh (Johns Hopkins). Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Biology Core. Rat cerebral cortex cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ mRNA with an oligo-(dT)15 primer (Promega). A 900-bp PCR product was generated by amplification with a Kalirin-8 sense primer (nt 4071–4092) and an antisense primer 5′-GGTCTAGACGGCTAACCCGGTCAGCT-3′ (rat nt 4978–4960)-basedHomo sapiens EST T74341, which included an XbaI site (underlined). The PCR product was subcloned and sequenced. A cDNA encoding full-length Kalirin-7 was constructed by replacing the 3′-end of Kalirin-8 (with the P-CIP10a 5′-end (2.Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar)) with the 3′-end of Kalirin-7. The PCR product was digested with NsiI (nt 4316) and XbaI, and the 662-bp fragment was isolated for subcloning into pBS.Kalirin-8 digested with the same two enzymes to generate pBS.Kalirin-7. The mammalian expression vector pSCEP.Myc-Kalirin-7 was constructed in a similar manner: a 0.7-kbNsiI (nt 4316)-NotI (3′-MCS) fragment isolated from pBS.Kalirin-7 was subcloned into pSCEP.Myc-Kalirin-8 cut with the same two enzymes. Another mammalian expression vector, pEAK10.His-Myc-Kalirin-7, was constructed by excising the entire insert from pSCEP.Myc-Kalirin-7 with NcoI and NotI and inserting it into pEAK10.His (Edge Biosystems) digested withBspLU11I and NotI. The DNA fragment encoding the DH-PH domain of Kalirin-8 (amino acids 1231–1575) was generated by PCR amplification of Kalirin-8 (nt 3715–4749) with sense primer 5′-GCTCTAGACATATGGCCATGGGGTTCAGACCGGGAGGTCA and antisense primer 5′-GGGAAAAGCGGCCGCTTATTTGGCTGGTGTTTTTGG, bearing the restriction sites for NcoI (underlined), and NotI (double underlined). pEAK10.His-Myc-DH-PH was constructed by inserting the NcoI–NotI fragment of the DH-PH PCR product into pEAK10.His-Myc cut with Bsp LU11 I andNotI. All constructs were verified by sequencing. PCR sense primers were as follows: nt 1–27 of P-CIP10a, 5′-GCCCGGTCTCTCAGGGCAGCCATAATG-3′; nt 327–352 of P-CIP10b, 5′-CGCAGACGCCCTCCCCCAGTCATGAA-3′; nt 98–123 of human DUO, 5′-GGGATGACGGACCGCTTCTGGGACCA-3′. Antisense primer was KAL 7-stop, nucleotides 4951–4925 of P-CIP10a (5′-AGTCCCAGGCTGCGCGCTAAACGTAAG-3′). Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the resultant cDNA was amplified using the High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were denatured for 15 s at 94 °C, annealed for 30 s at 62 °C, and extended for 4 min at 68 °C for a total of 30 cycles. Extension times were increased 20 s per cycle for the last 20 cycles. A DUO-specific probe for use in Northern blot analysis was generated by RT-PCR. Total or poly(A)+ cerebral cortical RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT). Amplification was carried out with Kalirin-7-specific sense (5′-GTGACAAGGATGGCAACCTT-3′ (nt 4865–4884)) and antisense (5′-GGAAACATGTTGCCCTCTGA-3′ (nt 4987–4967)) primers (nt numbers are for DUO). This 122-bp fragment was used to probe a Northern blot of rat cerebral cortex poly(A)+mRNA. Rabbit polyclonal antisera JH2580–2582 were generated against Kalirin spectrin-like repeats 4–7 (rat Kalirin-8-(517–976)) (4.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of these antisera did not alter the pattern observed on Western blots. Rabbit polyclonal antisera JH2958 and JH2959 were generated at Covance (Denver, PA) by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide comprising the COOH-terminal 19 residues of rat Kalirin-7 (1625GNLVPRWHLGPGDPFSTYV1644) cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde (2 mg of peptide, 5 mg of hemocyanin). This peptide was synthesized by Dr. Henry Keutmann (Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital). Following ammonium sulfate precipitation, JH2959 was affinity-purified using the rat Kalirin-7 COOH-terminal peptide linked to Affi-Gel 10. Affinity-purified antibody was eluted with 0.2 m glycine HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 2.3, immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl, dialyzed into 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and used at a dilution of 1:100. Parietal cortex and liver were dissected from adult female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan), and tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mg/ml), and a protease inhibitor mixture (lima bean trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), benzamidine (16 μg/ml), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml)) with five strokes of a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Large debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge at 450,000 × g max for 15 min to obtain crude soluble and crude particulate fractions. Extracts of rat brain cortex and olfactory bulb were fractionated in isotonic buffer according to the method of Huttneret al. (18.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). An equal percentage of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Postsynaptic densities were purified from brain cortex and olfactory bulb from 10 female adult Holtzman rats (Harlan) using the protocol described by Carlinet al. (19.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) with the exception that the homogenization buffer A contained 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research). Briefly, cells grown on glass slides for 3 days to 40–60% confluence were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/4-cm2 (pEAK10.His-Myc-DH-PH, pEAK10.His-Myc-Kalirin-7, or a plasmid carrying preproneuropeptide Y (20.Milgram S.L. Chang E.Y. Mains R.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 837-846PubMed Google Scholar)) and 4 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of complete serum-free medium for 5 h, after which they were fed with growth medium. After 1 day, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing no serum for 16 h. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm NaPi, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (17.Milgram S.L. Kho S.T Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell morphology was evaluated by analyzing approximately 30 transfected cells and counting the fraction of cells displaying a particular phenotype. Protein expression levels in transfected cells were compared by quantifying the intensities of immunofluorescence upon detection with Myc antibody, using the Scion image software. Olfactory bulbs dissected from postnatal rat brains were dissociated by treatment with porcine pancreas trypsin (Sigma) (3 mg/ml) and Benzonase (EM Science) (4 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were plated onto polylysine-coated plastic slides and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine and 10% NuSerum. Plating medium was replaced with serum-free Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% N-2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 mml-glutamine (Sigma), and 25 μml-glutamic acid (Sigma) after 24 h at 37 °C (21.Cigola E. Volpe B.T. Lee J.W. Franzen L. Baker H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7638-7649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 4–8 days in culture, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained as described above. Rat cerebral hemispheres dissected from embryonic day 17 or 18 rat embryos were dissociated by treatment with papain (Sigma) (200 units) for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were plated onto polylysine- and laminin-coated glass coverslips and grown in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% B-27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.1 mml-glutamine (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. After 7 days in culture, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained as described above. GST-Rac1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione affinity resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For expression of DH-PH, pEAK-Rapid cells (Edge Biosystems) were transiently transfected with pEAK10.His-Myc.DH-PH using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DH-PH protein was enriched using the Talon affinity resin (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The GDP/GTP exchange assay was performed according to Debant et al. (15.Debant A.

Human DUO (14.Colomer V. Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Duan K. Cooper J.K. Lanahan A. Lyford G. Worley P. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and rat Kalirin-8 are >98% identical in their 1612-amino acid region of overlap, differing at only 22 positions (Fig.2 A). This degree of identity strongly suggests that DUO and Kalirin are encoded by equivalent human and rat genes, respectively. Human DUO and rat Kalirin-8 differ at their NH2- and COOH-terminal ends. Human DUO has a 22-residue N terminus preceding the homologous region, while two different rat Kalirin N termini (10a, 4 residues; 10b, 24 residues) were identified (10.Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The three NH2-terminal sequences share no sequence similarity. Recombinant Kalirin-8 included the 4-residue N terminus, because transcripts with this start site were more efficiently expressed following in vitrotranscription/translation. At its COOH terminus, DUO contains 20 residues not present in Kalirin-8, while Kalirin-8 extends 283 residues beyond the 3′-divergence point (Fig. 2 A). To find out if rats express a form of Kalirin equivalent to human DUO, we performed RT-PCR on rat cerebral cortex poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 2 B). A cDNA fragment of the predicted size was amplified with a sense primer common to human DUO and rat Kalirin-8 and an antisense primer specific to human DUO (based on human EST T74341). EST T74341 is identical to Kalirin and DUO up to their 3′-divergence point, after which it is identical to DUO. The polypeptide encoded by the PCR product was identical to Kalirin-8 until the 3′-divergence point, after which the 20 COOH-terminal residues were identical to the corresponding region of human DUO and were followed by a stop codon. The 5′-ends of Kalirin-8 and DUO diverge at exactly the same point at which the two previously identified Kalirin 5′-ends (10a and 10b) diverged. To determine which of the three potential Kalirin 5′-ends encode Kalirin mRNAs with the DUO-like 3′-end, we amplified cDNA with sense primers specific for each of the three 5′-ends (10a, 10b, DUO) and a DUO-specific 3′ antisense primer. Products of the predicted size (5 kb) were obtained with all three primer pairs, indicating that all three 5′-ends were present in mRNAs that include a DUO-type 3′-end. Southern analysis using a cDNA probe to Kalirin-spectrin domains 1–3 (nt 580–1531) was used to confirm that the amplified products correspond to Kalirin (Fig. 2 C). Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the sizes of the Kalirin mRNAs including various regions of Kalirin (Fig.2 D). A probe specific for the DUO-type 3′-end detected 5.0- and 7.0-kb Kalirin transcripts and no larger forms. Hybridization with a probe corresponding to the first three spectrin-like repeats of Kalirin (spectrin 1–3) revealed that the 7-kb transcripts, as well as several longer transcripts, contained this region, while the 5-kb transcript did not. A probe specific for the 10b 5′-end also identified 7-kb transcripts (Fig. 2 D). Based on the PCR data shown in Fig. 2 C, 7-kb Kalirin transcripts could also include the DUO- and 10a 5′-ends. Since the functional significance of the different 5′-ends is not yet apparent, the three Kalirin proteins encoded by the 7-kb mRNA will be referred to collectively as Kalirin-7 (Fig. 2 E). A full-length Kalirin-7 cDNA was constructed by joining the 5′-end of Kalirin-8, bearing the 10a 5′-end (10.Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with the DUO-type 3′-fragment. The open reading frame of Kalirin-7 encodes a protein of 1644 residues (190 kDa). The Kalirin-7 protein includes the 10a sequence, nine spectrin-like repeats, a DH domain, and a PH domain (Fig. 2 E). It lacks the Src homology 3 domain present in Kalirin-8 and contains instead a unique 20-residue COOH terminus. The final COOH-terminal 3 residues correspond to the recognition motif for proteins with PDZ domains ((S/T)XV), suggesting that Kalirin-7 and Kalirin-5, unlike larger Kalirin proteins, could interact with such proteins. Two sets of antisera were used to detect endogenous Kalirin-related proteins. Kalirin-spectrin antisera JH2581 and JH2582 were raised against recombinant spectrin-like repeats 4 to 7 of Kalirin (13.Mains R.E. Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Back N. Hand T.A. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2929-2937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested the cross-reactivity of the Kalirin-spectrin antibodies with the homologous fragments of TRIO and Ost. The Kalirin-spectrin antisera had little (JH2581) or no (JH2582) cross-reactivity with the corresponding regions of TRIO and Ost (Fig.3 A). We used a 19-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique COOH terminus of Kalirin-7 to generate Kalirin-7-specific antisera (JH2958 and JH2959). The two Kalirin-spectrin antisera and a Kalirin-7 antiserum were used to detect Kalirin proteins in crude soluble and particulate fractions of rat brain cortex homogenate (Fig. 3 B). Both Kalirin-spectrin antisera detected a family of proteins in the soluble and particulate fractions. The bands recognized by both Kalirin-spectrin antisera and not present in the liver, a tissue that does not express detectable levels of Kalirin mRNA by Northern blotting (10.Alam M.R. Johnson R.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), were assumed to represent forms of Kalirin: 115, 190, 370, 420, and 470 kDa (Fig. 3 B). The 150-kDa protein is considered nonspecific because it is not detected by both Kalirin-spectrin antisera and corresponds to a cross-reactive protein in liver. The 190-kDa Kalirin protein was enriched in the particulate fraction. The Kalirin-7 antibodies detected a major 190-kDa protein and a minor 115-kDa protein (Fig. 3 B). Proteins of the same size were detected by both Kalirin-spectrin antisera. The 190-kDa protein detected by the Kalirin-7 antiserum is the mass predicted for Kalirin-7, and the 115-kDa protein is small enough to be encoded by the Kalirin-5 transcripts. Staining by the Kalirin-7 antiserum was eliminated by inclusion of excess antigen (Fig. 3 C). Since Kalirin-7 is enriched in the particulate fraction (Fig. 3 B), the abundance of Kalirin-7 in extracts varies with the extraction conditions used. In particulate fractions of adult rat cerebral cortex, Kalirin-7 was one of the most abundant Kalirin proteins. To our surprise, we found it difficult to detect a protein with the mass of Kalirin-8 (217 kDa), suggesting that Kalirin-8 is not an abundant isoform. To confirm the identity of this 190-kDa protein as Kalirin-7, we performed an immunodepletion experiment (Fig. 3 D). Since we used a crude soluble fraction of the rat brain to reduce background problems during immunoprecipitation, Kalirin-7 was not enriched in the starting material (IN-Cortex-S). Kalirin-7 antibody was incubated with the sample, and antibody-bound proteins were collected with protein A-agarose beads. Incubation with the Kalirin-7 antibody specifically depleted the 190-kDa Kalirin protein from the brain homogenate, while the other Kalirin-related proteins remained in the flow-through fraction (F.T.). Preincubation of the Kalirin-7 antiserum with antigenic peptide or use of preimmune serum prevented immunoprecipitation of the 190-kDa protein, demonstrating that binding to the antibody was specific. Further work is in progress to uncover the identity of the other Kalirin forms; the 115-kDa protein specifically bound to the Kalirin-7 antibody could represent the protein encoded by the Kalirin-5 transcript. Based on Western blot analysis of cerebral cortex homogenates, Kalirin-7 is a major form of Kalirin in the rat brain and is recovered primarily from particulate fractions. To further investigate its localization, we used differential centrifugation to prepare fractions enriched in different organelles (Fig.4 A) (18.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar); antibodies to specific marker proteins were used to verify the identity of each subcellular compartment. We used a method optimized for the isolation of synaptosomes, pinched off presynaptic boutons with their enclosed synaptic vesicles and cytosol (18.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar); the apposed postsynaptic membrane remains strongly attached (18.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P.

As expected, using the Kalirin-spectrin antibody, multiple Kalirin proteins were identified in the soluble, cytosolic fraction (fraction S3). Fraction P3, enriched in internal membranous organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (as indicated by BiP and TGN38 markers, respectively), contained more Kalirin-7 than did the cytosolic fraction (S3); the other forms of Kalirin were equally abundant in P3 and S3. The crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) was subjected to hypotonic lysis and then centrifuged to pellet a fraction enriched in synaptosomal plasma membranes and attached postsynaptic membranes (LP1).

https://openalex.org/W1975347125,"Abstract Micron-sized sensors were used to monitor glucose and oxygen levels in the extracellular space of single islets of Langerhans in real-time. At 10 mm glucose, oscillations in intraislet glucose concentration were readily detected. Changes in glucose level correspond to changes in glucose consumption by glycolysis balanced by mass transport into the islet. Oscillations had a period of 3.1 ± 0.2 min and amplitude of 0.8 ± 0.1 mm glucose (n = 21). Superimposed on these oscillations were faster fluctuations in glucose level during the periods of low glucose consumption. Oxygen level oscillations that were out of phase with the glucose oscillations were also detected. Oscillations in both oxygen and glucose consumption were strongly dependent upon extracellular Ca2+ and sensitive to nifedipine. Simultaneous measurements of glucose with intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) revealed that decreases in [Ca2+]i preceded increases in glucose consumption by 7.4 ± 2.1 s during an oscillation (n = 9). Conversely, increases in [Ca2+]i preceded increases in oxygen consumption by 1.5 ± 0.2 s (n = 4). These results suggest that during oscillations, bursts of glycolysis begin after Ca2+ has stopped entering the cell. Glycolysis stimulates further Ca2+ entry, which in turn stimulates increases in respiration. The data during oscillation are in contrast to the time course of events during initial exposure to glucose. Under these conditions, a burst of oxygen consumption precedes the initial rise in [Ca2+]i. A model to explain these results is described."

To understand better the binding mechanism, we developed a sensitive membrane binding assay using lens plasma membranes and recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins conjugated to a small fluorescent tag (Alexa350®). Both αA and αB homopolymer complexes, as well as a reconstituted 3:1 heteromeric complex, bind to lens membranes in a specific, saturable, and partially irreversible manner that is sensitive to both time and temperature. The amount of α-crystallin that binds to the membrane increases under acidic pH conditions and upon removal of exposed intrinsic membrane protein domains but is not affected at high ionic strength, suggesting that α-crystallin binds to the fiber cell plasma membranes mainly through hydrophobic interactions.

First, αA-crystallin is expressed almost exclusively in lens fiber cells, whereas αB-crystallin is expressed strongly in both the lens and non-ocular tissues such as heart, liver, and brain (6.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Second, a study utilizing two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that αA-crystallin is more stable than αB-crystallin with respect to the denaturing effects of extreme temperature, pH, and chaotropic agents such as urea and guanidine (7.Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, studies using knockout mice suggest major differences in the in vivo roles of αA- and αB-crystallins. Deletion of αB-crystallin has little effect on lens morphology; however, the removal of αA-crystallin causes early onset cataract associated with accumulation of inclusion bodies containing large amounts of αB-crystallin (8.Brady J.P.

From these observations, it seems likely that these two subunits are not functionally equivalent and that there may be some functional significance in the combination of αA and αB subunits found in the native complex.Despite these observations, the biological roles of α-crystallin are not yet firmly established. It is thought to give vertebrate lenses their refractive and transparency properties through short range ordering, which could result from the repulsive behavior of the native protein complex (10.Xia J.Z.

In addition, α-crystallin has been shown to inhibit stress-induced aggregation of proteins in vitro, reflecting a potential in vivo role in maintenance of lens transparency (14.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl.

Finally, α-crystallin is known to bind subcellular elements such as intermediate filaments and plasma membranes (19.Liang P. Macrae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21.FitzGerald P.G. Graham D. Curr.

Cenedella R.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).It is well known that the amount of soluble α-crystallin found in the cytoplasm of lens fiber cells falls steadily with increasing age and that this change is mirrored by an increase in the water-insoluble fraction of α-crystallin (24.Babizhayev M.A. Bours J. Utikal K.J. Ophthal. Res. 1996; 28: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25.Bessems G.J. De M.B. Bours J. Hoenders H.J. Exp.

Fodisch H.J. Hockwin O. Ophthal. Res. 1987; 19: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The prevailing explanation for these observations is that the amount of soluble α-crystallin available to bind partially denatured proteins becomes depleted with age, and the resulting high molecular mass aggregates slowly become insoluble. Interestingly, the amount of crystallin protein, especially α-crystallin, bound to the membrane also increases dramatically with increasing age and/or cataract formation (29.Boyle D.L. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30.Cenedella R.J. Fleschner C.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It could be that the progressive insolubilization of α-crystallin is due, in part, to increased membrane binding that is also associated with aging and cataract formation. These observations suggest that increased membrane association of α-crystallin may be closely correlated with the loss of transparency in the lens, thus underscoring the need to understand this interaction in greater detail.To date, few studies have examined the in vitro conditions that promote binding of α-crystallin to membranes. In a previous study, the interaction of native α-crystallin with membranes was shown to be markedly sensitive to ionic strength while reaching an optimum at 37 °C and a pH of 7.5 (22.Mulders J.W. Stokkermans J. Leunissen J.A. Benedetti E.L. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, saturable binding to protein-free phospholipid vesicles has been observed, but the measured capacity is reduced dramatically upon incorporation of cholesterol (31.Borchman D. Tang D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33.Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been postulated that αB-crystallin is largely unable to bind membranes in the absence of αA-crystallin (20.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23.Fleschner C.R. Cenedella R.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).To understand better the nature of α-crystallin membrane association and the relative contribution of each α-crystallin subunit to membrane binding, we developed a binding assay using extracted bovine cortical fiber plasma membranes and recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins. The effects of time, temperature, ionic strength, and pH on the membrane association of both homopolymeric complexes and the 3:1 heteromeric complex were compared. In addition, the reversibility, binding capacities, and binding affinities for each complex were determined. Our results show that α-crystallin homopolymeric complexes composed of αA- or αB-crystallin interact with lens fiber cell plasma membranes in a similar but distinct manner and that membrane binding of the heteromeric complex containing αA and αB subunits in a 3:1 molar ratio differs from either of the homopolymeric complexes.DISCUSSIONα-Crystallin is known to associate with lenticular plasma membranes in vivo as well as in vitro, and the amount bound increases with both age and the onset of cataract (29.Boyle D.L. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,30.Cenedella R.J. Fleschner C.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin also shows an increasing tendency to become insoluble during aging and/or at the onset of cataract (24.Babizhayev M.A. Bours J. Utikal K.J. Ophthal. Res. 1996; 28: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25.Bessems G.J. De M.B. Bours J. Hoenders H.J. Exp.

Fodisch H.J. Hockwin O. Ophthal. Res. 1987; 19: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Given this correlation between cataract formation and increased binding of α-crystallin to the plasma membrane complex, it is important to understand how this process is regulated in lens cells. In the present report, we have examined some fundamental binding properties of lens αA- and αB-crystallins.Human αA- and αB-crystallin as homopolymers and in a reconstituted 3:1 heteromeric complex show saturable binding to lenticular fiber cell plasma membranes (Fig. 2). These observations are in contrast to previous reports that suggested that αA-crystallin but not αB-crystallin was the only subunit involved with membrane association (20.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23.Fleschner C.R. Cenedella R.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our results also show that this interaction is sensitive to time and temperature, collectively suggesting that binding is specific in nature (Fig. 3, A and D). In fact, we observed a significant enhancement of binding at temperatures above 37 °C. It is unclear whether this increase is due to α-crystallin's strong affinity for heat-stressed proteins, presumably including intrinsic membrane proteins, or if it results from a phase transition of lens lipids at high temperatures.In addition, we show that binding is not affected by high ionic strength at physiological pH. This suggests that binding is mediated mostly by hydrophobic interactions presumably involving either the fatty acid core of the membrane bilayer or the buried hydrophobic regions of the intrinsic membrane proteins still present in the membrane preparation (Fig. 3 B). We also demonstrate that binding increases at pH values below pH 7.0, which is in contrast to a previous study in which native α-crystallin was reported to have optimum binding at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3 C) (22.Mulders J.W. Stokkermans J. Leunissen J.A. Benedetti E.L. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We observed a significant enhancement of binding, especially with the reconstituted 3:1 heteromeric complex, at pH 5.0, and this increased binding can be eliminated by increasing the salt concentration. This suggests that the salt sensitivity at low pH is due to either the introduction of electrostatic interactions or the elimination of electrostatic repulsion with some part of the membrane. The degree of enhancement is different for the three α-crystallin complexes, which further implies that the ionizable group is within the protein complex itself rather than on the membrane. In addition, the point at which pH sensitivity is observed for αA- and αB-crystallin can be predicted by their theoretical isoelectric pH values of 5.77 and 6.76, respectively. Despite the sensitivity to ionic strength at low pH, we believe that the interaction between α-crystallin and the plasma membrane is mediated mostly through hydrophobic interactions rather than electrostatic interactions in vivo.Our data also suggest that intact α-crystallin complexes are not in equilibrium between the membrane-bound and soluble phases. If this were the case, >99% removal of the bound fluorescent α-crystallin should be possible when competed with a large excess of nonconjugated α-crystallin. Rather, it appears that once on the membrane, some fraction of the subunits is not exchangeable with subunits comprising soluble α-crystallin complexes (Fig. 5). We propose that the conjugated α-crystallin removed by competition with unlabeled α-crystallin reflects exchange of subunits between Alexa350®-conjugated complexes associated with the membrane and nonconjugated complexes in solution. According to this model, the nonexchangeable subunits become buried in the membrane bilayer such that they are irreversibly associated. Another interesting observation is that different percentages of αA- and αB-crystallin are removable. If subunit exchange is the mechanism by which fluorescent α-crystallin is being released from the membrane, then these results suggest that bound αA- and αB-crystallin have a different number of subunits in direct contact with the membrane. This could occur if either the quaternary structures of the complexes are significantly different while bound or if αA-crystallin simply embeds itself deeper into the membrane than αB-crystallin, resulting in fewer exchangeable subunits.It is difficult to compare the calculated binding capacities of each homopolymer and the reconstituted 3:1 heteromeric complex for lens plasma membrane in the present study with those reported previously. In protein-free synthetic vesicles containing 50 mol % cholesterol, the binding capacity was approximately 40 ng of native α-crystallin/μg of lipid (33.Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, Ifeanyi and Takemoto (20.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) measured a binding capacity of 44 ng/μg of membrane protein using purified lens αA-crystallin and lens membranes prepared in a manner similar to that used in the present study but quantified by the Bradford dye binding assay rather than total dry weight. Using the Bradford assay on the membranes used in the present study, we calculate a binding capacity of 87 ng of αA-crystallin/μg of membrane protein (data not shown). Because previous studies utilized α-crystallins purified from adult cow lenses, differences in binding capacity could reflect post-translational changes known to accumulate in lens proteins which would not be represented in the recombinant human proteins used in the present study (43.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44.Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Sun Y. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12494-12502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Takemoto L. Horwitz J. Emmons T. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Trypsinization of the membranes was performed to determine the relative contribution of exposed protein domains on the binding of α-crystallin to the membrane. Previous studies have shown that brief treatment of lens membrane preparations with trypsin results in cleavage of the presumed cytoplasmic loops of MP26, the major intrinsic membrane protein (46.Keeling P. Johnson K. Sas D. Klukas K. Donahue P. Johnson R. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 74: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With both αB-crystallin and especially with the 3:1 heteromeric complex, the binding capacity to trypsinized membranes was increased markedly (Fig. 7, B andC), suggesting that exposed intrinsic membrane protein domains actually decrease the amount of α-crystallin that can bind to the membrane. As membrane proteins in lens fiber cells are thought to contribute a large percentage of the lens membrane mass, we consider it likely that the apparent increase in binding capacity of trypsinized compared with untreated membranes reflects enhanced access of α-crystallin complexes to the lipid bilayer, although we cannot rule out the possibility that trypsinization creates damaged proteins to which α-crystallin could potentially bind. Given the insensitivity of α-crystallin binding to increased ionic strength at physiologic pH, the apparent enhancement of binding capacity following trypsinization of membranes, and the published reports on the saturable association of α-crystallin with protein-free synthetic phospholipid vesicles, we postulate that α-crystallin binding to the membrane occurs predominantly through hydrophobic interactions rather than through protein-protein interactions as proposed previously (22.Mulders J.W. Stokkermans J. Leunissen J.A. Benedetti E.L. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31.Borchman D. Tang D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32.Ifeanyi F. Takemoto L. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33.Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Cenedella R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,47.Tang D. Borchman D. Yappert M.C. Ophthal. Res. 1999; 31: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).For each homopolymer and the 3:1 heteropolymer, binding constants were determined to measure the affinity of the interaction. All three complexes show similar affinity at low membrane concentration; however, the αB homopolymer shows a marked increase in apparent affinity at high membrane concentrations (Fig. 6 and Table II). It is possible that this apparent positive cooperativity results from polysteric linkage, whereby the binding of a ligand influences the aggregation state of the macromolecule (48.Colosimo A. Brunori M. Wyman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 100: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of αB-crystallin, it could be that binding to the membrane alters its quaternary structure such that additional αB subunits can insert into the existing bound complexes. Another possible explanation for the positive cooperativity behavior is that at high membrane concentrations, interactions between αB-crystallin and some other intrinsic membrane protein begin to add to the interactions between αB and the lipid bilayer. Consistent with this idea, we observed that the affinity plot of αB-crystallin measured with trypsinized membranes did not show the same positive cooperativity as seen with the nontreated membranes (Fig.8 B). Therefore we believe that the apparent increase in binding affinity seen with αB-crystallin at high membrane concentrations likely reflects the additive effects of protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions with MP26 or other membrane proteins.One unexpected trend in our data was the properties of the reconstituted 3:1 heteromeric complex. In the cases of the pH and temperature dependence (Fig. 3, C and D), this heteropolymer did not behave as an average of the component subunits, as would be expected if they were functionally and structurally equivalent. Indeed, the heteromeric complex had the lowest binding capacity measured with the fractionated lens membranes, and this capacity was the most dramatically affected by trypsinization of the membrane (2-fold increase) (Fig. 7 C). These results support the hypothesis that the mixed aggregate may hold particular functional significance in the lens. Based on the observation that enhanced membrane association is correlated with aging and the onset of cataract, it is reasonable to suggest that irreversible membrane binding is an event that negatively affects the transparency of the lens. By virtue of its relative resistance to membrane binding, the heteromeric complex may represent a more favorable state than homomeric complexes derived from either αA- and αB-crystallin subunits. The formation of cataract in the αA-crystallin knockout mouse lens adds support to this hypothesis (8.Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robison W.G.J. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).Our studies suggest that α-crystallin is able to bind membranes through hydrophobic interactions in such a way as to embed a portion of the complex into the hydrophobic fatty acid core of the bilayer. This interaction appears to be irreversible for the subunits in direct contact with the membrane, but it does not appear to prevent subunit exchange between the exposed subunits with soluble α-crystallin aggregates. The present data suggest particular biological significance for the heteromeric complex comprised of both αA- and αB-crystallin, as found in the lens. α-Crystallin is a large protein complex comprised of 30–40 copies of the A (αA-crystallin) and B (αB-crystallin) subunits in roughly a 3 αA to 1 αB molar ratio and can represent up to 50% of the total protein in vertebrate lenses (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 2.Gopalakrishnan S. Takemoto L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1992; 33: 2936-2941PubMed Google Scholar). Human αA- and αB-crystallin polypeptides have molecular masses of about 20 kDa, making the 3:1 αA/αB heteromeric complex found in the lens between 600 and 800 kDa (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Each subunit shows significant sequence homology to small heat shock proteins such as mouse HSP25 and human HSP27, but they diverge somewhat in their NH2 and COOH termini (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 3.de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar,4.Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Ralston G.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both protein subunits are also known to exchange readily between soluble α-crystallin complexes in a time- (>6 h) and temperature- (>25 °C) dependent manner, suggesting that the heteromeric complex has a dynamic quaternary structure (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 5.Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to their many similarities, αA- and αB-crystallin have some notable differences. First, αA-crystallin is expressed almost exclusively in lens fiber cells, whereas αB-crystallin is expressed strongly in both the lens and non-ocular tissues such as heart, liver, and brain (6.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Second, a study utilizing two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that αA-crystallin is more stable than αB-crystallin with respect to the denaturing effects of extreme temperature, pH, and chaotropic agents such as urea and guanidine (7.Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, studies using knockout mice suggest major differences in the in vivo roles of αA- and αB-crystallins. Deletion of αB-crystallin has little effect on lens morphology; however, the removal of αA-crystallin causes early onset cataract associated with accumulation of inclusion bodies containing large amounts of αB-crystallin (8.Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robison W.G.J. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 9.Brady J.P. Wawrousek E.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1998; 39 (Abstr. 4200): B257Google Scholar). From these observations, it seems likely that these two subunits are not functionally equivalent and that there may be some functional significance in the combination of αA and αB subunits found in the native complex. Despite these observations, the biological roles of α-crystallin are not yet firmly established. It is thought to give vertebrate lenses their refractive and transparency properties through short range ordering, which could result from the repulsive behavior of the native protein complex (10.Xia J.Z.

In addition, α-crystallin has been shown to inhibit stress-induced aggregation of proteins in vitro, reflecting a potential in vivo role in maintenance of lens transparency (14.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl.

In this manuscript we show that out of 16 known tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is the only tumor suppressor induced in the human lung cancer cell line, A549, following inhibition of DNA MeTase by a novel DNA MeTase antagonist or antisense oligonucleotides. The rapid induction of p21 expression points to a mechanism that does not involve demethylation of p21 promoter. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that part of the CpG island upstream of the endogenous p21 gene is unmethylated and that the expression of unmethylated p21 promoter luciferase reporter constructs is induced following inhibition of DNA MeTase. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of DNA MeTase in a cell can control the expression of a nodal tumor suppressor by a mechanism that does not involve DNA methylation.

To ascertain that the epigenetic information encoded in the methylation pattern is faithfully maintained, the expression of the maintenance DNA MeTase1 enzyme DNMT1, which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group fromS-adenosyl-methionine to the 5′ position on cytosines residing at the dinucleotide CpG (5.Gruenbaum Y.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 7: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that they play a causal role in cellular transformation (12.Wu J. Issa J.P. Herman J. Bassett Jr., D.E.

This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that a reduction in DNA MeTase levels by either 5-aza-deoxycytidine (13.MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for cellular transformation by DNMT1 and the reversal of transformation by DNA MeTase inhibition are unknown. One attractive hypothesis is that high levels of DNA MeTase lead to ectopic methylation and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as p16 (16.Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). Similarly, the inhibition of DNA MeTase could result in demethylation and lead to activation of p16 (17.Otterson G.A. Khleif S.N. Chen W. Coxon A, B. Kaye F.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1211-1216PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Gonzalgo M.L. Hayashida T. Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Tsai Y.C. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen H.D. Nguyen T.T. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1245-1252PubMed Google Scholar). However, because both the increase in DNA MeTase levels and its inhibition by pharmacological inhibitors are global processes, it is difficult to understand how they could predictably result in a discrete change of the methylation state of specific sites. A more likely explanation is that ectopic methylation of tumor suppressors in tumor cells is a slow and stochastic process, but the aberrant methylation events are selected because they confer a growth advantage. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in tumors bearing one mutant and one normal allele of p16, only the normal allele is methylated (19.Myohanen S.K. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 591-593PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, partial inhibition of DNA MeTase with pharmacological agents results in a stochastic demethylation of a specific site only in a fraction of the cells at each round of replication. An alternative possibility is that the DNMT1 protein might have a more direct and immediate effect on the state of cellular growth and transformation (20.Szyf M. Cancer Metast. Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility we inhibited DNA MeTase and examined the expression of genes known to control the cell cycle. In the past, 5-aza-deoxycytidine has been used as the standard inhibitor of DNA MeTase (21.Jones P.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 485-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the incorporation of 5-aza-deoxycytidine into DNA and subsequent trapping of DNA MeTase enzyme unto the replicating DNA (22.Wu J.C. Santi D.V. Prog. Clinic. Biol. Res. 1985; 198: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar) results in pleiotropic effects that confound the interpretation of the results (23.Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have developed two other approaches to inhibit DNA MeTase: antisense oligonucleotides (15.Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotide-based DNA MeTase antagonists that form a stable complex with DNA MeTase and inhibit its activity at an EC50 of 60 nm (24.Szyf M. Bigey P. Curr. Res. Mol. Ther. 1998; 1: 93-101Google Scholar, 25.Bigey P Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that inhibition of DNA MeTase by DNA MeTase antagonists results in a rapid inhibition of DNA replication that is inconsistent with a stochastic model (25.Bigey P Knox J.D.

In this manuscript we demonstrate that inhibition of DNA MeTase results in the rapid induction of the known tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator p21 by a mechanism that does not involve DNA methylation of the p21 promoter. A549 cells, a human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (26.Giard D.J. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Arnstein P. Kersey J.H. Dosik H. Parks W.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar) (ATCC: CCL 185), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. HEK 293 cells, a human adenovirus type 5 transformed human embryonal kidney cell line (27.Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russel W.C. Nairn R J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar) (ATCC, CRL 1573), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For oligonucleotide treatment A549 cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish 18 h prior to treatment. The DNA MeTase antagonist (3118) used in our study is a phosphorothioate modified hemimethylated hairpin of the following sequence: 5′-CTGAA(methyl)CGGAT(methyl)CGTTTCGATCCGTTCAG-3′. The sequence of the inactive analog used in our study (3188) is identical; it is also phosphorothioate modified but has a 2′-O-methyl modification of the sugar backbone. The oligos 3118 and 3188 have the same structure as the DNA MeTase antagonist 3016 and the inactive analog 3060, which were previously described by us (25.Bigey P Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except that 3118 and 3188 bear a fluorescein tag at the 5′ end. The sequence of the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide used in this study is: 5′-AAGCATGAGCACCGTTCTCC-3′ (as) and its mismatch control oligonucleotide (mm) has a 3-base pair mismatch. For determining p21 mRNA stability, the 4-h oligonucleotide treatment was followed by actinomycin D treatment (10 mg/ml) for 0, 4, and 8 h. For p53 binding experiments, A549 cells were treated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) for 12 h in phosphate-buffered saline, following which the medium was replaced by a regular growth medium for 12 h, and the cells were harvested. For transient transfection experiments, HEK 293 cells were plated 18 h prior to transfection at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Total RNA was prepared from the cells at the indicated time points after the treatment using standard protocols. 15 μg of the RNA were subjected to an RNase protection assay using two multi-probe template sets (PharMingen's RiboQuant) as recommended by the manufacturer. The first set (hCC-2) includes templates for antisense RNA probes for p130, Rb, p107, p53, p57, p27, p21, p19, p18, p16, p14/15, and the controls L32 and GAPDH. The second set (hTS-1) includes templates for antisense RNA probes for p130, Rb, p107, DP1, DP2, E2F1, E2F2, E2F4, L32, and GAPDH. The protected RNA fragments were resolved on a urea-polyacrylamide sequencing gel according to their size and imaged by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densiometric scanning (MasterScan, Scanalytics) and was normalized to the intensity of the control GAPDH mRNA in each lane. Total cell extracts were prepared using standard protocols and resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% for DNA MeTase and 12% for p21). After transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking the nonspecific binding with 5% milk, p21 protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz, p21 (C-19)) at 1:500 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5000 dilution, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNMT1 protein was detected as described previously (15.Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von Hofe E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with reverse transcriptase and random primers (Superscript/Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of 12.5 μCi of35S-labeled dCTP (1250 Ci/mmol) to quantify the efficiency of reverse transcription. Equal amounts of reverse transcribed cDNA (70 000 cpm as determined by the incorporation of35S-labeled dCTP) were subjected to PCR amplification in the presence of increasing concentrations of a competitor DNA fragment that amplifies with the same set of primers but yields a product that is shorter by 52 base pairs. The following PCR primers and the competitor were designed using p21 mRNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number S67388) previously described (28.Tao L. Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. (40 cycles). DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the32P-labeled p53 consensus sequence 5′-AGACATGCCTAGACATGCCT-3′ as described (29.McLure K, G. Lee P.W.K.

The complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5%). Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with minor modifications (31.Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). 50 ng of sodium bisulfite treated A549 DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using the first set of primers described below. PCR products were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions utilizing nested primers. The PCR products of the second reaction were then subcloned using the Invitrogen TA cloning Kit (as recommended by the manufacturer), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers used for the amplification of the p21 genomic region (GenBankTMaccession number U24170) were: 5′-GTAAAAAAAGTTAGATTTGTGG-3′ (sense, starting at 4278), 5′-CTCACCTCCTCTAAATACC-3′ (reverse, starting at 4640), 5′-AGGGATTGGGGGAGGAG-3′ (nested sense, starting at 4342), and 5′-CAACTACTCACACCTCAAC-3′ (nested reverse, starting at 4566).

Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p21 mRNA level was determined by Northern blot analysis using 10 μg of RNA and hybridization with32P-labeled human p21 probe (positions 205–544, accession number U03106). The levels of expression of p21 mRNA were quantified by densitometric scanning (MasterScan, Scanalytics) and normalized in each lane to the amount of total RNA as determined by hybridization with 32P-labeled 18 S ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide probe (33.Szyf M.

The calcium-phosphate precipitation method was used to transiently co-transfect HEK 293 cells with either 2 μg of promoterless luciferase reporter or luciferase reporter constructs containing 2145 or 94 base pairs of the p21 promoter upstream of the transcriptional start site (34.Somasundaram K Zhang Y-X, Z Houvras Y Peng Y Zhang H Wu G.S. Lichi J.C. Weber B.L. El-Diery W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of either control pCR3.1 DNA (Invitrogen) or a dnmt1 (base pairs 396–5066) antisense expression vector in pCR3.1 (as). 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) was included with all transfections to control for transfection efficiency by fluorescence microscopy. The luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (35.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). DNA MeTase activity was assayed using 3 μg of HEK 293 nuclear extract protein prepared as described previously (7.Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 30 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 25% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 μl ofS-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-l-methionine (78.9 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a methyl donor, and 0.2 mm of a synthetic hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate as a methyl acceptor as described previously (7.Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the incorporation of methyl groups into the DNA substrate was determined by scintillation counting of tricloroacetic acid precipitable counts. The background counts reflecting methylation of other macromolecules present in the nuclear extract as well as endogenous DNA methylation were determined by incubating the nuclear extract under the same conditions in the absence of the hemimethylated substrate. The background values were subtracted from the values obtained for each point. The results are presented as the averages of three determinations. To determine whether inhibition of DNA MeTase in cancer cells results in induction of the expression of tumor suppressors, we treated A549 human lung carcinoma cells with either antisense oligonucleotides (as) directed against dnmt1 mRNA or their mismatched control (mm), or a DNA MeTase antagonist (3118) and its inactive control (3188) for 5 days. The DNA MeTase antagonist was previously shown to inhibit DNA MeTase activity in nuclear extracts prepared from control A549 cells (k i of 65 nm; Ref. 25.Bigey P Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide was previously shown to prevent the production of detectable levels of DNMT1 protein at an EC50of 60 nm (data not shown). Two different methods of inhibition of DNA MeTase were used to exclude the possibility that the changes observed represented a nonspecific side effect. RNA prepared from the treated cells was subjected to an RNase protection assay with two sets of multiple probe templates that revealed the level of expression of 16 known cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors. As indicated in Fig. 1, p21 was the only known tumor suppressor that was induced by both treatments. p21 protein levels are also induced upon treatment with both DNA MeTase antisense oligonucleotides and antagonists as determined by the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 2 A.Figure 2Inhibition of DNA MeTase induces p21 protein. Shown is Western blot analysis of total cell extracts isolated from A549 cells treated with either antisense oligonucleotides to dnmt 1 mRNA (as), antisense mismatch control (mm), DNA MeTase antagonist (3118), inactive analog of the antagonist (3188), or the mock treated controls (ctrl) for 1, 2, or 5 days. The positions of p21 protein (A) and DNA MeTase protein (B) are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of induction of p21 following inhibition of DNA MeTase can provide an indication as to the mechanism involved. We chose to use the DNA MeTase antagonist (3118) because it directly interacts with DNA MeTase protein. In contrast, the antisense acts indirectly by reducing mRNA levels, which leads to the reduction of protein levels, and the turnover rate of DNA MeTase might confound the interpretation of the results. Any inhibitor of DNA methylation will have its most pronounced effect at the time of DNA replication. Therefore, the fraction of cells that are demethylated at a specific subset of regulatory sites will increase with the number of replication rounds. The level of p21 mRNA following DNA MeTase antagonist treatment was quantified by competitive PCR, which showed that the induction of p21 mRNA was rapid (7-fold after 8 h) and that it decreased over the period from 8 h to 5 days (Fig.3 B). These results are consistent with a mechanism that does not involve demethylation of specific sites. The competitive PCR also verified the induction of p21 following treatment with a DNA MeTase antagonist observed in the RNase protection experiments. There is a discrepancy between the time course of induction of p21 mRNA and protein levels. The highest level of p21 mRNA induction is observed shortly after treatment (8 h) (Fig. 3), whereas the levels of p21 protein seem to increase up to 5 days following treatment (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, although DNMT1 protein is undetectable within 1 day after antisense treatment (Fig.2 B), p21 protein levels continue to increase up to 5 days (Fig. 2 A). A possible explanation is that the turnover rate of protein is slower than that of the mRNA, resulting in gradual accumulation of protein over time following induction of p21 transcription. Another possibility is that inhibition of DNA MeTase induces p21 protein levels by an additional post translational mechanism as recently suggested by Fournel et al. (36.Fournel M. Przemyslaw S. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further experiments are required to clarify this question. DNA methylation is unlikely to play a role in the modulation of p21 gene expression because the p21 gene is active even in the untreated cells (Fig. 1). DNA methylation is believed to be an on-off switch in gene expression (37.Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation and Its Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 353-378Google Scholar). CpG islands present in the promoter regions have been shown to be susceptible to hypermethylation in many cancer cells (38.Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are prime candidates to be involved in regulation of their respective genes. To study the state of methylation of p21 promoter, we performed a bisulfite mapping of the portion of the p21 promoter that also partially overlaps with the p21 CpG island (Fig.4 B). The portion tested (−243 to +1) contains no methylated CpGs in the untreated cells (Fig.4 A). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA MeTase antagonists do not induce p21 mRNA levels by demethylation of its promoter. p21 plays a central role in the response to DNA damage and has been shown to contain p53 binding sites in its promoter region and to be a downstream effector of p53 (35.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). Our results do not support the hypothesis that p53 mRNA is induced following treatment with DNA MeTase inhibitors (Fig. 1). An alternative possibility is that either the presence of the oligonucleotide inhibitors or the inhibition of DNA methylation are interpreted as DNA damage resulting in an activation of p53 and an increase in p53 DNA binding to p53 recognition sequences (29.McLure K, G. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed the electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay shown in Fig.5. Treatment of A549 cells with the DNA damaging agent actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) results in activation of p53 and binding to its consensus sequence. This produces a super-shifted complex stabilized by anti-p53 antibody pAb421 as previously shown (29.McLure K, G. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with DNA MeTase inhibitors does not activate p53 consensus sequence binding. Several reports have indicated that the stability of the p21 mRNA could be altered by different signals such as differentiation (39.Schwaller J. Koeffler H.P. Niklaus G. Loetscher P. Nagel S. Fey M.F. Tobler A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and oxidative stress (40.Esposito F. Cuccovillo F. Vanoni M. Cimino F. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Russo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that p21 mRNA contains a conserved element in its 3′-untranslated region that is bound by the Elav-like mRNA stabilizing proteins (41.Joseph B. Orlian M. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20511-20516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether DNA MeTase antagonists increase the stability of p21 mRNA, we treated A549 cells with either the DNA MeTase antagonist (3118) or the inactive analog (3188). After 4 h, the mRNA transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (10 mg/ml) was added to the treated cultures and an untreated control, and the level of p21 mRNA was determined by a Northern blot analysis at different time points after initiation of actinomycin D treatment. As observed in Fig.6, DNA MeTase antagonist treatment does not considerably alter the stability of p21 mRNA, suggesting that induction of p21 mRNA occurs at the transcriptional level. p21 luciferase reporter constructs were used to confirm that the induction of p21 occurred at the transcriptional level. Plasmids amplified in Escherichia coli cells, which do not bear a CpG MeTase, are fully unmethylated. Therefore, these experiments directly test the hypothesis that induction of p21 transcription by inhibition of DNMT1 occurs by a mechanism that is independent of methylation of the p21 promoter. HEK 293 cells were used in these experiments because they are easily transfected. The results presented in Fig.7 A show that inhibition of DNMT1 by expression of a full-length antisense dnmt1mRNA results in induction of both p21 promoter luciferase reporter constructs. An assay of DNA MeTase activity confirmed that the transient transfection of the dnmt1 antisense construct resulted in a significant reduction of DNA MeTase activity in the transfected population of HEK cells (Fig. 7 B). To rule out the possibility that the p21 promoter luciferase reporter constructs are de novo methylated in HEK cells and that antisense treatment inhibits this activity, we subjected DNA prepared from transiently transfected HEK cells to digestion with eitherHpaII, which is sensitive to methylation at the CCmGG sequence, or MspI, which is insensitive to this methylation. The digested DNA was subjected to a Southern blot analysis using the entire p21 promoter luciferase reporter construct as a probe. Methylation in any one of the HpaII sites would have resulted in partially digested fragments. The Southern blot does not reveal partially cleaved HpaII fragments, thus suggesting that no significant de novo methylation of the studied HpaII sites occurs in HEK cells (Fig.7 C). The induction of p21 by DNMT1 inhibition does not require the presence of sequences upstream to the minimal promoter (−94) and therefore does not require the presence of p53 recognition elements. This also confirms that the induction of p21 promoter activity by DNA MeTase inhibition is independent of the methylation status of the promoter at sequences other than those mapped in the bisulfite sequencing experiment (Fig. 4). Inhibition of DNA MeTase has been previously shown to arrest the growth of tumor cells (13.MacLeod A.R. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14.Laird P.W. Jacksongrusby L. Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Jung W.E. Li E. Weinberg R.A. Jaenisch R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms involved are not clear. An attractive hypothesis is that inhibition of DNA MeTase results in the demethylation of tumor suppressors that were previously inactivated by methylation. In support of this hypothesis it has been shown that the tumor suppressor p16, which is methylated and inactive in many tumor cells (16.Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar), could be activated by prolonged treatment with an inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-deoxycytidine (16.Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar, 17.Otterson G.A. Khleif S.N. Chen W. Coxon A, B. Kaye F.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1245-1252PubMed Google Scholar). In this manuscript we tested the hypothesis that alternative mechanisms are involved in the arrest of cell growth by DNA MeTase inhibitors. For this reason A549, a NSCLC cell line with a homozygous deletion of p16INK4, was chosen to address this question (42.Fukuoka K. Adachi J. Nishio K. Arioka H. Kurokawa H. Fukumoto H. Ishida T. Nomoto T. Yokote H. Tomonari A. Narita N. Yokota J. Saijo N. Jap. J. Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two novel inhibitors of DNA MeTase that inhibit DNA MeTase by different mechanisms were used to increase the confidence that the effects observed were a consequence of DNA MeTase inhibition. Out of 16 genes known to regulate the cell cycle, only one, the housekeeping gene p21, was shown to be induced following inhibition of DNA MeTase. The negative effects of DNA MeTase inhibitors on the growth of A549 cells, which we have reported previously (25.Bigey P Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Théberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), can be explained by an induction of p21. The ectopic expression of p21 has been shown to arrest the growth of tumor cells (43.Yang Z.Y. Perkins N.D. Ohno T. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and through its inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases p21 is known to block entry into S and S phase progression (44.Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar, 45.Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These functions allow p21 to play a role in mediating stop signals such as those triggered by terminal differentiation and contact inhibition (46.Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 47.Wu R.C. Schonthal A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29091-29098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, p21 can directly arrest DNA replication in response to DNA damage by binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (48.Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 36: 574-578Crossref Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Unlike what is expected from the p16 model, the induction of p21 expression is rapid (7-fold induction 8 h after the treatment) and points to a novel mechanism independent of DNA methylation. Our experiments confirm that at least a portion of the p21 promoter is not normally methylated (Fig. 4) and demonstrate the ability of DNA MeTase inhibition to induce expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an unmethylated p21 promoter (Fig. 7). A recent publication showed that antisense inhibition ofdnmt1 mRNA in a bladder carcinoma cell line T24 results in an increase of p21 protein levels (36.Fournel M. Przemyslaw S. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our paper complements these results by (a) showing that the same results are produced when DNA MeTase is directly inhibited by a hemi-methylated hairpin phosphorothioate oligos as well as when inhibited by antisense oligos, (b) demonstrating the induction of p21 in a second, independent cell line, (c) providing strong evidence that the increase in p21 protein after DNA MeTase inhibition is primarily a consequence of p21 mRNA induction, and (d) demonstrating that p21 induction does not require a change in the methylation state (normally unmethylated) of its promoter. It is still unclear whether p21 induction is triggered by a decline in DNA MeTase activity or DNA MeTase amount. Further experiments are required to address this question. In any case, the ability of DNA MeTase to modulate p21 levels, as well as compete with p21 for its binding site on proliferating cell nuclear antigen (49.Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), suggests that the increased DNA MeTase expression observed in tumor cells may override p21 dependent stop signals and result in unregulated growth.

Nature. 1998; 393: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) acting on vacuoles and prevacuolar/late endosomal compartments, respectively. Detailed analyses of yeast mutants have suggested that Vam3p is involved in multiple membrane fusion events in vacuoles: biosynthetic transport via prevacuolar compartments, AP-3-dependent transport, endocytic transport, autophagy, and homotypic fusion (20.Wada Y.

Pep12p is required for the transport from the trans-Golgi network to the prevacuolar compartments (17.Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion, we found that the mouse syntaxin 7 cDNA cloned in this study could complement vam3 and pep12 mutants. These exciting results prompted us to study the role(s) of syntaxin 7 in the biogenesis of lysosomes and/or late endosomes in mammalian cells. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that syntaxin 7 is localized to late endosomes. Moreover, we demonstrated that syntaxin 7 is involved in the endocytic trafficking to late endosomes. These results indicate that the functional site of syntaxin 7 molecules is late endosomes. The monoclonal antibodies for lamp-2 (rat clone GL2A7) and EEA1 (mouse clone 14) were purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Goat polyclonal antibodies for cathepsin D were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cy3- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-rab7 antibodies were prepared by immunizing a guinea pig with a synthetic peptide based on the carboxyl-terminal sequence (Asn-172 to Cys-208) of mouse rab7. Anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies were prepared by immunizing a rabbit with the bacterially expressed cytoplasmic domain (Met-1 to Cys-239) of mouse syntaxin 7, followed by affinity purification. The GenBankTM database of expressed sequence tags was searched using the human and rat syntaxin 7 sequences (28.Wang H. Frelin L. Pevsner J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mouse expressed sequence tag clone, accession number AA014394, contained the entire open reading frame of syntaxin 7. The sequence data has been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number AB019213). The entire coding region was subcloned into yeast expression plasmid pKT10 (30.Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) to generate pKT-syn7. The inducible expression plasmid pIND-syn7ΔTMD was constructed by the introduction of a polymerase chain reaction fragment coding for the cytoplasmic domain (Met-1 to Cys-239) of mouse syntaxin 7 into the multiple cloning site of pIND (Invitrogen). NIH3T3 and NRK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium, respectively, containing 10% fetal calf serum. EcR3T3 cells (pVgRXR-transfected NIH3T3 cells; Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Individual clones of EcR3T3 transfected with pIND (control plasmid) and pIND-syn7ΔTMD (mutant syntaxin 7 expression plasmid) were isolated and then maintained in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Yeast cell culture, transformation, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (31.Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were observed under an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. The yeast strains used were YPH499 (Ref. 30.Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), MHS3–4D (YPH499, Δvam3::HIS3), and MHS3–3A (YPH499, Δpep12::LEU2). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% saponin, and 2% normal goat serum. The cells were incubated with the antibodies against syntaxin 7, lamp-2, rab7, or EEA1 and then reacted with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. After washing extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, samples were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then visualized using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). To analyze the endocytic trafficking of FITC-dextran, cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μm muristerone A for 60 h before the addition of FITC-dextran. The cells were labeled with 1 mg/ml FITC-dextran (70 kDa; Molecular Probes) for 1 h, chased for 0 or 6 h, and then fixed and immunostained with anti-lamp-2 antibody. For preloading of FITC-dextran, cells were cultured with FITC-dextran overnight and then cultured in the absence of FITC-dextran overnight before the addition of muristerone A. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and postfixed in 1% OsO4 and 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. Ultra-thin sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy, the pre-embedding silver enhancement immunogold method (32.Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) was used, with a slight modification. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryo-protected with 35% sucrose and 14% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were thawed and reacted with anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies, followed by incubation with colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibodies. The gold labeling was intensified using a silver enhancement kit (Nano Probes). For double staining, cells were reacted with anti-syntaxin 7 and anti-lamp-2 antibodies, then reacted with anti-rabbit IgG labeled with colloidal gold and biotinylated anti-rat IgG, and finally reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptoavidin. Horseradish peroxidase labeling was visualized by means of the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride reaction. Stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 10 μm muristerone A for 60 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in 10 mmHEPES-KOH containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the CompleteTM proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenization was performed by 10 passages through a 26-gauge needle. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants and pellets were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting and probed with anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies. Cells were cultured in the presence of 10 μm muristerone A for 60 h and then transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μmmuristerone A but lacking methionine and cysteine, followed by a 45-min incubation. The cells were labeled with 3.7 MBq/ml Tran35S-label (ICN) for 1 h and then chased for 0, 1.5, or 3 h in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml unlabeled methionine and cysteine. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the CompleteTMproteinase inhibitor mixture. Cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using an excess amount of antibodies, subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then visualized with a phosphorimaging analyzer (BAS1000; FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan). Yeast vam3 mutants (Δvam3) lack normal vacuoles but accumulate small vacuole-related structures, as shown previously (16.Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of syntaxin 7 restored the vacuolar morphology of the Δvam3 mutant (Fig.1, a–c), indicating that syntaxin 7 has a similar function to Vam3p. Whether or not syntaxin 7 also complements the pep12 mutation (Δpep12) became a matter of interest because Pep12p is homologous to syntaxin 7. Because the Δpep12 mutation did not affect the vacuolar morphology (17.Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33.Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), we examined the maturation of vacuolar lumenal proteins. Abolition of PEP12 function results in retardation of the maturation of vacuolar proteins including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) because of a defect in transport to vacuoles (Fig. 1 d, − Syntaxin 7). Thus,Δpep12 cells accumulate the precursor proteins of CPY and ALP and contain only small amounts of the mature proteins. When syntaxin 7 was expressed in the Δpep12 mutant, CPY and ALP became mature forms similar to the wild type (Fig. 1 d, +Syntaxin 7), indicating that syntaxin 7 has a function similar to Pep12p as well as Vam3p. The results with yeast mutants clearly suggest that syntaxin 7 is involved in the biogenesis of lysosomes and/or late endosomes. To confirm this notion, we examined the intracellular localization of syntaxin 7 by means of immunofluorescence microscopy. Numerous small organelles were identified in the perinuclear region on staining with anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies (Fig. 2, a, d, andg). The immunostaining pattern of syntaxin 7 overlapped those of rab7 (34.Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) and lamp-2 (35.Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A. Howe C.L. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are marker proteins for late endosomes, and of both late endosomes and lysosomes, respectively (Fig.2, top and middle panels). Essentially all compartments containing syntaxin 7 were also positive for rab7. In contrast, the distribution of early endosomal protein EEA1 (36.Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 37.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was clearly different from that of syntaxin 7 (Fig. 2,g–i). The exact cellular location of syntaxin 7 was determined by electron microscopy. NIH3T3 and H-4-II-E (rat hepatoma cell line) cells were processed for immunogold labeling with anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies. Syntaxin 7 was mainly localized to the limiting membrane of multivesicular compartments in the perinuclear region (about 75% of gold particles in NIH3T3) in both NIH3T3 (Fig.3, a and b) and H-4-II-E (Fig. 3 c) cells. A small portion of syntaxin 7 (about 20% in NIH3T3 cells) was also present on lucent compartments close to the multivesicular compartments (Fig. 3). Essentially no labeling was observed on tubular endosomal compartments. Double labeling revealed a high degree of co-localization of syntaxin 7 and lamp-2 (Fig. 3 d). These immunohistochemical studies indicated that syntaxin 7 is localized to the late endosomes but not to the early endosomes. The cytoplasmic domains of syntaxin-related proteins are known to interact with molecules involved in membrane docking/fusion, SNARE components and regulatory proteins (24.Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38.Clague M.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R258-R260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of mutant syntaxin 7 lacking the transmembrane domain (ΔTMD) could cause dominant interfering effects on organelle biogenesis. We established a stable NIH3T3 cell line expressing mutant syntaxin 7 under the control of the ecdysone-responsive promoter. Upon induction with muristerone A, the mutant syntaxin 7 was highly expressed, and the approximate ratio of mutant (ΔTMD) to endogenous (wild-type) syntaxin 7 reached 3:1 at the fully induced stage (Fig.4 a, Δ TMD, 60 h). About 40% of the mutant syntaxin 7 (ΔTMD) was found in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4 b), possibly having bound with syntaxin 7-interacting membrane proteins. Thus, analysis of cells expressing the mutant protein (ΔTMD) may reveal the roles of syntaxin 7 in membrane trafficking. We examined the subcellular localization of lamp-2 and the morphology of the lamp-2-containing compartments in the established cell lines. The perinuclear location of the lamp-2 was evident in normal (Fig. 2 e) and control cell lines (Fig. 4 c). When mutant syntaxin 7 (ΔTMD) was expressed, the perinuclear punctate staining of lamp-2 dramatically decreased, and a significant portion of lamp-2 was localized in the larger compartments located away from the perinuclear region (Fig.4 d). Interestingly, about 10% of the cells showed a high accumulation of larger compartments of varying sizes (2–5 μm in diameter; Fig. 4 e). Electron microscopic observation revealed that the ΔTMD mutant cells contained enlarged multivesicular and multilamellar membrane compartments (Fig.5) that were much larger than those observed in control cells; the diameters of the structures in control and ΔTMD mutant cells were 0.4–0.8 and 2–5 μm, respectively. The appearance of the aberrant multivesicular compartments was correlated to the expression of mutant syntaxin 7. Some of the enlarged structures contained multilamellar membrane structures (Fig. 5 , bottom, arrows). We did not observe any morphological perturbation of other organelles such as the mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum. The localization of marker proteins in the secretory pathway was found not to be altered on immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). We analyzed endocytic transport in the ΔTMD mutant cells using a fluid-phase endocytic tracer, FITC-dextran. After internalization for 1 h, FITC-dextran was found in punctate structures dispersed at the cell periphery (Fig.6 A, a and b), which is a typical distribution of early endosomes (Fig. 2 h). In the control cells, the internalized FITC-dextran was co-localized with lamp-2 in the perinuclear region, indicating the arrival of FITC-dextran in late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 6 B,d–f). FITC-dextran was not localized to lamp-2-containing compartments in the ΔTMD mutant cells and distributed throughout the cells even after a 6-h chase period (Fig. 6 B, a–c), suggesting that FITC-dextran was not transported to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Interestingly, the close proximity of FITC-dextran-containing compartments and lamp-2-positive compartments was frequently observed. Next, FITC-dextran was preloaded on late endosomes and lysosomes, and mutant syntaxin 7 was expressed for 60 h. lamp-2 was co-localized with FITC-dextran in the ΔTMD mutant and control cells (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect the localization of lamp-2 to late endosomes and lysosomes. The processing of cathepsin D was examined to assess the effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on the biosynthetic transport of lysosomal enzymes (Fig. 7). Cathepsin D is synthesized as inactive procathepsin D (51 kDa) in the endoplasmic reticulum, converted into the intermediate form (45 kDa) mainly in late endosomes, and finally converted into the lysosomal mature forms (30 kDa and 15 kDa) in lysosomes (39.Delbruck R. Desel C. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Richo G.R. Conner G.E. J. Biol.

Thus, the processing of cathepsin D can be a useful marker for examining the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal proteins. Procathepsin D was processed to the mature form with normal kinetics in the ΔTMD mutant cells (Fig. 7, compare ΔTMD and control cells). Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 7 did not block the transport of cathepsin D to late endosomes and lysosomes. The present study clearly shows that syntaxin 7 is localized on late endosomes and mediates endocytic trafficking to this organelle. As observed using immunofluorescence microscopy, syntaxin 7 is co-localized with rab7, a marker protein of late endosomes, but not with an early endosomal protein, EEA1. Furthermore, it was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy that syntaxin 7 is present on multivesicular compartments and is co-localized with lamp-2. These results functionally distinguish syntaxin 7 from other syntaxin-related proteins found in early and recycling endosomes (43.Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We have established a stable NIH3T3 cell line that inducibly expresses the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 7 (ΔTMD). A significant portion of mutant syntaxin 7 was found in the membrane fraction, suggesting that the mutant protein binds to syntaxin 7-interacting proteins and thereby interferes with the normal interaction of endogenous (wild-type) syntaxin 7. This mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect the morphology and transport in early stages of the secretory pathway (cathepsin D maturation) and endocytic internalization of FITC-dextran; consistently, syntaxin 7 was not localized in these organelles. Internalized FITC-dextran was not transported to the lamp-2-containing late endosomes and lysosomes in cells expressing mutant syntaxin 7 (ΔTMD). This result clearly suggests that syntaxin 7 is required for trafficking from early to late endosomes (Fig.8). On the other hand, lamp-2 was localized in the mutant late endosomes and lysosomes preloaded with FITC-dextran, even after incubation for 60 h in the presence of muristerone A. The half-life of lamp-2 was previously shown to be ∼60 h in mouse fibroblasts (44.Andrejewski N. Punnonen E.-L. Guhde G. Tanaka Y. Lullmann-Rauch R. Hartmann D. von Figura K. Saftig P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12692-12701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The co-localization of lamp-2 with FITC-dextran suggests that overproduction of mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect the transport of newly synthesized lamp-2 to late endosomes and lysosomes. Pulse-labeled procathepsin D was normally processed to the lysosomal mature form in the ΔTMD mutant cells. These results imply that the transport of lamp-2 and cathepsin D to lysosomes does not occur through the early endosomes and that syntaxin 7 is not involved in the biosynthetic (lamp-2 and cathepsin D) transport to the late endosomes. The biosynthetic transport may utilize a molecular machinery different from that used for endocytic transport. Finally, it is noteworthy that the present study was extended from the finding that syntaxin 7 could complement a yeast vam3mutant. This mutant lacks normal vacuoles and, instead, accumulates small vacuolar structures (16.Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other mutants with an altered vacuolar morphology (20.Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may allow further identification of the mammalian proteins essential for the assembly of lysosomes and endosomes."

Unlike the expression of interferon (IFN) B gene, the expression of IFNA genes is restricted to the lymphoid cells. Both IFN regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF-3 and IRF-7) were suggested to play positive roles in these genes expression. However, their role in the differential expression of individual subtypes of human IFNA genes is unknown. Using various IFNA reporter constructs in transient transfection assay we found that overexpression of IRF-3 in virus infected 2FTGH cells selectively activated IFNA1 VRE, whereas IRF-7 was able to activate IFNA1, A2, and A4. The binding of recombinant IRF-7 and IRF-3 to these VREs correlated with their transcriptional activation. Nuclear proteins from infected and uninfected IRF-7 expressing 2FTGH cells formed multiple DNA-protein complexes with IFNA1 VRE, in which two unique DNA-protein complexes containing IRF-7 were detected. In 2FTGH cells, virus stimulated expression of IFNB gene but none of the IFNA genes. Reconstitution of IRF-7 synthesis in these cells resulted, upon virus infection, in the activation of seven endogenous IFNA genes in which IFNA1 predominated. These studies suggest that IRF-7 is a critical determinant for the induction of IFNA genes in infected cells.

Interferons elicit antiviral effects as well as multiple biological responses such as activation of NK cells and macrophages, up-regulation of expression of MHC class I antigens (3.De Maeyer E.

Binding sites for the family of IRFs are highly conserved within the VRE of IFNA and IFNB genes, which suggests that the members of IRF family play an important role in the regulated expression of these genes.

In infected cells, IRF-7 was shown to interact with IRF-3 to form the ternary complex named virus-activated factor, which binds weakly to the IFNB promoter (10.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the role of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the cell type-specific expression of individual human IFNA subtypes. By using a co-transfection assay, the expression of individual IFNA reporter genes was determined in the presence of overexpressed IRF-3 or IRF-7H. We have shown that although all the IFNA promoters (A1, A2, A4, and A14) were activated by IRF-7, only A1 was activated by IRF-3. We have further found that in human fibroblasts, in which viral infection led to the expression of the IFNB gene but not the IFNA genes, reconstitution of IRF-7 expression conferred the virus-mediated activation of seven endogenous IFNA genes. From these expression of IFNA1 was most predominant. These data indicate that the lack of IFNA gene expression in infected fibroblasts is due to the absence of IRF-7. Bovine tracheal cells and 2FTGH cells, which were obtained from G. Stark (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sendai virus used in this study was purchased from Specific Pathogen Free Avian Supply (Preston, CT). Routinely, infection was conducted with 400 hemagglutinin unit/100-mm plate (80% cell confluency). The cells were infected in the absence of serum for 1 h and followed by an addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The 2FTGH cells constitutively expressing IRF-7 (2FTGH/IRF-7) were generated by co-transfection of 2FTGH cells with IRF-7 expressing plasmid in which IRF-7H cDNA was under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMVSport.IRF7H) and pSV2neo (ratio 10:1, respectively) (31.Au W.-C.

Single clones were screened for the expression of IRF-7 by Western blot hybridization. HuIFNA1, A2, A4, and A14 reporter gene plasmids designated as pA1-SAP, pA2-SAP, pA4-SAP, and pA14-SAP, were constructed by inserting the respective IFNA VRE (−110 to −51) in front of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter, which drives the expression of a reporter gene encoding the SAP (34.Dent C.L.

IRF-7 antibody was raised in rabbits against GST-IRF7H (amino acid 1–237) fusion protein and purified by protein A chromatography. In the transient transfection assay, 7.0 × 104 2FTGH cells/well in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the IFNA SAP reporter plasmids, and 0.5 μg of the indicated IRF expression plasmids by Superfect transfection method (Qiagen). The β-galactosidase expressing plasmid (50 ng) was used to normalize the difference in transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were infected with Sendai virus 24 h after transfection for 16 h. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and heated to 65 °C for 20 min to selectively inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase (SAP is heat-stable). The SAP assays were carried out as described previously (34.Dent C.L. Macbride S.J. Sharp N.A. Gewert D.R. J.

For EMSA, the binding reaction and analyses of the DNA-protein complexes were done as described previously (25.Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The respective probes were labeled VRE fragments (−110 to −51) excised from pA-SAP by SalI and XbaI digestion. For the competition experiment, A1 VRE, PRDI/III, A14 VRE, and poly(dI·dC) in 200× excess were added to GST-IRF-3, 20 min before addition of the probe. For DNase I footprinting, the IFNA probes used for the footprinting assay were generated by PCR and labeled with32P by T4 kinase. The 3′ primer within the IFNA 5′-untranslated region (+35 to +55) was engineered to haveXhoI cleavage site for the purpose of removing the labeling on the antisense strand. For each binding reaction (final volume, 100 μl) probe of 1.2 × 104 cpm was incubated with 1 μg of GST fusion protein in a binding solution containing 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 100 mm KCl. Following an incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, 7 × 10−3 units of DNase I was added to each binding reaction for 1–2 min at 25 °C, and the DNase activity was stopped by the addition of 350 μl of solution consisting of 323 μl of ethanol, 2.5 μl of tRNA (1 mg/ml), and 50 μl of 10 mammonuim acetate. The DNase-digested products were recovered by centrifugation and resolved on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. 1 μg of total RNA isolated by Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) was reverse transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers in a 30-μl reaction. From this mixture of cDNAs, IFNA, IRF-7, and β-actin cDNA were amplified by PCR using the following primer sets: (i) IFNA (consensus primers designed to recognize all human IFNA subtypes) sense 5′-GTACTGCAGAATCTCTCCTTTCTCCTG-3′, antisense 5′-GTGTCTAGATCTGACAACCTCCCAGGGCACA-3′ (38.Megyeri K. Au W.-C. Rosztoczy I. Raj N.B. Miller R.L. Tomai M.A. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2207-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); (ii) β-actin sense 5′-ACAATGAGCTGCTGGTGGCT-3′, antisense 5′-GATGGGCACAGTGTGGGTGA-3′; and (iii) IRF-7 sense 5′-TGCAAGGTGTACTGGGAG-3′, antisense 5′-TCAAGCTTCTGCTCCAGCTCCATAAG-3′. The IFNA specific primers contain a PstI (sense primer) and a XbaI (antisense primer) restriction enzyme recognition sequence to facilitate the cloning of the PCR fragments. The amplified IFNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript KS II+ (Stratagene) at the PstI/XbaI site. The clones were randomly chosen and sequenced. The human IFNA gene family consists of 13 functional genes, which are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 9 (Fig.1 A) (5.Diaz M.O. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 143-149Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of these genes show a high degree of similarity in the nucleotide sequences, not only in the coding region, but also in the promoter region (Fig.1 B). The similarity can be also found between the human and mouse IFNA VRE. The AF-1 and virus-induced factor binding domains, identified as important elements in murine IFNA4 and A6 promoter (14.Génin P. Bragança J. Darracq N. Doly J. Civas A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5055-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17.Au W.-C. Su Y. Raj N.B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are also preserved in the promoters of human IFNA genes. However, the levels of expression of individual IFNA subtypes in infected cells differ in a cell type-specific fashion. The difference in the levels of expression of various IFNA subtypes is due to the difference in the transcription activation of these genes (6.Bisat F. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6067-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have chosen four HuIFNA promoter regions of IFNA1, A2, A4, and A14 genes that were previously shown to be expressed at different levels in infected cells and examined the ability of IRF-3 and IRF-7 to activate the VRE of these promoters in transient transfection assays. The ability of these factors to activate IFNB promoter was also measured for comparison. 2FTGH cells express IRF-3 constitutively but do not express IRF-7, and virus infection in these cells stimulates the expression of IFNB but not IFNA genes. Transfection of pA1-, pA2-, pA4-, and pA14-SAP plasmids (containing HuIFNA1, A2, A4, and A14 VRE, respectively; Ref. 34.Dent C.L. Macbride S.J. Sharp N.A. Gewert D.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or pB-SAP plasmid (containing HuIFNB VRE; Ref. 35.Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to 2FTGH cells did not result in expression of the SAP reporter gene in uninfected cells (Fig.2 A). Viral infection stimulated expression of the pB-SAP only. Co-transfection with IRF-3 led to an increase in the constitutive expression of pB-SAP (5-fold), which was further enhanced by viral infection (12-fold). However, the expression of pB-SAP in infected cells was similar in IRF-3 transfected or untransfected cells, possibly because the level of endogenous IRF-3 is already high in these cells. Transfection with IRF-3 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the pA1-SAP expression in infected cells but did not increase expression of pA2-, pA4-, or pA14-SAP. In contrast, transfection with IRF-7 led to an increase of both the constitutive and inducible expression of all the IFNA VRE tested. However, the relative expression of pA-SAP differed. Although IRF-7 increased the expression of pA1-SAP only 2-fold, viral infection increased IRF-7-mediated stimulation 6-fold, indicating a synergistic activation by IRF-7 and virus. The expression of pA2-SAP was increased 5-fold by IRF-7, and following viral infection the levels of SAP expression were increased by 16-fold. The pA4-SAP showed a similar response to IRF-7 activation but in the infected cells, its expression was slightly lower (12-fold) than that of pA2-SAP (16-fold). In contrast, the expression of pA14-SAP was only marginally enhanced (2-fold) by IRF-7 and was not further increased by viral infection. Overexpression of IRF-7 increased both constitutive and virus stimulated expression of pB-SAP; however, the stimulation by virus infection and IRF- 7 overexpression were only additive. Altogether, these data show that in transient transfection assay in fibroblast cells, virus effectively induces only the IFNB VRE and none of the IFNA VRE tested. This correlates with the observed lack of expression of the endogenous IFNA genes in infected fibroblast cells. To determine more precisely the sequences within VRE that respond to IRF-7 activation in infected cell, we examined the expression of IFNA1 VRE mutants inserted into the SAP reporter plasmid (Fig. 2 C) (35.Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The pA1(del21)-SAP contains only sequences corresponding to PRDI and PRDIII in IFNB VRE, which were shown to bind IRF-3 (37.Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In pA1(NFκB)-SAP, a 6-base pair insertion recreated the NFκB site in the IFNA1 VRE (35.Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The pA1(4 PM)-SAP contains two point mutations (G=>A) in the GAAAG motifs. In transient transfection assay (Fig.2 B), the pA1(del21)-SAP was activated less efficiently by IRF-7 and viral infection than the wild type IFNA1 VRE, indicating that the sequences outside of PRDI/III region contribute to the activation of A1 VRE. The four point mutations in IFNA1 VRE (pA1[4 PM]-SAP) completely abolished the transcription activity of the IFNA1 VRE, as well as its response to IRF-7. In contrast, the insertion of the NFκB binding site into IFNA1 VRE substantially enhanced the transcription activation of IFNA1 VRE. This suggests that the insertion of NFκB site into IFNA1 VRE has converted it to a IFNB-like promoter. Because our data point to the critical role of IRF-7 in the activation of IFNA VRE in infected cells, we have examined whether the inability of the virus to stimulate expression of IFNA genes in fibroblasts is due to the absence of IRF-7. The 2FTGH cells were transfected with IRF-3 or IRF-7 expressing plasmids, respectively, and infected with Sendai virus 24 h after transfection. The presence of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in cellular lysates was determined 6 h post-infection by Western blot hybridization with anti-IRF-3 and anti-IRF-7 antibodies, respectively (Fig.3 A). It can be seen that low levels of IRF-3 but no IRF-7 could be detected in untransfected cells. In cells transfected with IRF-3 or IRF-7 expressing plasmids, the respective proteins could be detected both before and after viral infection. Although no decrease in the levels of IRF-3 was detected in infected cells, the relative levels of IRF-7 were lower in infected than in uninfected cells. These data suggest that IRF-7 may be subjected to degradation in infected cells. The relative levels of IRF-7 and IFNA mRNAs in total RNA preparation isolated at 6 h post-infection from transfected cells were determined by reverse transcription PCR (Fig. 3 B). The presence of IRF-7 mRNA and IFNA mRNA could be detected only in IRF-7 transfected cells but not in infected parental cells or cells transfected with IRF-3 expressing plasmid. The culture media from the infected cells were analyzed for the presence of HuIFN-α by antiviral assay on bovine tracheal cells. These cells are sensitive only to IFN-α but not to IFN-β (39.Raj N.B.K. Israeli R. Kelley K.A. Leach S.J. Minasian E. Sikaris K. Parry D.A.D. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8943-8952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It can be seen in Fig. 3 Bthat the interferon activity (80 units/ml) was detected only in media from the IRF-7 transfected cells but not in media from any of the other infected cells. Because the transfection efficiency in 2FTGH cells is only about 25%, these levels of interferon represent an underestimation of the true values. However, neither IFNA mRNA nor biologically active IFN-α could be detected in cells overexpressing IRF-3. In immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast cells, the virus-induced activation of IFN-α4 and IFN-β stimulated the expression of IRF-7, which in turn induced the expression of non-IFNA4 genes (32.Marie I"
https://openalex.org/W2001959880,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a calcium (Ca2+) release channel found on the endoplasmic reticulum of virtually all types of cells. Human T lymphocytes (Jurkat) that are made deficient in IP3R do not generate Ca2+ signals in response to T cell receptor stimulation, fail to translocate the nuclear factor for activated T cells to the nucleus, and are remarkably resistant to induction of apoptosis with CD95 (Fas), dexamethasone, γ irradiation, and T cell receptor stimulation using anti-CD3 antibody. Expression of constitutively active calcineurin A in IP3R-deficient T cells restored nuclear factor for activated T cells translocation to the nucleus and dephosphorylation of Bad and rendered the cells sensitive to apoptotic inducers. Induction of apoptosis required both active calcineurin A (ΔCnA) and activation-dependent colocalization of CnA with its substrate. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CnA) is downstream of the IP3R in both the cell growth and apoptotic signaling pathways.

Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and cell death (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that one of the key downstream targets of IP3-mediated Ca2+ flux in the growth pathway is calcineurin A (CnA) (6.Premack B.A. Gardner P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1119-C1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, sustained Ca2+ elevation is required for CnA-dependent dephosphorylation of NF-AT and the subsequent translocation of this important transcription factor into the nucleus of T cells (7.Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Because IP3R-deficient cells are resistant to apoptosis (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and FK506, a CnA inhibitor, prevents apoptosis (8.Fruman D.A. Mather P.E. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Eur. J.

Nature. 1989; 339: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) we reasoned that CnA could be a Ca2+-dependent enzyme downstream of IP3R in the apoptotic and cell growth signaling pathways. CnA is a serine-threonine phosphatase regulated by Ca2+ and the Ca2+ calmodulin complex (11.Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). It is sensitive to immunosuppressive drugs such as FK506 and cyclosporin A. CnA inhibition results in the failure to translocate NF-AT to the nucleus, preventing activation of several cytokine genes, including interleukin-2, that are required for T cell growth. It has been shown that T cell activation requires a sustained increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] to activate interleukin-2 gene transcription. IP3receptor-deficient Jurkat T cells are defective in intracellular Ca2+ release and are resistant to apoptosis (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We now show that ΔCnA restores NF-AT translocation and the apoptotic phenotype in IP3R-deficient T cells. The identification of CnA as a target for intracellular Ca2+ release suggests that Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation of downstream targets plays a role in the biochemical events triggering apoptosis and cell growth pathways. IP3R-deficient T cells (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin, whereas vector- and ΔCnA-transfected cells were cultured with 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin and 0.4 mg/ml G418. To induce apoptosis, both vector-transfected and ΔCnA-transfected cells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and cultured in 10% RPMI 1640 medium in the presence and absence of plate-bound αCD3 (10 μg/ml) as described (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). After the indicated time periods, the cells were washed and analyzed as described previously (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, the apoptotic cells were identified by the annexin V-fluorescein staining as per the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The annexin assay and the cell death assays were used as complementary techniques to determine apoptotic cell death; both assays were performed, and representative results are shown. A 1.2-kilobase Sma-SalI fragment containing the coding region of the constitutively active CnA was cloned into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH Laboratories). 3.2 μg of either vector or vector containing CnA DNA was used to transfect IP3R-deficient cells with the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 36 h after transfection with either GFP vector alone or GFP vector containing ΔCnA, transfected cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium, layered over an equal volume of a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and centrifuged for 20 min at 1500 rpm. The viable cells at the interphase were collected, washed in RPMI 1640 medium, and used for the experiments. The viability of these cells was determined using the trypan blue exclusion test. To induce apoptosis viable cells were cultured on αCD3-coated plates as described (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In all experiments only viable cells expressing levels of ΔCnA comparable with the levels of CnA in the parental cells (as determined by immunoblotting; e.g. see Fig. 1 D) were used. The relatively low expression of ΔCnA was similar in all cells used for all experiments. Cells were activated for 15 min in the presence of the indicated stimuli, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in bufferwith divalent (BWD) buffer (125 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm Mgcl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and immunostained as described (12.Harnick D.J. Jayaraman T. Ma Y. Mulieri P. Go L. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2833-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Anti-NF-ATp antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and rhodamine conjugated to rabbit IgG were used for NF-AT detection. After washing, the cells were mounted and examined at × 100 magnification using a scanning laser confocal attachment (Zeiss LSM 410) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV inverted fluorescence microscope equipped for fluorescence and transmitted-light imaging. Sample excitation and confocal image collection are accomplished using an argon-krypton laser and photomultiplier detectors. For green fluorescent protein, the excitation and barrier filters were set at 488 and 510 nm, respectively. Red fluorescence of NF-AT was measured at an excitation wavelength of 568 and emission was measured at 590 nm; the optical section thickness was 1 μm. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in cultures incubated with secondary antibodies alone or with pre-immune sera. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with phosphate buffered saline and then lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After clearing cellular debris using centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of protein from each lysate was denatured with SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following size fractionation using SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet tank apparatus (Bio-Rad mini wet transfer unit) overnight at 4 °C. Transfer membranes were then incubated with blocking solution (5% dry milk containing 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml primary antibody for 3 h. Membranes were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1/1000 dilution) for 1 h followed by washing four times. Signal detection was performed with a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primary antibodies were anti-CnA antibody (PharMingen; antibody recognizes both CnA and ΔCnA) and anti-Bad antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). CnA is a heterodimer comprised of a catalytic A subunit and a Ca2+-binding regulatory B subunit (11.Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active (Ca2+-independent) CnA (13.Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was stably expressed in IP3R-deficient T cells (Jurkat) (Fig.1 A). Jurkat transfected with GFP vector alone exhibited a diffuse fluorescent pattern (Fig.1 B), whereas cells transfected with GFP/ΔCnA exhibited a cytoplasmic localization of the fluorescent signal (Fig. 1 C) consistent with the cytoplasmic distribution of ΔCnA. Typically both parental and IP3R-deficient T cells expressing high levels of ΔCnA underwent spontaneous cell death. This finding was consistent with previous reports showing that expression of ΔCnA induces cell death (14.Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, it was possible to select cells that expressed low enough levels of ΔCnA to remain viable (Fig. 1 D). Immunoblot analysis of endogenous CnA and transfected ΔCnA expression in IP3R-deficient T cells transfected with GFP vector or ΔCnA showed that in the cell lines selected for the present study the level of ΔCnA expression was comparable with that of the endogenous CnA (Fig. 1 D). The growth rate of cells stably expressing low levels of CnA was the same as that of vector-transfected controls (Fig. 2). To determine whether activation of CnA is a downstream signal required for apoptosis in Jurkat cells, sensitivity to inducers of apoptosis was examined using IP3R-deficient cells that are resistant to apoptosis and that express low levels of ΔCnA (Fig.3 A). Stimulation with αCD3 induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in IP3R-deficient Jurkat cells expressing ΔCnA but not in control cells (Fig. 3 A). Annexin V assays, which are specific for apoptosis, showed that there was no increase in apoptotic cell death after stimulation with αCD3 in IP3R-deficient cells not expressing ΔCnA (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Fig. 3,A and B shows that expression of ΔCnA, but not vector alone, rendered the previously resistant cells sensitive to induction of apoptosis by αCD3. This finding suggests that the resistance to apoptosis exhibited by IP3R-deficient cells (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) is causally linked to their inability to release intracellular Ca2+ (5.Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is required to activate CnA (7.Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the activation state of NF-AT is critically dependent on CnA activity (15.Loh C. Shaw K.T.-Y. Carew J. Viola J.P.B. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). NF-AT activation is required to coordinate the immune response (16.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which are potent inhibitors of CnA, inhibit NF-AT translocation (15.Loh C. Shaw K.T.-Y. Carew J. Viola J.P.B. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Because FK506 is also known to inhibit activation-induced apoptosis in T cells, the requirement of CnA in both cellular activation and apoptosis raises the immediate question of whether alternate pathways for cellular activation or cell death share common Ca2+-dependent signaling steps. IP3R-deficient T cells expressing low levels of ΔCnA, but not those expressing vector alone, exhibited translocation of NF-AT in response to stimulation with αCD3 (Fig.4 A). In the cell expressing GFP vector alone NF-AT remains localized to the cytoplasm after stimulation with αCD3, as in the unstimulated cells, whereas in the cells expressing ΔCnA the NF-AT signal is detected in the nucleus following stimulation with αCD3 (Fig. 4 A). The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, which increases [Ca2+]i , induced translocation of NF-AT in both vector- and ΔCnA-transfected IP3R-deficient T cells (Fig. 4 B). FK506 (1 μm) blocked NF-AT translocation in both constitutively active ΔCnA-expressing cells and in ionomycin-treated cells (Fig. 4 B). These findings, coupled with our earlier reports showing that IP3R-deficient cells are resistant to apoptosis (3.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and cannot undergo TCR-mediated activation (5.Jayaraman T. Ondriasova E. Ondrias K. Harnick D.J. Marks A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6007-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggest that IP3-induced intracellular Ca2+ release is required for activation of apoptosis and for NF-AT translocation. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators of programmed cell death (17.Yang E. Korsemeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 19.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar) and are comprised of both anti- and pro-apoptotic members. It is generally believed that the ratio of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family members regulates cell fate by the ability of the members to form a complex with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (17.Yang E. Korsemeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Kelekar A. Chang B. Harlan J. Fesik S. Thompson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 12: 7040-7046Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Bad is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is pro-apoptotic when it is associated with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. Recent studies have suggested that phosphorylation of Bad by the serine-threonine kinase, Akt (21.Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsemeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), causes its release from Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and eventual degradation after binding to 14-3-3 proteins (22.Aitken A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Bad by Akt is anti-apoptotic, and dephosphorylation of Bad is pro-apoptotic. Akt is an important mediator of the growth-promoting pathways that are linked to growth factor receptor pathways such as those involved in insulin signaling. Thus, signals such as growth factors and cytokines promote cell survival in part by activating pathways that result in Bad phosphorylation by Akt (23.Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Bad might be a downstream target of CnA. TCR-mediated activation of cells expressing low levels of ΔCnA resulted in dephosphorylation of Bad protein (Fig.5 A). In contrast, dephosphorylated Bad was not observed in cells expressing ΔCnA in the absence of αCD3 stimulation or in cells treated with ionomycin (3 μm) alone (without αCD3 stimulation), suggesting that active CnA alone in the absence of an apoptotic inducer is insufficient to dephosphorylate Bad. This was in contrast to the translocation of NF-AT, which is also dependent on activation of CnA (15.Loh C. Shaw K.T.-Y. Carew J. Viola J.P.B. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We showed that ionomycin (3 μm) alone (without αCD3 stimulation) caused NF-AT translocation. TCR-mediated activation of IP3R-deficient T cells that were not expressing ΔCnA failed to dephosphorylate Bad (Fig. 5 A). These findings suggested to us that when ΔCnA was present at physiological levels in cells (as opposed to overexpressed) an additional signal was required to achieve colocalization of ΔCnA with Bad. Indeed, αCD3-mediated TCR stimulation did induce the colocalization of ΔCnA and Bad (Fig.5 B). These data suggest that the resistance to apoptosis in IP3R-deficient T cells is linked to the inability to dephosphorylate Bad because of insufficient CnA activation. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels can influence a wide variety of biochemical processes including gene transcription. Activation of CnA and the resulting dephosphorylation of NF-AT are downstream events triggered by a rise in [Ca2+]i. Modulation of CnA activation can alter the immune response. Indeed, viruses have evolved the ability to evade host defense systems by inhibiting CnA activity (24.Miskin J.E. Abrams C.C. Goatley L.C. Dixon L.K. Science. 1998; 281: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NF-AT4-deficient thymocytes display heightened sensitivity to apoptosis mediated through the TCR, indicating that NF-AT4 might control the up-regulation of survival genes (25.Oukka, M., Ho, I.-C., Brousse, F. C., Hoey, T., Grusby, M. J., and Glimcher, L. H. (1998) Immunity 295–304Google Scholar). It should be noted that NF-AT4 first associates with CnA in the cytoplasm and then both are translocated into the nucleus, where CnA may continue to act to counter the effects of nuclear NF-AT kinases (26.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Our data are in agreement with the earlier findings that NF-AT translocation is defective in triple negative (type 1,2,3 IP3R-deficient) cells in response to B cell antigen receptor cross-linking (27.Sugawara S. Kurosaki H. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Taken together our data and those of others indicate that Ca2+-dependent signaling via CnA can activate cell growth pathways, e.g. through NF-AT, and cell death pathways, e.g. through Bad. Cell death signals may be regulated by both transcriptional (e.g. dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes) and post-translational modification. It is not clear whether CnA regulates apoptosis solely via post-translational modifications or via transcriptional effects as well. Our data are consistent with the findings that dephosphorylation of Bad by CnA neutralizes the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2. The other possibilities could be that by dephosphorylating the transcription factors present in cytosol, CnA acts to translocate them to the nucleus to turn on the genes necessary for apoptosis. The corollary of this possibility is that survival factor-induced phosphorylation (such as by Akt) would retain the transcription factors in the cytosol and thus would prevent the activation of apoptotic genes. In this regard, it has been shown recently that Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating a Forkhead transcription factor, FKHRL1. Interestingly, dephosphorylation of this transcription factor results in translocation to the nucleus and activates Fas ligand (28.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). In summary, our study establishes that IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release is required for CnA activation, NF-AT translocation, and Bad dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Bad promotes cell survival by protecting the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, and CnA acts as a negative regulator of Bad via dephosphorylation and thus neutralizes Bcl-2 activity. Given this model, the magnitude and spatio-temporal activation of CnA can determine the specificity of a given response (e.g. either cell growth or cell death). The activation of specific scaffold, anchoring, and adapter proteins that recruit and place active CnA close to its substrate (29.Pawson T. Scott D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) could provide specificity. A mammalian scaffold complex has recently been identified that accounts for specificity in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (30.Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, active CnA in the absence of αCD3 activation failed to induce apoptosis in IP3R-deficient T cells unless the levels of active CnA were higher than those observed in normal cells. Interestingly, raising [Ca2+]i by itself (without ionomycin) was sufficient to induce translocation of NF-AT but not dephosphorylation of Bad. Thus, in addition to the elevation of [Ca2+]i another signal is required for apoptotic but not necessarily for cell growth pathways. These data suggest that in addition to Ca2+-dependent activation of CnA, apoptotic inducers must also trigger localization of CnA to substrates to initiate apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014522189,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play a key role in maintaining the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrate proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). However, the PTPase(s) that inactivate IR and IRS-1 under physiological conditions remain unidentified. Here, we analyze the subcellular distribution in rat adipocytes of several PTPases thought to be involved in the counterregulation of insulin signaling. We found that the transmembrane enzymes, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-α and leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), were detected predominantly in the plasma membrane and to a lesser extent in the heavy microsomes, a distribution similar to that of insulin receptor. PTP-1B and IRS-1 were present in light microsomes and cytosol, whereas SHPTP2/Syp was exclusively cytosolic. Insulin induced a redistribution of PTP-α from the plasma membrane to the heavy microsomes in a parallel fashion with the receptor. The distribution of PTP-1B in the light microsomes from resting adipocytes was similar to that of IRS-1 as determined by sucrose velocity gradient fractionation. Analysis of the catalytic activity of partially purified rat adipocyte PTP-α and LAR and recombinant PTP-1B showed that all three PTPases dephosphorylate IR. When a mix of IR/IRS-1 was used as a substrate, PTP-1B was particularly effective in dephosphorylating IRS-1. Considering that IR and IRS-1 can be dephosphorylated in internal membrane compartments from rat adipocytes (Kublaoui, B., Lee, J., and Pilch, P.F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 59–65) and that PTP-α and PTP-1B are the respective PTPases in these fractions, we conclude that these PTPases are responsible for the counterregulation of insulin signaling there, whereas both LAR and PTP-α may act upon cell surface insulin receptors. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play a key role in maintaining the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrate proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).

Considering that IR and IRS-1 can be dephosphorylated in internal membrane compartments from rat adipocytes (Kublaoui, B., Lee, J., and Pilch, P.F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 59–65) and that PTP-α and PTP-1B are the respective PTPases in these fractions, we conclude that these PTPases are responsible for the counterregulation of insulin signaling there, whereas both LAR and PTP-α may act upon cell surface insulin receptors. insulin receptor substrate protein-tyrosine phosphatase protein-tyrosine phosphatase leukocyte common antigen-related insulin receptor fast performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Hepes-EDTA-sucrose The initial steps in insulin signaling require protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The interaction of insulin with its plasma membrane receptor elicits a rapid autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues in several domains of the receptor's cytoplasmic β-subunit followed by activation of the receptor's exogenous tyrosine kinase activity as reflected by enhanced substrate phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 1.White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 2.Lee J. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C319-C334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principle insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)1 involved in metabolic regulation are IRS-1 and IRS-2, and there is abundant biochemical evidence to support this (reviewed in Ref. 3.White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence from animals devoid of IRS-1 (4.Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S.

Satoh S. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) and IRS-2 (6.Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) further suggests that these molecules are intimately involved in the signaling to metabolic pathways regulated by insulin. Two additional members of the IRS family, IRS-3 and IRS-4, have been described, but they are unlikely to be involved in insulin-dependent metabolic regulation because the former is not expressed in the appropriate tissues (7.Lavan B.E. Fantin V.R. Chang E.T. Lane W.S. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21403-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and a knockout of the latter has no obvious metabolic phenotype (8.Liu S.C.H. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18093-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). IRS-1 and IRS-2 contain numerous tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, act as docking sites for a certain set of Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins (3.White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In particular, it is the activation of PI-3 kinase in association with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 that propagates the insulin signaling cascade required for most or all of insulin's pleiotropic actions including metabolic regulation (9.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Attenuation of insulin action is mediated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), which dephosphorylate and deactivate the insulin receptor and post-receptor substrates. PTPases comprise a large family of transmembrane and intracellular enzymes that can act as either positive or negative regulators of signaling pathways (10.Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11.Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Several PTPases have been shown to be highly expressed in the major insulin-sensitive tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, and these include LAR, PTP-α, PTP-1B, and SHPTP2/Syp. Evidence that these particular enzymes are involved in insulin signaling comes from a variety of experimental approaches as has been comprehensively reviewed (12.Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13.Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14.Byon J.C. Kusari A.B. Kusari J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, the association LAR and PTP-1B with the insulin receptor and SHPTP2/Syp with IRS-1 has been shown by co-immunoprecipitation; negative effects on insulin signaling have been demonstrated as a result of overexpressing wild-type enzyme, and positive effects on insulin signaling result from expressing dominant negative (inactive) enzymes. Recently, gene knockouts for LAR (15.Ren J.M. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Sweet L.J. Cline G. Shulman G.I. Livingston J.N. Goldstein B.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and PTP-1B (16.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) have also implicated these enzymes in insulin signaling. However, a consensus has not emerged as to whether any one or all of these PTPases play a physiological role in reversing the insulin signal in its target cells under normal physiological conditions. We reasoned that for a specific PTPase to affect IR or IRS-1 function, both enzyme and substrate must be in the same place in the cell, at least transiently. Moreover, we (17.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and others (18.Bevan A.P. Burgess J.W. Drake P.G. Shaver A. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J.

With this in mind, we determined the intracellular localization of the PTPases PTP-α, LAR, SHPTP2/Syp, and PTP-1B as well as IR and IRS-1 in freshly isolated rat adipocytes in the presence or absence of insulin. In addition, we tested if the PTPases mentioned above have a preferential substrate specificity for IR or IRS-1. Collagenase and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The BCA protein determination kit was from Pierce. Aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A were obtained from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Electrophoresis chemicals were purchased from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-IRS-1 and anti-SHPTP2/Syp antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-PTP-1B antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IR antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Jongsoon Lee (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Anti-R-PTP-α antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Sap (Dept. of Pharmacology, New York University). Anti-LAR antibody (21.Weng L.P. Yuan J. Yu Q. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Qiang Yu (Pulmonary Center, Department of Medicine and Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine). Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion from epididymal fat pads of 150–175-g male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) as described previously (22.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated cells were allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C for 30 min with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.5 mmd-glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Insulin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) was added to the cell suspension for 10 min to a final concentration of 10 nm. Cells were washed two times and homogenized in 20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin, at pH 7.4. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (17.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein was quantitated using the BCA assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Light microsomes (1–2 mg of protein) were resuspended in HES buffer, pH 7.4, including protease inhibitors, and an equal amount of protein from each treatment was loaded onto the continuous sucrose gradient, ranging from 10 to 35% (w/v). Membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 55 min at 4 °C (23.Kummer J.L. Calera M.R. Pilch P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fractions (approximately 200 μl) were collected from the gradient, and protein content was measured. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) on 8 or 10% acrylamide gels run according to Ref. 24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon membrane (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at 25 °C to block nonspecific binding and then probed with polyclonal antibodies to LAR, R-PTP-α, IR, IRS-1, and PTP-1B or with monoclonal antibodies to SHPTP2/Syp and GLUT4 (25.James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To detect the antigen-bound antibody, the blots were treated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative analysis was performed using a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Solubilized plasma membrane (2–3 mg of protein) was subjected to FPLC with a Mono Q column (HR5/5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% Triton and protease inhibitors and developed at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl. Positions of the transmembrane phosphatases LAR and PTP-α were determined by Western blotting, and fractions were pooled and concentrated using a microfiltration unit, Centricon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Insulin receptor was purified from NIH-3T3 cells transfected with human insulin receptor using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose chromatography as described (26.Lee J. O'Hare T. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified insulin receptor was incubated with 10−7m insulin overnight at 4 °C. A tyrosine kinase reaction in the presence and absence of recombinant full-length IRS-1 protein (0.5–1.0 μg; Upstate Biotechnology) as an exogenous substrate was performed in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 8 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 15 min (26.Lee J. O'Hare T. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by a Bio-Gel P6 spin column (Bio-Rad). 32P-Labeled insulin receptor and32P-labeled insulin receptor substrate were incubated with column fractions (obtained as described above) containing endogenous LAR or PTP-α in a 125-μl reaction volume with 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) at 30 °C (23.Kummer J.L. Calera M.R. Pilch P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31.Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) containing β-mercaptoethanol, and after boiling the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. When indicated, a recombinant GST-PTP-1B fusion protein (full-length, 0.025 μg; Upstate Biotechnology) was used. Dephosphorylation of the 95-kDa β-subunit of the insulin receptor and the 180-kDa band of the insulin receptor substrate was analyzed by autoradiography. Since the localization of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases can be an important factor in determining their substrate specificity, we first studied the subcellular distribution of the PTPases PTP-α, LAR, PTP-1B, and SHPTP2/Syp in freshly isolated rat adipocytes and compared this to that of the IR, IRS-1, and GLUT4. Under basal conditions, PTPases PTP-α and LAR (Fig. 1,middle panels) fractionated in a manner very similar to that of the IR, particularly PTP-α, whose distribution was primarily in the plasma membrane (62%), followed by heavy (29%) and light microsomes (9%). As expected and as we have reported (25.James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 27.Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), GLUT4 was found only in light and heavy microsomes (Fig. 1,bottom panel). Stimulation of adipocytes with insulin resulted in the redistribution of the transmembrane PTPase PTP-α from the plasma membrane to the heavy microsomes (Fig. 1, middle panels). Also, insulin exposure reproducibly caused a small apparent increase in LAR immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane. LAR cannot be translocated to the plasma membrane because it is not present in any other compartment, and therefore, the altered signal may be a result of a change in affinity for antibody, possible as a result of a covalent modification. Consistent with previous reports (17.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18.Bevan A.P. Burgess J.W.

PTP-1B, SHPTP2/Syp, IRS-1, and IRS-2 all fractionated to the light microsomes and cytosol (Fig. 2). In the presence of insulin, the PTPase PTP-1B showed a small degree of redistribution from the light microsomes to the cytosol, and IRS-2 exhibited a small increase in this subcellular fraction (Fig. 2,middle panel). By contrast, IRS-1 and SHPTP2/Syp distribution did not change in response to insulin treatment (Fig. 2,top and bottom panels). Although SHPTP2/Syp is abundantly expressed in rat adipocytes (Fig. 2), several lines of evidence (31.Kuhne M.R. Zhao Z. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32.Hausdorff S.F. Bennett A.M. Neel B.G. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) tend to rule it out as playing a role in insulin's regulation of metabolic processes, particularly GLUT4 translocation. Also, compared with IRS-1, relatively little IRS-2 was present in rat adipocytes (Fig. 2, middle panel), and for these reasons, SHPTP2/Syp and IRS-2 were not studied further. In search of support for a enzyme/substrate relation, we investigated a possible colocalization of the PTP-1B with IR or IRS-1 in the intracellular membranes of adipocytes. Light microsomes were fractionated by sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation, and the resultant fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 (middle andbottom panels), PTP-1B and IRS-1 migrated at the top of the gradient in vesicles or macromolecular assemblies (35.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with the same density. There is a slight shift in IRS-1 distribution after insulin treatment as was previously demonstrated in rat skeletal muscle (23.Kummer J.L. Calera M.R. Pilch P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, insulin receptors were found to peak toward the middle of the velocity gradient (fractions 7–13) as did GLUT4 (Fig. 3,top and middle panels). As expected, insulin receptors were chased into the light microsomes by insulin, and GLUT4 levels decreased in the gradient fractions from the light microsomes (Fig. 3, top panel), due to a translocation to the plasma membrane. Considering the data in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, we can assume that either PTP-α or LAR or both PTPases can act on the insulin receptor at the cell surface and possibly in the HM, whereas the PTPase PTP-1B may exert its action on IRS-1. In order to test these possibilities, the transmembrane phosphatases PTP-α and LAR were purified from the plasma membrane fraction on a Mono Q column by FPLC with a linear gradient of 50 mm to 1 m NaCl. These PTPases were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-PTP-α and anti-LAR antibodies in the column fractions (Fig.4 A), which were assayed for PTPase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, PTPase activities using autophosphorylated labeled insulin receptor as substrate were only found in the column fractions that contained the transmembrane PTPases. To determine if endogenous PTP-α, LAR, and recombinant PTP-1B have a substrate preference toward IR or IRS-1, we performed a dephosphorylation reaction using a mix of phosphate-labeled IR/IRS-1 as substrates. A time course of the reaction was followed between 5 and 60 min. As shown in Fig. 5, A–C, each of the PTPases dephosphorylated IR and IRS-1 in a time-dependent manner. However, the three enzymes tested differed in their activity toward IR or IRS-1 dephosphorylation. At all times examined, IRS-1 was more efficiently dephosphorylated than IR (Fig. 5, B–C), and PTP-1B was particularly effective in dephosphorylating IRS-1. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein at a specific point in time represents a carefully modulated balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities. As noted previously, several PTPases have been implicated as exerting a negative regulation on insulin action, mainly in dephosphorylating the insulin receptor (IR), and these are PTP-α, LAR, and PTP-1B (reviewed in Refs. 12.Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13.Goldstein B.J. Ahmad F. Ding W. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Mol. Cell.

Conclusions along these lines derived from studies performed in cells using recombinant PTPases or overexpression systems in which the PTPase levels are artificially high (e.g. see Refs. 36.Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) for PTP-α, PTP-1B, and LAR, respectively). Although the level of PTPase mRNA has been determined in rat adipocytes (39.Ding W. Zhang W.R. Sullivan K. Hashimoto N. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), there has heretofore been no study of their distribution or enzymatic activity in these cells. Thus, we studied the expression of PTPases PTP-α, PTP-1B, and LAR at the protein level, their catalytic activity toward IR and IRS-1, and their subcellular distribution under basal conditions and after insulin stimulation in freshly isolated rat adipocytes. Although it is well known that when expressed in vitro, any of the studied PTPases can dephosphorylate the insulin receptor (40.Hashimoto N. Feener E.P. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13811-13814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to show that there is enough activity actually expressed in target cells to achieve this physiologically. The results we obtained demonstrate that all three PTPases are able to efficiently dephosphorylate insulin receptors, indicating that any of these PTPases have the potential to inactivate it in vivo. LAR and PTP-α were isolated in parallel and concentrated to the same extent; therefore, their catalytic activity is directly comparable. As when expressed enzymes were studied in vitro (40.Hashimoto N. Feener E.P. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13811-13814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also found that they were similarly effective in dephosphorylating IR, which does not support a preferential role of either PTPase. IRS-1 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after insulin stimulation followed by its dephosphorylation by an undetermined PTPase (17.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We found that in addition to dephosphorylating IR, PTP-α, LAR, and PTP-1B could also effectively dephosphorylate IRS-1, a result that does not support the existence of a unique PTPase for IR and another for IRS-1. In fact, when a mix of IR/IRS-1 was used as a substrate, all three PTPases were more efficient in dephosphorylating IRS-1 than IR. In particular, PTP1B was very effective in dephosphorylating IRS-1, and these proteins partially overlap in their subcellular distribution, suggesting a possible functional relationship. There is an abundance of experimental evidence to support LAR as a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway. This includes the formation of a physical complex between LAR and IR detected by immunoprecipitation (41.Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 448-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a decrease in the response to insulin in cells overexpressing LAR (38.Zhang W.R. Li P.M. Oswald M.A. Goldstein B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), an enhanced sensitivity to insulin in cells expressing antisense LAR mRNA (42.Kulas D.T.

However, LAR knockout mice did not show the anticipated increase or extended IR or IRS-1 phosphorylation after insulin stimulation but instead displayed an unexpected decrease in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (15.Ren J.M.

As previously noted in this paper, we and others have shown that internalized IR is highly phosphorylated and displays enhanced kinase activity and that both features subsequently decrease with time, indicating that a PTPase involved in IR dephosphorylation may reside in an endosomal compartment and not exclusively in the plasma membrane. In rat adipocytes (Fig. 1), LAR is present almost exclusively in plasma membrane, and it does not translocate to endosomal compartments even after insulin stimulation, suggesting that it is unlikely that LAR participates in IR inactivation in the endosomal compartment. Therefore, it may function exclusively at the plasma membrane. In rat adipocytes, PTP-α mRNA was the most abundant of several PTPases examined (39.Ding W. Zhang W.R. Sullivan K. Hashimoto N. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we show that although PTP-α is primarily in the plasma membrane, there is a significant fraction associated with heavy microsomes, an internal membrane compartment. Most importantly, insulin markedly increased the amount of PTP-α associated with this fraction. As mentioned above, IR dephosphorylation occurs in an internal membrane compartment, and from Fig. 1 it is clear that there is a significant amount of IR that translocates to the same heavy fraction as PTP-α. It is tempting to speculate that IR and PTP-α are in the same population of vesicles in the heavy microsomes fraction. Preliminary results show that, indeed, after further fractionation of the heavy microsomes by a sucrose velocity gradient, both IR and PTP-α are present in the same fractions, although it remains to be shown if both proteins coexist in the same vesicles or if they are present in different vesicles with the same density. A negative role for PTP-α in insulin action has been proposed by Molleret al. (36.Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) based on a decrease of IR tyrosine kinase activity after overexpression of PTP-α in baby hamster kidney cells. However, very recently, Arnott et al. (44.Arnott C.H. Sale E.M. Miller J. Sale G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26105-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) found that decreasing PTP-α levels with an antisense probe had no significant effect on the dephosphorylation profile of IR and IRS-1 proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although this result apparently contradicts the overexpression data and does not support a role for PTP-α in insulin signaling, it is possible that the enzyme is so efficient that the levels remaining after the antisense treatment (20%) are enough to effectively dephosphorylate IR and IRS-1. Interestingly, the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport under these conditions was not reported (44.Arnott C.H. Sale E.M. Miller J. Sale G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26105-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PTP-1B was one of the first PTPases to be identified, cloned, and shown to display a significant effect on the modulation of insulin signaling (45.Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Microinjection of PTP-1B into Xenopus oocytes blocked insulin-stimulated S6 peptide phosphorylation and retarded insulin-induced oocyte maturation (45.Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that overexpression of PTP-1B affected insulin- or insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and metabolic responses such as glucose incorporation into glycogen (37.Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and that PTP-1B and IR interacted physically (46.Seely B.L. Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Berhanu P. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Kusari J. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PTP-1B-deficient (knockout) mice were shown to have an increased phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 in liver and muscle tissue after insulin injection as well as a resistance to weight gain in mice, suggesting that PTP-1B has a major role in modulating both insulin sensitivity and fuel metabolism (16.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). PTP-1B, which is localized in the light microsomal fraction of fat cells (Figs. 2 and 3), can also potentially interact with the internalized IR following insulin stimulation. It is interesting to note that PTP-1B and IRS-1 show a very similar subcellular compartmentalization and that PTP-1B had the highest activity toward IRS-1 compared with IR. Considering these results altogether, we believe that this PTPase plays an important role in IRS-1 dephosphorylation. In summary, our studies lead us to conclude that PTP-α and PTP-1B may play a major role in modulating the insulin signaling pathway through the inactivation of insulin receptor kinase and post-insulin receptor cellular substrate proteins such as IRS-1. In view of the complexity and contradictory nature of published work in this regard, it is likely that further work will be necessary to determine more precisely the nature and location of PTPases involved in modulating insulin signaling."

Although a number of E2F-inducible genes have been identified, the biochemical cascades from E2F to the S phase entry remain to be investigated. In this study, we generated stably transfected mouse NIH3T3 cells that express exogenous human E2F-1 under the control of a heavy metal-inducible metallothionein promoter and analyzed the molecular mechanism of the E2F-1-mediated initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. Ectopic E2F-1 expression in cells arrested in G0/G1 by serum deprivation enabled them to progress through G1 and to enter S phase. During the G1 progression, mouse cyclin E, but little of cyclin D1, was induced to express, which subsequently activated Cdk2. Experiments using the Cdk inhibitory proteins p27, p18, and p19 proved that the activity of Cdk2, but not of Cdk4, was required for S phase entry mediated by E2F-1. Minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) 4 and 7, the components of the DNA-replication initiation complex (RC), were constitutively expressed during the cell cycle, although theMCM genes are well known E2F-inducible genes.

From this point of view, the component that functions the furthest downstream of the known G1 regulators would be directly involved in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. The candidates for such a factor include transcription factor E2F (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 2.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). The expression level of the endogenous E2F protein transiently increases near the G1/S boundary (3.Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and overexpression of E2F can induce chromosomal DNA synthesis of quiescent cells (4.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dominant negative E2F molecule inhibits the entry into S phase (5.Dobrowolski S.F. Stacey D.W. Harter M.L. Stine J.T. Hiebert S.W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2605-2612PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, E2F plays a pivotal role in regulating the transition from G1 to S phase. E2F-inducible genes include a number of genes whose products function to regulate the cell-cycle progression and the initiation of DNA replication (6.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 7.Sardet C. LeCam L. Fabbrizio E. Vidal M. Karin M. Ghysdael J. Yaniv M. Progress in Gene Expression, Oncogenes as Transcriptional Regulators. 2. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 1-63Google Scholar). Among them, thecyclin E gene is known to be one of the most important targets for E2F (8.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that ectopic expression of cyclin E could drive quiescent cells into S phase under situations in which E2F activities are undetectable or suppressed (9.Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that cyclin E could at least in part replace E2F in terms of S phase induction. Conversely, overexpression of E2F has been reported to be able to drive cells into S phase under the condition in which cyclin E-associated kinase activity is inhibited by the dominant-negative Cdk2 or Cdk inhibitors. Moreover, E2F has been shown to induce cell-cycle progression of γ-irradiated cells in which no Cdk2 kinase activity was detected (10.DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These results imply that the E2F-mediated pathway of S phase induction is composed of multiple signaling pathways and that the rate-limiting steps for the initiation of DNA synthesis may vary in different cell types and in different situations. Recently, many regulatory components involved in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells have been successfully identified and characterized (11.Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12.Tada S. Blow J.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 941-949PubMed Google Scholar). A multisubunit complex known as the origin recognition complex (ORC)1 binds to autonomously replicating origins of DNA. Several other molecules functionally and physically interact with this ORC·DNA complex and regulate DNA replication during S phase. Such factors include Cdc6, minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs), a Dbf4·Cdc7 kinase complex, and Cdc45 (11.Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12.Tada S. Blow J.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 941-949PubMed Google Scholar). The MCM complex consists of a family of six related proteins and is involved not only in triggering DNA replication but also in inhibiting re-replication during G2 phase as a candidate for the licensing factor (12.Tada S. Blow J.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 941-949PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of MCMs in mammalian DNA replication stems from the fact that microinjection of antibodies against MCM3 and MCM2 proteins inhibits the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells (13.Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although MCMs are present in the nucleus throughout the mammalian cell cycle, their association with chromatin changes in a cell-cycle dependent manner (13.Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Near the G1/S boundary, MCMs are tightly associated with chromatin. As cells progress through S phase, MCMs are gradually dissociated and, in G2 phase, no detectable interactions are observed between MCMs and chromatin. MCM loading onto the replication origins requires both ORC and Cdc6 proteins (15.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 16.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the MCM components by the Cdc7 and Cdc2 kinases is a critical step for the initiation of DNA replication and the dissociation of MCMs from chromatin, respectively (18.Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19.Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J.

A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the state of MCMs in the nucleus clearly represents the environment around the replication origin. Furthermore, the transcription of all the MCM genes is up-regulated in late G1 by the E2F transcription factor (23.Tsuruga H. Yabuta N. Hosoya S. Tamura K. Endo Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24.Leone G. DeGregori J. Yan Z. Jakoi L. Ishida S. Williams R.S. Nevins J.R.

Oncogene. 1999; 8: 2299-2309Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MCM genes could be the rate-limiting components in the E2F-mediated induction of S phase. Another regulatory factor essentially required for replication initiation is Cdc45, which interacts genetically with MCMs and ORC and physically with MCMs and the yeast replication origins (26.Dalton S. Hopwood B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5867-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27.Zou L. Mitchell J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28.Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of Cdc45 reveal that it is a unique protein and not a member of the MCM family. Cdc45 is neither a component of the pre-replicative complex nor a requirement for its formation, but it associates with the pre-replicative complex after activation of S-phase-promoting Cdk (28.Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, a Xenopus Cdc45 homologue has been shown to play a pivotal role in the loading of DNA polymerase onto chromatin under the control of the S-phase-Cdk activity (29.Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc45 could be another candidate of the key elements functioning downstream of E2F at the onset of S phase. In this study, we generated a cell system in which the expression of exogenous E2F-1 can be extracellularly controlled and then analyzed the molecular mechanism of the E2F-mediated induction of S phase. We especially focused on the actions and behaviors of MCMs (MCM4 and -7) and Cdc45. Our results strongly suggest that there are at least two independent pathways functioning downstream of E2F to regulate MCMs and Cdc45, one of which depends upon the activity of Cdk2 and the other does not. Thus, transcription factor E2F and cyclin E/cdk2 kinase seem to cooperate to induce chromosomal DNA replication in mouse fibroblasts. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The entire coding sequence of human E2F-1 or cyclin E was inserted into an expression vector (pMT-CB6+) (30.Cook D.M. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1789-1799PubMed Google Scholar) containing a sheep metallothionein promoter and a neo gene. Cells were transfected with an expression vector by a modified calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method (31.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) and selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Each cell clone derived from a single transfected cell was isolated using cloning rings (IWAKI GLASS), expanded, and tested for protein expression in response to heavy metal. For synchronization, exponentially growing cells plated at a low density (about 10% confluency) were incubated in medium containing 0.1% FBS for 48 h and then stimulated to enter the cell cycle by adding 10% FBS or 20 μm ZnSO4. For flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, cells were suspended in a 1-ml solution of 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and treated with 1 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence from the propidium iodide-DNA complex was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by the Cell Fit cell cycle software. For determination of BrdUrd incorporation, cells were plated on a cover glass at a low density, starved, and stimulated as described above, and then incubated in BrdUrd (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min before harvest. Cells were fixed in a glycine buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 2.0) containing 70% ethanol, stained with anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody in the presence of nuclease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell samples were viewed by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy and the number of BrdUrd-positive cells was scored. In each experiment, more than 500 cells were examined. Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and an immune complex kinase assay were performed as described (32.Kurokawa K. Tanaka T. Kato J.-y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2718-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to cyclin D1 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human E2F-1, mouse cyclin E, human cyclin E, mouse cyclin A, and mouse Cdk2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to mouse pRb and an HA peptide epitope were from Pharmingen and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Polyclonal rabbit antibody to Cdc45 was generated against a bacterially produced GST-Cdc45 fusion protein, which was created by insertion of the cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of human Cdc45 (kindly provided by H. Takisawa, Osaka University) into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibody cross-reacted with mouse Cdc45 as well as with the human protein. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by neutralization with excess recombinant Cdc45 proteins. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin, stained with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For double staining of the cell sample, cells stained with anti-HA rabbit antibody (BabCO) and Texas Red-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were treated with 1.5 m HCl and re-stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (see above). The cell samples were viewed by phase-contrast or fluorescence microscopy. Total RNA was purified from mouse fibroblasts using ISO-GEN (Nippon Gene). Thirty μg of RNA per lane was separated on agarose gels under denaturing conditions, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA containing mouse cyclin E or mouse cyclin D1 under highly stringent conditions. For analysis of the Cdc45 gene expression, total RNA was isolated from serum-starved REF52 cells infected with adenovirus vectors and analyzed using human Cdc45 cDNA as a probe. The pHsCDC45-Luc (−459) reporter plasmid consisting of the human Cdc45 promoter and a luciferase gene was generated by insertion of the genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking sequence of Cdc45 cDNA (−459 to −21, as 5′ end of the cDNA +1) into the KpnI site of the pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega). The control reporter plasmid, pHsCDC45-Luc (E2F-), contains the modified sequence, TTTGATGGGAGT (nucleotides −60 to −49) in place of an E2F-like site, TTTGGCGGGAGT, created by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis. The methods for REF52 cell transfection and luciferase assay were previously described (4.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Extraction of the nuclear protein was performed basically as described (14.Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In short, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% Nonident P-40) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, sodium fluoride, and sodium orthovanadiate. The cell lysates were collected and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet fraction was resuspended in a hypotonic lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 5 min, collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and added to SDS sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 4 min before separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To investigate the molecular action of E2F in S phase induction, we constructed a cell system in which expression of the E2F subunit can be extracellularly controlled. There are 6 members of theE2F gene family, among which E2F-1, -2, and -3 have been shown to be able to induce DNA replication in quiescent fibroblasts (4.Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar,33.DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We chose E2F-1, the first member of this gene family, to analyze replication induction mediated by E2F transcription factors. We inserted the entire coding sequence of human E2F-1 cDNA into an inducible expression vector containing a heavy metal-inducible metallothionein promoter and a neo gene conferring resistance to G418, and transfected the plasmid into mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. After selection in G418, several cell clones (NIH-E2F clones) were isolated and tested for expression of human E2F-1 in response to heavy metal. We present here the results obtained from one representative cell line, but several independent clones behaved similarly. The expression of human E2F-1 was detected in response to heavy metal in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A), which was sufficient to induce entry into S phase (Fig. 1 B). However, addition of more than 40 μm ZnSO4 to serum-starved cells induced substantial cell death and precluded the precise measuring of the BrdUrd uptake. In the presence of serum, higher doses of ZnSO4 can induce higher levels of E2F-1 protein expression (Fig. 1 A). However, the level of E2F-1 expression induced by 20 μm ZnSO4 drove a significant portion of the cells into S phase (Fig. 1 B) and was sufficient to up-regulate the E2F activity in the cells (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, we decided to treat the starved cells with 20 μm ZnSO4 in the following experiments. To determine the precise timing of the initiation of S phase, both parental and NIH-E2F cells that had been synchronized in G0/G1 by serum starvation were re-stimulated with serum or ZnSO4 and were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 20 min before fixation. Cells that had incorporated BrdUrd into their chromosomal DNA were detected by immunofluorescent staining using antibody to BrdUrd (Fig. 1 D). BrdUrd-positive cells began to appear in both serum- and ZnSO4-stimulated populations of NIH-E2F cells at approximately 10 h post-stimulation and the number of positive cells increased thereafter with similar kinetics except that ZnSO4 stimulation was slightly more effective. In a control experiment, parental NIH3T3 cells responded to serum but not to ZnSO4 as expected. To look at the bulk of newly synthesized DNA and the rate of S phase progression, we measured the DNA content of NIH-E2F cells treated as above by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1 E). Serum-stimulated cells continuously progressed through S phase and the vast majority of cells returned to G1 within 24 h post-stimulation. Of the ZnSO4-stimulated cells, however, only 23.3% were in S phase at 16 h post-stimulation although about 50% were BrdUrd-positive at 14 h post-stimulation. These results may sound paradoxical but because we labeled the cells with BrdUrd only for a short time, the intensity of the BrdUrd-positive signals does not necessarily reflect the total sum of newly synthesized DNA. In addition, the measurement of BrdUrd uptake is a far more sensitive assay than the measurement of the DNA content by flow cytometry because a certain amount of DNA needs to be synthesized and accumulated for detection by flow cytometry. Therefore, it may be reasonable to conclude that although ectopic E2F-1 expression effectively fired the origin of DNA replication, the actual rate of DNA synthesis was not very high and not enough newly synthesized DNA to be detected by flow cytometric analysis accumulated. In fact, the increase in DNA content of E2F-1-induced cells during S phase was much slower than in serum stimulated cells (compare 16 h versus 24 h in Fig.1 E). Thus, it is likely that some other factors induced by serum are required for effective promotion of the normal cell cycle. Since the promoters of the G1 cyclin (cyclins D and E) genes contain the E2F-binding site and thecyclin E gene has been reported as one of the E2F-inducible genes (1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 2.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), we investigated the expression of G1cyclins and the activation of their partner Cdks in our E2F-inducible cells. Among three subtypes of cyclin Ds (D1, D2, and D3), cyclin D1 is the major D-type cyclin expressed in fibroblasts (34.Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Ectopic human E2F-1 induced much less cyclin D1 proteins than did FBS. Moreover, E2F-1-mediated cyclin D1 expression was temporal and occurred in early-to-mid G1 (Fig. 2 A, top panels). In contrast, cyclin E proteins were induced to express in response to ectopic E2F-1 expression. The kinetics of induction and the maximum amount of proteins were very similar between stimulations with FBS and heavy metal (Fig. 2 A, middle panels). We occasionally detected an additional band just above that of cyclin E (indicated by an arrowhead in Fig.2 A, middle panel). Although the identity of this is not yet clear, it is most likely that it does not represent alternative forms of cyclin E because (i) we see this band in cell samples in which cyclin E mRNA is not detectable (see time 0 in Fig. 2, Aand B, left panels), (ii) detection of this band is not reproducible (see Fig. 2, A, right panel, and Fig. 8 D, top panels), and (iii) this band was sometimes observed in blots assayed with antibodies to irrelevant proteins (data not shown). The expression of cyclin A proteins occurred several hours after cyclin E, and, once more, we did not see any differences between these two stimulations (Fig. 2 A, bottom panels). The mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and E mirrored the protein expression (Fig.2 B), suggesting that G1 cyclins were transcriptionally regulated by the ectopic E2F-1 transcription factor.Figure 8Cyclin E-mediated S phase induction. A, NIH-cycE cells were arrested in G0/G1 by incubation in 0.1% FBS for 48 h and stimulated with 10% FBS or 20 μm ZnSO4for 16 h. The direct cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specifically recognizing human cyclin E, mouse cyclin E, and mouse cyclin A. In a preliminary experiment, we confirmed that the antibodies to human and mouse cyclin E are species-specific and do not cross-react with the proteins from other species. B andC, the cells were treated as in panel A, except that BrdUrd was added at the time of stimulation and subject to immunofluorescent analysis using antibody to BrdUrd (B) and to flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (C).D, the quiescent cells were stimulated for the times indicated on the top, fractionated by the differential extraction method, and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to mouse cyclin E, MCM4, and Cdc45. E, the lysates from quiescent NIH-cycE cells (None) and the cells stimulated with FBS and ZnSO4 were subject to immunoblot analysis using antibody to Rb proteins. The positions of hyper-phosphorylated (ppRb) and hypo-phosphorylated (pRb) forms of Rb proteins are shown. F, NIH-cycE cells were transfected with an E2F reporter construct, deprived of serum for 48 h (None), and stimulated with FBS and ZnSO4. The relative luciferase activities contained in each cell lysate were measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An in vitro kinase assay after immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies revealed that the activation of Cdk2 occurred in parallel with cyclin E-protein expression (data not shown). To examine the Cdk2 activation within the cell, we looked at the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, one of the well knownin vivo substrates for the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex, by a mobility shift assay in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig.2 C shows that slower migrating, highly phosphorylated forms of Rb proteins appeared in parallel with cyclin E in response to heavy metal-mediated E2F-1 induction. Interestingly, although the first timings of the appearance of highly phosphorylated Rb proteins were very similar, the total shift of the Rb proteins to the slowest migrating forms was somewhat delayed in heavy metal-treated cells as compared with serum-stimulated cells. This could be because cooperation between cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes is required for efficient phosphorylation of Rb proteins (35.Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J.-y. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To determine whether G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activities are required for E2F-1-mediated induction of S phase in growth factor-deprived mouse fibroblasts, we introduced the Cdk inhibitory proteins by transient transfection and examined their effects on the E2F-1-mediated initiation of DNA replication (Fig.3). To date, 7 mammalian Cdk inhibitory proteins have been isolated and characterized (36.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). p27Kip1belongs to the Cip/Kip family and inhibits a variety of cyclin-Cdk complexes (cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin D-Cdk6, cyclin A-Cdk2, and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes). The INK4 family of Cdk inhibitors specifically targets cyclin D-dependent kinases, Cdk4 and Cdk6. DNA replication in serum-stimulated cells was efficiently blocked by all 3 Cdk inhibitors. However, E2F-1-mediated S phase induction was refractory to the INK4 family of Cdk inhibitors and was blocked by the universal inhibitor, p27, indicating that E2F-1 mediated S phase induction requires Cdk2 but not Cdk4 activity. Thus, E2F can be placed downstream of Cdk4 and upstream of Cdk2 in this particular system. The MCM complex, consisting of 6 different but closely related proteins, is required for the initiation of S phase and functions as the component of the regulatory machinery that allows cells to replicate DNA in S phase only once (11.Diffley J"

These properties of thrombin rely on its action as a serine protease, which cleaves the N-terminal region of a 7-transmembrane G protein receptor (protease-activated receptor, PAR-1), thus exposing a tethered end hexapeptide sequence capable of activating its receptor. Little is known about its effect on genes that regulate the cell cycle. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible mechanisms by which thrombin regulates tumor cell growth in several tumor cell lines: human CHRF megakaryocyte, DU145 prostate, MDAMB231 and MCF7 breast, U3A fibrosarcoma, and 2 murine fibroblast cell lines, MEFp53(−/−) and CD STAT(−/−). We have found that thrombin under the conditions of culture employed inhibits cell growth by both up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 and induction of caspases via its PAR-1 receptor. The increased expression of p21 waf/cip1 by thrombin was p53 independent, STAT1 dependent, and protein synthesis independent. This was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1, and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Induction of apoptosis is also PAR-1-specific, STAT1-dependent, and associated with up-regulation of caspases 1, 2, and 3. Our study establishes, for the first time, a link between PAR-1 receptor activation with the STAT signal pathway, which leads to cell cycle control and apoptosis. This observation broadens our understanding of the mechanism of PAR-1 activation and its effect on cell growth, and could possibly lead to therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer.

The activity of these enzymes is controlled in part by their association with regulatory subunits called cyclins (cyclin A to E) (1.Hunter T. Pines J.

In normal cells, CDKs exist predominantly in multiple quaternary complexes, each containing a CDK, cyclin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the p21 protein. However, in many transformed cells, such as SV40 T antigen-transformed cells, p21 waf/cip1 is lost from these multiprotein complexes; overexpression of p21 waf/cip1 inhibits the proliferation of mammalian cells (3.Harper J.W.

The newly formed N-terminal region of PAR-1 acts as a tethered ligand and activates thrombin's cellular responses. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the new N-terminal region of PAR-1 such as a 14-mer or 6-mer (thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP)) can substitute for thrombin receptor activation (19.Scarborough R.M.

Activation of the thrombin receptor stimulates a number of phospholipid-directed enzymes, generating both lipid-soluble and water-soluble second messengers (6.Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thrombin stimulates phosphoinositidase C activity which generates inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Both of these second messages are involved in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation, respectively. Thrombin stimulates jun,fos, Ras and MAP kinases which may be involved in mitogenesis (6.Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem.

On the other hand, it has been reported that the rapid induction of discrete intracellular signaling mechanisms by thrombin, including the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway, appears to be insufficient alone to promote vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis (23.Molloy C.J.

Little is known regarding the effect of thrombin on genes regulating the cell cycle. This study was undertaken to investigate the possible mechanisms by which thrombin regulates tumor cell growth. We report that thrombin can inhibit tumor cell growth. This is associated with the up-regulation of the universal inhibitor p21 waf/cip1 via a p53-independent, STAT1-dependent pathway as well as induction of apoptosis in association with the up-regulation of caspases, which is also mediated by a STAT1-dependent pathway. CHRF, a human megakaryocyte cell line, was a gift from Dr. M. Lieberman, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Human prostate cancer cell line DU145 and breast cancer cell lines MDAMB231 and MCF7 were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. MEFp53(−/−) cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) were derived from p53 knockout mice, and kindly provided by Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, New York University Medical Center. Mouse fibroblasts CD+ and CD− were derived from parental and STAT knockout mice, respectively, and kindly supplied by Dr. David Levy, New York University Medical Center. Both mouse fibroblast cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. U3A, STAT 1(−/−), human fibrosarcoma and 2B, STAT(+/+) human fibrosarcoma were obtained from Dr. Richard Pine (Public Health Research Center, New York). For experimental studies, cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence and then switched to serum-free media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for starving overnight. In some experiments, DU145 cells were cultured in media containing 5% FCS. Various concentrations of thrombin were then added to the cells. Thrombin and the thrombin receptor-activation peptide (TRAP 14-mer), hirudin (thrombin inhibitor), and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p21, anti-caspase 3, anti-JAK2, anti-STAT1, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz. Cells were seeded at 1 × 104/well in 96-well microtiter plates. Various concentrations of thrombin, ranging from 0.25 to 1 units/ml were then added to the wells. After 24 h, cells were pulsed with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 4 h at 37 °C. BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized cellular DNA was analyzed by immunoassay according to the method described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidine thiocynate-phenol-chloroform method (13.Nierodzik M.L. Chen K. Takeshita K. Li J-J. Huang Y-Q. Feng X-S. D'Andrea M.R. Andrade-Gordon P. Karpatkin S. Blood. 1998; 92: 3694-3700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was size fractionated in a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 mformaldehyde and then transferred to GeneScreen plus nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) using 10 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate). The specific probe for p21 waf/cip1 was kindly provided by Dr. David Beach, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The probes for caspase 1–3 were generated by RT-PCR, using the following primers. The caspase-1 primer pair, 5′-TTGCTCCCTAGAAGAAGCTCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCTTCCCGAATACCATGAGAC-3′, generated a 321-base pair product. The caspase 2 primer pair, 5′-TCCAGCTCCAAGAGGTTTTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCCTTTGAGGCAGGCATAG-3′, generated a 250-base pair product. The caspase 3 primer pair, 5′-TGGAACAAATGGACCTGTTGACC-3′ and 5′-AGGACTCAAATTCTGTTGCCACC-3′, generated a 356-base pair product. The filters were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with a specific probe nucleotide, labeled with [32P]dCTP in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 1% Denhart's solution, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, the membranes were washed under standard conditions and autoradiographed. mRNA signals were quantified by densitometeric analysis. The ratio of experimental treatment/control is reported as the closest round number. Each experiment has been repeated 2–3 times. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and lysed in 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin (10 μg/ml). Twenty μg of total protein were applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were incubated with preblocking solution (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 5% non-fat skim milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 16 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human p21 waf/cip1 antibody or rabbit anti-human caspase 3 antibody (Santa Cruz) in the same solution. After three washes in PBS, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase and developed using chemiluminescence with luminol. PAR-1 and PAR-3 were assayed in CHRF, DU145, MDAMB231, and MCF7 cells by RT-PCR as described previously (13.Nierodzik M.L. Chen K. Takeshita K. Li J-J. Huang Y-Q. Feng X-S. D'Andrea M.R. Andrade-Gordon P. Karpatkin S. Blood. 1998; 92: 3694-3700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase in solution containing hexanucleotide, dNTP, and buffer (Perkin-Elmer). PCR was performed in reactions containing Taq DNA polymerase, dNTP PCR buffer, and primers (PAR-1: 5′-GCAGAGCCCGGGACAATGGGG-3′ and 5′-AGATGGCCAGACAAGTGAAGG-3′; PAR-3: 5′CAGGAATATTATCTTGTTCAGCCA-3′, 5′-AAGGTAAGCAGTGGAGTGATTTCT-3′; PAR-4: 5′-GAAGCCTGAGCCCACAGCCCAGAG-3′, 5′CATGCAGAGTCCAAGGGCCAGGCG-3′). RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Incubated CHRF cells were washed with PBS, suspended in 400 μl of cold buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 30 min and nuclear extracts cleared by centrifugation.32P-End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC) containing STAT-1 nucleotide recognition sequences were used (26.Armstrong D.K. Kaufman S.H. Ottaviano Y.L. Furuya Y. Buckley J.A. Isaacs T.J. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5280-5283PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reaction was conducted in a solution containing 0.1 ng of probe, 5 μg of protein from nuclear extracts, 10 mm Hepes, 5% glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dT), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 m Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) and detected by radioautography. Total cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with either anti-STAT1 or JAK2 antibodies for 2 h at 40 °C, followed by addition of protein G beads and further incubation for 2 h. The immune complexes were washed five times with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting analysis as indicated above. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and JAK2 were detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. DU145 cells, cultured on chamber slides were starved in RPMI 1640 media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 16 h and then stimulated with thrombin for 30 min. The cells were fixed with cold methanol and then washed with PBS. After treatment with H2O2, the cells were incubated with anti-STAT1 (1:300) antibody for 2 h and visualized with avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and 3,3-diaminobenzidine. The cells were counterstained with methanol blue. Cells, treated without anti-STAT1 antibody, served as control. DU145 cells were cultured in media containing 1% FCS overnight, and then treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 24 h. The cells were smeared on slides and fixed with 10% formamide. The solution containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme and digoxigenin nucleotides was applied to the slides (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). After washes, the antidigoxigenin antibody-peroxidase conjugate was added to the slides, followed by staining with substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Methanol green solution was used for counterstaining. CHRF cells express PAR-1 and respond to stimulation by thrombin. The effect of thrombin on CHRF cells was examined by the incorporation of BrdUrd, a measure of DNA replication and therefore an indicator of cellular activity in the S phase of the cell cycle. CHRF and DU145 cells were incubated with or without various concentrations of thrombin for 16 h and pulse-labeled with BrdUrd. As shown in Fig.1 A, the amount of BrdUrd incorporated with thrombin-treated cells (1 units/ml) was only 20–25% of the incorporation seen with untreated cells. The maximum change in thrombin concentration-dependent impairment of cell growth was at 1 unit/ml thrombin. The same experiment was also performed with DU145 cells in media containing 5% FCS. Thrombin inhibited the incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA. This effect of 1.5 unit/ml thrombin could be reversed by hirudin (p = 0.003), demonstrating thrombin specificity (Fig. 1 B). Cell proliferation is controlled by cell cycle regulatory factors which include cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. The p21 waf/cip1 protein is a universal inhibitor of cyclin kinases and plays an important role in inhibiting cell proliferation. Therefore, the expression of p21 waf/cip1 mRNA was studied in CHRF cells following stimulation. The effect of continuous thrombin exposure (at various concentrations) on p21 waf/cip1 up-regulation in CHRF cells was prominent at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h (Fig.2 A). Although the effect was noted with as little as 0.25 units/ml thrombin, the maximum effect (3–4-fold) was generally noted at 0.5 unis/ml (5 nm). A similar up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 was noted after a relatively short 10-min exposure to thrombin (followed by washing) at 1 and 3 h of further incubation with disappearance of the effect at 6 h (Fig. 2 B). Similar 5-fold induction was noted with 2 breast cell lines, MDAMB431 and MCF7, following 3 h of incubation with 1 unit/ml thrombin (Fig. 2 C) and a prostate cell line, DU145, at 3, 6, and 24 h of incubation (Fig.3 A). Immunoblot analysis of p21 waf/cip1 protein confirmed the Northern analysis. Fig.2 D demonstrates markedly enhanced p21 waf/cip1 protein following 3 h of thrombin stimulation of CHRF cells, with maximum effect at 0.5–1 units/ml.Figure 3Thrombin up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 mRNA is independent of p53.

Hannon J.H. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to study whether increased p21 waf/cip1 expression by thrombin is p53-dependent. Prostate cancer cell line, DU145, with a defect in the gene encoding for p53, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from a p53 “knockout” mouse were studied for p21 waf/cip1 up-regulation by thrombin. As shown in Fig. 3,A and B, the p21 waf/cip1 mRNA level was clearly increased in both cell lines treated with thrombin. These results suggested that thrombin-stimulated up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 expression is p53-independent. To study whether induction of p21 waf/cip1 by thrombin required ongoing protein synthesis, we stimulated CHRF cells with thrombin (1 unit/ml) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), a potent protein synthesis inhibitor. Approximately 3-fold up-regulation of p21 was observed in cells treated with thrombin or cycloheximide plus thrombin indicating that ongoing protein synthesis was not required for up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 by thrombin (Fig.4 A). It has been reported that interferon γ induces the expression of p21 waf/cip1 via the STAT pathway (24.Chin Y.E. Kiyagawa M. Su W.S. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In examining the possible role of STAT1 in thrombin induced up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1, we looked at the level of expression of p21 waf/cip1 in thrombin-stimulated fibroblasts derived from a STAT1 knockout mouse. The increased expression of p21 waf/cip1 upon thrombin stimulation was observed in CD+ cells not in STAT1-deficient fibroblasts (CD−) (Fig. 4 B). The same result was also obtained with 2B and U3A fibrosarcoma cells, which contain functional or deficient STAT1, respectively (data not shown). This result suggested that thrombin up-regulation of p21 required the activation of STAT1. The activation of STAT1 in thrombin-induced expression of p21 waf/cip1 was further examined using the mobility shift assay (Fig. 4 C). Nuclear extracts prepared were examined for STAT1 binding activity. Administration of thrombin resulted in a marked increase in STAT1 activity as measured by mobility shift assay. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by thrombin was further investigated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the two proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, STAT1 and JAK2 were tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of CHRF cells with thrombin for 15 min. Thrombin-dependent nuclear translocation of STAT1 was analyzed by immunostaining using anti-STAT1 antibody. As shown in Fig.4 F, thrombin induced the translocation of STAT 1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Positive signals were not observed in control cells (data not shown). Fig.5 demonstrates inhibition of thrombin up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 by hirudin (lanes 1–4) and PAR-1 receptor specificity (lanes 1 and 5). Similar results were noted with the up-regulation of caspase 3 by thrombin (Fig. 6 D). Thrombin receptor analysis by RT-PCR revealed the presence of PAR-1 in all cell lines examined (DU145, CHRF, MDAMB231, and MCF7). The expression of PAR-3 and PAR-4 was only detected in CHRF cells, not the other 3 cell lines tested (data not shown).Figure 6Thrombin up-regulation of the expression of caspases in DU145, CHRF, and CD1+ cells.

Northern blot analysis was performed using specific probes. As shown in Fig. 6 A, thrombin induced caspases 1, 2, and 3 in DU145 cells. The maximum effects were observed at 1 unit/ml thrombin with 5-fold increased expression of caspase 1- and 4-fold increased expression of caspases 2 and 3. A 4-fold up-regulation of caspase 3 by thrombin was also observed in CHRF cells. The increased expression of caspase 3 was not observed in cells derived from STAT 1 knockout mice treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin, but was detected in mouse cells containing wild type STAT1 (Fig.6 B). Up-regulation of caspase 3 was also detected at the protein level in both DU145 and CHRF cells (Fig. 6 C). DU145 cells were treated with or without 1 unit/ml thrombin for 24 h, and cells further analyzed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay. The apoptotic cells were clearly detected in cells treated with thrombin, while no apoptotic cells were observed in control cells (data not shown). The requirement of STAT1 for thrombin-induced p21 waf/cip1 and caspase 3 induction suggested that STAT1(−/−) cells would be more resistant to thrombin-induced impaired cell growth. Cell growth of CD+versus CD− cells were therefore measured by BrdUrd incorporation as in Fig. 1. CD− cells were 1.4–1.5-fold more resistant to thrombin-induced impaired cell growth than CD+ cells at 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 units/ml thrombin (two experiments, data not shown). A novel and important observation of the present study is the observation that thrombin induces growth inhibition of several tumor cell lines under the conditions studied. This finding indicates that thrombin, aside from its well known effects on blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, and cell proliferation, may also directly inhibit the growth of cells. Many growth factors and cytokines have dual effects on cell growth (25.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). For example, epidermal growth factor stimulates the growth of many cell lines, but inhibits growth in some breast cancer cell lines (26.Armstrong D.K. Kaufman S.H. Ottaviano Y.L. Furuya Y. Buckley J.A. Isaacs T.J. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5280-5283PubMed Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 stimulates the proliferation of hepatocytes but inhibits the growth of some myeloma cell lines (27.Minami M. Irone M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thrombin has been shown to be able to induce the proliferation of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts (6.Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, in comparison to platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-stimulated cell growth, thrombin-stimulated vascular smooth muscle proliferation is delayed and requires the de novo expression of one or more autocrine mitogens (23.Molloy C.J. Pawlowski J.E. Taylor D.S. Turner C.E. Weber H. Peluso M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thrombin may also have a dual biphasic effect on tumor cell growth, with low concentration inducing mitogenesis and higher concentration impairing cell growth, as we have observed with 3 other cell lines. 2Zain, J., Huang, Y-Q., Feng, X-S., Nierodzik, M. L., Li, J-J., and Karpatkin, S. (2000) Blood, in press. It is also conceivable that various types of cells respond to thrombin differently, possibly on the basis of their thrombin receptor repertoire, or other intracellular messenger factors. The level of prothrombin in serum ranges from 1 to 5 nm. Therefore, the concentration of thrombin produced locally could be high enough to inhibit the growth of some types of cells via up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 and/or induce cell death via apoptosis. An increase of the amount of p21 waf/cip1 relative to the amount of cyclin-bound CDK may convert active CDK complexes into inactive ones. Whether the genes that control the cell cycle are regulated by thrombin is not well defined. In this study, we have demonstrated that thrombin-induced expression of p21 waf/cip1 is associated with thrombin receptor activation. Thrombin-induced expression of p21 waf/cip1 was inhibited by hirudin, a specific thrombin antagonist. Activation by TRAP 14-mer confirmed that activation of the PAR-1 thrombin receptor could induce increased p21 waf/cip1 expression. It should be noted that although TRAP can activate non-thrombin receptor PAR-2 as well, it has a substantially low affinity for this receptor which cannot be activated by thrombin (28.Blackhart B.D. Emilsson K. Nguyen D. Teng W. Martelli A.J. Nystedt S. Sundelin J. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16466-16471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although thrombin can activate PAR-3 and PAR-4, they were not present on the DU145, MDAMB231, and MCF7 cells studied. In addition, the TRAP 14-mer used in this study can only activate PAR-1, not activate PAR-3 and PAR-4. Thus, the increased expression of p21 waf/cip1 by thrombin is induced by PAR-1 activation. Expression of p21 waf/cip1 is induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which facilitates G1 arrest in response to DNA damage (3.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5222) Google Scholar, 4.Xiong Y. Hannon J.H. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). It has been reported that expression of p21 is rarely p53-independent, i.e. p21 waf/cip1 expression is not preserved in cells of p53 knockout mice (3.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5222) Google Scholar, 4.Xiong Y. Hannon J.H. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar) and MyoD, a skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional regulator as well as antioxidant induces p53-independent activation of p21 waf/cip1 (29.Chinery R. Brockman J.A. Peeler M.O. Shyr Y. Beauchamp R.P. Coffey R.J. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30.Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A. Sands A.T. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible involvement of p53 in thrombin-stimulated p21 waf/cip1 expression was studied using the p53 knockout cell line as well as the tumor cell line deficient in p53. The thrombin-induced up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 expression in the 2 cell lines strongly suggests that the increased expression of p21 waf/cip1 is p53-independent. It has been reported that the expression of p21 waf/cip1 is directly induced by activated STAT1 protein, which specifically recognizes the conserved STAT-responsive elements in the promoter of p21 waf/cip1 (24.Chin Y.E. Kiyagawa M. Su W.S. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that JAK2 and STAT1 are activated by thrombin. Furthermore, p21 waf/cip1 mRNA was induced by thrombin in CD+ cells but not in STAT-1 knockout CD− cells. Thus, STAT-1 is required in these cells for increased expression of p21 waf/cip1 in response to thrombin. STAT proteins are known to be activated by a wide variety of ligands including an increasing number of cytokines whose receptors belong to the large cytokine-receptor superfamily as well as a number of other growth factors, whose receptors exhibit tyrosine kinase dependent activity (31.Leonard W.J. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 968-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Except for angiotensin II, ligands that bind to 7-transmembrane domain receptors have not been reported to activate STATs (32.Dostal D.E. Hunt R.A. Kule C.E. Bhat G.J. Karoor V. McWhinney C.D. Baker K.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2893-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is of interest that phosphorylation of JAK2, which could induce STAT protein activation, has been reported in thrombin-stimulated human platelets (33.Rodriguez-Linares R. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that G-protein-coupled receptor activation by thrombin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 which creates recruitment sites for STAT transcription factor activation, leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation. Thrombin inhibited the growth of several tumor cell lines. To determine whether up-regulation of p21 waf/cip1 alone is sufficient for the inhibition of the growth of several lines of tumor cells, the role of thrombin in the induction of apoptosis was also investigated. Our results, in agreement with our recent observations with murine B16F10 melanoma and human HCT8 colon carcinoma cells,2 and that recently reported for neurons and astrocytes (34.Donovan F.M. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5316-5326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that thrombin also induces apoptosis in other cell lines examined, via the PAR-1 receptor and therefore may be a growth inhibitor for certain types of cells. It is of interest that CD− cells were 1.5-fold more resistant to thrombin-induced impaired cell growth than CD+ cells. The absence of complete resistance with CD− cells suggests that other mechanisms may be involved in thrombin-induced impaired cell growth other than p21 induction or apoptosis; or that the counterbalancing effect of enhanced cell growth induced by thrombin, possibly by the release of platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor may play a role (35.Stouffer G.A. Sarembock I.J. McNamara C.A. Gimple L.W. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C806-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Weiss R.H. Maduri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5724-5727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of caspases by thrombin was demonstrated in DU145, CHRF, and mouse fibroblasts, but not in mouse cells without functional STAT1, indicating that induction of caspases by thrombin requires the STAT1 pathway. It is of interest in this regard that STAT1 is required for efficient constitutive expression of caspases 1, 2, and 3 in human fibrosarcoma cells and STAT1-null cells are resistant to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α (37.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that thrombin, like tumor necrosis factor-α, can induce apoptosis via STAT1-mediated up-regulation of caspases. Our study establishes, for the first time, a link between PAR-1 receptor activation with the STAT signal pathway, which leads to cell cycle control and apoptosis. This observation broadens our understanding of the mechanism of PAR-1 activation and its effect on cell growth, and could possibly lead to therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer. For example, an adenoviral vector containing a constitutively active PAR-1 (38.Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) regulated by a promoter specific for a malignant tissue may be of clinical benefit. Studies designed to explore this interesting hypothesis are currently in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2072267298,"The occurrence of a deoxyribonucleoside kinase inDrosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) with remarkably broad substrate specificity has recently been indicated (Munch-Petersen, B., Piskur, J., and Søndergaard, L. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3926–3931). To prove that the capacity to phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides is in fact associated to one polypeptide chain, partially sequenced cDNA clones, originating from the Berkeley Drosophila genome sequencing project, were searched for homology with human deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The total sequence of one cDNA clone and the corresponding genomic DNA was determined and expressed inEscherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The purified and thrombin cleaved recombinant protein phosphorylated the four deoxyribonucleosides with high turnover andK m values similar to those of the nativeDm-dNK, as well as the four ribonucleosides and many therapeutical nucleoside analogs. Dm-dNK has apparently the same origin as the mammalian kinases, thymidine kinase 2, deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and the herpesviral thymidine kinases, but it has a unique C terminus that seems to be important for catalytic activity and specificity. The C-terminal 20 amino acids were dispensable for phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides but necessary for full activity with purine ribonucleosides. Removal of the C-terminal 20 amino acids increased the specific activity 2-fold, but 99% of the activity was lost after removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids. The occurrence of a deoxyribonucleoside kinase inDrosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) with remarkably broad substrate specificity has recently been indicated (Munch-Petersen, B., Piskur, J., and Søndergaard, L.

The key enzyme of thede novo pathway is ribonucleotide reductase, and the key salvage enzymes are the deoxyribonucleoside kinases, which phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates (1.Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Deoxyribonucleoside kinases from various organisms differ in their substrate specificity, regulation of gene expression, and cellular localization. In mammalian cells, four enzymes with overlapping specificities (thymidine kinases 1 (TK1)1 and 2 (TK2), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK)) phosphorylate purine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides. All four enzymes have been cloned and are encoded by nuclear genes (2.Johansson M. Bajalica-Lagercrantz S. Lagercrantz J. Karlsson A.

TK1 and TK2 are pyrimidine specific and phosphorylate deoxyuridine (dUrd) and thymidine (dThd), and TK2 also phosphorylates deoxycytidine (dCyd) (7.Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). dCK phosphorylates dCyd, deoxyadenosine (dAdo), and deoxyguanosine (dGuo) but not dThd (8.Bohman C. Eriksson S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TK1 is cytosolic, and TK2 and dGK are localized in the mitochondria, although recent reports indicate a cytoplasmic localization of TK2 as well (10.Johansson M. Brismar S. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11941-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,11.Söderlund J.C.F. Arnér E.S.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 370: 201-204Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In procaryotic cells, the pattern of deoxyribonucleoside kinases is not very well clarified. In Escherichia coli, there seems to be only one deoxyribonucleoside kinase, which has been characterized as a TK with similarity to the mammalian TK1 (12.Okazaki R. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 269-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to incorporate dCyd, dAdo, and dGuo seems to be lacking (13.Ives D.H. Ikeda S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). InLactobacillus acidophilus, which is deficient in ribonucleotide reductase, the four deoxyribonucleosides are phosphorylated by three enzymes (13.Ives D.H. Ikeda S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 205-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14.Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition to a TK resembling the E. coli TK, there are two kinase complexes that phosphorylate dCyd, dAdo, and dGuo. Complex I is a dCK/dAK complex, and complex II is a dGK/dAK complex (14.Ikeda S. Ma G.T. Ives D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Several viruses carry a gene for a TK. Herpesviruses have a TK that also can phosphorylate dCyd, as well as TMP and dCMP (15.Chen M.S. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1325-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The herpetic kinases with the relatively broad substrate specificity have many features in common with the mammalian TK2, dCK, and dGK. Poxviruses code for a TK very similar to the mammalian TK1 (16.Kit S. Microbiol. Sci. 1985; 2: 369-375PubMed Google Scholar). So far, however, none of the known viral, bacterial, or eucaryotic deoxyribonucleoside kinases have been shown to phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides. Recently, we have isolated a deoxyribonucleoside kinase fromDrosophila melanogaster and named it D. melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK) (17.Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Søndergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The isolated kinase appeared to possess the ability to phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides. However, the presence of more than one kinase with the same size in our highly purified enzyme preparation could not be ruled out, because TK2, dGK, and dCK all have subunit sizes in the same range as Dm-dNK, 28–30 kDa (7.Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bohman C. Eriksson S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper, we describe a cDNA from D. melanogasterwith homology to the cDNA of mammalian TK2, dCK, and dGK but with a unique C-terminal amino acid sequence that appeared to be important for the catalytic activity. The corresponding overexpressed and purified protein did phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides with the same high turnover as reported for the native enzyme. Thus, we have proved the existence of a multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase inD. melanogaster that differs from all known viral, bacterial and eucaryotic kinases. The fact that all four deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities are contained within a single monomeric protein raises an important question as to the evolution of the deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The availability of recombinantDm-dNK is the basis for studies on the use of this unique enzyme in biotechnology and in medical therapy. Glutathione-Sepharose, pGEX-2T vector, E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, thrombin, and molecular weight standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled nucleosides and nucleotides and CHAPS, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were from Sigma or ICN. Dideoxyadenosine (ddAdo), dideoxycytidine (ddCyd), dideoxyguanosine (ddGuo), and dideoxythymidine (ddThd) were a generous gift from Dr. H.-G. Ihlenfeldt (Roche Diagnostics). [methyl-3H]dThd (925 GBq/mmol) and [6-3H]dCyd (740–925 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [2,8-3H]dAdo (1106 GBq) and [2,8-3H]dGuo (226 GBq/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA). Materials for cloning, PCR, and DNA sequencing were standard commercially available products. Partially sequenced cDNA clones in the GenBankTM data base from an embryonic D. melanogaster library were screened for homology to deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The Bluescript SK ± phagemid clone LD 15983–5′, GenBankTM accession numberAA441228, 2D. Harvey, L. Hong, M. Evans-Holm, J. Pendleton, C. Su, P. Brokstein, S. Lewis, and G. M. Rubin, personal communication. contained a 1.1-kilobase EcoRI-XhoI cDNA insert that showed a high homology to human TK2 and other known kinases. Sequencing by the Sanger dideoxyribonucleotide method was performed manually using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and by an ABI 310 automatic cycle sequencing machine using the BIG-DYE terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). The clone was sequenced on both strands using several primers designed by standard computer programs. Afterward, the sequence was analyzed for open reading frames. The genomic region corresponding to Dm-dNK was cloned and sequenced using genomic DNA isolated from adult flies and PCR primers deduced from the cDNA. The largest open reading frame was overexpressed in E. coli using the GST gene fusion expression system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The insert for subcloning was obtained by PCR amplification. The first primer, Dm-TK3 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCGGAGGCAGCATCCT), was designed to contain aBamHI site overhang, just upstream from the putative translation start site. The second primer, Dm-TK4 (5′-CGGAATTCTTATCTGGCGACCCTCTGGCGT), was designed to contain anEcoRI site overhang, just downstream of the putative translation stop site. C-terminal deletions (minus 10, 20, or 30 amino acids) were made using the primers Dm-TK4B (5′-TATCCGGAATTCTTACACCAGAACCGGCGAGGGCTGTTG), Dm-TK4C (5′-TATCCGGAATTCTTATGAGATGGCGTCGAATATGCTGCT), and Dm-TK4D (5′-TATCCGGAATTCTTAGCGCTGGTACTCGGTGCCAATGTT) in combination with Dm-TK3. The PCR fragments were cut with BamHI andEcoRI and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the pGEX-2T plasmid vector, allowing expression of the protein encoded by the open reading frame fused to the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) gene. A specific thrombin cleavage site was encoded just after the GST gene. The sequences of the expression inserts were verified by sequencing. The E. coli strains BL21 was transformed with the expression plasmid vectors by the CaCl2 method. The expressed recombinant proteins were named rDm-dNK, rDm-dNKΔC10, rDm-dNKΔC20, and rDm-dNKΔC30. After inoculation of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin with a transformed colony, the bacteria were grown toA 600 = 0.6, and then the expression of the GST fusion protein was induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4, 22 °C), 5 mm MgCl2 1 mmdithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 50 mm α-aminocaproic acid), and homogenized using a French press. The homogenate was centrifuged 15 min at 12,000 ×g (4 °C), and the remaining cell debris was removed by passing successively through a 1 μm Whatman glass microfiber filter and a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter. Filtered cell homogenate of induced BL21 transformants was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (15 × 45 mm) preequilibrated with Buffer A. Unbound material was removed by washing with 50 column volumes of Buffer A. Strongly bound contaminating proteins were removed by recirculating twice for 1 h each time at room temperature, each time with two column volumes of Buffer A containing 3 mmATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The column matrix was then equilibrated with 10 column volumes of Buffer B (140 mmNaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3). The expressed protein was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase by recirculation for 2 h at room temperature with 4 column volumes of Buffer B containing 400 units of thrombin. Finally, the remaining glutathioneS-transferase and uncleaved fusion protein were eluted with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5, 22 °C) containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Before storage of enzyme-containing fractions at −80 °C, glycerol, Triton X-100, and dithiothreitol were added to 8%, 1% and 1 mm, respectively. Nucleoside kinase activities were determined by initial velocity measurements based on four time samples by the DE-81 filter paper assay using tritium-labeled substrates (17.Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Søndergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the enzyme activity was followed by the ADP production measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm, caused by NADH oxidation in a coupled enzyme system with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. This coupled spectrometric assay is a modification of the uridine-cytidine kinase assay described by Valentin-Hansen (18.Valentin-Hansen P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The standard assay conditions were as follows: 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.8, 22 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.2 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 3.1 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.15 mm NADH, and 0.15 mm ATP in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was recorded with a temperature-controlled (37 °C) U-1100 Hitachi spectrophotometer. One unit of kinase activity is defined as 1 μmol of deoxyribonucleoside-5′-monophosphate formed per min. NativeDm-dNK was isolated as described recently (17.Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Søndergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the native protein was determined by standard procedures on an automatic amino acid analyzer after acidic proteolysis (19.Barkholt V. Jensen A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Tryptophan was not included due to high instability. Asparagine and glutamine were converted to the corresponding acids. Cysteine was measured as thiopropionic acid. Pairwise sequence alignments were performed using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (20.Pearson W.R. Genomics. 1991; 11: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 21.Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar), and multiple alignments were performed with PILEUP and CLUSTAL W (22.Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Deposited EST sequences belonging to D. melanogaster were searched for homology to human deoxyribonucleoside kinases. A sequence of 596 bp belonging to theD. melanogaster clone (GenBankTM accession number AA441228) had a high homology to the 5′-end of human TK2. The complete sequence of the cDNA insert was determined and analyzed for open reading frames. The nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame of 750 bp were deposited in the GenBankTM data base with the accession numberY18048. The largest open reading frame encodes a protein of 250 amino acids, with a calculated mass of 29,055 Da. This is the same mass as that determined for the native Dm-dNK (about 30 kDa) (17.Munch-Petersen B. Piskur J. Søndergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the corresponding genomic DNA showed that the primary transcript is 1246 bp long, that it has a 130-bp nontranslated 5′ end, and that the translated region is interrupted by two introns, one 75 bp long and another of 56 bp, located 331 and 679 bp downstream of the translation start, respectively. The sequence has the GenBankTM accession number AF185268. The amino acid composition of the native Dm-dNK was determined and found to be very similar to the amino acid sequence predicted from the longest open reading frame (data not shown). As the similarity between the amino acid composition of the cloned and native protein was high, it was very likely that the cloned sequence represented the cDNA forDm-dNK. For further confirmation, the largest open reading frame was expressed, and the recombinant putative kinase was purified and analyzed. The longest open reading frame was overexpressed as a fusion protein with GST of about 56 kDa. TK activity reached maximum after about 5–7 h of induction. The recombinant protein was purified in one step to nearly homogeneity by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography combined with in situ thrombin cleavage. The procedure was followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and measurements of the TK activity. During the initial attempts to purify the cleaved protein, several high molecular mass proteins with subunit sizes about 60–70 kDa copurified consistently with the recombinant kinase. From the size of the bands and the firm association with the expressed protein, the contaminating proteins may be heat shock response proteins expressed by the E. coli host as a defense against abnormal proteins. Several heat shock proteins have been shown to release their target protein in the presence of ATP (23.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, an additional step in the glutathione-Sepharose chromatography procedure within situ incubation with ATP/MgCl2 was added before the thrombin cleavage step. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the contaminating proteins were almost completely removed by two consecutive ATP/MgCl2 incubations (fractions III and IV). The cleavage fraction (V), in which the TK activity was present, contained the expressed and cleaved recombinant protein, seen as a strong band of about 29 kDa. Remaining uncleaved fusion protein (56 kDa) was eluted by reduced glutathione together with glutathioneS-transferase (27 kDa) in fraction VI. The results of the purification of rDm-dNK are summarized in TableI.Table IPurification tables (measured with dThd) for rDm-dNK and the C-terminal truncated mutants with data for the crude bacterial extracts and the cleavage fractions.Total activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationunitsmgunits/mg%FoldrDm-dNK Crude extracts3336010.561001 Pooled fractions613.617.918.332 Peak fraction9.50.2636.52.965rDm-dNKΔC10 Crude extracts2174420.51001 Pooled fractions251.319.311.539 Peak fraction12.70.5323.85.848rDm-dNKΔC20 Crude extracts195213901.41001 Pooled fractions108524.843.855.631 Peak fraction3566.951.618.237rDm-dNKΔC30 Crude extracts43560.011001 Pooled fractions0.120.420.29329 Peak fraction0.090.260.352.235All data are related to 1 liter of culture.

The kinetic relation of the rDm-dNK between the velocity and the substrate concentration was determined for the four deoxyribonucleosides. The results are shown in Fig. 2 as double reciprocal plots of velocity versus substrate. With the four substrates, the pattern is very similar to that observed with the nativeDm-dNK, because classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics andV max values within the same range were observed (Table II). The K mvalues of the recombinant kinase with dThd and dGuo were similar to those of the native kinase. The K m values with dAdo and dCyd were about twice as high as those with the native kinase, but within the same order of magnitude. The K m values with ATP were in the range of 5–10 μm with all four substrates and thus in the same low range as for the nativeDm-dNK.Table IIKinetic parameters of native Dm-dNK and rDm-dNKSubstrateNative Dm-dNK (data from Ref.17.Munch-Petersen B.

Piskur J. Søndergaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3926-3931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The maximal velocities obtained by varying equimolar concentrations of the phosphate donor and MgCl2 were 29.4 units/mg with ATP and 28.1 units/mg with CTP. However, ATP exhibited substrate inhibition at concentrations above 0.1 mm with the native as well as the recombinant kinase, whereas no inhibition was observed with CTP (data not shown). These results proved that in D. melanogaster, a single enzyme has the ability to phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides. From pairwise alignments using the Smith-Waterman algorithm (20.Pearson W.R. Genomics. 1991; 11: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 21.Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar) Dm-dNK was found to have high identity with human TK2 (44%), human dGK (34%), and human dCK (31%). This indicates that Dm-dNK, together with TK2, dCK, and dGK belongs to the so-called “herpetic family” of deoxyribonucleoside kinases (24.Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25.Gentry G.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 319-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of Dm-dNK, human TK2, human dGK, human dCK and HSV1-TK is shown in Fig. 3.Dm-dNK contains five out of the six sites of strong sequence homology previously identified for most herpesviral TKs (24.Balasubramaniam N.K. Veerisetty V. Gentry G.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2979-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25.Gentry G.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 319-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of HSV1-TK in complex with its substrates has been solved (26.Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J. Melitz C. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27.Champness J.N. Bennett M.S. Wien F. Visse R. Summers W.C. Herdewijn P. Declercq E. Ostrowski T. Jarvest R.L. Sanderson M.R.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2097-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As can be seen from the alignment in Fig. 3 nearly all of the specific residues closest to the bound nucleoside in the HSV1-TK structure, i.e. Glu-83, Trp-88, Tyr-101, Gln-125, Arg-163, Tyr-172, and Glu-225 (HSV1-TK numbering), are conserved inDm-dNK. These amino acids were also reported to be conserved in human TK2 (29.Evans J.S. Lock K.P. Levine B.A. Champness J.N. Sanderson M.R. Summers W.C. McLeish P.J. Buchan A. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When the Dm-dNK amino acid sequence was examined by the signal prediction method for cellular transport signals (30.Horton P. Nakai K. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1996; 4: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar), several motifs were found. The 15 N-terminal amino acids may function as a signal for import into mitochondria. However, so far, proteolytic processing of the native Dm-dNK N terminus could not be shown, because the N terminus apparently was blocked (data not shown). Two patches of amino acids within the open reading frame match classical nuclear signaling motifs and may be potential signals for nuclear import (31.Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The first, PTNKKLK, starts at residue 95, and the second, PSKRQRV, starts at residue 242. Additionally, a putative serine phosphorylation site, similar to the one found in human TK1 (32.Chang Z.F. Huang D.Y. Chi L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12095-12100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was found in the C-terminal region at residue 241, SPSK (matching a cdc2 consensus recognition site) and overlapping with the second nuclear import signal. Phosphorylation of such consensus sites has been shown for lamin from Drosophila embryos, also influencing nuclear import (33.Schneider U. Mini T. Jeno P. Fisher P.S. Stuurman N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4620-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 3, the very C-terminal part ofDm-dNK shows no similarity and is extended compared with the mammalian kinases. Therefore, we decided to examine the role of the C terminus of Dm-dNK for substrate specificity and catalysis by engineering three C-terminal truncated mutants of rDm-dNK (deletion of the C-terminal 10, 20, or 30 amino acids). All three deletion mutants were expressed, cleaved, and purified as described for rDm-dNK. The purity of the preparations was compared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown) and judged to be the same as obtained with rDm-dNK. Comparison of the specific activities (Table I) shows that rDm-dNKΔC30 had about 1% of the specific activity of rDm-dNK. The specific activity of rDm-dNKΔC10 was in the same range as the specific activity of rDm-dNK. Surprisingly, the specific activity of rDm-dNKΔC20 was nearly twice as high as the specific activity of rDm-dNK. Furthermore, as calculated from the specific activities of the enzymes in Table I, the expression of rDm-dNKΔC20 per liter of bacterial culture (38 mg) was more than 4-fold higher than that of Dm-dNK (9 mg). TheK m values for thymidine were 1.7, 1.7, and 2.5 μm for rDm-dNKΔC10, rDm-dNKΔC20, and rDm-dNKΔC30, respectively, and thus very similar to the K m value (1.2 μm) for rDm-dNK. Finally, the substrate specificity of rDm-dNK and the two active deletion mutants rDm-dNKΔC10 and rDm-dNKΔC20 was determined (TableIII). To enable measurement of the phosphorylation of unlabeled substrates, a modified version of the nonradioactive spectrophotometric assay of Valentin-Hansen (18.Valentin-Hansen P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used. rDm-dNK showed a clear preference for deoxyribonucleosides, but also, all ribonucleosides were accepted as substrates, as much as 16% with cytidine as compared with thymidine. ddGuo was found not to be a substrate under our assay conditions, whereas all other dideoxyribonucleosides were accepted. Pyrimidine nucleosides were generally preferred over purine nucleosides.Table IIISubstrate specificities of rDm-dNK and its C-terminal truncated variantsSubstrate (500 μm)rDm-dNKrDm-dNKΔ10rDm-dNKΔ20%dThd100100100dCyd134 ± 10140 ± 7144 ± 4dUrd113 ± 2123 ± 9130 ± 4dAdo96 ± 7100 ± 3109 ± 1dGuo53 ± 558 ± 0.356 ± 0.4FdUrd92 ± 1184 ± 391 ± 6Cyd16 ± 217.5 ± 0.1416.1 ± 0.19Urd6.45 ± 0.56.90 ± 0.506.80 ± 0.20Ado0.82 ± 0.260.41 ± 0.26NDGuo1.18 ± 0.220.33 ± 0.26NDddThd4.44 ± 0.443.10 ± 0.243.10 ± 0.34ddCyd11.1 ± 1.09.70 ± 0.528.80 ± 0.48ddAdo0.90 ± 0.250.28 ± 0.22NDddGuoNDNDNDAraC58.2 ± 5.654.4 ± 1.557.7"

Such parasites include Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease or American trypanosomiasis. During its life cycle,T. cruzi has to adapt to environments of different temperature, osmolarity, ionic composition, and pH, and some of these adaptation processes are paralleled by morphological and functional changes. Very litttle is known about the signaling mechanisms involved in these processes. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLCs)1 catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to d-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (1.Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar, 2.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar).

The membrane-resident DAG controls cellular protein phosphorylation states by activating various protein kinase C isozymes (2.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). Three classes of mammalian PI-PLCs with 10 different isozymes have been characterized (β1-β4, γ1-γ2, and δ1-δ4) (3.Irvine R. Nature. 1996; 380: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The activity of β- and γ- isozymes (145–150 kDa) is regulated by G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, respectively. These isozymes are related to the much smaller δ-isozymes (∼85 kDa) (3.Irvine R. Nature. 1996; 380: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It seems very likely that PI-PLC-δ evolved first, because every PI-PLC cloned so far from a non-mammalian species (for example,Dictyostelium, yeast, higher plants, andChlamydomonas) is clearly a δ-isoform (3.Irvine R. Nature. 1996; 380: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is currently not known how δ-isozymes are regulated in vivo (4.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It is possible that they are regulated only by calcium ions (3.Irvine R. Nature. 1996; 380: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) although the idea of PI-PLC-δ being regulated by GTP-binding proteins is one which has increasing support (3.Irvine R.

It has also been postulated that PI-PLC-δ could have a role in differentiation ofDictyostelium discoideum (9.Drayer A.L. van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 297: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The understanding of factors controlling phospholipid metabolism in parasitic protozoa is very poor, although these lipids could be involved in several important events in these eukaryotic cells. The presence and operation of the inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol signaling pathway was demonstrated in epimastigotes of T. cruzi (11.Docampo R. Pignataro O.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). IP3 and DAG formation was stimulated by Ca2+ in digitonin-permeabilized cells, thus suggesting the presence of a PI-PLC (11.Docampo R. Pignataro O.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of different inositol phosphates in amastigotes (12.Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E. Pignataro O.P. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and trypomastigotes (13.Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was reported later. A shift in the levels of phosphoinositide metabolites after incubation of epimastigotes with carbamoylcholine (14.Machado de Domenech E.E. Garcia M. Garrido M.N. Racagni G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 267-270Crossref Google Scholar) and the stimulation of IP3 and DAG production and epimastigote proliferation by fetal calf serum (15.Oliveira M.M. Rocha E.D. Rondinelli E. Arnholdt A.V. Scharfstein J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 124: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were also reported. A PI-PLC activity was also detected in epimastigote lysates using PI as substrate (15.Oliveira M.M. Rocha E.D. Rondinelli E. Arnholdt A.V. Scharfstein J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 124: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to a chicken αD-globin fragment was able to increase inositol monophosphate (IP) and IP3 levels in epimastigotes (16.Garrido M.N. Rocha M.I. Machado de Domenech E.E. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 859-864PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulate transformation of epimastigotes into trypomastigotes (metacyclogenesis) (17.Fraidenraich D. Pena C. Isola E.L. Lammel E.M. Coso O. Anel A.D. Pomgor S. Baralle F. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10140-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A protein kinase C was also characterized inT. cruzi epimastigotes (18.Gomez M.L. Erijman L. Arauzo S. Torres H.N. Tellez-iñón M.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enzyme requires phosphatidylserine and Ca2+ for activity and is stimulated by DAG (18.Gomez M.L. Erijman L. Arauzo S. Torres H.N. Tellez-iñón M.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this work we report the cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene (TcPI-PLC) encoding a PI-PLC from T. cruzi. The gene is expressed at high levels in the epimastigote and amastigote stages, and its expression is induced during the differentiation of trypomastigotes into amastigotes, where its product (TcPI-PLC) is associated with the plasma membrane and increases its activity. In contrast to other PI-PLCs, T. cruzi PI-PLC is lipid modifiedin vivo, and has a highly charged linker region between the catalytic X and Y domains. T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes (Y strain) were obtained from the culture medium of L6E9 myoblasts by a modification of the method of Schmatz and Murray (19.Schmatz D.M. Murray P.K. Parasitology. 1982; 85: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as we have described before (12.Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E. Pignataro O.P. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem.

Med. 1994; 180: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The contamination of trypomastigotes with amastigotes and intermediate forms or of amastigotes with trypomastigotes or intermediate forms was always less than 5% unless otherwise stated. T. cruziepimastigotes (Y strain) were grown at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium (21.Bone G.J. Steinert M. Nature. 1956; 178: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Trypomastigotes were induced to transform into amastigotes axenically as described previously (22.Tomlinson S. VanDekerckhove F. Frevert U. Nussenzweig V. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypomastigotes were washed once with DMEM containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin (DMEM-BSA) at pH 7.5. The cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 107/ml in DMEM-BSA at either pH 5 or 7.5. The DMEM was buffered with 20 mm MES (pH 5.0) or 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Parasites were incubated at 35 °C and harvested at different time points. For overnight incubations, parasites previously incubated at acidic pH for 4 h were centrifuged and resuspended in DMEM-BSA at pH 7.5.

The Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III was from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. BF3-methanol was from Superco, Bellefonte, PA. All other reagents were analytical grade. All basic recombinant DNA techniques followed standard procedures described previously (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. For Southern blotting DNA was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose with TAE (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer and transferred to Zeta Probe GT nylon membrane. DNA was isolated by standard procedures (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's recommendations. The polyadenylated RNA was obtained using a PolyATract mRNA isolation system. RNA was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose gels with 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and transferred to Zeta Probe GT nylon membranes. DNA probes were prepared using random hexanucleotide primers and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System) and [α-32P]dCTP. RNA probes were prepared from linearized double-stranded DNA templates with either T3 or T7 promoter sequences upstream of the probe sequence using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Riboprobein vitro Transcription System) and digoxigenin (DIG System). To amplify the PI-PLC gene of T. cruzi, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 40 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, using 1.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase with 50 ng of T. cruzi genomic DNA, 1 μm of each oligonucleotide primer, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside trisphosphate in a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). The PCR products were separated in an agarose gel, purified, and cloned into the pGEM-T easy or pCR 2.1-TOPO. The sequences of the primers were: 5B, 5′-CA(C/T)AA(C/T)AC(A/T/C)TA(C/T)(C/T)T-3′ and 5R, 5′-GG(C/T)TT(A/C/G/T)A(A/G)(A/C/G/T)AC(A/G)TA(A/C/G/T)CC-3′. To make aT. cruzi subgenomic library, the genomic DNA was completely digested by BamHI and DNA fragments of 2–6 kb were purified from the gel and ligated into λZAP-Express vector. The resulting library was screened by plaque hybridization with the PCR clone as a probe in a manner described previously (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing (24.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar) was performed either manually with Sequenase sequencing kit or automatically with Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and a 373A DNA Automatic Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA) at the Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. DNA and deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed with the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (version 8.0, GCG, Madison, WI). Hydropathy plot analysis was performed by using the Kyte and Doolittle method (25.Kyle J. Doolittle D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17284) Google Scholar). The TcP0 (26.Skeiky Y.A.W. Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) DNA used as a control in the Northern blots was obtained by amplifying T. cruzi genomic DNA by PCR with the specific primers (5′-GTACGAGGAGCGTTTCAATG-3′ and 5′-ATCATCCTCCTCTTCGGGTT-3′) and the product was purified and cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO. cDNA was synthesized by using reverse transcriptase, total RNA, and oligo(dT) as a primer. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to the T. cruzi splice leader sequence (5′-ATAGAACAGTTTCTGTAC-3′) and a TcPI-PLC sequence (5′-CTTGATCACTTTGATGCAGG-3′). PCR conditions were the same as described above except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C. The sequence of TcPI-PLC was deposited in GenBank under the accession number AF093565. To obtain a contiguous TcPI-PLC open reading frame (ORF), two sequences which covered the 5′- and 3′-portions of TcPI-PLCwere combined and cloned into pBluescript KS(−) (pTcPI-PLCorf). AnNheI site was created immediately upstream of the initiation codon to insert the TcPI-PLC ORF into the E. coliexpression vector pET28c. A 162-bp sequence at the 5′-end ofTcPI-PLC ORF was amplified by PCR using primers, one with the NheI site followed by TcPI-PLC 5′-end sequence including the initiation codon (5′-TGCTAGCATGGGTCTTTGTACGAGTAA-3′), and the other with the sequence 143 bp downstream of the initiation codon (5′-TAGGATATCACGCGAAGCTC-3′). The PCR product was inserted into the pTcPI-PLCorf to produce pTcPI-PLC-NheI. The whole ORF and 300 bp of 3′-end untranslated sequence of TcPI-PLC was excised from the pTcPI-PLC-NheI and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pET28c (pET-TcPI-PLC). In order to overexpress TcPI-PLC-encoding protein (TcPI-PLC), E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed by pET-TcPI-PLC. The transformed cells were grown in LB medium and the gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm when the cell density reached anA 600 of 0.6. The cells were harvested after 3 h incubation at 18 °C and used directly for SDS-PAGE analysis, or sonicated (4 × 30 s with 30 s intervals at 4 °C) in 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and centrifuged at 21,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min for separation into pellet and supernatant fractions. The supernatant was used for purification of active TcPI-PLC, and the pellet was used to extract TcPI-PLC for antibody production. For purification of the expressed TcPI-PLC, a nickel resin column (Quick 900 cartridge) and buffer system (His-bind buffer kit) were used. The supernatant fraction was applied to the column. After washing once with 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), TcPI-PLC was eluted with 1m imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9). The purified TcPI-PLC was transferred into dialysis tubes (M r cut off 3,500) and concentrated by incubating the tube in polyethylene glycol (M r15,000–20,000) powder at 4 °C until the volume was one-tenth of the original. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Bio-Rad). PI-PLC activity was measured as the release of water-soluble radioactivity from [2-3H]inositol-labeled PI or PIP2 by a procedure described before (6.Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, stock solutions containing either PI or PIP2 in organic solvent were dried just prior to use under a stream of nitrogen and suspended in reaction buffer by sonication for 10 s in a Branson digital sonifier. Reaction mixtures contained cold PI or PIP2 at various concentrations, 15,000 to 20,000 cpm of [3H]PI (or [3H]PIP2), 1 mg of sodium deoxycholate/ml, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.0), 2.5 mm EGTA, 0 to 10 mm CaCl2, and an appropriate amount of enzyme in a total volume of 100 μl. The final pH in the reaction mixture was pH 7.15 unless otherwise noted. Precise free Ca2+concentrations were achieved by using a CaCl2-EGTA buffer and calculated using the free distributed software MaxChelator using the Bers stability constants (27.Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of chloroform-methanol-HCl (100:100:0.6) followed by 0.15 ml of 5 mm EGTA in 1 n HCl. Samples were subjected to vigorous vortex mixing for 30 s and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 2 min to separate the organic and aqueous phases. The aqueous phase (0.25 ml) was removed, dissolved in 5 ml of a liquid scintillation fluid, and counted in a scintillation counter. Enzyme amount was adjusted in each assay so that a linear time course could be obtained during the 10-min reaction. A polyclonal antibody against TcPI-PLC was generated using the E. coli-expressed recombinant protein. For this purpose, the inclusion bodies in the pellet (insoluble) fraction of TcPI-PLC-expressing E. coli were used because of their large quantity. This fraction was suspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 15 min at room temperature to remove endogenousE. coli proteins. The pellet was then washed once with PBS, solubilized in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.6), 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%). TcPI-PLC was visualized by staining with 2.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in water for 2 h and destaining in water for 2 h. The protein band corresponding to TcPI-PLC was excised from the gel, ground, mixed with water, incubated for 3 h at room temperature with constant mixing and the supernatant collected after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. After repeating this process three times, the supernatants were pooled and concentrated to 500 μg/ml by constant air flow. A rabbit was injected subcutaneously with 50 μg of TcPI-PLC emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by five booster injections of 50 μg of TcPI-PLC in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Sera were collected before the initial injection (preimmune), prior to each booster injection, and 2 weeks after the final booster. The antiserum after the final booster had a titer of more than 1:20,000 as determined by Western blotting. Affinity purification of anti-PI-PLC antibodies was carried out by elution from a column to which the hexahistidine-TcPI-PLC fusion protein had been coupled. The affinity column was prepared by conjugating purified hexahistidine-tagged TcPI-PLC (derived from a 1-liter culture of the transformed E. coli) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (0.5 ml of beads) as described by the manufacturer. The affinity matrix was incubated with 10 ml of anti-TcPI-PLC antiserum (1:2 dilution in PBS) for 16 h at 4 °C, washed 4 times with 20 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, and the antibodies eluted in 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.8), 1 mm EDTA. The antibodies were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris (pH 9.5), supplemented with sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.05% and stored at 4 °C. The electrophoretic system used was essentially as described by Laemmli (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Aliquots of different stages of T. cruzi (at the protein concentration indicated under “Results”) were mixed with an equal amount of non-reducing 2 × SDS buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.6, 20% glycerol (v/v), 6.0% SDS (w/v), and 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to application to SDS-polyacrylamide gels at the concentration indicated under “Results.” Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) by the method of Towbin et al. (30.Towbin H. Stahelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar), using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min at room temperature. Affinity purified anti-TcPI-PLC in TPBS was then applied at room temperature for 60 min. The membrane was washed three times for 15 min each with TPBS. After incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000) and washing three times with TPBS, immunoblots were visualized on blue-sensitive x-ray film (Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) using the ECL chemiluminiscence detection kit and following the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Life Science). After washing three times with PBS, parasites were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Sigma). After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min, the parasites were incubated with 1:150 dilution of the antibody against TcPI-PLC, followed by 1:300 of fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, both at room temperature. The images were obtained with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. The images were recorded with a CCD camera (model CH250; Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) and IPLab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) as described previously (31.Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 4-h incubation of trypomastigotes in the acidic medium (pH 5.0) (DMEM containing 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA and 20 mm MES), metabolic labeling was carried out by adding [9,10-3H]myristate (25 μCi/ml), or [9,10-3H]palmitate (50 μCi/ml) to the medium at pH 7.5 (DMEM containing 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA and 20 mmHepes). The cells were labeled for 16 h at 35 °C and harvested for immunoprecipitation. Epimastigotes were metabolically labeled by incubating the cells in MEM with the same radiochemicals as above with 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 16 h at 28 °C. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation analysis (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III), 100 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and 2 mm EDTA. The lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with protein A/protein G-conjugated agarose beads (Protein A/G PLUS-agarose) to adsorb nonspecifically bound proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and mixed with anti-TcPI-PLC antiserum at a final dilution of 1:100. After overnight incubation, the protein-antibody complex was selectively adsorbed by incubation with Protein A/G Plus-agarose for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min and washed four times with RIPA buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The collected beads were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS electrophoresis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 6.0% SDS (w/v), and 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated at 96 °C for 2 min. For [3H]myristate or [3H]palmitate-labeled protein, sample buffer without Tris was used to avoid deacylation of the protein at high temperature (32.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and fluorography was performed by treating the gel with EN3HANCE according to the manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed to blue-sensitive x-ray film (Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) at −80 °C. For deacylation of TcPI-PLC in the gel, the gel was washed twice for 30 min with 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.5), or 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (control) and rinsed three times for 5 min with water prior to the fluorography. The cellular content of IP3 was determined with a competitive binding protein assay. This assay was performed on acid-transformed (pH 5.0) and control (pH 7.5) trypomastigotes at different incubation times. Aliquots of the parasite suspensions were removed, centrifuged (2,000 × g for 10 min), and washed once in DMEM-BSA (pH 7.5). The cells were resuspended at a concentration of 8.3 × 108 cells/ml in the same buffer. An aliquot was removed for protein determination followed immediately by addition of ice-cold 20% perchloric acid to a final concentration of 4% HClO4. The lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 2000 ×g, for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.5 by the addition of 10 m KOH and the suspension was centrifuged again at 2000 × g for 10 min. IP3 was quantified in the supernatant by measuring the ability of the parasite extract to displace [3H]IP3 from its binding protein as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Deacylati"
https://openalex.org/W2049737988,"The two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, are acetylated by aspirin at Ser-530 and Ser-516, respectively, in the cyclooxygenase active site. Acetylated COX-2 is essentially a lipoxygenase, making 15-(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and 11-(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE), whereas acetylated COX-1 is unable to oxidize arachidonic acid to any products. Because the COX isoforms are structurally similar and share approximately 60% amino acid identity, we postulated that differences within the cyclooxygenase active sites must account for the inability of acetylated COX-1 to make 11- and 15-HETE. Residues Val-434, Arg-513, and Val-523 were predicted by comparison of the COX-1 and -2 crystal structures to account for spatial and flexibility differences observed between the COX isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis of Val-434, Arg-513, and Val-523 in mouse COX-2 to their COX-1 equivalents resulted in abrogation of 11- and 15-HETE production after aspirin treatment, confirming the hypothesis that these residues are the major isoform selectivity determinants regulating HETE production. The ability of aspirin-treated R513H mCOX-2 to make 15-HETE, although in reduced amounts, indicates that this residue is not an alternate binding site for the carboxylate of arachidonate and that it is not the only specificity determinant regulating HETE production. Further experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether the steric bulk imparted by the acetyl moiety on Ser-530 prevented the ω-end of arachidonic acid from binding within the top channel cavity in mCOX-2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change Val-228, which resides at the junction of the main cyclooxygenase channel and the top channel, and Gly-533, which is in the top channel. Both V228F and G533A produced wild type-like product profiles, but, upon acetylation, neither was able to make HETE products. This suggests that arachidonic acid orientates in a L-shaped binding configuration in the production of both prostaglandin and HETE products. The two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, are acetylated by aspirin at Ser-530 and Ser-516, respectively, in the cyclooxygenase active site. Acetylated COX-2 is essentially a lipoxygenase, making 15-(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and 11-(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE), whereas acetylated COX-1 is unable to oxidize arachidonic acid to any products. Because the COX isoforms are structurally similar and share approximately 60% amino acid identity, we postulated that differences within the cyclooxygenase active sites must account for the inability of acetylated COX-1 to make 11- and 15-HETE. Residues Val-434, Arg-513, and Val-523 were predicted by comparison of the COX-1 and -2 crystal structures to account for spatial and flexibility differences observed between the COX isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis of Val-434, Arg-513, and Val-523 in mouse COX-2 to their COX-1 equivalents resulted in abrogation of 11- and 15-HETE production after aspirin treatment, confirming the hypothesis that these residues are the major isoform selectivity determinants regulating HETE production. The ability of aspirin-treated R513H mCOX-2 to make 15-HETE, although in reduced amounts, indicates that this residue is not an alternate binding site for the carboxylate of arachidonate and that it is not the only specificity determinant regulating HETE production. Further experiments were undertaken to ascertain whether the steric bulk imparted by the acetyl moiety on Ser-530 prevented the ω-end of arachidonic acid from binding within the top channel cavity in mCOX-2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change Val-228, which resides at the junction of the main cyclooxygenase channel and the top channel, and Gly-533, which is in the top channel. Both V228F and G533A produced wild type-like product profiles, but, upon acetylation, neither was able to make HETE products. This suggests that arachidonic acid orientates in a L-shaped binding configuration in the production of both prostaglandin and HETE products. cyclooxygenase prostaglandin high performance liquid chromatography mouse-cyclooxygenase-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 5-hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid 11-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid 12-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid 15-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid 11-(R)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid 15-(R)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase is a bifunctional heme-containing protein with both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. Because the cyclooxygenase activity catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandin endoperoxides, the protein is frequently referred to by the name of this activity (COX).1 COX catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the latter being the essential precursor of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. PGG2 is synthesized by incorporation of two molecules of molecular oxygen into arachidonic acid at the cyclooxygenase site. After exiting the cyclooxygenase active site, PGG2 undergoes a two-electron reduction at the peroxidase active site to form PGH2 (1.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2.Marnett L.J. Maddipati K, R. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 293-334Google Scholar). Although COX-1 and COX-2 both make PGH2, the physiological basis of their regulation is different. COX-1 is generally considered to be constitutively expressed in many tissues and is important in maintenance of homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 expression is up-regulated at specific sites in response to stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and mediators of inflammation (3.Herschman H.R. Xie W.L. Reddy S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4.Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

A number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been utilized clinically to control prostaglandin synthesis. Many of these NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins by binding tightly within the COX active site, thereby preventing the conversion of arachidonate to PGG2. Aspirin and the more COX-2-specific aspirin-like molecule, (2-acetoxyphenyl)hept-2-ynyl sulfide, differ from all other NSAIDs in that they inhibit COX activity by covalently modifying (acetylating) an active site Ser-530 2The numbering system used is in accord with that of COX-1. 2The numbering system used is in accord with that of COX-1. side chain (6.Roth G.J.

Science. 1998; 280: 1268-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The involvement of Ser-530 in the acetylation reaction has been confirmed through site-directed mutagenesis (8.Shimokawa T.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though acetylation of COX-1 and COX-2 occurs on the same residue in the cyclooxygenase active site, the modified enzymes differ in their product profiles. In the absence of acetylation, both COX-1 and COX-2 make predominantly PGG2 and small amounts of lipoxygenase-type products (hydroperoxy fatty acids), which have been reported to occur in the R and S stereochemistry (10.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After aspirin acetylation, COX-1 is virtually devoid of any oxygenase activity, whereas acetylation of COX-2 abrogates PGG2 synthesis but forces the infrequently occurring lipoxygenase reaction. 15-(R)-HETE and to a lesser extent 11-(R)-HETE are the predominant products. Until recently, it was uncertain whether these aspirin-induced products were physiologically relevant, but the discovery that 15-(R)-HETE can be converted to the lipoxins 15 epi-LXA4 and 15 epi-LXB4 suggests that the beneficial actions of aspirin may be partly mediated by the generation of these products (13.Serhan C.N. Takano T. Maddox J.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 447: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the difference between the COX isoforms to make lipoxygenase products is unknown, but the elucidation of the COX-1 and COX-2 crystal structures complexed with inhibitors is helpful in formulating hypotheses (14.Picot D.

Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). The major difference between the COX-1 and COX-2 active sites is that the COX-1 active site is smaller than that of COX-2 (17.Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18.Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). This is primarily due to valine to isoleucine substitutions at residues 434 and 523. The smaller Val-434 side chain in COX-2 enables the opening of a solvent accessible space, referred to as the side pocket, that increases the total volume of the cyclooxygenase active site. The other residue that differs between COX-1 and -2 in this side pocket region is at position 513, a histidine in COX-1 and an arginine in COX-2. Because this side chain points from the side pocket toward the center of the COX active site, it seems plausible that it could be an alternate binding site for the carboxylate of arachidonate. Thus, in the present study we addressed the hypothesis that the inability of acetylated COX-1 to make large amounts of 15-HETE is due to differences in the side pocket region compared with that of COX-2. We performed site-directed mutagenesis on mouse COX-2, mutating Val-434, Arg-513, and Val-523 to their COX-1 consensus residues. Our results suggest that Arg-513 is not an alternate binding determinant for the carboxylate of arachidonate and that the smaller solvent-accessible space within the COX-1 active site is the major determinant preventing the synthesis of HETE products following acetylation by aspirin. The second aspect of HETE formation we addressed is the position of the ω-end of arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase active site. Our recent modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies (19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggest that arachidonate binds within the COX active site with its ω-end extending above Ser-530, into a solvent-filled top channel (Fig.1 B). It is clear that acetylation of Ser-530 (Fig. 1 A) will force arachidonate into an alternate binding conformation, but, it is uncertain whether arachidonic acid will retain its L-shaped conformation or bind in a more hairpin or U-shaped orientation. Through site-directed mutagenesis of Val-228 at the junction of the main cyclooxygenase channel and top channel and of Gly-533, which is in the top channel, we provide evidence that in acetylated mouse COX-2 arachidonic acid binds in an L-shaped orientation in a manner similar to that proposed for the synthesis of PGG2. Arachidonic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid) and [14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from Nu-Check-Prep (Elysian, MN) and NEN Life Science Products, respectively. Standards of 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Electrophoresis and chromatography reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a mCOX-2 pBS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The V228F-containing region was subcloned into the mCOX-2 pVL1393 baculovirus expression vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) using the BlpI andEcoRI restriction sites, the V434I-containing region with the EcoRI and StuI sites, and the R513H and V523I mutants by use of the StuI restriction site in mCOX-2 and the XbaI restriction site present in both the pBS+ and pVL1393 vectors. The subcloned regions were fully sequenced to ensure no accidental mutations were incorporated. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in SF-9 cells and purified as described (19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of all purified proteins was measured using the guaiacol peroxidase assay as described (19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase product assays were performed with both purified protein and SF-9 membrane extracts. For assays utilizing SF-9 membranes, appropriate amounts of membranes that gave approximately 30% substrate conversion were reconstituted in 190 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 μmphenol, and 10 μm hematin prior to incubation with 500 μm aspirin in Me2SO or Me2SO alone for 1 h at 37 °C. Cyclooxygenase product formation was initiated by the addition of 100 μm[14C]arachidonic acid for the indicated time at 37 °C. For assays using purified protein, the same buffer, aspirin, and [14C]arachidonic acid stocks were utilized, but only two equivalents of hematin were utilized for reconstitution. All assays were terminated and analyzed by thin layer chromatography in the manner described previously (7.Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Garner C. Seibert K. Marnett L.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1268-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

Purified wild type mCOX-2 and mutant mCOX-2 samples were treated with 500 μm aspirin for 1 h at 37 °C followed by addition of 100 μm[14C]arachidonic acid for either 10 min or 1 h at 25 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 400 μl of stop solution (80.6 ml of ether, 11.4 ml of methanol, 2.8 ml of 1m citric acid). The organic phase was removed and dried under nitrogen. Samples were then purged with argon and stored at −20 °C. To identify lipoxygenase products from the aspirin-treated COX enzymes, authentic standards of 5-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETE standards were added, and the conjugated double bonds were detected at 235 nm using a Varian 2050 detector. Each HETE standard was prepared in the same manner as the test samples by extracting with stop solution, drying under nitrogen, and storing under argon in the manner described above. The HPLC conditions used were modified from Capdevilaet al. (27.Capdevila J.H. Morrow J.D. Belosludtev Y.Y. Beauchamp D.R. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3325-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and utilized a 5-μm Beckman Ultrasphere ODS C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) run under reverse phase conditions at 1 ml/min with a mixture of the following buffers: Buffer A, 0.1% v/v glacial acetic acid in water; Buffer B, 0.1% v/v glacial acetic acid in acetonitrile. Initial conditions used were 70% A/30% B for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 40% A/60% B over 30 min. After a 10-min isocratic period, the gradient was changed to 25% A/75% B in a linear manner over 15 min. This was followed by a 10-min isocratic period before changing the gradient to 0% A/100% B linearly over 10 min followed by a 5-min isocratic period. Products were quantitated with an on-line liquid scintillation counter (In/us Systems Inc β-Ram, 2B). Chiral analysis of the 15-HETE produced by the R513H mutant was compared with that from wild type mCOX-2. Fractions of approximately 1 ml containing 15-HETE were collected from the reverse phase conditions described above. Following removal of the acetonitrile by purging with nitrogen, the HETE products were extracted with an equal volume of CH2Cl2, and the 15-HETE methyl ester derivative was obtained by reaction with CH2N2. After drying the reaction under N2, the 15-HETE methyl ester was separated by straight phase HPLC using a 5 μm Alltech Econosil Silica column (0.46 × 25 cm) and a 100:1 hexane/isopropanol solvent at 1 ml/min. The methylated 15-HETE was then loaded onto a CHIRALPAK AD (0.46 × 25 cm) HPLC column and run at 1 ml/min in 100:2 hexane/ethanol. The product profile was monitored on a LDC/Milton Ray variable wavelength detector at 235 nm. Wild type and mutant COX-2 proteins were expressed in insect cells from baculovirus vectors and then purified by ion exchange and gel filtration. All of the purified proteins were shown by densitometric scanning of a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to be at least 80% pure (Table I). The purified V228F, G533A, G533V, and G533L mutants and the triple V434I/R513H/V523I mutant exhibited at least 87% of the wild type peroxidase activity, suggesting that no major conformational change had occurred as a result of the site-directed mutation (Table I). Both the total oxygen consumption and initial rate of oxygen uptake by the V434I/R513H/V523I mutant were similar to those of wild type enzyme, whereas the V228F mutant consumed only 68% of the oxygen consumed by wild type enzyme and displayed a 5-fold reduced initial rate. Of the Gly-533 mutants, only the G533A enzyme was able to metabolize arachidonic acid, but the initial rate was only 8% of that observed with wild type COX-2, and the total products were 26% of wild type (Table I).Table ICharacterization of mutant cyclooxygenasesConstructPurityPeroxidase activityCyclooxygenase activityInitial rateTotal products%% of wild type mCOX-2% of wild type mCOX-2% of wt mCOX-2Wild type mCOX-284100100 ± 4100 ± 8V228F8087 ± 0.120 ± 169 ± 3V434I/R513H/V523I92118 ± 5104 ± 489 ± 3G533A8099 ± 58 ± 0.526 ± 0G533V8097 ± 400G533L80107 ± 300The purity of wild type and mutant COX-2 proteins was determined from Coomassie-stained 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

The effect of aspirin acetylation on the conversion of arachidonic acid to products was assessed by reacting 500 μm aspirin with COX-2 protein for 1 h followed by incubation with [14C]arachidonic acid and HPLC analysis of products. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C to correspond to previous reports (20.O'Neill G.P. Mancini J.A. Kargman S. Yergy J. Mei Yee Kwan Falgueyret J.-P. Abramovitz M. Kennedy B.P. Ouelett M. Cromlish W.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As expected, the products formed by acetylated COX-2 were significantly different than those formed by control enzyme (Fig.2, B and C). Most of the products generated by wild type enzyme coeluted with prostaglandin standards, although a small percentage of products were detected that coeluted with 11- and 15-HETE standards. In contrast, acetylated mCOX-2 produced mainly HETEs, the major product being 15-HETE with a small amount of 11-HETE. Small amounts of prostaglandins were detected that reflect the presence of residual uninhibited enzyme. The product profile observed with the V434I/R513H/V523I mutant was similar to that observed with wild type mCOX-2. However, following acetylation, very little metabolism took place and only a small amount of 15-HETE was observed. Because the V434I/R513H/V523I triple mutation was so detrimental to HETE synthesis, we performed assays on the single mutant proteins to establish what effect each had on HETE production. Each of the individual mutant proteins made predominantly 15-HETE following acetylation, but the amounts were approximately one-third those seen with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3).Figure 3Ratio of HETE products to prostaglandin products produced by control and aspirin-treated COX-2 and COX-2 mutants. Prostaglandins, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE were produced by treating wild type or mutant COX-2 expressing SF-9 membranes with either vehicle alone or 500 μm aspirin for 1 h at 25 °C followed by treatment with 100 μm[14C]arachidonic acid in the manner described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amounts of HETE products from the aspirin-treated samples are expressed as percentages of the total products synthesized in the vehicle alone samples.

We deemed this experiment necessary because it has recently been shown that the K m for arachidonate oxygenation is more dependent on Arg-120 in COX-1 than in COX-2 (22.Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although we found that the amount of 15-HETE made by the R513H mutant was less than that produced by wild type mCOX-2, no difference in the chirality of the products was observed because both enzymes made only 15-(R)-HETE (Fig.4). We have recently shown through modeling and mutagenesis studies that arachidonic acid binds in an L-shaped orientation, with the ω-end extending above Ser-530 into a region we term the top channel (Fig.1 B) (19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is clear that acetylation of Ser-530 will impart steric constraints upon arachidonic acid binding, because the substrate would no longer be able to lie directly above the Ser-530 side chain (Fig. 1). However, it is unclear whether arachidonic acid could still enter the top channel cavity of the acetylated enzyme. To test this possibility, we designed the V228F mutant to fill the solvent accessible space at the junction of the main cyclooxygenase channel and top channel, the region where we predicted arachidonic acid would bind after displacement by the acetyl moiety on aspirin acetylated Ser-530. This mutant had 90% of the wild type peroxidase activity (Table I) and also had a wild type mCOX-2-like product profile (Fig.5 A), indicating that the V228F mutation had little effect on the structure of the enzyme and the binding of the substrate in the unacetylated active site. Aspirin treatment, however, abolished the lipoxygenase activity of this mutant (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the space filled by the larger phenyl side chain is important in production of 11- and 15-HETE. To further test the hypothesis that the ω-end of arachidonic acid binds in the top channel in the acetylated enzyme, three Gly-533 mCOX-2 mutants (G533A, G533V, and G533L) were tested for their ability to make 15-HETE. Only G533A was able to make normal prostaglandin products (Fig. 5 C), but the specific activity of this protein was much lower than that of wild type mCOX-2. Upon acetylation, G533A was unable to make any products (Fig. 5 D). Similarly, both acetylated and nonacetylated G533V and G533L were unable to metabolize arachidonic acid (results not shown).

Science. 1998; 280: 1268-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), differ from all other NSAIDs in that they covalently modify the same serine residue (Ser-530) in both COX-1 (6.Roth G.J.

This increases the probability of reaction of the acetyl group with the hydroxyl group of Ser-530. The current model for arachidonate/COX binding predicts an L-shaped configuration for the substrate (19.Rowlinson S.W Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

The carboxylate moiety is anchored to Arg-120 and Tyr-355, and the fatty acid backbone extends upwards toward the top of the COX active site, with the 13-pro-S hydrogen of the substrate positioned close to Tyr-385 (32.Goodwin D.C.

The ω-end of arachidonate extends into the region we have termed the top channel, with carbons 17–20 lying above Ser-530. Acetylation of Ser-530 should restrict access of arachidonate to the top channel and prevent its oxygenation by cyclooxygenase. In fact, aspirin completely blocks arachidonate oxygenation by sheep COX-1, and the crystal structure of sheep COX-1 inactivated by bromoacetylsalicylic acid reveals steric congestion in this region (15.Loll P.J. Picot D. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Although aspirin blocks arachidonate oxygenation to PGG2 by mouse and human COX-2, the acetylated enzyme is able to convert arachidonate to 15-(R)-HETE (11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We attempted to determine the protein residues responsible for this catalytic difference and whether the ω-end of arachidonate binds in a different region of acetylated COX-2 to enable oxygenation at carbon-15. Mutation of residues in the side pocket adjacent to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 of COX-2 to the corresponding residues in COX-1 eliminates the ability of acetylated enzyme to generate 15-HETE. The triple mutant V434I/R513H/V523I completely eliminates 15-HETE synthesis, whereas each of the single mutants causes partial loss of activity. The V434I mutant had the least effect on 15-HETE production (Fig. 3), whereas a more significant change was observed with the valine substitution at position 523. The effect this mutant has on arachidonate oxygenation is consistent with the effect of this side chain on the binding of COX-2-selective inhibitors (29.Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9280-9286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A similar decrease in the amount of HETE products is observed with the R513H enzyme, but we cannot be certain whether this is due to steric or electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic effects are favored because overlay of the COX-1 and COX-2 structures shows that the Arg-513 side chain extends further into the COX active site than the histidine side chain, appearing to actually decrease the solvent accessible space. Because the Arg-513 has been implicated in a network of electrostatic interactions that are important in regulating the opening and orientation of the mouth of the COX active site (17.Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), we propose that this side chain may help stabilize the conformation of the active site so that arachidonic acid can bind in an orientation that is favorable for HETE synthesis. The hypothesis that the Arg-513 may be an alternate carboxylate binding site for arachidonate appears untenable because the R513H mutant is still able to make HETE products (Fig. 3), and the 15-HETE produced has the R-stereochemistry, as is seen with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4). The results of our study further establish that the ω-end of arachidonate binds in the top channel of acetylated COX-2. HPLC analysis of the unacetylated V228F mutant shows a wild type product profile (Fig. 5 A), whereas the aspirin-treated V228F enzyme produced no HETE products (Fig. 5 B). Further support for the hypothesis that 15-HETE production involves binding of arachidonic acid within the top channel is provided by results obtained with Gly-533 mutants. If arachidonic acid binds in a U-shaped or hairpin conformation with its ω-end projecting back down toward Arg-120 and Tyr-355, then adding bulk to the 533 position should not influence 11- or 15-HETE formation. This is clearly not the case because neither G533V nor G533L was able to oxygenate arachidonate in the presence or absence of aspirin. G533A is able to make prostaglandin products and small amount of HETE products (Fig. 5 C) but is unable to make products when acetylated (Fig. 5 D). The present results suggest that arachidonate binds to acetylated COX-2 in the same regions of the protein as it binds to in unacetylated enzyme. However, to access the top channel of acetylated COX-2, arachidonate must alter its conformation, which is accommodated by the increased volume near the carboxylate-binding region of COX-2. It is possible that arachidonate also binds to acetylated COX-1 but that the conformational changes it must make to do so moves carbon-13 too far from Tyr-385 to be oxidized. Thus, acetylation of Ser-530 not only forces the ω-end of arachidonate to bind in an alternate conformation but also imparts longer range compensatory movement on the arachidonate molecule from carbon-13 to its carboxylate. This movement requires the solvent-accessible space in the side pocket region of COX-2. Because this space is not accessible in COX-1, no 15-(R)-HETE production can occur."

O-Glycosylation of a highly polarized intestinal brush-border protein sucrase isomaltase is implicated in its apical sorting through interaction with sphingolipid-cholesterol microdomains. We characterized the structural determinants required for this mechanism by focusing on two major domains in pro-SI, the membrane anchor and the Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain. Deletion mutants lacking either domain, pro-SIΔST (stalk-free) and pro-SIΔMA (membrane anchor-free), were constructed and expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In the absence of the membrane anchoring domain, pro-SIΔMA does not associate with lipid rafts and the mutant is randomly delivered to both membranes. Therefore, the O-glycosylated stalk region is not sufficient per se for the high fidelity of apical sorting of pro-SI. Pro-SIΔST does not associate either with lipid rafts and its targeting behavior is similar to that of pro-SIΔMA. Only wild type pro-SI containing both determinants, the stalk region and membrane anchor, associates with lipid microdomains and is targeted correctly to the apical membrane. However, not all sequences in the stalk region are required for apical sorting. Only O-glycosylation of a stretch of 12 amino acids (Ala37-Pro48) juxtapose the membrane anchor is required in conjunction with the membrane anchoring domain for correct targeting of pro-SI to the apical membrane. OtherO-glycosylated domains within the stalk (Ala49-Pro57) are not sufficient for apical sorting.

Both kinds of biomolecules are sorted in the trans-Golgi network complex into different types of vesicles for apical or basolateral delivery (5.Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J.

Whereas all basolateral sorting signals of membrane proteins described to date reside in the cytoplasmic domains (7.Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One criterion for apical delivery could be the presence of asparagine-linked carbohydrates, since their removal by tunicamycin treatment or site-directed mutagenesis results in nonpolar secretion (12.Urban J. Parczyk K. Leutz A. Kayne M. Kondor-Koch C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2735-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13.Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Ueda M. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumoto S. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, insertion of novel N-glycosylation sites into the normally randomly secreted rat growth hormone leads to apical secretion (14.Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Further evidence has accumulated that some apical membrane proteins accumulate in sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich microdomains (15.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8111) Google Scholar), which have been termed sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts. Glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins as well as transmembrane proteins, like the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (16.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) or intestinal brush-border proteins like sucrase isomaltase and dipeptidyl peptidase (17.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) are associated with lipid rafts. Rafts can be discriminated from other membraneous components based on their insolubility in nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 or CHAPS1 at low temperature. By virtue of its structural features and sorting behavior sucrase isomaltase (SI, EC 3.2.1.48; 10) constitutes an exquisite model protein to identify apical sorting signals and to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying apical targeting. SI is an intestinal transmembrane protein that is apically targeted in a highly polarized manner in association with lipid rafts (17.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a heavily N- andO-glycosylated protein that is composed of two homologous subunits, sucrase and isomaltase. Inhibition or drastic reduction ofO-glycosylation in Caco-2 cells by using benzyl-N-acetylgalactosaminide substantially affects the high sorting fidelity of pro-SI ending with a random delivery of the protein to both membranes (19.Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Importantly, O-linked glycans mediate apical sorting through association with lipid rafts. Pro-SI contains a stretch of a Ser/Thr-rich domain in immediate proximity of the membrane (20.Hunziker W. Spiess M. Semenza G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Similar domains, referred to as stalk regions, have been also described for glycophorin (21.Jokinen M. Andersson L.C. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11314-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the neurotrophin receptor (22.Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) or the low density lipoprotein receptor (23.Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and are thought to be the site of heavy O-glycosylation. In pro-SI this stretch serves as a link between the globular protein and the plasma membrane by forming a rigid unfolded structure. Based on its membrane proximity this domain constitutes a sterically suitable site for interaction with other cellular factors. For the neurotrophin receptor it has been shown that the O-glycosylated stalk domain is required for apical targeting (22.Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition this requirement could only be demonstrated for membrane-anchored receptors, whereas the soluble form expressed in Caco-2 cells was secreted into the basolateral medium in the presence of the stalk domain (24.Monlauzeur L. Breuza L. Le Bivic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30263-30270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that O-glycosylated apically-sorted proteins interact via O-linked carbohydrates with a lectin-like cellular protein. In this paper we describe the characterization of the structures implicated in the interaction of pro-SI with lipid microdomains along the polarized transport of pro-SI. We demonstrate that deletion of the stalk region of pro-SI leads to default targeting of the normally apically transported pro-SI to both membrane domains and to a disruption of the association of pro-SI with lipid rafts. The same sorting behavior was also observed with the soluble form of pro-SI, indicating that the presence of the membrane-proximalO-glycosylated stalk determines apical targeting and raft association. Furthermore, membrane association of pro-SI is a necessary requirement for the stalk domain to fulfill this role in pro-SI transport. Transwell filters (24 mm) were obtained from Falcon.l-[35S]RedivueTMPRO-MIXTM and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Streptomycin, penicillin, geneticin-418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (denoted Met-free medium), and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

For immunoprecipitation of pro-SI a mixture of four different monoclonal antibodies was used (HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 3/705, and HBB 2/219). Deletion of the stalk domain of pro-SI (pro-SIΔST, ST stands for stalk region) and subdomains of the stalk domain was performed by oligonucleotide-directed looping out mutagenesis with the Quick ChangeTM in Vitro Mutagenesis System from Stratagene. The template constituted a full-length cDNA encoding pro-SI cloned into pSG8-vector (26.Moolenaar C.E. Ouwendijk J. Wittpoth M. Wisselaar H.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 557-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used in this context: Δstalkupstream: 5′-GCCTTAATTGTTGTTTTAGCAGGAAAATGTCCAAATGTGT-3′; Δstalkdownstream: 5′-ACACATTTGGACATTTTCCTGCTAAAACAACAATTAAGGC-3′; Δstalk37–48upstream: GTTTTAGCAACTAAGACACCTGCTACTACTCGTGTGACTACA; Δstalk37–48downstream: TGTAGTCACACGAGTAGTAGCAGGTGTCTTAGTTGCTAAAAC; Δstalk49–57upstream: AGTGATTCTACTTCAACTCCATCTGATTCAGGAAAATGTCCA; Δstalk49–57downstream: TGGACATTTTCCTGAATCAGATGGAGTTGAAGTAGAATCACT; Δstalk37–57upstream: GTTTTAGCAACTAAGACACCTTCTGATTCAGGAAAATGTCCA; Δstalk37–57downstream: TGGACATTTTCCTGAATCAGAAGGTGTCTTAGTTGCTAAAAC. Deletion of the sequences was confirmed by sequencing and the plasmids obtained were denoted pSG8-SIΔST, pSG8-SIΔST37–48, pSG8-SIΔST49–57, and pSG8-SIΔST37–57. For the generation of an anchorless, soluble form of pro-SI the signal sequence of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) (27.Mantei N. Villa M. Enzler T. Wacker H. Boll W. James P. Hunziker W. Semenza G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was fused with the N terminus of the stalk domain by “polymerase chain reaction sowing.” In this procedure four different oligonucleotides were used:EcoRI-LPH: 5′-GAATTCGTTCCTAGAAAATGGAGCTGTCTTGGCATGTAG-3′; cLPH-signal: 5′-TGACCCCCAGCATGAAAAACT-3′; SI-st (st stands for stalk-region): 5′-ATCAGTGATTCTACTTC -3′; cLPH-ma (ma stands for membrane anchor): 5′- AGAAAAGAGAACGTACAAAGCTTGAACACTAAAGTTTCTTCC-3′. In the first two polymerase chain reaction reactions the LPH signal sequence and the isomaltase domain were amplified with the primer pairsEcoRI-LPH/cLPH-signal and SI-st/cLPH-ma. The resulting fragments were annealed by polymerase chain reaction sowing, and finally an 853-base pair EcoRI/XhoI-fragment of this construct was used to replace the N terminus of pro-SI encoded on pSG8-SI (26.Moolenaar C.E. Ouwendijk J. Wittpoth M. Wisselaar H.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 557-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting sequence was confirmed by sequencing and the plasmid obtained was denoted pSG8-SIΔMA. MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate recombinant DNA using Polybrene (28.Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected MDCK cells were selected in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml active G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and after 18–23 days, surviving colonies were isolated with cloning rings. Stable transformants expressing pro-SIWT,pro-SIΔST, and pro-SIΔMA were screened by immunoprecipitation. For transient transfection experiments MDCK cells were transfected with pSG8-SIΔST37–48, pSG8-SIΔST49–57, and pSG8-SIΔST37–57using the calcium phosphate procedure as described before (29.Jacob R.

Metabolic labeling of MDCK cells grown on filters or plated in six-well culture dishes was performed as described previously (28.Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For higher transfection efficiency on filters transiently transfected MDCK cells were treated with trypsin prior to transfection to dissociate the cells and achieve an optimal exposure of cells to DNA. Transiently transfected cells and MDCK clones expressing pro-SIWT, pro-SIΔST, and pro-SIΔMA were labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and chased for different times with unlabeled methionine. The medium of MDCK cells expressing the anchorless mutant pro-SIΔMA was collected, set to pH 8.0 by Hepes (30 mm), and protease inhibitors were added. The medium and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the mAb anti-SI mixture as described by Naim et al. (18.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cell surface antigens were immunoprecipitated from intact cells on filters by addition mAb anti-SI to either the apical or basolateral compartments. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed, soaked in 16% salicylic acid for signal amplification, and subjected to fluorography. Transiently transfected and stable MDCK cells expressing wild type pro-SI, pro-SIΔST, and pro-SIΔMAwere biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h and solubilized as described above. Microdomains preparation was performed by loading the detergent extracts on 5–35% sucrose gradients, followed by ultracentrifugation as described (31.Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The gradients were fractionated into 12 fractions, immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-SI, and the isolated proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE. Digestion of 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (Endo F/GF) was performed as described previously (32.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of the stalk and the membrane anchoring domain on the sorting of pro-SI in polarized cells, two constructs of pro-SI were generated. In the first construct only the stalk region (Thr33-Ser60) was deleted from wild type pro-SI (denoted pro-SIΔST). The second construct contained the stalk region, but lacked the entire transmembrane domain (denoted pro-SIΔMA). Pro-SI is a type II glycoprotein that is synthesized with an uncleavable signal sequence residing in its membrane domain. The signal sequence is therefore eliminated upon deletion of the membrane anchor. We therefore fused the cleavable signal sequence of the type I glycoprotein, human intestinal brush-border lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, to the N-terminal end immediately in front of the stalk region of pro-SI (Fig.1). Both constructs, pro-SIΔST and pro-SIΔMA, as well as wild type pro-SI were stably transfected in MDCK cells and the positive clones were selected by immunoprecipitation of detergent extracts of biosynthetically labeled cells with mAb anti-SI. Fig.2 A shows that biosynthetic labeling of MDCK-SIWT for 6 h revealed two polypeptides, an Endo H-resistant and an Endo H-sensitive band. In analogy with pro-SI isolated from human intestinal biopsy samples (18.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Caco-2 cells (25.Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), these polypeptides correspond to the 210-kDa mannose-rich pro-SI (pro-SIh) and the 245-kDa complex glycosylated pro-SI (pro-SIc). Similar to pro-SI in intestinal cells (18.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), N-deglycosylation of pro-SI revealed two polypeptides, one which contains O-linked glycans (a 205-kDa polypeptide) and is derived from mature pro-SIc and the other is derived from mannose-rich pro-SIh and is devoid of O-glycosylation. A similar double band pattern was not revealed upon Endo F/GF treatment of the pro-SIΔSTmutant from which the stalk region was truncated. Instead one slightly diffuse band of apparent molecular weight approximately similar to that of the N-deglycosylated mannose-rich species of pro-SIΔST was discerned. Obviously a substantial reduction in the size of the O-glycans has occurred due to the deletion of the stalk region. On the other hand,N-linked glycosylation and maturation in the Golgi apparatus of pro-SIΔST has occurred normally (see later Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the pro-SIΔST mutant revealed two biosynthetic forms during the same labeling period as wild type pro-SI. These polypeptides could be distinguished from each other when Endo H treatment was performed. Similar to wild type pro-SI, a mannose-rich Endo H-sensitive form and a mature Endo H-resistant form could be discerned indicating that truncation of the stalk domain had no influence on the transport of pro-SI from the endoplasmic reticulum to the site of maturation in the Golgi apparatus. Other evidence for the drastic reduction in the amount of O-glycosylation due to the deletion of the stalk region is obtained when cells were biosynthetically labeled at 15 °C. At this temperature transport of proteins is arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum preventing thus O-glycosylation which commences in the cis-Golgi (33.Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, pro-SIΔSTrevealed a mannose-rich form which was N-deglycosylated with Endo H or Endo F/GF to polypeptides with similar apparent molecular weights. The diffused band pattern of the Endo F/GF product of pro-SIΔST at 37 °C as compared with its counterpart at 15 °C indicates that some O-glycosylation has occurred. Nevertheless, the extent of O-glycans is substantially less than that in wild type pro-SI. Together the results demonstrate that the stalk domain of pro-SI is the major site ofO-glycosylation in the pro-SI molecule.Figure 2Identification of molecular forms of wild type pro-SI , pro-SI ΔST and pro-SI ΔMA in MDCK cells. A, MDCK cells stably expressing wild type pro-SI or pro-SIΔST were biosynthetically labeled for 6 h at 37 °C (upper panel) or 10 h at 15 °C (lower panel) with [35S]methionine. Detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-SI antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were divided into equal parts and treated with Endo H, Endo F/GF, or not treated. The proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE on 6% slab gels followed by fluorography. B, MDCK stably expressing pro-SIΔMA cells were biosynthetically labeled for 6 h with [35S]methionine at 37 °C. Cellular lysates and culture medium were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-SI antibodies. Further treatment of the immunoprecipitates was as in A. C, MDCK stably expressing pro-SIΔMA cells were biosynthetically labeled for 6 h with [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of benzyl-GalNAc (denoted Benzyl). Secreted pro-SIΔMA was immunoprecipitated from the culture medium and treated or not treated with Endo H and Endo F/GF. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Transport kinetics of wild type pro-SI , pro-SI ΔST , and pro-SI ΔMA in MDCK cells. A, MDCK cells stably expressing pro-SI and pro-SIΔST were pulse labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and chased for the indicated times with 2.5 mm unlabeled methionine. Wild type pro-SI and pro-SIΔST were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with mAb anti-SI and the immunoprecipitates were divided into equal parts, one of which was treated with Endo H and the other was not treated. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels and fluorography. B, MDCK cells stably expressing pro-SIΔMA were subjected to pulse-chase labeling as inA. Pro-SIΔMA was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and the medium and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% SDS gel followed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next the structural features and biosynthesis of the anchorless mutant pro-SIΔMA were investigated. This mutant was secreted into the medium in biosynthetically labeled MDCK cells indicating that deletion of the membrane anchoring domain had no consequences on the intracellular transport of pro-SIΔMA (Fig.2 B). The soluble pro-SIΔMA form had an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa and is resistant to treatment with Endo H indicating that it is complex glycosylated. The cellular form of pro-SIΔMA in the cell lysates revealed the mannose-rich form which was sensitive to treatment with Endo H. Endo F/GF treatment of secreted complex glycosylated pro-SIΔMA generated a polypeptide that was larger than the N-deglycosylated cellular counterpart indicating that the secreted form contained Endo F/GF-resistant O-glycans. O-Glycosylation of the pro-SIΔMA was further confirmed by treatment of cells with benzyl-GalNAc, a potent inhibitor of O-glycosylation. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that pro-SIΔMA was transport competent in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc and it was secreted into the medium. However, a marked shift in the apparent molecular weight was revealed as compared with the control pro-SIΔMA in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc indicating a decrease in the extent of O-linked glycosylation. This view was confirmed by N-deglycosylation of the secreted pro-SIΔMA glycoforms with Endo F/GF. The deglycosylated control pro-SIΔMA was larger than its counterpart from cells treated with benzyl-GalNAc. This demonstrates that the shift in the size of secreted pro-SIΔMA generated upon benzyl-GalNAc treatment is not due to N-linked glycosylation otherwise a similar product of N-deglycosylation would have been obtained and this was not the case. The results shown above demonstrated that the pro-SI mutants were transport competent. To determine, however, whether truncation of the stalk region and the transmembrane domains have affected the transport kinetics of these mutants as compared with wild type pro-SI, pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine were performed. Fig. 3 A shows that within 1 h of pulse, only the mannose-rich glycosylated forms of wild type pro-SI, pro-SIΔMA, and pro-SIΔST appeared which were sensitive to Endo H treatment. After 1 h of chase Endo H-resistant complex, glycosylated forms of pro-SIWT and pro-SIΔST could be detected, which became the predominant bands with increasing chase periods. The fact that complex glycosylated species were detected within the same period of chase indicates that wild type pro-SI and pro-SIΔST have been transported to the Golgi apparatus at almost similar rates. However, complete processing of the mannose-rich species to the complex glycosylated form was achieved only with wild type pro-SI after 6 h of chase, while almost 15% pro-SIΔST were still present in the mannose-rich form indicating that the processing kinetics of the pro-SIΔST mutant are slightly slower than those of wild type. The transport kinetics of pro-SIΔMA were assessed by comparing the proportions of pro-SIΔMA in the cell lysates with those in the medium (Fig. 3 B). A faint band corresponding to the complex glycosylated secreted form of pro-SIΔMA was found in the medium already after 1 h of chase and the intensity of this band increased substantially within the next chase time points. At 6 h of chase the secreted form constituted almost 90% of total pro-SIΔMA. Here again, pro-SIΔMA is transported within the cell at almost similar rates as wild type pro-SI and comparable to the transport of pro-SI in the small intestine (18.Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next we wanted to determine how the deletions of the transmembrane domain and the stalk region have affected the polarized sorting of the pro-SI mutants. For this purpose, MDCK cells expressing wild type pro-SI and the mutants were grown on transparent polyester membranes in multiwell tissue culture plates, which allow separate access to both surface domains, the apical and the basolateral. The cells were labeled 5–8 days after confluency with [35S]methionine for 6 h and cell surface immunoprecipitation of pro-SI was performed with mAb anti-SI. Fig.4 A shows that approximately 95% of pro-SIWT were immunoprecipitated from the apical membrane in line with previous data obtained in Caco-2 cells. By contrast, deletion of the transmembrane domain was associated with a dramatic shift in the sorting behavior of the pro-SI mutants. In pulse-chase experiments pro-SIΔST was immunoprecipitated from the apical and basolateral membranes at all chase time points. Scanning of the fluorograms revealed about 60% of pro-SIΔST at the"

For the first time, we have shown that SF1 and Oct-3/4 are co-expressed in embryonal carcinoma (EC) P19 cells, and their expression is down-regulated with very similar kinetics following retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of these cells, suggesting a functional relationship between the two. Previously, we have shown that theOct-3/4 promoter harbors an RA-responsive element, RAREoct, which functions in EC cells as a binding site for positive regulators of transcription, such as RAR and RXR. In this study we have identified in the Oct-3/4 promoter two novel SF1-binding sites: SF1(a) and SF1(b). The proximal site, SF1(a), is located within the RAREoct, and the distal site, SF1(b), is located between nucleotide −193 and −209 of the Oct-3/4 promoter. Both sites contribute to activation of Oct-3/4 promoter in EC cells, with SF1(a) playing a more crucial role. SF1, and its isoforms ELP2 and ELP3 bind to both SF1 sites and activate the Oct-3/4 promoter. This activation depends on the presence of SF1 DNA-binding domain. Thus,Oct-3/4 is the first EC-specific gene reported that is regulated by SF1. Interestingly, SF1 and RAR form a novel complex on the RAREoct sequence that synergistically activate theOct-3/4 promoter.

One family of transcription factors which exhibits developmental functions is the POU-specific family. Members of this family share two regions of homology: a highly conserved amino-terminal domain, designated the POU-specific domain, and a more divergent carboxyl-terminal homeodomain (reviewed in Refs. 1.Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholarand 2.Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It is expressed in totipotent and pluripotent stem cells of the pregastrulation embryo, primordial germ cells, and oocytes (4.Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 5.Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Timmons P.M. Poirier F. Rigby P.W.J. Staudt L.M.

Oct-3/4 expression is down-regulated in the developing embryo upon differentiation to endoderm and mesoderm, and in EC and ES cells which are induced to differentiate in vitro following treatment with retinoic acid (EC/RA, ES/RA) (4.Okamoto K.

Expression of Oct-3/4 is crucial to the establishment of pluripotent stem cells in the mammalian embryo, since Oct-3/4-deficient embryos develop to the blastocyst stage, but the inner cell mass cells are not pluripotent (10.Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar).Studies of the down-regulation of Oct-3/4 gene expression suggest an involvement of several cis acting elements. An enhancer element (located 1.2 kb upstream of the initiation site, designated RARE1) has been characterized (11.Okazawa H. Okamoto K. Ishino F. Ishino-Kaneko T. Takeda S. Toyoda Y. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This enhancer is necessary for a high level of promoter activity in P19 cells before RA treatment and for RA-mediated repression. Another DNA element located farther upstream (∼2 kb 5′ to the initiation site) and designated the distal enhancer has also been identified (12.Minucci S. Botquin V. Yeom Y.-I. Dey A. Sylvester I. Zand D.J. Ohbo K. Ozato K. Schöler H.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13.Young Y., II Fuhrmann G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hübner K. Schöler H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element confers strong enhancer activity in ES cells, but not EC cells, and in mice is considered to be active specifically in the germ line lineage. We and others have previously detected an RA-responsive element, RAREoct, present in the promoter region of the Oct-3/4 gene (14.Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben-Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15.Schoorlemmer J. van Puijenbroek A. van den Eijnden M. Jonk L. Pals C. Kruijer W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16.Sylvester I. Schöler H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This RAREoct motif functions in EC cells as a binding site for positive regulators of transcription, and in RA-differentiated cells as a binding site for negative regulators (15.Schoorlemmer J. van Puijenbroek A. van den Eijnden M. Jonk L. Pals C. Kruijer W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16.Sylvester I. Schöler H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the RARE1 region located in the proximal enhancer, the RAREoct promoter element contains a typical recognition sequence for RA receptors (RAR).Vitamin A (retinol) and its biologically active derivatives (retinoids), most notably RA, exert pleiotropic effects on vertebrate development, cell differentiation, and homeostasis (18.Mendelsohn C. Ruberte E. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19.Tabin C.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 199-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The action of diverse ligands (including retinoids, vitamin D, steroid hormones, and thyroid hormone) is mediated by members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. RA exerts its action through two distinct groups within the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily: the retinoid nuclear receptors, RARs (isoforms α, β, and γ), and the RXRs (isoforms α, β, and γ). The complexity of retinoid signaling is further increased by the fact that, at least in vitro, RARs bind to their polymorphic cis acting response elements, as RAR:RXR heterodimers. Moreover, RXRs are also heterodimeric partners for other nuclear receptors such as thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, as well as the nerve growth factor I-B (NGFI-B) (reviewed in Refs. 20.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar and 21.Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), and the OR1 orphan receptors (22.Wiebel F.F. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The orphan members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors are those for which the activating ligands have not been identified. Two of the well characterized orphan receptors, ARP-I and COUP-TFI, were shown to have the capacity to block RAR:RXR-mediated transactivation (23.Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 24.Tran P. Zhang X.-K. Salbert G. Hermann T. Lehmann J.M. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4666-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory indicated inhibition of Oct-3/4 gene expression by the ARP-I and COUP-TFI orphan receptors through the RAREoct site (17.Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The RAREoct sequence includes a potential site for the binding of another orphan receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1). SF1 has emerged as a key regulator of endocrine function within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and adrenal cortex and as an essential factor in sex differentiation. SF1 plays a role in the regulation of genes in steroidogenic cells, Sertoli cells, and gonadotropes. Analysis of the role of SF1 in vivo by targeted gene disruption showed that SF1 knockout mice exhibited adrenal and gonadal agenesis, male-to-female sex reversal of the internal and external genitalia, impaired gonadotrope function, and deletion of a specific region of the hypothalamus (reviewed in Ref.25.Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The SF1 protein is one of four known isoforms (SF-1, ELP1, ELP2, and ELP3) generated by alternative promoter usage and 3′-splicing of the same gene (26.Ninomiya Y. Okada M. Kotomura N. Suzuki K. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The SF-1/ELP transcription factors and their closely resembled Drosophila fushi tarazu factor 1 are believed to interact with their recognition site 5′-PyCAAGGPyCPu-3′ or 5′-PuPuAGGTC-3′ as monomers (27.Ohno C.K. Ueda H. Petkovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3166-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ueda H. Sun G.-C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).We show that the SF1/ELP transcription factor(s) is expressed not only in the cell lineages described above, but also in P19 EC cells, and its expression is down-regulated following RA treatment. SF1 activates theOct-3/4 promoter via two SF1-binding sites. Moreover, we point out a possible functional interaction of the SF1/ELP protein(s) with the RAR proteins to synergistically activate theOct-3/4 gene expression. The possible effect of SF-1/ELP on the Oct-3/4 gene and its synergism with members of the RAR family of transcription factors, adds sources of diversity to regulation of a RA-responsive gene.DISCUSSIONThe Oct-3/4 transcription factor is expressed in the earliest stages of embryogenesis (4.Okamoto K.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and is thus likely to play an important role in regulation of initial decisions in development (10.Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms that participate inOct-3/4 activation in pluripotent cells, we have examined the regulation of the Oct-3/4 promoter activity, in detail. The Oct-3/4 promoter is composed of multiple regulatory elements, including binding sites for Sp1, RAR:RXR heterodimers, COUP-TFI, and ARP-1 (14.Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben-Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15.Schoorlemmer J. van Puijenbroek A. van den Eijnden M. Jonk L. Pals C. Kruijer W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16.Sylvester I. Schöler H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study we have provided proof that SF1-binding sites, and the SF1 protein play a role in up-regulatingOct-3/4 promoter activity. Furthermore, our data show that SF1 and RAR function cooperatively in transactivation of theOct-3/4 promoter. Interestingly, we have shown that SF1 is expressed in P19 EC cells, which also express the Oct-3/4gene, and expression of both transcription factors is down-regulated in EC cells which are induced to differentiate with RA. Considering these data, it seems likely that SF1 positively regulates Oct-3/4expression in EC cells.We have identified two novel putative SF1-binding sites in theOct-3/4 promoter: the proximal site, SF1(a), that is located within the previously identified RAREoct element, and the distal site, SF1(b), which is located between nucleotide −193 and −209 of theOct-3/4 promoter. The RAREoct is a compound element that harbors three direct repeats (R1-R3) of an AGGTCA-like consensus binding site for members of the RAR family of transcription factors, with 1- and 0-nucleotide spacers. The SF1-putative binding site encompasses the R3 and three adjacent nucleotides of the R2, whereas the RAR:RXR heterodimers bind to R1-R2 (16.Sylvester I. Schöler H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have shown that SF1, which is expressed in P19 cells, binds to the RAREoct motif harboring the SF1(a) motif. Moreover, footprinting analysis of the 400-bpOct-3/4 promoter fragment, using COS-1/SF1 protein extracts revealed a protection pattern similar to that observed in our previous study, using cell extracts prepared from P19 cells (14.Pikarsky E.

The undifferentiated P19 nuclear extracts protected a region between nucleotides −52 and −20 of the Oct-3/4 wild-type promoter. This region includes the Sp1, RAREoct, and SF1-binding sites. In contrast, extracts from P19/RA cells protected the region between nucleotides −52 and −34. This shorter region lacks the SF1-binding site. Introduction of mutations within the putative SF1(a)-binding site blunted the ability of SF1 to either bind or transactivate theOct-3/4 promoter. The distal SF1(b) sequence is a putative SF1-binding site, in a reverse orientation CCTGGAACT. Mutation analysis of the proximal and distal SF1 sites indicates that the proximal SF1(a) site is the main site through which SF1 affects the Oct-3/4promoter, as tested in P19 cells. Interestingly, numerous genes regulated by SF1 contain more than one SF1-binding site in their regulatory elements. The presence, in a promoter, of multiple binding sites for a single transcription factor may reflect different usage in various cellular backgrounds (53.Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9052-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 54.Takayama K. Morohashi K.-i. Honda S.-i. Hara N. Omura T. J. Biochem.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An Sp1 consensus binding site is located 5′ to the RAREoct motif. The proteins that take part in activating the Oct-3/4 promoter through the Sp1 site have not yet been identified, but it is likely that there could be unique Sp1 factors characterized by a cell lineage-specific rather than ubiquitous expression pattern. This Sp1 decamer sequence partially overlaps with the R1 sequence. Thus, the Sp1- and SF1-binding sites are closely located in theOct-3/4 promoter, and moreover, are both protected similarly using P19 (14.Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben-Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and COS/SF1 whole cell extracts. Proximal location of SF1 and Sp1 binding elements were observed in other genes as well (56.Hamann L. Bayer K.-U. Jensen K. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5786-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 57.Leone T.C. Cresci S. Carter M.E. Zhang Z. Lala D.S. Strauss A.W. Kelly D.P. J. Biol.

An example for cooperative functional interactions between Sp1 and SF1 proteins have been shown in the transactivation of thecholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A) promoter (58.Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sp1 and SF1 responsive elements have also been linked and involved in the cAMP-induced expression of various genes (53.Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9052-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 55.Zhang P. Rodriguez H. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58.Liu Z.

The cAMP-induced expression might involve cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, and phosphorylation of the SF1 protein (60.Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Considering the fact that theOct-3/4 promoter sequence harbors SF1 and Sp1 neighboring sequences, combined with the data indicating a regulatory effect of cAMP on EC cells (61.Goldstein B. Rogelj S. Siegel S. Farmer S.R. Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 62.Lenardo M.J. Staudt L. Robbins P. Kuang A. Mulligan R.C. Baltimore D. Science. 1989; 243: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 63.Meier P. Koedood M. Philipp J. Fontana A. Mitchell P.J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it seems likely that Oct-3/4promoter activity may be regulated through the cAMP signal transduction pathway.SF1 protein is involved in regulation of expression of genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in the adrenal cortex. SF1 activates genes in steroidogenic cells (steroid hydroxylases, non-cytochrome P450 enzyme, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, and ACTH receptor), in Sertoli cells (Müllerian-inhibiting substance andaromatase), and in the gonadotropes (α-subunit ofglycoproteins, β-subunit of leutinizing hormone, and the GnRH receptor, reviewed in Ref. 25.Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In this report we have demonstrated the presence, and indicated a possible functional role, of SF1 protein in a completely different cell lineage, i.e. the EC cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an EC-specific gene that is activated by SF1. Moreover, the kinetics of Oct-3/4 repression following RA treatment directly correlates with suppression of the SF1 transcripts. This direct correlation between Oct-3/4 and SF1 expression in EC cells, and down-regulation in RA-treated EC cells, as well as our binding and transfection experiments, may imply a functional relationship between SF1 and Oct-3/4. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the SF1 protein is necessary for SF1-mediated activation ofOct-3/4 gene expression. A similar requirement for the SF1 DBD for the activation of the P450ssc gene in ES cells and for differentiation of ES cells into steroidogenic cells, has also been demonstrated (64.Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).On the basis of our previous experiments which implicate RAR:RXR heterodimers in activation of the Oct-3/4 promoter (17.Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in order to get a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying activation of the Oct-3/4 promoter via SF1, we have examined the possibility of a functional interaction between SF1 and RAR or RXR nuclear factors. We have shown that RAR acts in concert with SF1 to activate Oct-3/4 promoter expression. Co-transfections of both SF1 and RAR expression vectors into L cells clearly confirmed that the two transcription factors act in synergism on the Oct-3/4 promoter. This synergism was restricted to SF1 and RAR, since co-transfection of SF1 withRXRα, β, or γ had no effect on Oct-3/4expression. SF1 and RAR synergism requires the two respective binding sites, since disruption by site-directed mutagenesis of either site abolishes the synergism. This functional interaction also requires the SF1 DNA-binding domain. It has been previously shown that the RARs alone are inefficient DNA binders and require auxiliary nuclear proteins for effective interactions with responsive elements. The RXRs serve as such auxiliary proteins. It is possible that the SF1 protein is a similar auxiliary factor that facilitates the binding of RAR to DNA, improves the ability of RAR to interact with coactivators, or interferes with the ability of RAR to interact with corepressors. Unlike the RAR:RXR heterodimers that activate the Oct-3/4promoter in the presence of RA, the RAR and SF1 proteins synergistically activate the Oct-3/4 promoter in the absence of RA added to medium. Moreover, binding assays reveal that RA (10−4 to 10−7m) neither activated nor inhibited SF1·RAR complex formation (data not shown). In P19 cells Oct-3/4 expression is down-regulated following 24 h of RA treatment, whereas RAR:RXR expression is up-regulated by 3 h of treatment. Interestingly, 24 h of RA treatment results also in up-regulation of ARP-1 andCOUP-TFI orphan receptors which repress theOct-3/4 promoter (15.Schoorlemmer J. van Puijenbroek A. van den Eijnden M. Jonk L. Pals C. Kruijer W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1122-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16.Sylvester I. Schöler H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These orphan receptors bind the RAREoct site with a much higher affinity than the RAR:RXR and most probably also with a higher affinity than RAR and SF1. This high binding affinity provides the orphan receptors with the ability to compete and displace the activating receptors (RAR, RXR, and SF1) from the RAREoct site and subsequently to silence the Oct-3/4promoter.Although our studies clearly indicate that SF1 and RAR cooperate to synergistically activate the Oct-3/4 promoter, the nature of RAR-SF1 interaction is not yet clear. Our binding experiments show that SF1 and RAR form a novel complex which contains both transcription factors, on the RAREoct sequence. This complex could be formed through several molecular interactions, such as direct interactions between SF1 and RAR. Alternatively, since SF1 synergies with RAR and not with RXR, they may indirectly interact through a shared coactivator that is specific for this combination. Both were found to interact with multiple coactivators such as SRC-1, CBP, and p300 (65.Monté D. DeWitte F. Hum D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4585-4591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 66.Ito M., Yu, R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 67.Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These two modes of interactions (direct or through coactivators) are not mutually exclusive. In addition, SF1 and RAR can bind to their adjacent sites cooperatively, binding of one transcription factor altering the DNA conformation in a way which increases the local accessibility for the second transcription factor. The effect of SF1 alone onOct-3/4 promoter activity, although very consistent, is moderate and is enhanced considerably in the presence of RAR. It is possible that tissue-specific expression of genes regulated by SF1 could be reinforced by the presence of other transcription factors expressed in the tissue and act in synergism with SF1. Thus, the ability of RAR to synergize with SF1 in enhancing Oct-3/4 expression, may also contribute to restriction of the activation ofOct-3/4 in appropriate cell types where both transcription factors are expressed.Similarly to NGFI-B, NURR1, and thyroid hormone, that bind both as monomers or as dimers (reviewed in Refs. 20.Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar and 68.Perlmann T. Lottie J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), SF1 may also belong to this category of monomer/dimer binding receptors. In fact, several studies have described the effect of protein-protein interactions in SF1-dependent transcription. It has been shown that co-transfection of the zinc finger NGFI-A (Egr-1) and SF1 transcription factors led to synergistic activation of theLHβ promoter (69.Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A.

Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J. Science. 1996; 273: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This enhancement ofLHβ transcription most probably results from a direct interaction between Egr-1 and SF1 (71.Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, estradiol receptor and SF1 have been found to synergistically regulate the salmon gonadotropin II gene (sGTHIIβ) in the presence of estradiol (73.Le Dréan Y. Liu D. Wong A.O.L. Xiong F. Hew C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 217-229PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, using the mammalian two-hybrid system, Sp1 and SF1 have been shown to functionally collaborate in the transactivation of the bovine CYP11A (58.Liu Z. Simpson E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SF1 was found to associate and sinergize also with Wilms' tumor −1 and SOX9 to promoteMüllerian inhibiting substance andanti-Müllerian hormone expression, respectively (74.Nachtigal M.W.

https://openalex.org/W1980138952,"LOX-1 (lectin-likeoxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1) is a type II membrane protein belonging to the C-type lectin family that can act as a cell-surface receptor for atherogenic oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) and may play crucial roles in atherogenesis. In this study, we show, by pulse-chase labeling and glycosidase digestion, that LOX-1 is synthesized as a 40-kDa precursor protein withN-linked high mannose carbohydrate chains (pre-LOX-1), which is subsequently further glycosylated and processed into the 48-kDa mature form within 40 min. Furthermore, when treated with anN-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, both tumor necrosis factor-α-activated bovine aortic endothelial cells and CHO-K1 cells stably expressing bovine LOX-1 (BLOX-1-CHO) exclusively produced a 32-kDa deglycosylated form of LOX-1. Cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated that the deglycosylated form of LOX-1 is not efficiently transported to the cell surface, but is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus in tumor necrosis factor-α-activated bovine aortic endothelial cells, but not in BLOX-1-CHO cells. Radiolabeled Ox-LDL binding studies revealed that the deglycosylated form of LOX-1 expressed on the cell surface of BLOX-1-CHO cells has a reduced affinity for Ox-LDL binding. Taken together,N-linked glycosylation appears to play key roles in the cell-surface expression and ligand binding of LOX-1.

In particular, modulation of endothelial functions elicited by Ox-LDL and its lipid constituents has been implicated in the initiation of this complex disease process (1.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar,2.Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). LOX-1 (lectin-like Ox-LDL receptor-1) is a type II membrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a long C-terminal extracellular domain whose structure belongs to the C-type lectin family (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LOX-1 does not share any homology with other receptors for Ox-LDL, including class A and B scavenger receptors. Functional analysis revealed that LOX-1 supports the binding, internalization, and proteolytic degradation of Ox-LDL, but not significant amounts of acetylated LDL (4.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LOX-1 can also bind aged red blood cells as well as apoptotic cells (5.Oka K. Sawamura T. Kikuta K. Itokawa S. Kume N. Kita T. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9535-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Expression of LOX-1 can be up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and fluid shear stress in cultured vascular endothelial cells, suggesting that LOX-1 expression appears to be dynamically regulated by inflammatory and fluid mechanical stimuli (6.Kume N. Murase T. Moriwaki H. Aoyama T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 7.Murase T. Kume N. Korenaga R. Ando J. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). LOX-1 expression is not restricted to vascular endothelial cells, but has been detected in human and murine macrophages in vitro (8.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Kataoka H. Murase T. Nishi E. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9.Yoshida H. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent study has revealed that LOX-1 is expressed by endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions in vivo (10.Kataoka H. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Minami M. Moriwaki H. Murase T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Hashimoto N. Kita T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that LOX-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Bovine LOX-1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 810 base pairs that encodes a protein of 270 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 30,872 Da. The expressed protein in CHO cells and BAECs has a molecular mass of 48 kDa (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). This difference may possibly result from the addition of carbohydrates at four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites located in the C-terminal domain; however, this remains to be clarified. In this study, we provide evidence, for the first time, that LOX-1 is synthesized as a 40-kDa precursor form (pre-LOX-1), which is rapidly converted into the mature form with N-linked oligosaccharide chains. In addition, we show that N-linked glycosylation is necessary for the efficient cell-surface expression of LOX-1 in BAECs and that the deglycosylated form of LOX-1 has a lower affinity for the binding of Ox-LDL. BAECs were isolated by scraping the inner surface of bovine aortas with a glass coverslip and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sanko Junyaku). A CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing bovine LOX-1 (BLOX-1-CHO) was established and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Nissui) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS and 10 μg/ml blasticidin S as described previously (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). A murine anti-bovine LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (29-1) was prepared by immunizing mice with a recombinant protein corresponding to the extracellular domain of bovine LOX-1 as described previously (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) and was used for immunoblotting. A rat anti-bovine LOX-1 monoclonal antibody (5-144) was produced by immunizing rats with BLOX-1-CHO cells. Hybridomas were screened by cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Monoclonal antibody 5-144 was used for immunoprecipitation, cell ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry. After cells were washed with PBS and preincubated with methionine-free DMEM containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed FCS for 30 min at 37 °C, [35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DMEM and 10% FCS containing 1 mg/ml methionine for the indicated time periods. After cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), whole cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a rotator and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. After 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated with PBS and 0.1% (w/v) BSA for 2 h at 4 °C and with 5 μg of rat anti-bovine LOX-1 monoclonal antibody 5-144 for 1 h at 4 °C, samples from each time point of a pulse-chase experiment were immunoprecipitated by adding the complexes of anti-LOX-1 antibody and protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation and extensive washing. After boiling for 5 min in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 60 mmTris (pH 6.8), and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, samples were electrophoresed on 10.5% polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. LOX-1 absorbed to protein G-Sepharose was treated with several glycosidases essentially as described by Johnston et al. (11.Johnston G.I. Kurosky A. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1816-1823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the beads were treated with 50 milliunits/ml endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 16 h at 37 °C. For treatment withN-glycosidase F (N-glycanase; Takara), the beads were washed and boiled for 5 min in 10 ml of 0.5% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The volumes were adjusted to final detergent concentrations of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 1.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated for 17 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 milliunits/mlN-glycanase. Samples treated with neuraminidase (Seikagaku Kogyo) were incubated with 100 milliunits/ml neuraminidase for 1 h at 37 °C. Some samples treated with neuraminidase were then incubated with 100 milliunits/ml endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycanase; Seikagaku Kogyo) for 16 h at 37 °C. After enzyme treatments, SDS sample buffer was added to all reactions. BAECs were cultured in DMEM and 10% FCS containing TNF-α (5000 IU/ml) in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Wako) for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in equal amounts of Laemmli sample buffer, and equal amounts of lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. BLOX-1-CHO cells were also cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h at 37 °C, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). Blotted membranes were probed with murine anti-bovine LOX-1 monoclonal antibody 29-1, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, and detected by ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with PBS and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. Cells were incubated with primary antibody 5-144 for 1 h, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin antibody for 30 min. Antibody binding was determined using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate system (Dako) by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm. Viable cell numbers were measured by crystal violet staining. In brief, after incubation with 2% (v/v) methanol for 10 min, the cells were stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet (Wako) in 20% (v/v) methanol for 10 min and washed three times with tap water. The stain was eluted from the cells with 0.1 mcitrate buffer (pH 4.2) in 50% (v/v) ethanol, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured. The absorbance at 420 nm from cell ELISA for LOX-1 was corrected by the absorbance at 540 nm from crystal violet staining. Cells were detached from tissue culture flasks with 1 mm EDTA in PBS and washed with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (w/v) NaN3. The detached cells were resuspended in PBS and 1% (w/v) BSA containing anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody 5-144 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were analyzed for fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry (FACSvantage, Becton Dickinson). Dead cells were detected by low forward and right angle scatter and excluded from the analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on BAECs grown in four-well chamber slides (Nunc). After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min at room temperature, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and PBS for 1 h and then incubated with PBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 2% (v/v) normal serum for 20 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. Cells were incubated with primary antibody 5-144 for 1 h, followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. After being mounted, cells were visualized using an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with an LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Human LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from the plasma of healthy human subjects by sequential ultracentrifugation at 4 °C. LDL was dialyzed against 3 changes of LDL buffer (150 mm NaCl and 0.24 mm EDTA (pH 7.4)) at 4 °C, sterile-filtered, and stored at 4 °C. Oxidative modification of LDL was performed by incubation with 7.5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 24 h (12.Kume N. Arai H. Kawai C. Kita T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oxidation of LDL was monitored by the amounts of lipid peroxides by measuring thiobarbiturate acid reactive substances. Values for thiobarbiturate acid reactive substances in Ox-LDL and native LDL were 9.86 and 1.15 nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of protein, respectively. Ox-LDL was radiolabeled with Na125I (DuPont) by the iodine monochloride method as described previously (13.Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2599-2604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After being cultured in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 12 h, the binding of 125I-Ox-LDL to BLOX-1-CHO cells was measured as described previously (14.Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). In brief, adherent cells cultured in 12-well dishes were prechilled in 1 ml of ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) (buffer A) for 30 min at 4 °C. Culture media were replaced with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing the indicated amounts of 125I-Ox-LDL. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, cells were extensively washed with Tris washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mmNaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 2 mg/ml BSA, followed by washes with Tris washing buffer without BSA. The cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2n NaOH for 2 h in a shaker, and the radioactivity was measured by a γ-counter. The mean values for 125I-Ox-LDL binding in wild-type CHO cells were subtracted from those in BLOX-1-CHO cells to obtain the specific binding activities. The protein concentration of each well was measured by the method of Bradford (41.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). LOX-1 expression has been shown to be up-regulated by TNF-α in BAECs (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Therefore, BAECs that had been treated with TNF-α for 8 h were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min, chased for up to 2 h, and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, when BAECs were labeled for 20 min and chased for 0 min, only a precursor form of LOX-1 (pre-LOX-1) with an approximate molecular mass of 40 kDa was visualized. At 20 min of chase, >50% of the proteins detected were in the 48-kDa mature form. After 40 min of chase, most of the LOX-1 detected was in the mature form. The precursor-mature form relationship of LOX-1 was also examined in BLOX-1-CHO cells by a similar pulse-chase immunoprecipitation analysis. Pre-LOX-1 was detectable within 20 min, and significant levels of the mature form appeared within 40 min (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that LOX-1 is synthesized as 40-kDa pre-LOX-1 and rapidly modified into the 48-kDa mature form. In the amino acid sequence of LOX-1, four potential N-linked glycosylation sites have been identified (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whetherN-linked glycosylation is responsible for the post-translational processing of pre-LOX-1 into the mature form. BLOX-1-CHO cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min and chased for 20 min to obtain equal amounts of labeled pre-LOX-1 and mature LOX-1 as shown in Fig. 1 B, and the cell lysates were subjected to various glycosidase digestions. As shown in Fig. 2, pre-LOX-1, but not mature LOX-1, was sensitive to endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, which selectively removes high mannose residues. Treatment withN-glycanase, which cleaves most forms of N-linked carbohydrates, reduced the molecular sizes of both pre-LOX-1 and mature LOX-1 to 32 kDa. Sensitivity to neuraminidase indicated that mature LOX-1 contains certain amounts of sialic acid residues. Additional treatment with O-glycanase after neuraminidase did not affect the molecular mass of LOX-1. LOX-1 expressed in TNF-α-activated BAECs gave identical patterns of glycosidase digestion (data not shown). These data show that pre-LOX-1 is synthesized by the addition of N-linked high mannose carbohydrates and is further processed into the mature form, which contains certain amounts of sialic acids, without addition ofO-linked oligosaccharides. BAECs were cultured in the presence of a soluble glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, which completely prevents the addition of N-linked glycans to the nascent polypeptide chain (15.Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 661-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, BAECs treated with tunicamycin exclusively produced a protein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa, which corresponds to LOX-1 lacking all the N-linked glycans. Treatment with tunicamycin also almost completely inhibited the addition of N-linked glycans to LOX-1 in BLOX-1-CHO cells (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the expression levels of these two different forms of LOX-1 were not dramatically different, suggesting that tunicamycin did not significantly affect transcription or translation of LOX-1 in TNF-α-activated BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Cell-surface expression of LOX-1 was measured by cell ELISA and flow cytometry in both tunicamycin-treated BAECs and BLOX-1-CHO cells. In TNF-α-activated BAECs, cell-surface expression of LOX-1 was diminished after tunicamycin treatment (Fig.4 A). In contrast, BLOX-1-CHO cells did not show any decrease in LOX-1 cell-surface expression after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 4 B). Flow cytometric analysis similarly showed that cell-surface expression of LOX-1 in BAECs was reduced after tunicamycin treatment (Fig.5 A); however, BLOX-1-CHO cells did not show any significant decreases in LOX-1 cell-surface expression in response to tunicamycin (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Effect of tunicamycin on cell-surface expression of LOX-1 as shown by flow cytometry. After TNF-α-activated BAECs (A–D) and BLOX-1-CHO cells (E–G) were cultured in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), cells were detached from the culture plates and subjected to flow cytometry using the anti-LOX-1 monoclonal antibody.

As shown in Fig.6, dense immunofluorescence was observed in the cytoplasmic membranes and vesicles, in addition to the perinuclear regions, of TNF-α-activated BAECs. In contrast, tunicamycin treatment of TNF-α-activated BAECs abolished the immunofluorescence in the cytoplasmic membranes and vesicles, although the perinuclear staining was preserved. Taken together with the data from cell ELISA and flow cytometry, N-linked carbohydrates on LOX-1 appear to be crucial for its efficient transport to the cell surface in BAECs. LOX-1 is involved in the cellular uptake of Ox-LDL in vascular endothelial cells and macrophages (4.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Kataoka H. Murase T. Nishi E. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To examine whetherN-linked carbohydrates of LOX-1 are required for the binding of Ox-LDL, 125I-Ox-LDL binding assays were carried out in tunicamycin-treated BLOX-1-CHO cells. Although tunicamycin treatment did not affect cell-surface expression of LOX-1 in BLOX-1-CHO cells (Figs. 4 B and 5 B), 125I-Ox-LDL binding was markedly inhibited over the entire range of Ox-LDL concentrations examined (Fig.7 A). Scatchard analysis revealed that tunicamycin treatment resulted in a 5-fold decrease in the Ox-LDL binding affinity without a significant effect on the maximal binding capacity (Fig. 7 B). These data thus indicate thatN-linked carbohydrate chains of LOX-1 play an important role in the binding affinity for Ox-LDL. LOX-1 has been identified as a cell-surface receptor for Ox-LDL in vascular endothelial cells (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Functional analysis revealed that LOX-1 can support the binding, internalization, and proteolytic degradation of Ox-LDL (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). LOX-1 can also support the binding and phagocytosis of aged red blood cells and apoptotic cells (5.Oka K. Sawamura T. Kikuta K. Itokawa S. Kume N. Kita T. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9535-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that LOX-1 is expressed in human and murine macrophages in vitro (8.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Kataoka H. Murase T. Nishi E. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Kita T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9.Yoshida H. Kondratenko N. Green S. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In human atherosclerotic plaques, LOX-1 is expressed not only by vascular endothelial cells, but also by macrophages and smooth muscle cells (10.Kataoka H. Kume N. Miyamoto S. Minami M. Moriwaki H. Murase T. Sawamura T. Masaki T. Hashimoto N. Kita T. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These data imply its physiological roles as a scavenger receptor and its involvement in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Bovine LOX-1 consists of 270 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 30,872 Da. The expressed protein in CHO-K1 cells and BAECs, however, has a molecular mass of 48 kDa (3.Sawamura T. Kume N. Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). This difference in molecular masses has been speculated to result from the addition of carbohydrate chains at four potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular C-terminal domain. In this study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that LOX-1 is synthesized as a 40-kDa precursor protein (pre-LOX-1) containing N-linked high mannose carbohydrate chains, which is subsequently further processed into the 48-kDa mature form. This post-translational modification of LOX-1 occurs more rapidly than those of other membrane glycoproteins such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin (16.Goldberger A. Middleton K.A. Oliver J.A. Paddock C. Yan H.C. DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. Newman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17183-17191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Smeets E.F. de Vries T. Leeuwenberg J.F. van den Eijnden D.H. Buurman W.A. Neefjes J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Treatment of both mature LOX-1 and pre-LOX-1 withN-glycanase resulted in reduction of their molecular masses to ∼32 kDa, which appeared to correspond to the predicted molecular size of LOX-1 lacking all the N-linked carbohydrates. In addition, O-glycanase did not affect the molecular size of LOX-1, thus further supporting that N-linked (but notO-linked) sugar chains are responsible for the co-translational and post-translational processing of LOX-1. N-Glycosylation can be found in most membrane proteins; however, the precise functions of N-linked carbohydrates are not fully understood (18.Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested, however, that glycosylation can be a crucial factor for the folding and trafficking of membrane glycoproteins (19.Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Anai M. Hirano H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3268-3273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Linked oligosaccharides can facilitate appropriate protein folding and thus work as a “quality control” system of the endoplasmic reticulum that prevents the transport of inappropriate proteins to the Golgi complex (23.Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In the first category, membrane glycoproteins with defects in N-linked glycosylation are retained and ultimately degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (20.Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21.Collier E. Carpentier J.L. Beitz L. Carol H. Taylor S.I. Gorden P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33423-33428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the second category, certain glycoproteins are appropriately folded and efficiently transported to the cell surface withoutN-glycosylation (25.Ding D.X.-H. Vera J.C. Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24580-24584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the third category, some glycoproteins show decreased levels of cell-surface expression by deglycosylation, possibly because of the alternative mechanisms of protein transport that are independent of the glycosylation state (26.Pahlsson P. Strindhall J. Srinivas U. Lundblad A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2452-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since tunicamycin treatment did not completely prevent the transport of LOX-1 to the cell surface in TNF-α-activated BAECs, LOX-1 appears to fall into the third category. In BLOX-1-CHO cells, however, cell-surface expression of LOX-1 was not affected by the lack ofN-linked glycosylation, suggesting that the alternative mechanisms of intracellular transport of LOX-1 may differ among different cell types. N-Glycosylation of membrane glycoproteins has been shown to be necessary for their ligand binding (25.Ding D.X.-H. Vera J.C. Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

In BLOX-1-CHO cells, cell-surface expression of LOX-1 was not significantly altered by tunicamycin (Figs. 4 B and 5 B); however, this glycosylation inhibitor reduced the 125I-Ox-LDL binding affinity by ∼80%. This appears to indicate thatN-glycosylation of LOX-1 is required for the full ligand binding activity. In contrast, deglycosylated forms of E-selectin, one of the C-type lectin family glycoproteins, were found to be fully active in the adhesion of HT-29 cells (26.Pahlsson P. Strindhall J. Srinivas U. Lundblad A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2452-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that roles ofN-linked carbohydrates in ligand binding may differ among different molecules belonging to the C-type lectin family. Our previous studies have revealed that the ligand specificity of LOX-1 is distinct from that of other scavenger receptors (4.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). LOX-1 can bind to Ox-LDL, but not to significant amounts of acetylated LDL. Negative charges on Ox-LDL particles (39.Fong L.G. Parthasarathy S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1466-1477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appear to facilitate binding to the positively charged collagen-like domain of class A scavenger receptors (40.Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, interactions between Ox-LDL and LOX-1 may not be simply explained by negative charges on Ox-LDL particles (4.Moriwaki H. Kume N. Sawamura T. Aoyama T. Hoshikawa H. Ochi H. Nishi E. Masaki T. Kita T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In fact, mature LOX-1 contains certain amounts of negatively charged sialic acid residues (Fig. 2), but the absence of N-linked oligosaccharides including sialic acids reduces the Ox-LDL binding (Fig. 7). In summary, this study demonstrates that LOX-1 is synthesized as a 40-kDa precursor (pre-LOX-1) with N-linked high mannose carbohydrates, which is subsequently further glycosylated and processed into 48-kDa mature LOX-1. N-Linked glycosylation of LOX-1 appears to regulate, at least in part, its intracellular transport and ligand binding. Altered glycosylation of LOX-1 may thus affect its biological functions in vivo and modulate the pathophysiology of diseases including atherosclerosis. Further characterization of the cellular and molecular actions ofN-linked carbohydrates on LOX-1 may shed new light on the understanding of the roles of this membrane glycoprotein in the pathogenesis of diseases.

Pharmacological analyses revealed that H+i-activated22Na+ influx mediated by NHE5 was inhibited by several classes of drugs (amiloride compounds, 3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl guanidine methanesulfonate, cimetidine, and harmaline) at half-maximal concentrations that were intermediate to those determined for the high affinity NHE1 and the low affinity NHE3 isoforms, but closer to the latter. Kinetic analyses showed that the extracellular Na+ dependence of NHE5 activity followed a simple hyperbolic relationship with an apparent affinity constant (K Na) of 18.6 ± 1.6 mm. By contrast to other NHE isoforms, NHE5 also exhibited a first-order dependence on the intracellular H+concentration, achieving half-maximal activation at pH 6.43 ± 0.08.

Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 10.Brookes N. Glia. 1997; 21: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ion transporters responsible for pHiregulation in the nervous system are not as well characterized as in peripheral cell types, and this is particularly true for neurons, which are often difficult to isolate and/or maintain in culture in a differentiated state. Despite this limitation, accumulating evidence indicates that the acid-base transport systems in brain are heterogeneous but comparable to other organ systems. In cultured fetal or freshly isolated neonatal pyramidal CA1 neurons from rat hippocampus, restoration of steady-state pHifollowing intracellular acidification involves two principal ion carriers: a Na+-dependent HCO3−/Cl− exchanger and a novel amiloride-resistant Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)1 (11.Baxter K.A. Church J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 457-470Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12.Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later in development, acutely dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurons from adults rats exhibit an acidifying mechanism mediated by a Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, most likely the AE3 isoform (14.Raley-Susman K.M. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. Brain Res. 1993; 614: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ and Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchangers also make distinct contributions to pHi regulation in neurons of the medulla oblongata (15.Ritucci N.A. Chambers-Kersh L. Dean J.B. Putnam R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1152-R1163PubMed Google Scholar), superior cervical ganglion sympathetic neurons (16.Tolkovsky A.M. Richards C.D. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cerebellar Purkinje cells (17.Gaillard S. Dupont J.-L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 425: 71-83Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as well as brain synaptosomes (18.Jean T. Frelin C. Vigne P. Barbry P. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9678-9684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, pHiregulation in primary cultures of rat astrocytes is more intricate and involves the three major acid-base transport systems mentioned above (19.Boyarsky G. Ranson B. Schlue W.-R. Davis M.B.E. Boron W.F. Glia. 1993; 8: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20.Shrode L.D. Putnam R.W. Glia. 1994; 12: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as a fourth pH-regulating mechanism, Na+-HCO3− cotransport (20.Shrode L.D. Putnam R.W. Glia. 1994; 12: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,21.Boussouf A. Lambert R.C. Gaillard S. Glia. 1997; 19: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, rat astrocytes express multiple NHE isoforms (22.Benos D.J. McPherson S. Hahn B.H. Chaikin M.A. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13811-13816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which further adds to their pH-regulatory complexity. More detailed examination of NHE mRNA expression in rat brain revealed that NHE1 is the most abundant and widely dispersed isoform, whereas other family members (i.e. NHE2–4) show a more restricted distribution (23.Ma E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The importance of NHE1 in neuronal function is demonstrated convincingly by spontaneous (24.Cox G.A. Lutz C.M.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C788-C795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) null mutations in mice, which develop ataxia and epileptic-like seizures by 2 weeks of age and show significant mortality (67%) prior to weaning. These changes are associated with selective loss of neurons in the cerebellum and brainstem (24.Cox G.A. Lutz C.M. Yang C.L. Biemesderfer D. Bronson R.T. Fu A. Aronson P.S. Noebels J.L. Frankel W.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). By contrast, mice with targeted disruptions of the Nhe2 and Nhe3 loci do not display obvious neurological symptoms (26.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M.

Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar); hence their particular roles in nervous system function are less apparent. In addition to NHE1–4, recent molecular cloning and tissue distribution studies in human (28.Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabó E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4377-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and rat (29.Attaphitaya S. Park K. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4383-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have identified a fifth NHE isoform that is distinguished by its predominant expression in discrete regions of the brain, including dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. Moreover, it shares high sequence similarity to the amiloride-resistant NHE3 isoform which, in brain, is detected only in cerebellar Purkinje cells (23.Ma E. Haddad G.G. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is reasonable to postulate that NHE5, rather than NHE3, is a likely candidate for the amiloride-resistant form of the NHE reported in hippocampal neurons (13.Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2739-2745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly other cell types of the nervous system (19.Boyarsky G. Ranson B. Schlue W.-R. Davis M.B.E. Boron W.F. Glia. 1993; 8: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, its intrinsic biochemical and pharmacological properties have yet to be defined in detail. To facilitate its characterization without the complicating presence of other NHE isoforms, we stably expressed the human NHE5 cDNA in mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary cells (AP-1) devoid of endogenous NHE activity. The results reveal that the functional properties of NHE5 closely resemble those of an amiloride-resistant NHE isoform identified in hippocampal neurons. Carrier-free 22NaCl (range of specific activity, 900–950 mCi/mg; concentration, ∼10 mCi/ml) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Amiloride, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), cimetidine, clonidine, harmaline, ouabain, bumetanide, antimycin A, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, MES, and MOPS were purchased from Sigma. (3-methanesulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)guanidine methanesulfonate (HOE694) was kindly provided by Dr. Hans-J. Lang (Hoechst Marion Roussel, AG). Nigericin was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). α-Minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents used in these experiments were from British Drug House Inc. (St. Laurent, Québec) or Fisher Scientific and were of the highest grade available. A full-length cDNA encoding human NHE5 was used in this study as described previously (28.Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabó E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4377-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), except that it did not contain a COOH-terminal influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope tag in order to preserve the native structure of the protein. The human NHE5 cDNA was inserted into a mammalian expression vector under the control of the enhancer/promoter region from the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus as described previously (28.Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabó E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4377-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and called pNHE5. The pNHE5 plasmid was stably transfected into NHE-deficient Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells (30.Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (31.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar) and acid selection (32.Franchi A. Perucca Lostanlen D. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9388-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several clonal cell lines were screened for their level of NHE5 expression by measuring H+i-activated22Na+ influx. For these studies, the cell clone AP-1NHE5/C6, which had the highest level of NHE5 activity, was used between passages 2 and 10. The cells were maintained in complete α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Prior to22Na+ influx measurements, the cells were acidified intracellularly using the NH4Cl prepulse technique as described previously (33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were initiated by incubating the cell monolayers in isotonic choline chloride solution (125 mm choline chloride, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmglucose, 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm ouabain and carrier-free 22Na+(1 μCi/ml) in the absence or presence of the NHE-specific inhibitor EIPA (0.1 mm). The lack of K+ and the presence of ouabain minimized transport of Na+ catalyzed by the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter and the Na+,K+-ATPase. In experiments where the assay buffer contained extracellular K+, the medium was further supplemented with 0.1 mm bumetanide to block the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter. The influx of 22Na+ was terminated by rapidly washing the cells three times with 4 volumes of ice-cold NaCl stop solution (130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). To extract the radiolabel, the monolayers were solubilized with 0.25 ml of 0.5 n NaOH, and the wells were washed with 0.25 ml of 0.5 n HCl. Both the NaOH cell extract and the HCl wash solution were combined in 5 ml of scintillation fluid and transferred to scintillation vials. The radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Under the conditions of NH4Cl acid load, the uptake of 22Na+ at low Na+ concentrations was linear over a 10-min period at 22 °C. Therefore, a time course of 5 min was chosen for most experiments with the following exceptions. In experiments examining the kinetics of NHE activity as a function of the extracellular Na+ concentration, the influx of22Na+ was linear for only 2 min at 100 mm NaCl. Consequently, an uptake time of 1 min was chosen for these studies. For studies designed to examine the activity of NHE as a function of the H+iconcentration, the pHi was set over the range of 5.8–7.4 by using the K+-nigericin method (34.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Measurements of 22Na+ influx specific to the NHE were determined as the difference between the initial rates of H+i-activated22Na+ influx in the absence and presence of 0.1 mm EIPA and expressed as EIPA-inhibitable22Na+ influx. Depletion of cellular ATP was carried out as described previously (35.Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 10 min in ATP-depleting medium containing 100 mm potassium glutamate, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmdeoxyglucose, and 1 μg/ml antimycin A. This high K+, low Na+, and nominally Ca2+-free medium was used to prevent Na+ and/or Ca2+ loading of the cells upon inhibition of the Na+/K+ or Ca2+ pumps. Substitution of most of the Cl− by glutamate− was intended to minimize cell swelling. Control cells were incubated in this same solution devoid of deoxyglucose and antimycin A and instead contained 5 mm glucose. All experiments represent the average of two to four experiments, each performed in quadruplicate. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The NHE isoforms characterized to date (i.e. NHE1–4) display a wide range of sensitivities to different classes of pharmacological inhibitors, including amiloride and its analogs (e.g. EIPA and HMA), benzoyl guanidinium compounds (e.g. HOE694 and HOE642 (cariporide)), cimetidine, clonidine, and harmaline (33.Orlowski J.

Many of these compounds have been shown to mediate their effects by competing with extracellular Na+ at the same, or a closely associated, binding site(s) (for review, see Ref. 41.Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the sensitivity of human NHE5 to these antagonists, the rate of H + i-activated22Na+ influx was measured as a function of the drug concentration in a clonal isolate of NHE5-transfected AP-1 cells (i.e. AP-1NHE5/C6). As illustrated in Fig.1 and summarized in TableI, the order of potency of these compounds was HMA ≈ EIPA > HOE694 > amiloride > cimetidine > harmaline with apparent half-maximal inhibition (K 0.5) values of (in μm) 0.37, 0.42, 9.1, 21, 230, and 940, respectively. These values are intermediate between those of NHE1 and NHE3 but closer to the latter. By contrast, clonidine had little, if any, effect on NHE5 activity even though it is an effective inhibitor of other NHE isoforms (33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab To determine the extracellular Na+ (Na+o) affinity of NHE5, initial rates of H+i-activated22Na+ influx were measured as a function of the Na+o concentration. The rate of22Na+ influx was saturable and conformed to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.2 A). Transformation of the data according to the Eadie-Hofstee algorithm (V versusV/[S]) yielded a linear relationship (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the presence of a single Na+ binding site at the extracellular surface. Calculation of the value of the negative slope gave an apparent affinity constant for Na+o (K Na) of 18.6 ± 1.6 mm. Transport activity was also measured as a function of the H+i concentration. This was determined by measuring the rate of 22Na+influx in cells where the pHi was clamped over the range of pH 6.0–7.4 using the K+-nigericin method. The pHi sensitivity of NHE5 is presented in Fig.3 A as a percentage of EIPA-inhibitable 22Na+ influx determined at pHi 6.0. Transformation of the data according to the Eadie-Hofstee algorithm also revealed a straight line (Fig.3 B), suggestive of a single internal H+ binding site. Calculation of the negative slope gave a half-maximal H + i activation value of pK = 6.43 ± 0.08. This activity profile is in contrast to that observed for other NHE isoforms in several cell types which show a greater than first-order dependence on intracellular protons (41.Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 43.Lazdunski M. Frelin C. Vigne P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1985; 17: 1029-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Extracellular monovalent cations, including H+o, Li+o, and NH4+o, have generally been shown to decrease H+i-activated22Na+ influx by endogenous (41.Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected exchangers (i.e. NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3) (33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a competitive manner, although in some cases mixed type inhibition is observed (44.Ives H.E. Yee V.J. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9710-9716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, these exchangers are capable of transporting both Li+ and NH4+, but the rates of translocation are usually slower than that for Na+and H+. By contrast, external K+ selectively inhibits NHE1, but only at high, nonphysiological concentrations, and does not appear to be translocated (33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether the rate of Na+ transport by NHE5 is also differentially sensitive to the presence of other extracellular monovalent cations (i.e.H+o, Li+o, and K+o). External protons decreased H+i-activated22Na+ influx into NHE5-transfected cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4 A), with apparent half-maximal activity reached at pHo 8.13 ± 0.15. This reduction is associated with the gradual decrease in the transmembrane H+ gradient (ΔpH) but could also partly reflect H+o competition for the Na+o binding site. To test this latter possibility, the Na+oconcentration was adjusted to 1 and 10 mm, and the initial rates of influx of 22Na+ were measured as a function of the H+o concentration. Transformation of the data using the Dixon algorithm (1/Vversus [H+]o) resulted in straight lines (Fig. 4 B), with the slope of the line decreasing in the presence of higher Na+o levels. Determination of the intercept of the lines yielded an inhibitory constant (K i) for H+o of approximately 17 nm. These data indicate that the effectiveness of H+o to reduce the influx of 22Na+ by NHE5 is influenced by the Na+o concentration, which is consistent with the notion that H+oeffectively competes with Na+o at a single site. Similarly, Li+o was also a potent and competitive inhibitor of H+i-activated22Na+ influx by NHE5 (Fig.5). The apparent half-maximal inhibition was achieved at a concentration of 318 ± 47 μm(Fig. 5 A), which is an order of magnitude lower than that reported for other isoforms (33.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the nature of this inhibition in greater detail, the initial rates of 1 mm and 10 mm22Na+influx were measured as a function of the Li+o concentration. Analysis of the data by Dixon plot (Fig. 5 B) yielded straight lines, with the slope of the line decreasing in the presence of higher Na+o levels. This suggested that Li+o also interacted in a competitive manner with an apparent K i ≈ 0.63 mm. In contrast to H+oand Li+o, increasing concentrations of K+o (1–100 mm) had only a minor inhibitory effect on the initial22Na+ transport rates of NHE5 (Fig.6). A summary of these data is presented in Table II.Figure 6Influence of extracellular K+ on EIPA-inhibitable 22Na+ influx in AP-1 cells expressing human NHE5. AP-1NHE5/C6 cells were preloaded with H+ using the NH4Cl prepulse technique. Initial rates of EIPA-inhibitable22Na+ influx were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of K+o(10−3 to 10−1m). Isoosmolarity was maintained by adjusting the choline chloride concentration. Data were normalized as a percentage of the maximal rate of EIPA-inhibitable22Na+ influx in the absence of K+o.

Thus, it was of interest to determine whether NHE5 was similarly sensitive to ATP. Under the conditions used (10-min incubation with deoxyglucose and antimycin A to block glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, respectively), ATP is depleted rapidly by >90% without compromising the intactness of the plasma membrane or adherence of the cells to the culture dishes (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7, NHE5 activity was completely abolished over the pHirange studied (pH 5.8 and 7.4). Recent studies by us (28.Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabó E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G.

We have investigated the effects of γ-irradiation on cellular levels of the Ku autoantigens. Ku70 and Ku80 have been shown to form a heterodimeric complex that can bind tightly to free DNA ends and activate the protein kinase DNA-PKcs. We have found that irradiation results in an up-regulation of cellular levels of Ku70, but not Ku80, and that this enhanced level of Ku70 accumulates within the nucleus. Further, we uncovered that the postirradiation up-regulation of Ku70 utilizes a mechanism that is dependent on both p53 and damage response protein kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated); however, the activation of DNA-PK does not require Ku70 up-regulation. These findings suggest that Ku70 up-regulation provides the cell with a means of assuring either proper DNA repair or an appropriate response to DNA damage independent of DNA-PKcs activation.

Such genotoxic events activate a number of signaling pathways that serve, for example, to activate DNA repair mechanisms, halt cell cycle progression, and/or trigger advancement into apoptosis. These damage response pathways exist to facilitate genome repair and limit the accumulation of heritable genetic errors. Not surprisingly, a wide range of tumor cells has been shown to be defective in one or more of the elements that comprise these genome damage response pathways (see Ref. 1.Smith M.L. Fornace A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that such responses play a key role in limiting tumor cell formation. A central figure in many damage response pathways is the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 is a transcription factor that, when active, serves to up-regulate the cellular abundance of a cadre of molecules important in genotoxic response. Such p53-inducible proteins include p21 WAF-1/CIP-1, bax, mdm2, gadd45, and KILLER/DR5, which perform a variety of functions in response to DNA damage such as halting cell growth and/or propelling cells into apoptosis (2.el-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) Thus, p53 performs a pivotal role in choreographing appropriate cellular response to genome damaging events. Other proteins responsible for an appropriate and timely response to IR-induced genome damage are members of a protein kinase family which share homology to the lipid kinase phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (3.Zakian V.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 685-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar,4.Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Spring K. Watters D. Shiloh Y. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 382-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ATM, the protein mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is an important member of this kinase family. Cells from A-T patients are radiosensitive and have been shown to be deficient in a number of signaling events that normally occur following DSB formation (see Ref. 5.Brown K.D. Barlow C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 46-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For example, A-T cells display faulty cell cycle checkpoint function in response to IR exposure (6.Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1981; 84: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7.Beamish H.

Recent work has shown that ATM directly phosphorylates p53 in response to γ-irradiation (10.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 11.Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). The lack of ATM-mediated irradiation-induced phosphorylation of p53 is likely to be directly responsible for the blunted up-regulation of p21 WAF-1/CIP-1 in A-T cells resulting in their G1/S cell cycle checkpoint defect (12.Dulic V.

Genet. 1997; 17: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, A-T cells are also defective in several apparent p53-independent responses such as the activation of c-Abl (15.Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of the p34 subunit of replication protein A (16.Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Another member of the ATM family of protein kinases which plays an important role in genome damage response is the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). Deficiencies in DNA-PKcs activity are responsible for the lack of appropriate response to DSBs observed in the radiosensitive mammalian xrs-6 cell line (17.Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and scid (severe combined immunodeficiency) mouse strain (18.Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E. Smith G.C.M. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T.M. Mizuta R. Varghese A.J. Alt F.W. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P.

The mutant phenotypes displayed by these lines and mice indicate that loss of DNA-PKcs catalytic activity results in defective DSB rejoining and the inability to facilitate V(D)J recombination. The functional contribution of DNA-PKcs-dependent phosphorylation to DSB responses is currently unclear; however, recent studies have shown that DNA-PK, unlike ATM, is not involved in the activation of irradiation-induced cell cycle checkpoints (20.Burma S. Kurimasa A. Xie G. Taya Y. Araki R. Abe M. Crissman H.A. Ouyang H. Li G.C. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

Appella E. Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G. Wahl G.M. Hubank M. Nature. 1999; 400: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The DNA-PK holoenzyme consists of three subunits: a ∼450-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a heterodimeric complex composed of the proteins Ku70 (70 kDa) and Ku80 (86 kDa). The Ku proteins were originally identified as autoantigens in patients with autoimmune disorders (22.Reeves W.H. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North. Am. 1992; 18: 391-414PubMed Google Scholar) and were found to bind tightly to linear duplex DNA (23.Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2274-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the generation of DSBs by either exogenous forces (e.g. γ-irradiation) or intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., during V(D)J recombination) the Ku70-Ku80 complex binds to free DNA ends and subsequently recruits and activates DNA-PKcs at the site of DSBs (24.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In this manuscript we report that cellular levels of Ku70, but not Ku80, increase multifold within the nucleus of irradiated cells. Up-regulation of Ku70 following IR requires both functional p53 and ATM. Furthermore, we report that up-regulation of Ku70 is not required for appropriate activation of DNA-PK activity following genome damage. These results indicate that, in addition to its characterized function in activating DNA-PK, Ku70 plays yet another role(s) in DNA damage response. Normal diploid human lung fibroblast line MRC-5 was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection. Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Human lung carcinoma line H1299 and its derivative temperature-sensitive line H1299-Val-138 (25.Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Wenge L. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15271-15277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C as were fibroblasts cultured fromc-abl−/− mice. Where indicated, H1299-Val-138 cells were shifted to an incubator maintained at 32 °C for 6 h prior to irradiation. Normal (GM0536A and B-310) and A-T lymphoblast (GM01525E and IARC12/AT3) lines were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. GM0536A and GM01525E lines were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). All cell lines were grown in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were exposed to 10 Gy of IR from a 137Cs source (Gammacell 1000, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.; dose rate, 318 rad/min). Following irradiation, cells were returned to the incubator and harvested at the indicated time points. The Ku70 mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-5, Ku80 monoclonal antibody Ab-2, and DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibody Ab-2 were purchased from Lab Vision Corporation (Fremont, CA). The anti-p53 antibody DO-1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody DM1A was a generous gift from Dr. D. W. Cleveland (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA). At the indicated time points, cells were harvested with trypsin, washed three times with cold (4 °C) PBS, and lysed by the addition of SDS-solubilization buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Lysates were then boiled for 5 min, sonicated briefly, centrifuged (5 min/14,000 rpm), and the supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Prior to electrophoresis, appropriate volumes of cell lysates were diluted in 3 × SDS-sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 3% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% pyronin-Y) and boiled for 2 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransfer of the gels to nitrocellulose sheets, and antibody labeling were conducted as outlined (26.Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadandanan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Supersignal CR-HRP (Pierce) chemiluminescent substrate and recorded on Kodak XAR film. Quantitation of immunoblot signals was performed using an Agfa SnapScan flatbed scanner and the NIH Image (version 1.62) software package using the integrated density function. In all cases, protein loadings and antibody dilutions were adjusted to assure that immunoblotting was conducted at subsaturating conditions. Kinase reactions were performed using an adaptation of the DNA-PKcs immunoprecipitation-based protocol of Kurimasa et al. (27.Kurimasa A. Kumano S. Boubnov N.V. Story M.D. Tung C.S. Peterson S.R. Chen D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3877-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were irradiated with 10 Gy of γ-radiation and collected at indicated time points. The cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 × lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NAF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin-A)). After adjusting the lysate concentration for equal protein content, DNA-PKcs antibody was added to the lysate at a concentration of 5.0 μg/mg lysate and incubated for 2 h on ice. After this step, 15 μl of a 50% slurry (in PBS) of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 500 mmNaCl and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were then suspended in a minimal volume of kinase buffer and used in kinase reactions. Kinase reactions were carried out in a final reaction volume of 35 μl. To the slurry of beads containing immunoprecipitated DNA-PKcs, 1 μg of bacterially synthesized, purified recombinant GST-p53 fusion protein, 5 μm cold ATP, 30 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol, ICN) and 500 ng of sonicated salmon sperm DNA were added. This reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of 3 × SDS-sample buffer followed by immersion in a boiling water bath. The reaction products were resolved on 8% acrylamide gels and electrically transferred onto Immobilon-P sheets (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. Quantitation was done using a Bio-Rad laser densitometer (GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer). Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (26.Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadandanan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 irradiated (10 Gy) and nonirradiated MRC-5 fibroblasts were harvested by scraping and rinsed twice in-cold PBS. The cells were then swollen in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.1, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5.0 μg/ml pepstain-A, 2.0 μg/ml chymostain, 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 5.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.0 μg/ml antipain)) for 10 min on ice. The cells were then lysed by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle and the nuclei cleared by centrifugation (400 ×g, 10 min). Following this step, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a Centricon microconcentrator (Amicon), concentrated approximately 5-fold, and subsequently stored at −80 °C. The nuclei were washed three times in lysis buffer and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was conducted as outlined previously (26.Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadandanan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). MRC-5 fibroblasts were cultured on sterilized glass coverslips to ∼75% confluence prior to irradiation. Postirradiation the cells were fixed by immersion in PBS containing 3.0% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, after which the cells were permeabilized by immersion in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following this step the coverslips were rinsed in PBS and blocked by immersion in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Immunofluorescent staining was done using anti-Ku70 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were counterstained with Hoescht 33258 (0.1 μg/ml final concentration) to reveal DNA. Images were captured on 35-mm film (Kodak T-Max 400) using a Nikon microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. In our efforts to define signal transduction pathways that are activated following genotoxic events we have investigated the fluctuation of the Ku70 and Ku80 autoantigens following IR exposure. The Ku70-Ku80 complex is responsible for the activation of DNA-PKcs in part because of its intrinsic property of binding to free DNA ends with high affinity. Hence, it is conceivable that the cellular levels of Ku70 and/or Ku80 could be influenced positively in response to the introduction of DSBs into the genome. An initial report on this subject (28.Kumaravel T.S. Bharthy K. Kudoh S. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicated that in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and a leukemia tumor cell line exposure to γ-irradiation resulted in an apparent 3–4-fold rise in Ku70. To confirm that Ku70 levels are altered in response to IR exposure we subjected normal human diploid lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) to analysis following γ-irradiation. 2 h following 10 Gy of IR we measured an approximate 3-fold rise in Ku70 (mean = 2.7 ± 0.5 S.D., n = 5) over the levels present in nonirradiated cells (Fig. 1 a). This quantitative increase in Ku70 was observed 30 min after irradiation and persisted during the analyzed 2-h time frame. We have examined MRC-5 cells 6 h postirradiation and observed no further significant Ku70 accumulation than what was noted 2 h after IR exposure (data not shown). We noted a slight increase in cellular levels of the Ku80 protein after IR exposure (Fig. 1 b); however, this increase was significantly blunt compared with the observed rise in Ku70 during the same time period. As expected, we noted a 5–7-fold rise in p53 following IR exposure during this period (Fig. 1 c). An immunoblot run in parallel and probed with anti-tubulin confirmed equivalent protein loadings (Fig.1 d). p53 is responsible for the up-regulation of a number of proteins in response to genotoxic events (2.el-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). To determine if Ku70 up-regulation observed in normal human fibroblasts is a p53-dependent event, we measured Ku70 accumulation in irradiated H1299 cells, a p53-null human lung carcinoma cell line (29.Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar). Irradiation of these cells with 10 Gy of IR resulted in no significant increase in cellular levels of Ku70 at 2 h (1.1-fold rise ± 0.15, n = 7) (Fig.2 a). To confirm that loss of functional p53 in H1299 cells was the underlying cause of loss of irradiation-dependent Ku70 increase we employed a derivative cell line that expresses a conditionally functional form of p53. This cell line, termed H1299-Val-138, is engineered to express ectopically a human p53 molecule that contains an alanine to valine mutation at codon 138 (25.Pochampally R. Fodera B. Chen L. Wenge L. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15271-15277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This change renders the molecule temperature-sensitive, similar to an equivalent alanine to valine mutation at codon 135 in murine p53 (30.Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). When H1299-Val-138 cells were cultured for 6 h at the permissive temperature (32 °C) and then irradiated with 10 Gy of IR these cells showed, 2 h after irradiation, an approximate 2-fold up-regulation of cellular Ku70 levels (1.9 ± 0.5, n = 8) (Fig.2 b). Conversely, when irradiated H1299-Val-138 cells were maintained at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) there was no observed increase in Ku70 levels at the same time point (1.0 ± 0.4 h, n = 8) (Fig. 2 c). Taken together, these findings validate that the postirradiation rise in Ku70 is dependent on p53. ATM has been shown to phosphorylate p53 in response to IR exposure (10.Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar,11.Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A.

Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar) and is required for the p53-dependent rise in several proteins following DSB formation (see Refs. 5.Brown K.D. Barlow C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 46-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 31.Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1555-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To determine if p53-dependent up-regulation of Ku70 levels requires ATM function we subjected normal human and A-T patient lymphoblasts to 10 Gy of γ-irradiation. (Lymphoblasts are Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized peripheral blood lymphocytes and have been shown to possess intact p53-dependent responses (7.Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20486-20493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13.Canman C.E. Wolff A.C. Chen C.-Y. Fornace A.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5054-5058PubMed Google Scholar).) Consistent with the observations of Kumaravel et al. (28.Kumaravel T.S. Bharthy K. Kudoh S. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) we observed an approximate 2-fold increase in Ku70 in normal lymphoblasts 2 h after IR exposure (2.1 ± 0.6, n = 5) (Fig.3 a). However, we observed no postirradiation increase in Ku70 in either the A-T lymphoblast lines IARC12/AT3 (1.0 ± 0.26, n = 5) or GM01525E (1.0 ± 0.39, n = 8) (Fig. 3, b andc) 2 h after IR exposure. Further, two additional A-T lymphoblast lines displayed parallel results (data not shown). These observations indicate that in addition to p53, ATM is required for the up-regulation of Ku70 after irradiation. Previous work has shown that Ku70 and Ku80 play an essential role in activating DNA-PKcs (24.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined if the observed rapid up-regulation of Ku70 levels was required for timely activation of DNA-PKcs after IR exposure. To address this issue we irradiated H1299-Val-138 cells cultured at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperature with 10 Gy of IR and subsequently measured DNA-PKcs activity by employing an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GST-p53 as a substrate (p53 has been shown to be anin vitro substrate for DNA-PKcs catalytic activity (32.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar)). At the permissive temperature (active p53) we observed a 4-fold rise in DNA-PK-associated p53 phosphorylation after γ-irradiation (Fig.4 a). Equivalent results were observed in extracts of irradiated H1299-Val-138 cells cultured at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 4 b). Immunoblots with anti-DNA-PKcs confirmed the presence of equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated DNA-PKcs in each of the kinase assays. Further, we observed normal activation of DNA-PK activity in irradiated A-T lymphoblastoid cells (data not shown). These findings clearly indicate that the irradiation-induced rise in Ku70 is not required for DNA-PK activation. We examined the localization of Ku70 in irradiated cells. MRC-5 cells were exposed to γ-irradiation (10 Gy), and 2 h and 18 h postirradiation these cells and nonirradiated controls were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy. Contrary to the findings of Kumaravel et al. (28.Kumaravel T.S. Bharthy K. Kudoh S. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) who observed Ku70 accumulation within the cytoplasm 18 h postirradiation, we found Ku70 localized exclusively within the nucleus in both nonirradiated cells and irradiated cells (Fig. 5 a). Negligible cytoplasmic staining was observed. To confirm these findings independently, we subjected irradiated and nonirradiated MRC-5 cells to subcellular fractionation (Fig.5 b). Analysis of nuclear fractions by immunoblotting showed a significant elevation of Ku70 within the nuclear fraction of irradiated cells compared with nonirradiated controls, consistent with the immunofluorescence studies. Ku70 was not detected in the cytoplasmic fractions obtained from either irradiated or nonirradiated fibroblasts. α-Tubulin (a cytoplasmic protein) was detected predominantly in the cytoplasmic fractions, indicating that lysis was virtually complete. We are unsure why our results differ from the observations of Kumaravel et al. (28.Kumaravel T.S. Bharthy K. Kudoh S. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, others have noted a difference in Ku70 localization in lymphoid and fibroblast type cells (33.Grandvaux N. Grizot S. Vignais P.V. Dagher M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 503-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data indicate that this protein accumulates exclusively within the nucleus in irradiated fibroblasts. The evidence presented in this study indicates that ionizing radiation results in increased cellular levels of Ku70, a finding that is in agreement with a previously published report (28.Kumaravel T.S. Bharthy K. Kudoh S. Tanaka K. Kamada N. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using lymphoid cells, Kumaravel and co-workers noted a 3–4-fold increase in Ku70 2 h postirradiation (earlier time points were not assayed), and this elevated level persisted for 72 h. We have extended this work by demonstrating that in both human fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, Ku70 undergoes a similar (2–3-fold) rise rapidly (within 30 min) after irradiation and that this phenomenon requires both functional ATM and p53. Additionally, we have found that Ku70 levels rise in irradiated normal and c-abl−/− mouse fibroblasts, 2S. Shangary and R. Baskaran, unpublished results. indicating that the up-regulation of Ku70 is independent of c-Abl activity and IR-induced Ku70 up-regulation is a feature common to many, if not all, normal cell types. Our observation that the up-regulation of Ku70 requires both functional ATM and p53 leads us to propose the following signal cascade: DSB > ATM > p53 > Ku70. The involvement of p53 in postirradiation Ku70 up-regulation suggests that this phenomenon is caused by increased p53-mediated transcription of the Ku70 gene. However, preliminary evidence failed to detect a rise in Ku70 mRNA 2 h after γ-irradiation as judged by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Thus, at this time, we are unsure of the nature of the molecular mechanism that gives rise to the observed increase in Ku70 levels. Although we documented the multifold up-regulation of Ku70 after irradiation, we noted no similar rise in its heterodimeric binding partner Ku80, a finding that is in agreement with other reports (34.Myung K. Braastad C. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7664-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the postirradiation rise in Ku70 does not result in higher cellular concentrations of the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer. Interestingly, a splice variant of the Ku80 protein termed KARP-1 (35.Myung K. He D.M. Lee S.E Hendrickson E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 18: 3172-3184Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has been also shown to be up-regulated following IR exposure in an ATM/p53-dependent manner (34.Myung K. Braastad C. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7664-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Like the Ku70-Ku80 complex, several lines of evidence indicate that KARP-1 is involved in modulating DNA-PK activity (35.Myung K. He D.M. Lee S.E Hendrickson E.A. EMBO J. 1997; 18: 3172-3184Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that KARP-1 and Ku70 may form a complex after DNA damage because such events lead to increased abundance of both molecules. Diminution of DNA-PK activity has been shown to be responsible for thescid defect in mice (18.Blunt T. Finnie N.J. Taccioli G.E. Smith G.C.M. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T.M. Mizuta R"
https://openalex.org/W2045558559,"The effect of age on the incorporation of newly synthesized aggrecan into the extracellular matrix of human articular cartilage was investigated. This property was measured in a pulse-chase explant culture system by determining the distribution of radiolabeled molecules ([35S]sulfate-labeled) between a nondissociating extract (phosphate-buffered saline), which extracts mainly nonaggregated macromolecules, and a dissociating extract (4m GnHCl) containing mainly aggrecan that was complexedin situ with hyaluronan. The rate of incorporation of aggrecan into aggregates was much slower in mature cartilage than in tissue obtained from younger individuals. Furthermore, autoradiography showed that in mature cartilage, newly synthesized aggrecan is not transported from the pericellular environment within the first 18 h of chase culture, whereas in immature cartilage, it moves into the intercellular space during the same period, i.e. aggrecan is processed in the extracellular space very differently in young and adult articular cartilage. Experiments were also performed to show that the interaction of link protein with newly synthesized aggrecan depends on the maturity of the G1 domain of aggrecan. This investigation has shown that the extracellular aggregation of aggrecan in adult human articular cartilage involves a number of intermediate structures.

These have not been identified in the very young cartilage obtained from laboratory animals or in porcine and bovine articular cartilage obtained from the abattoir. phosphate-buffered saline Aggrecan is one of the major macromolecules in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage and endows the tissue with its characteristic water imbibing properties and its ability to undergo reversible compression. During normal aging of cartilage, aggrecan undergoes many posttranslational modifications to its protein core and to the number, size, and proportion of the chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains that are covalently associated with it (1.Bayliss M.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These events are mostly catabolic in nature and are a consequence of the relatively long resident time of aggrecan in the matrix (2.Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-Kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 61-71Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that a number of these age-related changes could only have come about by an altered anabolic response of the chondrocyte (3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A recent publication (3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) has emphasized that the rate of aggrecan synthesis (sulfate incorporation) is dependent on the age of the specimen from which the tissue was obtained. However, the ability of the chondrocyte to make this molecule is only one part of the maintenance process; it also has to be assembled into aggregates in the extracellular matrix. This process involves the interaction of aggrecan with link protein(s) and hyaluronan, which are themselves under their own biosynthetic control, and the complex must then be deposited within the correct compartment of the tissue (4.Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4920-4930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, extracellular assembly must be a rate-limiting step in the formation of a stable matrix. The speed at which aggregation happens is important for normal tissue homeostasis, but it would be particularly important during any pathological process when the chondrocyte attempts to repair a defective extracellular matrix. The study by Oegema (5.Oegema T.R. Nature. 1980; 288: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was the first to indicate that aggrecan was not immediately incorporated into aggregates when it was exported from the cell. Subsequent studies also showed that the disulfide bonds present in the G1 domain of aggrecan required time to mature and that aggrecan is only slowly converted from a form that has a low affinity for hyaluronan to one with a higher affinity (6.Bayliss M.T. Ridgway G.D. Ali S.Y. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7.Bayliss M.T. Ridgway G.D. Ali S.Y. Biosci.

Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 300-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The latter investigations also showed that the presence or absence of link protein influenced the rate of incorporation of aggrecan into aggregates. Moreover, a study of “delayed aggregation” in rabbit articular cartilage showed that it also operates in vivo and that the phenomenon is age-dependent (13.Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A more recent study demonstrated that the extent of tissue compression, with the concomitant changes in proteoglycan concentration and pH of the extracellular matrix, could influence the hyaluronan binding properties of aggrecan in bovine cartilage explants (14.Sah R.L. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Sandy J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This lead the authors to suggest that such a pH mechanism may have a physiological role, promoting proteoglycan deposition in regions of low proteoglycan concentration. Thus, at least one biological mechanism is active in articular cartilage that has the ability to control the rate of aggrecan assembly. There have been no direct measurements of the rate of aggregation of aggrecan in articular cartilage and no investigations of how normal aging affects the process. The experiments presented here support a hypothesis in which the age of the individual is a very important factor in controlling the rate and extent of aggregation in human articular cartilage. Intact knee joints were obtained from amputations or massive replacements at operations for bone tumors not involving the joint space. Fresh specimens (within 1 h of operation) were dissected using sterile techniques, and full-thickness cartilage was removed from all of the femoral condyle and diced into 1–2 mm2 pieces. The tissue was thoroughly mixed to ensure that representative samples could be taken. The exact conditions for explant culture depended on the analysis that was required. The rate of proteoglycan synthesis was determined, by measuring the incorporation radioisotope into articular cartilage; triplicate aliquots (∼50 mg) of tissue were incubated for 4 h in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi of [35S]sulfate, which labeled glycosaminoglycan chains associated with aggrecan. A quantitative measure of aggrecan biosynthesis was calculated as nmol/h/g of wet weight of cartilage, as described by Bayliss et al. (3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When pulse-chase experiments were carried out in order to determine the rate of aggregation, glycosaminoglycan chains associated with aggrecan were radiolabeled by incubating the tissue for 1 or 4 h in Ham's F-12 culture medium containing 150 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate,i.e. in culture medium containing 15–30 μm[SO42–]. This produced a pool of newly synthesized aggrecan, in situ, that was of a high specific activity. After storing an aliquot (∼200 mg) at −20 °C, the remainder of the cartilage was incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, i.e. in culture medium containing 800 μm [SO42–]. After various periods of time in chase culture, cartilage was removed and stored at –20 °C until it was required. When long term, 4-h pulse-chase experiments were performed, the chase culture medium was also retained and stored at −20 °C. Preliminary experiments compared the structure of aggrecan synthesized by cartilage cultured in Ham's F-12 medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (results not shown). No differences in the hydrodynamic size or the electrophoretic profile of aggrecan or in the Δdi6S:Δdi4S ratio of the chondroitin sulfate chains were observed during the short culture period used. Cartilage samples were sectioned at 20 μm in order to overcome any barrier to diffusion and to ensure complete extraction of the aggregate components, before extracting them with PBS1 (4 ml) overnight at 4 °C. The tissue sections were filtered through glass wool and then extracted for a further 24 h at 4 °C with 4 m GnHCl (4 ml). Both extracts were stored at −20 °C until they were analyzed, and the cartilage residue was washed with PBS and dispersed by digesting it with papain. The distribution of radiolabel ([35S]sulfate) in each extraction solution and in the papain digests was measured by scintillation counting. The proportion of radiolabeled macromolecules released into the culture medium of the long term chase cultures was determined by measuring the [35S]sulfate excluded from PD10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All extraction buffers contained proteinase inhibitors (7.Bayliss M.T. Ridgway G.D. Ali S.Y. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Size exclusion gel chromatography was performed on a column (150 × 0.65 cm) of Sepharose CL2B. Cartilage extracts (1 ml) were eluted either with 0.5 msodium acetate, pH 7.4, or with 2 m GnHCl buffered with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.4. Fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting and for their uronic acid content (15.Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Agarose/polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described in Refs. 16.Carney S.L. Billingham M.E.J. Caterson B. Ratcliffe A. Bayliss M.T. Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. The gels were used to assess the aggregating properties of newly synthesized aggrecan, in which case the gel and the sample were equilibrated in 0.01m Tris acetate, pH 7.4 (associating conditions). When it was necessary to assess the electrophoretic profile of aggrecan itself, the gels were equilibrated in 4 m urea, and the samples were buffer-exchanged into 7 m urea (dissociating conditions). Endogenous proteoglycans (3 μg of uronic acid/well) were detected by staining the gel with toluidine blue, and radioactive bands were visualized by drying the stained gel on Gel Bond and subjecting it to autoradiography using Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat film. The electrophoretic conditions used were those described by Baylisset al. (3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The distribution of [35S]sulfate within the tissue was determined by autoradiography of immature and mature cartilage that had been subjected to the 4-h pulse and 18-h chase protocol described above. After culture, tissue samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) formaldehyde/saline and embedded in wax before cutting 7-μm histological sections and collecting them on glass slides. Slides were coated with Kodak K5 silver emulsion and stored in the dark for 4 weeks. The slides were then developed and mounted and the distribution of silver grains visualized by light microscopy using a Leitz microscope. Less than 1% of the incorporated [35S]sulfate was released into the culture medium during the period of incubation. Although no analysis was made of the tissues after fixation, embedding, and sectioning, cetylpyridinium chloride was included in the fixative to prevent leaching of the proteoglycans during processing (17.Buschmann M.D. Maurer A.M. Berger E. Hunziker E.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan oligosaccharides were prepared by digesting a solution (1 mg/ml) of human umbilical cord hyaluronan (Sigma) with ovine testicular hyaluronidase (Worthington Chemicals, London) at a concentration of 400 units/mg in 0.2 m sodium acetate containing 0.1m NaCl at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling the digest for 5 min, and the resultant precipitate was isolated by centrifugation. The supernatant, containing hyaluronan digestion products, was tested for its ability to compete with full-length hyaluronan chains for the binding of porcine aggrecan. Porcine aggrecan (1 mg/ml A1D1) was mixed with 5% (w/w) hyaluronan overnight at 4 °C, and the extent of aggregation was assessed by gel exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL2B (results not shown). A 10-fold excess of the hyaluronidase supernatant, relative to the full-length hyaluronan concentration, was added to the mixture of hyaluronan and porcine A1D1. This procedure inhibited the formation of aggregates and disrupted preformed complexes formed between aggrecan and hyaluronan (results not shown). Link protein was prepared from a porcine aggregate (A1) preparation as described in Refs. 18.Bonnet F. Dunham D.G. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and19.Dudhia J. Davidson C.M. Wells T.M. Vynios D.H. Hardingham T.E. Bayliss M.T. Biochem.

Preliminary experiments compared the size exclusion profiles of 35S-labeled aggrecan, in direct 4 mGnHCl extracts of immature and mature human articular cartilage. Fig.1 shows that although the endogenous aggrecan (uronic acid profile) is reduced in molecular size during aging and that there is an increase in molecular heterogeneity, the newly synthesized aggrecan (35S-labeled) has the sameK av in immature and mature cartilage. Electrophoresis in agarose/polyacrylamide gels emphasized this age-related change in aggrecan structure. The relationship between the three molecular species identified in adult cartilage extracts was investigated by radiolabeling aggrecan during a 4-h pulse with [35S]sulfate and then chasing the culture in nonradioactive medium for 14 days. After electrophoresis of the 4m GnHCl extracts in dissociative (8 m urea) composite gels, a comparison of the toluidine blue stained gel indicated the presence of three aggrecan bands in the pulse and the chase explants; these appeared to be of equal intensity, although no quantitative analysis was carried out (Fig.2 a). Fluorography indicated that most of the newly synthesized aggrecan was associated with the slower migrating, higher molecular weight species, identified by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 2 b). However, a small proportion of the 35S-labeled aggrecan was also associated with the faster migrating bands, even in the extract of cartilage that had only been pulse-labeled for 4 h.Figure 2Radiolabeled ([35S]sulfate) explants of human articular cartilage (55 years) were extracted with 4m GnHCl, and the extracts were subjected to electrophoresis in agarose/polyacrylamide gels that had been equilibrated in 8m urea (dissociative). After electrophoresis, the endogenous aggrecan (3 μg uronic acid/well) in the extracts was visualized by staining the gel with toluidine blue (a). The gel was then dried on Gel Bond and subjected to autoradiography (b). Radiolabeled aggrecan was visualized using X-Omat film. The arrows mark the position of the slowest migrating band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine whether there were any age-related differences in the extracellular assembly of aggrecan, cartilage explants were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [35S]sulfate, and a portion of the tissue was stored at −20 °C. The remainder of the cartilage was cultured (chased) for up to 7 h in nonradioactive medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), and samples of cartilage were removed every hour and stored at −20 °C before processing them. In some cases, cartilage explants were chased for 48 h before terminating the cultures. All cartilage samples were cryosectioned at 20 μm prior to extraction with PBS (this extracts aggrecan that is presumed not to be complexed with hyaluronan) and then with 4 m GnHCl (this procedure removes aggrecan presumed to be complexed with hyaluronan). Fig. 3, a–i, shows that in immature cartilage, newly synthesized aggrecan is rapidly incorporated into the 4 m GnHCl-extractable pool and that with increasing age, the [35S]sulfate-labeled aggrecan is retained for a longer period of time as PBS-extractable molecules. The slower rate of incorporation of aggrecan into aggregate complexes in adult cartilage meant that it was necessary to perform additional experiments in order to fully assess this process. Explants were, therefore, radiolabeled for 4 h before subjecting them to chase culture for up to 15 days. Once again, in immature cartilage, aggrecan was incorporated relatively rapidly into the 4m GnHCl extract (results not shown). However, in adult cartilage, incorporation was relatively slow, and only 48% of the [35S]sulfated aggrecan was extracted from the tissue with 4 m GnHCl after 3 days in culture; even after 14 days, only 55% was removed by this extracting solution. Furthermore, only 20% was released into the culture medium after 14 days (Fig.3 j). The quantitative results described above suggested that the rate of incorporation of aggrecan into aggregates was much slower in adult cartilage. In order to determine whether this meant that the newly synthesized molecules were present in different compartments of the tissue at these times, the distribution of radiolabeled aggrecan was visualized in situ by autoradiography, after a 4-h pulse and 4-h pulse-18-h chase culture of cartilage explants. After radiolabeling with [35S]sulfate for 4 h, proteoglycans were confined to the pericellular compartment of both immature and mature chondrocytes. By the end of the 18-h chase period, however, most of the labeled aggrecan was localized in the intercellular matrix of immature cartilage. In marked contrast, the majority of newly synthesized molecules remained in the pericellular compartment of adult tissue during the first 18 h of chase culture (Fig.4). The organization of aggrecan in situ was investigated further by studying the structure of the molecules extracted from the tissue. This was initially carried out using size exclusion chromatography. Fig.5 illustrates the Sepharose CL2B profiles of extracts from a 9-year-old's and a 65-year-old's specimen of human articular cartilage. When the nondissociative (PBS) and dissociative (4m GnHCl) extracts were combined in 4 m GnHCl in the relevant proportions (v/v) and then dialyzed to remove the guanidinium hydrochloride, 66% of the newly synthesized aggrecan extracted from the 9-year-old's cartilage (1 h pulse) was excluded from the column, indicating that this proportion of the extract could form aggregates. This value did not change during the subsequent 24-h chase period. In marked contrast, only 31% of the combined extracts from the 65-year-old's cartilage (4-h pulse) was excluded from Sepharose CL2B, and this proportion continued to increase during the following 3 days of chase culture, up to a value of 63%,i.e. aggrecan from adult cartilage exhibited “delayed aggregation.” The percentage of uronic acid (as a measure of the endogenous molecules) (Fig. 5, Vo) was unchanged during the culture of both immature and mature tissue and remained at approximately 65% (results not shown). Although 63% of the radiolabeled aggrecan could be extracted from immature cartilage with PBS (2 years; Fig. 3), the majority of newly synthesized aggrecan in this extract (62%) was recovered in the void volume of the column as aggregate (Fig.6). However, nearly all of the35S-labeled aggrecan in the PBS extract of adult cartilage (80 years) eluted in the included fractions of the column and this proportion changed very little during the subsequent 10 days of chase culture (Fig. 7). It should also be noted that the aggregation of the porcine aggrecan, added to these cultures to ensure that the conditions for assembly were kept constant, was not affected by the chase conditions, and approximately 70% of the uronic acid was eluted from the Sepharose CL2B column in each case.Figure 7The PBS extracts of radiolabeled pulse and pulse-chase explants from an 80-year-old individual were subjected to size exclusion gel chromatography in order to assess the aggregating potential of the [35S]sulfate-labeled aggrecan in each extract. The extracts from the 4-h pulse and the 1-day and 10-day chase explants were mixed with 1, 2, 3, or 4% (w/w) hyaluronan (based on the uronic acid content of the extracts). Fractions (1 ml) were analyzed for their content of [35S]sulfate by scintillation counting, and the percentage excluded from the column was calculated. The dashed line shows the uronic acid profiles, in the presence of 1% hyaluronan, for the carrier aggrecan (A1D1) derived from porcine laryngeal cartilage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Addition of exogenous hyaluronan (up to 4% (w/w) of the uronic acid content of the extract) to the PBS extracts of adult cartilage demonstrated that the aggrecan in these extracts exhibited the classical signs of delayed aggregation; they slowly acquired the ability to interact with lower concentrations of hyaluronan (Fig. 7). However, even when aggrecan was deemed to have undergone the structural changes necessary for conversion of a low affinity to a high affinity form, it was still possible to extract it in a nonaggregated form with PBS. Furthermore, a large proportion of the complex that formed with hyaluronan was open to competition with high concentrations of oligosaccharides of hyaluronan, i.e. the aggrecan that is extracted with PBS at all culture times does not form link-stabilized complexes with any endogenous link protein in the extract when it is mixed with hyaluronan (results not shown). This contrasts with the investigations of the aggregating properties of radiolabeled aggrecan in the PBS extracts of immature cartilage, which were excluded from Sepharose CL2B columns, and this profile was unchanged in the presence of oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (results not shown). It was considered possible that the concentration of link protein may have been a rate-limiting factor in the formation of aggregates. Therefore, experiments were carried out to determine whether the addition of exogenous link protein could influence the aggregation of adult aggrecan. Fig. 8 shows that most of the newly synthesized aggrecan extracted with PBS from this adult specimen, after a 4-h pulse and also after 3 days in chase culture, was not aggregated. Addition of hyaluronan induced the formation of aggregates, and the phenomenon of delayed aggregation was again observed. The addition of link protein to the mixture caused more of the newly synthesized aggrecan in the PBS extract of the pulse culture to complex with hyaluronan, but these complexes were not stable and could be dissociated by the addition of oligosaccharides of hyaluronan. Addition of link protein had little effect on the extent of aggregation of the chase cultures. The complexity of the aggregation process illustrated by the Sepharose CL2B studies indicated that there was a need to confirm the findings using another method of investigation. Thus, the acquisition of aggregating potential and stability and the role of link protein on this process was also investigated using composite gel electrophoresis. The PBS and 4 m GnHCl extracts from a 14-year-old's and a 47-year-old's specimen were combined as described above and after electrophoresis in associative (Tris-buffered) composite gels, the extent of aggregation of the newly synthesized aggrecan was assessed by fluorography. Fig.9 a shows that although most of the newly synthesized aggrecan in the 4-h pulse extract of the 14-year-old's specimen electrophoresed within the gel, a small amount was retarded as higher molecular weight material. Although this higher molecular weight complex persisted in the extracts of immature cartilage explants that were chased for 1, 2, 3 days, most of the35S-labeled aggrecan was recovered as very high molecular weight complexes that did not enter the gel. Furthermore, although some aggrecan was dissociated from the high molecular weight complexes by oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (Fig. 9 b), the presence of exogenous link protein stabilized these to the electrophoretic field so that they did not then enter the gel (Fig. 9 c). In marked contrast, almost all of the radiolabeled aggrecan in the 4-h pulse extract of adult cartilage migrated within the composite gel, indicating that it could not interact with hyaluronan (Fig.9 d). During chase culture, some of the aggrecan was retarded within the gel, migrating as higher molecular weight complexes, but no radiolabeled aggrecan was completely excluded from the gel. All of the aggregates formed by aggrecan in the extracts of chase explants of mature cartilage were unstable in the presence of oligosaccharides of hyaluronan, whereas, when link protein was included, labeled aggrecan in both the 4-h pulse and the 1-, 2-, and 3-day chase extracts formed very high molecular weight complexes at both ages studied (Fig. 9,e and f). These experiments highlighted the different results that can be obtained using an alternative technique to study the same process. For example, [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan from the 9-year-old's specimen of cartilage (Fig. 5) was fully aggregated in the pulse extract, whereas the 14-year-old's extract, analyzed by gel electrophoresis, had a mobility consistent with nonaggregated aggrecan. This was partly because of the methodology used, because when the 9-year-old's extract was electrophoresed in composite gels, it also appeared to contain 50% aggrecan (results not shown). The instability of aggregates in an electrophoretic field was also highlighted by the results shown by Fig. 9 d: a faster migrating, diffuse molecular species was present in the chase cultures, and this could not be identified using gel chromatography. Thus, both methods (size exclusion chromatography and gel electrophoresis) are effective in describing the changes that take place under the different experimental conditions applied, but interpretation of the data depends on having a detailed knowledge of the molecules under investigation. The endogenous aggrecan present in these extracts was also investigated by staining the gels with toluidine blue before subjecting them to autoradiography (results not shown). The electrophoretic pattern of these molecules showed that even in the pulse extracts, most of them were high molecular weight and therefore did not enter the composite gel and that this pattern did not change during the subsequent chase culture. However, treatment of the extracts of cartilage with either oligosaccharides of hyaluronan or link protein gave very similar patterns of toluidine blue staining to that observed for the newly synthesized aggrecan. It should be noted that both the endogenous and the newly synthesized aggregates from the mature cartilage were more unstable in the electrophoretic field than those extracted from immature cartilage. Experiments were carried out to compare the extent of aggregation of aggrecan synthesized by cartilage explants taken from a normal knee joint (84 years) and from two osteoarthritic specimens (70 and 76 years). After pulse-labeling the cartilage explants with [35S]sulfate for 4 h, they were extracted directly with 4 m GnHCl, and after dialysis to promote the re-formation of aggregates, the extracts were eluted from a column of Sepharose CL2B. Considerably more of the radiolabeled aggrecan extracted from the osteoarthritic specimens was eluted in the void volume of the column (Fig. 10). In a subsequent study, the extent of aggregation of aggrecan in a 4-h pulse and in 2- and 4-h chase extracts were compared for a normal specimen of femoral condyle cartilage (75 years) and for an osteoarthritic specimen (73 years). Fig. 10 shows that acquisition of full aggregating potential was attained much faster by the newly synthesized aggrecan from the diseased specimen. The altered rates of assembly of aggrecan in the diseased cartilage was not a consequence of changes in the availability/extraction of hyaluronan, because analysis of the endogenous proteoglycans showed that 65–70% of the uronic acid was excluded from the column in each case. Very little is known about the rate or the extent of assembly of aggrecan in situ. A number of questions remain unanswered about this process, and we have addressed these by providing some information about the extracellular organization of aggrecan. It is generally accepted that the stoichiometric relationship for the binding of aggrecan through its G1 domain to hyaluronan and link protein in an aggregate complex, is 1:1:1 (mol) (20.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Dudhia J. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). This is undoubtedly true for immature cartilage, which has been used to obtain much of the published experimental data. However, is the same relationship true for adult articular cartilage? The answer to this question has many repercussions for cartilage biology, particularly when one is considering the repair of cartilage defects by mature chondrocytes. Is all of the newly synthesized aggrecan processed in the same way? For example, are there different pools of aggrecan and are they present in different compartments of the tissue, in situ? It is our contention that age has a significant effect on all of these parameters. The preliminary experiments carried out to investigate aggrecan structure were performed, not only to establish the techniques that would be used subsequently but also to provide the evidence to support a strategy that we have applied to improve our understanding of aging of normal articular cartilage, i.e. the need to advance our knowledge of both the endogenous and the newly synthesized molecules of cartilage. A subsequent report will deal with the composition and structure of endogenous aggrecan molecules in the various extracts of human cartilage. The origin of the three toluidine blue-staining bands observed in the mature cartilage extracts will be discussed in detail in that publication, as will the immunoreactivity of them and their relationship to the radiolabeled molecules. However, it is pertinent to the discussion that follows here that our research makes clear that the two faster migrating bands could arise from the slower one by proteolytic modification during the relatively long time that these molecules are present in the extracellular matrix (2.Maroudas A. Bayliss M.T. Uchitel-Kaushansky N. Schneiderman R. Gilav E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 61-71Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is also important to realize that they could be derived by a biosynthetic route. The recent study of chondroitin sulfation during aging of human articular cartilage (3.Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) has gone some way to explaining the relationship between the three molecular species of aggrecan. Although the differential extraction procedure described in this manuscript can give some very useful information about aggregationin situ on its own, it is still necessary to carry out an analysis of the structural properties of the molecules involved in order to make a statement about the organization of the complex. For example, although our findings are consistent with the extraction of a low affinity form of aggrecan from adult cartilage with PBS and its slow conversion to a high affinity form in situ, evidence is also presented that suggests that the nondissociative extract contains high affinity molecules that require some other stimulus for them to be able to interact with hyaluronan. A high proportion of newly synthesized aggrecan is extracted from immature cartilage with PBS, and yet much of it can form aggregates with low concentrations of hyaluronan. A far more likely explanation is that there is processing of macromolecules, such as hyaluronan, from a PBS-soluble form to one requiring guanidine for extraction, or that other matrix molecules are required to induce aggregation. This hypothesis is consistent with autoradiographic studies that were performed on pulse-labeled and pulse-chase explants. One would not expect the newly synthesized molecules in the 4-h pulse explants of immature cartilage to be fixed in the pericellular compartment. How then could they move to the intercellular space during the chase culture? Once again, it is more likely that they have “matured” but have not found the appropriate biological signal/environment (positional and structural) to promote aggregation. It is also likely that there are other interactions occurring in situ, possibly with molecules that we would not normally associate with the formation of aggregates, of which we know very little. A good example of this is the age-related increase in the formation of nonenzymatic cross-linking of proteins that has been demonstrated in human articular cartilage (21.Bank R.A. Bayliss M.T. Lafeber F.P.J.G. Maroudas A. TeKoppele J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 22.Verzijl, N., Bank, R. A., Bayliss, M. T., Maroudas, A., DeGroot, J., Lafeber, F. P. J. G., and TeKoppele, J. M. (1998) 44th Trans. Am. Orth. Res. Soc. 860Google Scholar). The study of Sandy and Plaas (12.Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 300-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) gives another possible explanation of our findings. They showed that it was necessary to include detergent in the column buffers in order to inhibit self-association of aggrecan. Although similar experiments were not carried out in the present study of human aggrecan, they should be included in any subsequent analysis of this phenomenon. Osteoarthritis is a joint disease characterized by an eventual loss of the articular cartilage. During the progress of the disease, a decreased concentration of aggrecan in the tissue is often observed. Gray et al. (24.Gray M.A. Pizzanelli A.M. Grodzinsky A.J. Lee R.C. J. Orthop. Res. 1988; 6: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) suggested that this altered composition would result in an increase in the pH of the extracellular matrix. It would become less acidic and, therefore, promote the conversion of aggrecan into a high affinity form (14.Sah R.L. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Sandy J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Obviously, this mechanism of control is countered by many other biological mechanisms, but it is pertinent that the rates of aggregation of aggrecan in osteoarthritic cartilage presented here are much faster than that measured for normal cartilage. Another feature of osteoarthritic cartilage is the variable status of the metabolism of the chondrocyte that is often observed. Some authors have stated that the rate of [35S]sulfate incorporation by these late stage specimens is invariably higher than normal (25.Ryu J. Treadwell B.V. Mankin H.J. Arth. Rheum. 1984; 27: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas others have shown that either there is no change from normal or proteoglycan synthesis is decreased (23.Brocklehurst R. Bayliss M.T. Maroudas A. Coysh H. l. Freeman M.A.R. Revell P.A. Ali S.Y. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Br. Vol. 1984; 66A: 95-106Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Whatever the finding is, the results serve to illustrate the phasic nature of the disease, even at this relatively late stage. It should be noted that all of the osteoarthritic specimens used in the present study had rates of [35S]sulfate incorporation that were within the normal range. It is also worth noting that unpublished studies 2S. Howat and M. T. Bayliss, unpublished data. have indicated that a decrease in the pO2 of the culture medium (to a value found in vivo) decreases the rate of synthesis and delays the rate of aggregation. Thus, it appears that different biological mechanisms are active at different ages and that these directly influence the homeostasis of articular cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2010237285,"In vitro protein binding assays identified two distinct calmodulin (CaM) binding sites within the NH2-terminal 30-kDa domain of erythrocyte protein 4.1 (4.1R): a Ca2+-independent binding site (A264KKLWKVCVEHHTFFRL) and a Ca2+-dependent binding site (A181KKLSMYGVDLHKAKDL). Synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences bound CaM in vitro; conversely, deletion of these peptides from a 30-kDa construct reduced binding to CaM. Thus, 4.1R is a unique CaM-binding protein in that it has distinct Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent high affinity CaM binding sites. CaM bound to 4.1R at a stoichiometry of 1:1 both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, implying that one CaM molecule binds to two distinct sites in the same molecule of 4.1R. Interactions of 4.1R with membrane proteins such as band 3 is regulated by Ca2+ and CaM. While the intrinsic affinity of the 30-kDa domain for the cytoplasmic tail of erythrocyte membrane band 3 was not altered by elimination of one or both CaM binding sites, the ability of Ca2+/CaM to down-regulate 4.1R-band 3 interaction was abrogated by such deletions. Thus, regulation of protein 4.1 binding to membrane proteins by Ca2+ and CaM requires binding of CaM to both Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent sites in protein 4.1. In vitro protein binding assays identified two distinct calmodulin (CaM) binding sites within the NH2-terminal 30-kDa domain of erythrocyte protein 4.1 (4.1R): a Ca2+-independent binding site (A264KKLWKVCVEHHTFFRL) and a Ca2+-dependent binding site (A181KKLSMYGVDLHKAKDL).

Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In most cases, Ca2+ is essential for the initial binding of CaM to these proteins and for subsequent modulation of their function. However, a small subset of proteins including erythroid 4.1 (4.1R) bind CaM in a Ca2+-independent manner but require Ca2+ for manifesting changes in function. Of particular relevance to the present study is the role played by CaM in modulating various protein-protein interactions in the erythrocyte membrane involving 4.1R. CaM is present in human erythrocytes at micromolar concentration (3.Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, CaM binds to Ca2+-ATPase (6.Kessler F. Falchetto R. Heim R. Meili R. Vorherr T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E.

Through its interaction with Ca2+-ATPase, CaM enables the erythrocyte to maintain a submicromolar concentration of Ca2+. Since only 5% of the CaM in erythrocyte is involved in interaction with Ca2+-ATPase (13.Larsen F.L. Vincenzi F.F. Science. 1979; 204: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), 95% of CaM is available for interaction with other membrane proteins and modulation of their functional interactions. In fact, recent evidence suggests that Ca2+/CaM reduces the affinities of the spectrin-actin-adducin interaction (9.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14.Anderson J.P. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6365-6372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the spectrin-actin-4.1R interaction (11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM also decreases the affinity of interaction between 4.1R and band 3 and between 4.1R and glycophorin C (16.Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By modulating the affinities of these different protein-protein interactions, Ca2+/CaM can play a significant role in regulating the function of the erythrocyte membrane (10.Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Biochemical and biophysical studies have facilitated construction of a structural and functional map of the 4.1R molecule (for a review, see Ref. 17.Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Four major structural domains of 4.1R with apparent molecular masses of 30, 16, 10, and 22–24 kDa were identified. 4.1R interacts with spectrin and actin through its 10-kDa domain and with integral membrane proteins glycophorin C and band 3 through its 30-kDa domain (reviewed in Ref. 17.Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). CaM has previously been shown to bind to the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R at a molar ratio of 1:1 in a Ca2+-independent manner (11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is an absolute Ca2+ requirement for CaM-induced regulation of 4.1R interactions with other membrane proteins (15.Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16.Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for this Ca2+ requirement, we explored the possibility that the presence of both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent CaM binding sites in the 30-kDa domain may account for CaM regulation of protein-protein interactions involving protein 4.1R. In the present study, we quantitated the affinity of interaction between CaM and 4.1R, its 30-kDa domain, and various synthetic peptides. CaM bound to the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R in Ca2+-independent manner at a molar ratio of 1:1 with a dissociation constant on the order of 0.1 μm, consistent with previous findings (11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified two different CaM-binding sequence motifs in the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R: one encoded by exon 9 (AKKLSMYGVDLHKAKDL; peptide 9) and the other by exon 11 (AKKLWKVCVEHHTFFRL; peptide 11) (18.Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences share conserved sequence motifs with the CaM binding sequence of Ca2+-ATPase (6.Kessler F. Falchetto R. Heim R. Meili R. Vorherr T. Strehler E.E. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11785-11792Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Importantly, while peptide 11 bound CaM with high affinity in the absence of Ca2+, binding of CaM to peptide 9 was Ca2+-sensitive. Serine 185 in peptide 9 appeared to play a critical role in Ca2+-dependent CaM binding, since replacement of this serine by tryptophan resulted in loss of Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to 4.1R. Ca2+ decreases the affinity of band 3 binding to the 30-kDa domain in the presence of CaM. However, Ca2+ had no effect on the affinity of the band 3 interaction with the 30-kDa domain when either the Ca2+-independent or both the Ca2+-dependent and -independent CaM binding sites were deleted. Thus, regulation of 4.1R binding to membrane proteins by Ca2+ and CaM requires binding of CaM to both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent sites in 4.1R. Based on these findings, we propose that two distinct domains in 4.1R are responsible for CaM binding and that one of these domains is responsible for Ca2+-sensitive regulation of 4.1-R interactions with membrane proteins.

The purified fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin. The replacement of Ser185 by Trp185, of Phe277-Phe278 by Ala277-Ala278, and of Trp268 and Phe277-Phe278 by Ala268 and Ala277-Ala278 in r30kDa in the pGEX-KG vector was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. r30kDa was further purified by affinity column chromatography using CaM-Sepharose CL-4B (16.Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), while the other recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B to remove cleaved glutathione S-transferase. The purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel) analysis. The protein concentrations were determined using the following relationship: protein concentration (mg/ml) = 1.45 A 280 − 0.74A 260. Protein-protein interactions and protein-peptide interactions were studied using the resonant mirror detection method (30.Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J.

To measure the ability of different 4.1R peptides and 4.1R recombinant proteins to bind CaM, the biotinylated peptides or proteins were immobilized to the aminosilane cuvette according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications (32.George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All experimental procedures were carried out at 25 °C with constant stirring. In brief, an aminosilane cuvette was activated with 2 mm of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. After extensive washing with distilled water, proteins suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml were added to the cuvette and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline was added to the cuvette to reduce nonspecific binding. The biotinylated peptides were immobilized onto the cuvette surface through streptavidin. Cuvettes with immobilized bovine serum albumin alone or streptavidin alone were prepared to serve as negative controls for binding studies. To quantitate the effects of Ca2+ and CaM on the binding of different r30kDa proteins to transmembrane proteins, the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was immobilized on the surface of the aminosilane cuvette. r30kDa or its mutants (50 nm-1 μm) were preincubated with 5 μm CaM in buffer A (20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl) and either 0.1 mm EGTA or 1.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm EGTA at 25 °C for 30 min. All binding assays were conducted in buffer A and 0.1 mm EGTA or 1.1 mmCaCl2 and 1.0 mm EGTA at 25 °C for 30 min. The dissociation constant K (D)kin was determined from the binding assay as described previously (33.Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In brief, the time-dependent changes in arc seconds provided information concerning real-time changes in surface concentration of protein complexes formed on the sensor surface (30.Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 347-353Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 31.Watts H.J. Lowe C.R. Anal.

The resulting binding curve (arc seconds versus time; see Fig.2) was analyzed using the software package FASTfitTM (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). The dissociation constant from this form of kinetic analysis (termedK (D)kin) is then calculated as follows:K (D)kin =k d/k a, wherek a is the association rate constant andk d is the dissociation rate constant. The dissociation constant by Scatchard plot analysis (termed K (D) K (D)Scat) was also derived from the binding data (33.Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present study, theK (D)Scat derived under all experimental conditions closely matched the correspondingK (D)kin values calculated. The stoichiometry of 4.1R binding to CaM in the presence and absence of Ca2+ was determined using the IAsysTM system. Maximal binding (B max) of 4.1R represented as arc seconds was obtained from the Scatchard plot as described previously (33.Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The amount of immobilized CaM on the aminosilane cuvette was determined as the difference of arc seconds between bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate and CaM under equilibrium conditions. The stoichiometry of 4.1R binding to CaM was calculated according to the following equation described in the Method Guide of the IAsysTM system: Stoichiometry of 4.1R:CaM = (B max of 4.1R/80,000):(amount of immobilized CaM on aminosilane cuvette/18,000), where 80,000 and 18,000 are apparent molecular weights of 4.1R (18.Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CaM (1.Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 2.Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), respectively. The cuvettes were reused after cleaning with HCl. Original binding curves could be replicated after HCl washes, implying that the washing procedure used did not denature the bound ligands. The ability of CaM to bind to native 4.1R and to its four major structural domains (30-, 16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains) was determined using the IAsysTMsystem. All binding studies were performed at physiologic ionic strength. Ca2+ dependence of binding was evaluated at defined concentrations of Ca2+. Analysis of binding response curves (Fig. 2) obtained at varying concentrations of 4.1R in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2 A) providedk a and k d of 6.1 × 104m−1 s−1 and 2.0 × 10−2 s−1, respectively. From these measured values of k a andk d, a K (D)kin value of 0.33 μm was derived for Ca2+-independent CaM binding to 4.1R. Ca2+ had little effect on the affinity of 4.1R binding to CaM. The stoichiometry of 4.1R binding to CaM was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the values of B max (970 arc seconds) in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and the amount of immobilized CaM on the aminosilane cuvette (200 arc seconds) (Fig.3), a molar ratio of 4.1R binding to CaM was derived to be 1:1 both in the presence and absence of calcium. This finding is consistent with earlier findings on stoichiometry of Ca2+-independent binding of 4.1R to CaM (11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CaM also bound to the N-terminal 30-kDa domain isolated from native 4.1R and to r30kDa with a K (D)kin value of 0.35 μm(Fig. 2 B, Table I) at a molar ratio of 1:1. Again, Ca2+ had little effect on the affinity or stoichiometry of CaM binding to the 30-kDa domain. In contrast, no binding signal could be detected for interaction between CaM and 16-, 10-, or 22/24-kDa domains of 4.1R (Fig. 2 C). Thus, CaM binds to the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R in a Ca2+-independent fashion, consistent with earlier reports (11.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, these results do not rule out the presence of additional Ca2+-dependent binding sites, of equal or lower affinity, whose existence could be masked by the high affinity Ca2+-independent binding site.Table ICaM binding to wild and mutant r30kDaProteinMutationConditionK (D)kinμm4.1RWild typeEGTA0.33 ± 0.02+Ca2+0.10 ± 0.05r30kDaWild typeEGTA0.35 ± 0.03+Ca2+0.13 ± 0.01ΔEx.11EGTA30.0 ± 2.61+Ca2+5.10 ± 0.26ΔEx.9/11EGTANo binding+Ca2+No bindingK (D)kin for the interaction between CaM and 4.1R or r30kDa (wild type), exon 11-deleted r30kDa (ΔEx.11), and exons 9 and 11-deleted r30kDa (ΔEx.9/11), in the presence and absence of Ca2+ are shown. 4.1 R and r30kDa proteins (50 nm to 1 μm) were incubated with CaM immobilized on the aminosilane cuvette in the presence of either 0.1 mm EGTA (EGTA) or 1.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mM EGTA (+Ca2+) in buffer A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From the binding curves obtained by resonant mirror detection method, K (D)kin was determined using the software package FAST-Fit™.

Open table in a new tab K (D)kin for the interaction between CaM and 4.1R or r30kDa (wild type), exon 11-deleted r30kDa (ΔEx.11), and exons 9 and 11-deleted r30kDa (ΔEx.9/11), in the presence and absence of Ca2+ are shown. 4.1 R and r30kDa proteins (50 nm to 1 μm) were incubated with CaM immobilized on the aminosilane cuvette in the presence of either 0.1 mm EGTA (EGTA) or 1.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mM EGTA (+Ca2+) in buffer A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From the binding curves obtained by resonant mirror detection method, K (D)kin was determined using the software package FAST-Fit™. K (D)kin represents mean ± S.D. (n = 3–5). To identify CaM binding sites in the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R, we quantitated CaM binding to r30kDa from which sequences encoded either by exon 11 (ΔEx.11) or both exons 9 and 11 (ΔEx.9/11) had been deleted. As noted before, CaM binds wild type r30kDa with aK (D)kin value on the order of 0.1 μmeither in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Deletion of sequences encoded by both exons 9 and 11 (ΔEx.9/11) completely abolished the binding of the mutant r30kDa peptide to CaM either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Table I). This finding implies that CaM binding domain sequences are encoded by these two exons. Interestingly, the mutant r30kDa ΔEx.11 polypeptide exhibited Ca2+-sensitive CaM binding with aK (D)kin value of 30 μm in the absence of Ca2+ and a K (D)kin value of 5.1 μm in the presence of Ca2+ (Table I). These data imply that sequences encoded by exon 9 exhibit Ca2+-sensitive CaM binding. It should be noted that the affinity of the interaction of this mutant protein with CaM was markedly decreased compared with the wild type protein, suggesting that sequences encoded by exon 11 may constitute the high affinity binding site in 30-kDa domain for CaM. We were unable to study CaM binding to ΔEx.9 r30kDa, since this recombinant protein could not be obtained in a soluble form. Deletion of sequences encoded by exon 5 (ΔEx.5) from the r30kDa polypeptide had no effect on CaM binding in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Taken together, these data imply that two distinct CaM binding sites encoded by exons 9 and 11 exist in 4.1R. We identified the putative CaM binding sequence motif, AKKLXXXXVXX(X)HXXXXL (where the XX(X) indicates that there may be 2 or 3 unknown residues) in the sequences encoded by both exons 9 and 11. The sequence encoded by exon 9 is AKKLSMYGVDLHKAKDL (peptide 9), while the one encoded by exon 11 is AKKLWKVCVEHHTFFRL) (peptide 11) (Fig.1 B). To test directly whether these sequences can bind CaM, the corresponding synthetic peptides were made, and their binding to CaM was assayed (Table II). CaM bound to peptide 11 with a K (D)kin value of 0.54 μm both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. CaM binding to peptide 9 was highly sensitive to Ca2+. CaM bound to peptide 9 with a K (D)kin value of 1.7 μm in the presence of Ca2+ but with a much higher K (D)kin value of 40 μm in the absence of Ca2+. Peptide 9-a (A181KKLSMYGV) also showed Ca2+-sensitive CaM binding, while binding of peptide 9-b (D190LHKAKDL) to CaM was not Ca2+-sensitive (data not shown). It is noteworthy that there was an absolute requirement for Ca2+ for interaction of CaM with peptide 9-a. These data suggest that the Ca2+-sensitive CaM binding site in peptide 9 requires sequences in peptide 9-a.Table IICaM binding to peptides of the 30-kDa domain of 4.1RMutationConditionK (D)kinμmPeptide 9Wild typeEGTA40 ± 5.30+Ca2+1.7 ± 0.02+peptide 11EGTA5.6 ± 0.55+Ca2+0.34 ± 0.08Ser185 → Trp185EGTA8.5 ± 0.51+Ca2+5.6 ± 0.10Peptide 11Wild typeEGTA0.54 ± 0.01+Ca2+0.60 ± 0.15Trp268 → Ser268EGTA6.7 ± 0.02+Ca2+2.8 ± 0.10Trp268-Lys269 → Ser268-Leu269EGTA21 ± 0.24+Ca2+1.1 ± 0.01K (D)kin values for the interaction between CaM and peptides 9 and 11 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ are shown.

We report here a molecular cloning of Chat (Cas/HEF1-associated signaltransducer) that associates with Cas and HEF1. Chat is a 78-kDa signaling molecule with an N-terminal SH2 domain and is expressed in a wide range of tissues. In hematopoietic cells, a 115-kDa isoform of Chat (Chat-H) was specifically expressed. Chat is associated with Cas in brain, and Chat-H is associated with HEF1 in splenocytes. Deletion analyses revealed that Chat and Cas are associated with each other by their C-terminal domains. Treatment of PC12 cells with epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor increased the phosphorylation level of Chat. This increase was suppressed by an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, PD98059, suggesting the phosphorylation of Chat by MAP kinase. In Chat-overexpressed COS7 cells, the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase was up-regulated. After the epidermal growth factor stimulation, Chat and Cas were colocalized with actin filaments at ruffling membranes.

Integrin family proteins consist of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins and have an ECM-binding extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic domain associating with actin cytoskeleton. At the cytoplasmic surface of integrin-ECM adhesion site, subsets of signaling molecules are recruited and form multi-molecular signaling complex. Tyrosine kinases play a key role in both the integrin-mediated signaling and the regulation of cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 3.Parsons T. Curr. Opin.

Several signaling molecules are constituted of only these modules and their binding motifs, and are termed “adaptor proteins” (reviewed in Refs. 18.Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cas, originally identified as a major tyrosine phosphorylated protein in v-Crk- or v-Src-transformed fibroblasts, belongs to this adaptor protein family (20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S.

DOCK180-Rac1 pathway also affects the cytoskeletal reorganization and cell spreading (29.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M.

Interestingly, overexpression of Cas promotes the membrane ruffling and cell migration on ECM by a Rac1-dependent manner (30.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

HEF1 is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes (32.Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp.

The most C-terminal regions of these proteins including Cas show significantly high sequence similarity to one another; however, the function of these regions has not been characterized yet. In this study, we have isolated a gene encoding an SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein, Chat (Cas/HEF1-associated signaltransducer), and identified its hematopoietic cell-specific isoform, Chat-H. Chat and Chat-H bound, respectively, to the C-terminal domains of Cas and HEF1. Furthermore, Chat was phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase after growth factor stimulation, and overexpression of Chat caused JNK activation. We also demonstrated that Chat and Cas were colocalized at ruffling membranes. These results suggest that the Chat-Cas complex regulates the JNK signaling pathway and membrane ruffling at the downstream regions of tyrosine kinases and MAP kinase. In the process of an immunoscreening of a mouse lung cDNA library constructed in λgt11 using a monoclonal antibody B45/18, the initial clone was isolated by a cross-reaction of the antibody. 2A. Sakakibara, unpublished data. Using this clone as a probe, full-length mouse cDNA encoding Chat was obtained. After subcloning the insert into pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene), nucleotide sequencing was performed. Rabbit anti-Chat polyclonal antibodies (anti-Chat SH, amino acid residues 57–167; anti-Chat CT, residues 308–702; anti-Chat CP, residues 687–702) were raised against the SH2 domain and the C-terminal half-region of Chat produced in Escherichia coli, and a hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic oligopeptide, respectively. Anti-p130Cas (anti-Cas/HEF1), recognizing both Cas and HEF1, was purchased from Transduction Labolatories. Anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and Anti-HA 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used for epitope-tagged proteins. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For growth factor stimulation, PC12 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Takara) or 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; Upstate Biotechnology) for 3 min. For PD98059 (Research Biochemicals International) treatment, cells were preincubated with 50 μm PD98059 for 30 min before growth factor stimulation. COS7 cells were serum-starved for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin before EGF stimulation. Mouse lymphoid tissues dissected in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum were passed through a mesh. The suspended cells were collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. For splenocyte isolation, cells were then resuspended in Tris-NH4Cl solution (0.15 m NH4Cl, 0.017 mTris-HCl, pH 7.2) to burst red blood cells. After 2 min at room temperature, the suspension was diluted 10-fold with RPMI 1640 medium and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. Mouse tissues were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in approximately 20 volumes of ice-cold IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants were collected as the tissue lysates. To prepare the lysates from isolated lymphoid cells or cultured cells, cells were lysed with IP buffer and gently rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were saved. Appropriate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the lysates, and the mixtures were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with IP buffer and then eluted by boiling in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for 10 min. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitates was performed as described (37.Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, 0.22-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was incubated with first antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxydase-conjugated appropriate second antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive signals were detected with Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). To determine the binding sites for Chat-Cas interaction, expression plasmids for Chat, Cas, and their deletion mutants were constructed. N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length Chat and a deletion series of Chat (Chat212–702, Chat345–702, ChatΔ346–492, and Chat1–619) were constructed in pCI-neo vector (Promega), after ligation with an oligonucleotide containing the FLAG sequence. Similaly, full-length Cas and its deleted forms (Cas425–874, Cas1–781, and Cas671–874) were constructed in N-terminal HA-tagging vector pCMV-HA. His-tagged full-length Chat (His-Chat) was constructed by adding six histidine codons upstream the initiation codon of Chat and expressed by using pCAX, a derivative of pCAGGS (38.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar). In JNK assays and immunofluorescence analyses, pCAX was used for the expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length Chat (pCAX-Chat), and pSSRαCas (21.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) was used for the full-length Cas. For transient expression, transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Life Tech.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged Chat was expressed in COS7 cells by transient transfection with pCAX-His-Chat. After 24 h, cells were homogenized in His-binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol), and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. His-Bind Resin (Novagen) was mixed with the lysate for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by packaging into a column. The column was washed with His-wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) and eluted with His-elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). To express glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of Chat association domain of Cas (GST-Cas671–874) inE. coli, pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. GST or GST-Cas671–874 produced in E. coliwas bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). His-Chat produced in COS7 cells was diluted ten-fold with Binding buffer and incubated with GST-bound or GST-Cas671–874-bound glutathione-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing five times, the adsorbed materials were subjected to immunoblot with anti-Chat CP. COS7 cells grown on 60-mm dishes were transfected with 1.25 μg each of indicated plasmids as described above. Total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 2.5 μg/60-mm dish with control vector pCAX. After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C. Preparation of cell lysates and solid phase JNK assay were carried out according to Hibi et al. (39.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, endogenous JNK was pulled down by GST-c-Jun1–79-coupled glutathione-Sepharose and was subjected to kinase reaction in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by measuring the signal intensity of the autoradiogram of the samples on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were cultured on cover glasses and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, cells were soaked in a blocking solution (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. The specimens were incubated with first antibodies for 60 min in a moist chamber, washed three times with the blocking solution, and then incubated for 60 min with the second antibody, Cy2-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To visualize actin filaments, Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used. Samples were then washed with PBS for three times, mounted in Perma Fluor (Immunon), and examined using a fluorescence microscope, Zeiss Axiophot II photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss). In the process to identify an antigen that localizes at cell-cell adherence junctions by immunoscreening of an expression library, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel adaptor protein by a cross-reaction of the antibody. This protein had an N-terminal SH2 domain, and its calculated molecular mass was 78 kDa (Fig.1, A and B). The central portion of this protein was rich in serine, threonine, and proline residues, and this portion contained four consensus sites for MAP kinase phosphorylation (Pro-X-Ser/Thr-Pro) shown by double underlines in Fig. 1 A. As described below, this protein was associated with Cas family adaptor proteins, Cas and HEF1, through its C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B). Considering these properties, we named this protein Chat. As the first step, we examined the expression of Chat in various tissues of mouse. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Chat CP polyclonal antibody showed a relatively ubiquitous expression pattern of Chat at the molecular mass of 78 kDa (Fig. 1 C, arrow). A 115-kDa isoform of Chat was specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells from spleen, lymph node, and thymus (Fig. 1 C,arrowhead). Although the detailed molecular nature of this 115-kDa protein remained to be clarified, we tentatively named the isoform Chat-H, meaning the hematopoietic cell-specific Chat. Same results were obtained with other anti-Chat polyclonal antibodies that recognized distinct epitopes (anti-Chat SH and anti-Chat CT; data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of various established cell lines showed that Chat was expressed in a wide range of cell lines at different levels (data not shown). Only Chat-H species was detected in hematopoietic cell lines (WEHI 231, BAL17, HL-60, Jurkat, etc.; data not shown), which confirmed the result obtained with tissue extracts. To seek for a clue to Chat function, we tried to identify a tyrosine phosphorylated protein that formed a complex with Chat, because Chat had one SH2 domain at its N terminus. Chat was immunoprecipitated with anti-Chat-CT from lysates of mouse brain and splenocytes, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analyses (Fig.2). Anti-Chat-immunoblot confirmed the results in the previous section that brain and lymphoid cells expressed only Chat and Chat-H, respectively (Fig. 2, top panel). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparent molecular masses of 130 kDa (in brain) and 115 kDa (in spleen) were detected as major Chat-associated molecules (Fig. 2, middle panel). We then applied antibodies against various known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the molecular mass of which was between 115 and 130 kDa. An anti-Cas antibody that recognized Cas and HEF1 reacted with both Chat-associated proteins (Fig. 2, bottom panel). This result revealed that the 130-kDa protein and the 115-kDa protein were Cas and HEF1, respectively. The essential region of Chat for the association of Cas was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay using various deletion mutants of Chat and full-length Cas coexpressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, full-length Chat, Chat212–702 and Chat345–702 associated with Cas to a similar extent, indicating that the C-terminal half-region of Chat (Chat345–702) was fully capable of the Chat-Cas interaction. However, the deletion of 146 amino acid residues from the middle (ChatΔ346–492) or 78 residues from the C terminus (Chat1–619) completely disrupted the binding activity. The expression level of these proteins and Cas were similar among these samples (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the C-terminal half-region of Chat but not the SH2 domain is required for the association with Cas, and we named the C-terminal region “Cas association domain” (Fig. 3 A). Cas is known to form a complex with diverse signaling molecules through its SH3, substrate, and Src binding domains (20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 21.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To identify the binding site on Cas for the association with Chat, we then performed co-immunoprecipitation assay using a series of deletion mutants of Cas and full-length Chat (Fig.4). N-terminally deleted mutants (Cas425–874 and Cas671–874) still fully retained the association capacity with Chat (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that the C-terminal 204 residues are sufficient for the association. By the deletion of C-terminal 93 residues, however, Cas completely lost the association activity (Cas1–781, in Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we defined the C-terminal 204 residues of Cas as “Chat association domain” (Fig. 4 A). To examine whether the association of Chat and Cas was direct or not, we carried out in vitro binding experiment. N-terminally histidine-tagged full-length Chat was expressed in COS7 cells and partially purified by a nickel affinity column. The purified protein was mixed with GST or GST-Cas671–874 that had been immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig.4 C, only GST-Cas671–874 pulled down Chat, suggesting that Chat-Cas interaction is direct. To clarify the upstream signaling pathway of Chat, we examined whether endogenous Chat in PC12 cells underwent phosphorylation during the treatment of cells with either EGF or NGF (Fig.5 A). Both EGF and NGF caused upward electrophoretic mobility shift of Chat to a similar extent (top panel). However, Chat in these cells was not recognized by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, indicating that Chat was not tyrosine phosphorylated under the condition (middle panel). When anti-Chat immunoprecipitates were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, the mobility of Chat from both control and EGF-treated cells increased to a same level (top panel). This result indicated that Chat was phosphorylated to some extent in the control cells and that the phosphorylation level further increased by EGF treatment. Because Chat before the phosphatase treatment was detected as a significantly broad band, multiple sites might be phosphorylated. Even after the phosphatase treatment, Cas still bound to Chat, which suggested that the Chat-Cas interaction was phosphorylation-independent (bottom panel). Because Chat had four potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (Fig.1 A), we examined the effect of an inhibitor of MAP kinase and/or ERK2 kinase, PD98059, on Chat phosphorylation induced by EGF. PD98059 treatment clearly suppressed the upward shift of Chat (Fig.5 B), suggesting that MAP kinase is a main kinase responsible for the EGF-induced Chat phosphorylation. Recent studies reported that JNK is up-regulated when a member of Cas signaling pathway is overexpressed (29.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 40.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To assess the possibility that Chat is also involved in this signaling pathway, we measured JNK activity of COS7 cells overexpressing Chat (Fig. 6). In Chat-overexpressing cells, JNK activity was 1.7-fold higher than in the control cells (Fig. 6 B). This increase was similar to that induced by Cas (1.9-fold (Fig. 6 B) or the data in Ref.40.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or Crk (40.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Chat and Cas activated JNK to a similar level (2.0-fold (Fig. 6 B)). The amount of JNK did not vary significantly among the samples (data not shown). These results suggest that Chat is also involved in the Cas-mediated JNK activation pathway. To further confirm the association of Chat with Cas, we performed immunofluorescence analyses of COS7 cells expressing Chat together with staining of actin cytoskeletal structures (Fig.7). In Chat-transfected COS7 cells, Chat was predominantly detected throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.7 A). Rapid translocation of Chat to ruffling membranes was observed after stimulation of membrane ruffling by EGF (Fig. 7,C and D) or insulin (data not shown). Chat and Cas were then expressed simultaneously, and their cellular distributions were studied. In unstimulated cells, both Chat (Fig.7 E) and Cas (Fig. 7 F) were mainly localized in the cytoplasm. When cells were EGF-stimulated, intense staining of Chat (Fig. 7 G) and Cas (Fig. 7 H) at ruffling membranes was observed, and their patterns were very similar to each other. Taken together with the results that Chat and Cas formed a complex in cell lysates, the association of Chat and Cas in living cells was strongly suggested. This study demonstrates that Chat, an adaptor protein having an SH2 domain, interacts with the C-terminal domain of Cas family adaptor proteins. Chat was phosphorylated by MAP kinase after the stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors in PC12 cells. In Chat-overexpressing COS7 cells, the JNK activity was up-regulated. Chat showed colocalization with Cas at ruffling membranes. These results suggest that Chat integrates signals from tyrosine kinases and MAP kinase, controlling cell growth and cytoskeletal reorganization through the Cas signaling pathway. Very recently, Lu et al. (41.Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported a molecular cloning of NSP family proteins, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3, and it emerged that NSP3 is the human ortholog of mouse Chat (90% identity between NSP3 and Chat amino acid sequences; 35–40% identity between Chat and NSP1 or NSP2). BCAR3 that confers antiestrogen resistance to a mammary cell line (42.van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L.A. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is identical to NSP2. Ascidian HrSH2 may also be a member of this family (43.Takahashi H. Satoh N. Dev. Growth Differ. 1998; 40: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). As described here Chat/NSP3 binds to Cas. Lu et al. (41.Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) described the Cas-NSP1 interaction in the same study, although they speculated that the association was mediated by Cas SH3 domain. Furthermore, NSP1 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and Chat/NSP3 becomes Ser/Thr phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation. Therefore, these family proteins may participate in novel signaling pathways to Cas. Tissue immunoblot analyses showed that Chat was expressed ubiquitously except hematopoietic cells, wherein only a hematopoietic cell-specific isoform, Chat-H, was expressed (Fig. 1 C). Chat and Chat-H respectively associates with Cas and HEF1 (Fig. 2). HEF1 is tyrosine phosphorylated when B or T cell antigen receptor is stimulated (32.Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 35.Manié S.N. Beck A.R. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N.

Kamiguchi K. Fujita H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6446-6451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chat-H was recovered in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates when B cell antigen receptor was cross-linked,2 consistent with the complex formation of Chat-H with HEF1. By using various deletion mutants of Chat and Cas, we demonstrated that C-terminal half of Chat binds to C-terminal 204 amino acids of Cas (Figs. 3 and 4). Although the binding of Chat-H to HEF1 was not fully characterized yet, it was highly likely that complex formation between Chat-H and HEF1 was mediated by their C-terminal domains, because (a) our preliminary characterization of Chat-H revealed that Chat and Chat-H share same C-terminal sequence2 and (b) the C-terminal region of human HEF1 shows relatively high sequence similarity to Chat association domain of rat Cas (56% identical, 73% conservative among 204 residues). Whether Chat or Chat-H interacts with the third member of Cas family protein, Efs/Sin, remains to be clarified. Similarity between Efs/Sin and Cas (42% identical, 57% conservative among C-terminal 147 residues) is lower both in length and extent compared with that between Cas and HEF1. Cas family proteins participate in multiple biological events including integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion (11.Nojima Y. Morino N. Miura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K.

Recently, the molecular basis for these events has been intensely investigated. In integrin-mediated cell adhesion, Cas forms a multivalent scaffold complex at focal adhesion sites. This complex includes at least FAK, Src, and Crk as direct binding partners of SH3, Src binding, and substrate domains of Cas, respectively (20.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 21.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of Cas family proteins are highly conserved in their primary structures; however, the function of these regions has not been characterized, except that C-terminal portion of HEF1, when expressed in budding yeast, causes the filamentous cell morphology (31.Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our result, that Chat binds to the C-terminal domain of Cas (Fig.4 C) and probably to HEF1, reveals a novel function of these domains. We showed that the phosphorylation level of Chat was elevated when PC12 cells were stimulated by EGF or NGF and suggested MAP kinase as a major kinase responsible for this increase (Fig. 5). The result coincided with the molecular feature of Chat having four MAP kinase phosphorylation sites (Pro-X-Ser/Thr-Pro) in the central region (Fig.1 A). Human NSP3 has five MAP kinase sites in the corresponding region. Interestingly, NSP1 does not have any MAP kinase site in the molecule. It is intriguing to clarify the physiological function of MAP kinase phosphorylation of Chat. Although endogenous Chat in PC12 cells did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF (Fig. 5), when overexpressed in COS7 cells, Chat was tyrosine phosphorylated during the stimulation with the same ligand (data not shown). Lu et al. (41.Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) also reported that NSP1 was tyrosine phosphorylated by EGF and that NSP1 bound to activated EGF receptor in a similar overexpression experiment. Recently, the physiological significance of FAK-Cas signaling pathway in integrin-mediated JNK activation and cell cycle progression was emphasized (26.Oktay M. Wary K.K. Dans M. Birge R.B. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1461-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and several reports demonstrated that overexpression of Cas, or component of Cas signaling pathway, Crk, DOCK180 or NSP1, activates JNK (29.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 40.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Chat overexpressing COS7 cells, JNK activity was up-regulated to a similar extent as in Cas overexpressing cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that Chat is also involved in the Cas-mediated JNK activation pathway. Cas functions as well in the integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization that accompanies with cell adhesion (45.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S.-I. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and cell migration (30.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In Chat and Cas expressing COS7 cells, both Chat and Cas were concentrated at ruffling membranes after EGF or insulin stimulation (Fig. 7). Ruffling membranes are characteristic of migrating cells, and both EGF and insulin are known to induce cell migration on ECM (30.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), suggesting that Chat function in these growth factors induced cell migration. We report here a unique biological feature of Chat integrating signals from tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase. The next important issues that we should resolve are to identify the binding partner of Chat SH2 domain, to clarify the mechanism of Chat translocation to ruffling membranes, and to reveal the effect of MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation on Chat function. Studies on these lines will provide us further information on the molecular mechanism of how these integrated signals regulate the function of Cas signaling pathway. Initial phase of this project was carried out in Dr. S. Tsukita's laboratory. We thank S. Tsukita for the permission to use the cDNA clone encoding Chat and T. Nakamoto and H. Hirai for providing the Cas expression construct. We also thank S. Nakamura, T. Katagiri, Y. Ohta, Y. Imai, and M. Matsuda for valuable comments and technical advice."

In contrast, activation of protein kinase C induces the phosphorylation of α1b-adrenoreceptors and blocks their actions. The effect of norepinephrine and phorbol esters on α1a-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation and coupling to G proteins were studied. Both stimuli lead to dose-dependent receptor phosphorylation. Interestingly, protein kinase C activation affected to a much lesser extent the actions of α1a-adrenergic receptors than those of the α1b subtype (norepinephrine elicited increases in calcium in whole cells and [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes). Basal phosphorylation of α1a-adrenergic receptors was much less than that observed with the α1b subtype. The carboxyl terminus seems to be the main domain for receptor phosphorylation. Therefore, chimeric receptors, where the carboxyl-terminal tails of α1a and α1badrenergic receptors were exchanged, were constructed and expressed. α1a-Adrenoreceptors wearing the carboxyl tail of the α1b subtype had a high basal phosphorylation and displayed a strong phosphorylation in response to norepinephrine and phorbol esters. Our results demonstrate that stimulation of α1a-adrenergic receptor, or activation of protein kinase C, leads to α1a-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation. α1a-Adrenoreceptors are affected to a much lesser extent than α1b-adrenoreceptors by protein kinase C activation.

The paradigm of desensitization is based mainly on exhaustive studies performed with the Gs-coupled β2-ARs1 (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Advances in Pharmacology. 42. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 416-420Google Scholar, 2.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz J.R. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when agonist-occupied receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins, the released Gβγ complexes recruit soluble GRKs (particularly GRK-2) to the site of receptor activation (2.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Receptors are phosphorylated by these enzymes and bind arrestin proteins that stabilize the uncoupled state of the receptors (3.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Arrestins act as bridges that bind to clathrin molecules, initiating the internalization of phosphorylated receptors into vesicles, where specific phosphatases remove the phosphates and allow the dephosphorylated receptors to return to the cell surface, completing the cycle of activation-desensitization-resensitization (4.Goodman Jr., O.B.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Second messenger-activated kinases, such as PKA (protein kinase A) and PKC, also promote receptor phosphorylation, eliciting heterologous desensitization by a parallel process that does not require receptor activation and in which arrestins do not seem to participate (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Advances in Pharmacology. 42. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 416-420Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation is associated with desensitization, particularly with homologous desensitization (1.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Advances in Pharmacology. 42. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 416-420Google Scholar, 6.Bünemann M. Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Some heterologous stimuli lead to receptor phosphorylation and consequent desensitization. For example, α1b-ARs are phosphorylated and desensitized after their activation by agonists, as a result of a cross-talk with endothelin ETA receptors or activation of PKC by phorbol esters (7.Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Cotecchia S. Lomasney J.W. DeBernardis J.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5651-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8.Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

However, this same receptor is phosphorylated without evidencing desensitization by a cross-talk with B2 bradykinin receptors (12.Medina L.C. Vázquez-Prado J. Torres-Padilla M.E. Mendoza-Mendoza A. Cruz-Muñoz M.E. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or when active GRK-5 are expressed (9.Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Few examples exist in which desensitization takes place with no detectable receptor phosphorylation; these include studies with the parathyroid hormone receptor (13.Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 11: 5476-5481Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (14.Lamm M.L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1537-1546PubMed Google Scholar). Differential regulation within a family of receptors is frequently associated with differential susceptibility of members to be modified by phosphorylation. The actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE), for example, are mediated through nine known adrenergic receptors. Subtypes of α2- and β-ARs seem to be subject to desensitization according to their susceptibility as kinase substrates (15.Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Liggett S.B. Goldstein D.S. Eisenhofer G. McCarty R. Advances in Pharmacology. 42.

The information on α1-AR phosphorylation/desensitization is far less complete. α1-ARs couple to the phosphoinositide turnover/calcium mobilization pathway (18.Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of other signal transduction processes such as modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activities has also been reported (21.Hu Z.-W. Shi X.-Y.

These receptors participate in a plethora of physiological actions, including autonomic neurotransmission and the control of cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal functions. They modulate metabolic pathways, smooth-muscle contraction, water and electrolyte metabolism, and vascular tone. Long term effects of α1-AR stimulation include expression of c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogenes and cell growth and proliferation (20.Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Therefore, knowledge of these receptors and their regulation is of interest from basic, clinical, and therapeutic perspectives. Three α1-ARs have been cloned, i.e. the α1a-, α1b-, and α1d-ARs (Refs. 31.Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of PKC with TPA markedly inhibited the actions mediated through the α1b- and α1d-ARs, whereas those mediated through α1a-ARs were only marginally altered (18.Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). The α1b-AR was the first to be cloned (31.Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K.

Other studies have reported the presence of α1a-AR as the predominant subtype present in the human prostate and have suggested the use of specific α1a-AR antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (29.Lepor H.

In our opinion, further knowledge of the molecular events that regulate α1a-AR may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of such conditions and potentially to new approaches to alleviate them. In this work, we show that α1a-ARs are phosphorylated as a consequence of agonist binding or PKC activation. Interestingly, these events affect α1a-ARs to a very limited extent, which is in marked contrast to the desensitization that has been observed with α1b-ARs.

For all of the experiments, confluent cells were serum-deprived overnight in unsupplemented DMEM. [3H]Prazosin binding was performed as described previously (18.Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent fibroblasts were incubated overnight in DMEM without serum and antibiotics. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM in Krebs-Ringer Hepes containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached by gentle trypsinization. Experiments were performed with about 106 cells suspended in 3 ml of the above mentioned buffer supplemented with 1.2 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 spectrometer with the excitation monochromator set at 340 and 380 nm, with a chopper interval of 0.5 s, and the emission monochromator set at 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to Grynkiewiczet al. (38.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the software provided by Aminco-Bowman; traces were directly exported to the graphs. Cells were treated with the different agents to be tested. After stimulation, cells were washed and scraped with a rubber policeman in buffer containing: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, and the previously mentioned protease inhibitors. Membranes were prepared as described (11.Vázquez-Prado J. Medina L.C. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27330-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.10m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm GDP. [35S]GTPγS binding was performed as described by Wieland and Jakobs (39.Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Iyengar R. Methods in Enzymology. 237. Academic Press, London1994: 3-13Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The binding reaction was carried out in a volume of 250 μl for 30 min at 25 °C in binding buffer containing 0.2 nm[35S]GTPγS. The reaction was initiated by the addition of membranes (25 μg protein/tube) and terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and filtration on Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel harvester. Filters were washed three times and dried, and radioactivity was measured with a Beckman LS 6000 SC liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 30 μm cold GTPγS, represented about 10% of total binding. Statistical analysis between comparable groups was performed using analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls analysis with the software included in the GraphPad Prism 2.01 program. Membranes from Rat-1 cells expressing bovine α1a-AR or Cos-1 cells expressing chimeric receptors (see below) were obtained as described previously (11.Vázquez-Prado J. Medina L.C. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27330-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the dark, membranes (25 μg of protein) were incubated with 6 nm[125I]arylazidoprazosin essentially as described (11.Vázquez-Prado J. Medina L.C. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27330-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After 1 h at room temperature, 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin 20 μg/ml, aprotinin 20 μg/ml, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 100 μg/ml, bacitracin 500 μg/ml, and soybean trypsin inhibitor 50 μg/ml) was added. Open tubes were exposed to UV light for 3 min (Stratalinker, Stratagene). Membranes were centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 15 min, washed, and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis containing 7m urea under reducing conditions. The specificity of the labeling was determined using 10 μm phentolamine as a competitor. The carboxyl-terminal domain of bovine α1a-AR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AAGGATCCCAAGAGTTTAAAAAGGCC-3′ (sense) corresponding to bases 971–988 of the bovine α1aORF with an additional BamHI site; and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGACTTCCTCCCCATTTTCACT-3′ (antisense) corresponding to bases 1378–1398 of the gene with an EcoRI site. The amplified fragment (432 bp) was digested withBamHI-EcoRI and ligated with pGEX2T (Pierce) digested with the same enzymes. The construction was analyzed by restriction analysis and automatic sequencing. The induced fusion protein contained the complete GST protein joined to the last 139 amino acids of the bovine α1a-AR and was used to immunize rabbits. Photoaffinity-labeled membranes expressing α1a-ARs were used to standardize immunoprecipitation of the receptor. Rabbit antiserum against the described GST-α1a-AR fusion protein was used. Membranes were solubilized in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, and the previously mentioned protease inhibitors). After 1 h at 4 °C, the extracts were centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing 10 μl of immune serum. Tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then, 40 μl of Sepharose-coupled protein A, 50% (v/v) slurry were added and incubated for 1–2 h. Beads were washed five times (1 ml/each) with 50 mm Hepes, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, and 100 mm NaF. Washed beads were suspended in 50 μl of 10% SDS and vortexed, and then 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% mercaptoethanol were added. Samples were incubated for 5 min in a boiling bath and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels containing 7 m urea. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to X-OMAT x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Immunoprecipitation of α1b-ARs was performed with an antibody generated against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of these receptors (11.Vázquez-Prado J. Medina L.C. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27330-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the procedure described above. Analysis of immunoprecipitation was performed in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with the included ImageQuant software. Serum samples able to immunoprecipitate at least 70% of the photoaffinity-labeled receptors were used. Rat-1 fibroblasts, expressing the bovine α1a-ARs or the hamster α1b-ARs, were cultured in culture dishes (10-cm diameter). Cells reaching confluence were serum-starved for 24 h. For the experiments using only cells expressing α1a-ARs, fibroblasts were maintained in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h and then incubated in 3 ml of the same medium containing [32P]Pi (0.2 mCi/ml) for 3–5 h at 37 °C. In the experiments in which the phosphorylation of α1a- and α1b-ARs were compared, the amount of radioactive phosphate was 0.1 mCi/ml. Labeled cells were stimulated with NE or TPA as indicated, and then they were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1.0 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm p-serine, 1 mm p-threonine, and 1 mm p-tyrosine. The plates were maintained on ice for 1 h. Then the extracts were centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described above. At least three independent experiments were performed for each treatment. Receptor phosphorylation was detected with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantified with ImageQuant software. Data were within the linear range of detection of the apparatus and were plotted using Prism 2.01, GraphPad software. cDNAs for wild type bovine α1a-AR in pBluescript and hamster α1b-AR in pSP65, containing 5′ and 3′ nontranslated regions, were generous gifts from Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University). Chimeric α1ab-AR and α1ba-AR were constructed by interchanging their carboxyl-terminal tails. A conservedPvuII site located in the coding sequence of the seventh transmembrane segment of both cDNAs was used for the ligation of fragments. cDNAs in the original plasmids were digested withEcoRI and PvuII, and the 5′ cDNA of the α1a-AR was ligated with the 3′ cDNA of the α1b-AR and vice versa; chimeric cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 for expression in Cos-1 cells. Fragments used for the construction of chimeric receptors were obtained from digestions in original plasmids. From the α1a-AR cDNA these fragments were: (a) a 1136-bpEcoRI-PvuII fragment containing the 5′ nontranslated sequence and the information for the amino-terminal 319 amino acids; and (b) a 1456-bpPvuII-EcoRI fragment containing the coding sequence for the 147 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus and the 3′ nontranslated sequence. Fragments from the α1b-AR cDNA, obtained by partial digestion, were: (a) a 1036-bpEcoRI-PvuII fragment containing the 5′ nontranslated sequence plus the information for the amino-terminal 341 amino acids; and (b) a 1069-bpPvuII-EcoRI fragment containing the information for the carboxyl-terminal 174 amino acids and the 3′ nontranslated sequence. Because inefficient expression (binding sites) was obtained with plasmids that contained 3′ and 5′ noncoding sequences, these regions from wild type and chimeric receptors were eliminated by polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotides were: 5′-AAGATATCGAATTCATGAATCCCGATCTGGACACC-3′ (sense) corresponding to bases 1–21 from the hamster α1b ORF, containing additional restriction sites for EcoRV and EcoRI; 5′TAGAATTCGCGGCCGCCTAAAAGTGCCCGGGTGCCAG-3′ (antisense) corresponding to bases 1527–1545 from the hamster α1b-AR ORF, with additional NotI and EcoRI restriction sites; 5′-AAGATATCGAATTCATGGTGTTTCTCTCCGGAAAT-3′ (sense) corresponding to bases 1–21 from the bovine α1a-AR ORF, withEcoRV and EcoRI sites; and 5′-TAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTAGACTTCCTCCCCATTTTC-3′ (antisense) corresponding to bases 1380–1401 of the bovine α1aORF, with NotI and EcoRI sites. The initial constructions on pcDNA3 were used on polymerase chain reactions with the convenient combination of oligonucleotides, and the resulting products were digested with EcoRI-NotI and ligated with pcDNA3 digested with the same enzymes. These new constructions were sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer from Perkin-Elmer. Transient transfection of wild type and chimeric receptors into Cos-1 cells was performed using DEAE-dextran (40.González A.L. Joly E. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 216-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells at 50–70% confluence (seeded the previous day) were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid for each 10-cm Petri dish. Experiments with transient transfected cells were performed 48–72 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency (60–80%) was determined in"

We examined the role of Myb proteins in the regulation of bcl-2 expression in lymphoma cells. We showed that A-Myb up-regulates bcl-2promoter activity. Northern and Western analyses demonstrated that A-Myb was expressed in the DHL-4 t(14;18) cell line. In t(14;18) cells and mature B cells, A-Myb up-regulated bcl-2 expression, whereas B- and c-Myb had little effect on bcl-2 gene expression. Deletion analysis of the bcl-2 5′-region identified a region responsive to A-Myb in t(14;18) cells. A potential binding site for the Cdx homeodomain proteins was located in this sequence. Analysis of the A-Myb-responsive region by UV cross-linking experiments revealed that a 32-kDa protein formed a complex with this region, but direct binding by Myb proteins could not be demonstrated. A-Myb could be recovered along with Cdx2 when nuclear extracts were passed over the Cdx site. Mutagenesis of the Cdx binding site abolished binding by the 32-kDa protein and significantly reduced the ability of A-Myb to induce bcl-2 expression. A strong induction ofbcl-2 P2 promoter activity was observed in cotransfection studies of DHL-4 cells with the A-Myb and Cdx2 expression vectors, and increased endogenous Bcl-2 protein expression was observed in B cells transfected with A-Myb and/or Cdx2 expression constructs.

Science. 1983; 221: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The translocation of the bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18q to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus at 14q results in the deregulated expression of bcl-2 (2.Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The overexpression of bcl-2 in t(14;18) lymphoma leads to high levels of bcl-2 mRNA and protein, which act to protect cells from apoptosis (3.Graninger W.B. Seto M. Boutain B. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Clin. Inv. 1987; 80: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). During B cell development, bcl-2is expressed at low levels in pre-B cells, in which extensive cell death occurs by apoptosis, whereas bcl-2 expression is higher in mature and activated B cells (3.Graninger W.B. Seto M. Boutain B. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Clin. Inv. 1987; 80: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4.Gurfinkel N. Unger T. Givol D. Mushinski J.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of normal and deregulated expression of bcl-2 remain unclear although recent studies have provided some insight. In t(14;18) cells, regulatory elements of both the bcl-2 promoter and the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancers are believed to play a role inbcl-2 overexpression. Two promoters mediate initiation of bcl-2 gene transcription. The 5′-promoter (P1) is located 1306–1423 base pairs upstream of the translational start site (5.Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This is a TATA-less, GC-rich promoter that displays multiple start sites. The 3′-promoter (P2) is located 1.3 kilobases downstream of the P1 promoter (5.Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The P2 promoter contains a TATA-box and CCAAT element. A number of negative regulatory sites have been described in the bcl-2 promoter region. We have previously demonstrated three π1 binding sites, which function as negative regulators of bcl-2 expression in pre-B cells (6.Chen H.-M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3840-3847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT1 protein has also been shown to repressbcl-2 activity in HeLa cells and B cells (7.Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. McDonnell T.J. Rauscher F.J.I. Saunders G.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5386-5389PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Heckman C. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19609-19614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, a negative regulatory element upstream of the P2 promoter has been described, although the proteins that bind to this element have not been identified (9.Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor has been shown to mediate repression of bcl-2 directly or indirectly through a 195-base pair region (10.Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar). We have also characterized a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element that is responsible for the positive regulation of bcl-2 expression during the activation of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B cells from calcium-dependent apoptosis (11.Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In chicken myeloid cells, v-Myb was reported to function as an anti-apoptotic factor by up-regulation of bcl-2 expression, whereas in murine T cells, both c-Myb and B-Myb were shown to induce bcl-2promoter activity (12.Frampton J. Ramqvist T. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2720-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13.Taylor D. Badiani P. Weston K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14.Grassilli E. Salomoni P. Perrotti D. Franceschi C. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2451-2456PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear if the Myb transcription factors have a similar function in human B cells. From our studies of the deregulation of bcl-2 in t(14;18) lymphoma cells, we have shown that the cAMP-response element site in the 5′-flanking sequence of the translocated bcl-2 gene is occupied (15.Ji L. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22687-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cAMP-response element-binding protein family of proteins was shown to bind to this site in vitro, and the maximal increase in bcl-2 activity mediated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancers in transient transfection assays was dependent on an intact cAMP-response element site. We have also described an in vivo footprint over a WT1 site on the normal silent bcl-2 allele; this site displayed a negative regulatory activity (8.Heckman C. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19609-19614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The site was not occupied on the translocated allele, and the presence of the immunoglobulin enhancers prevented the repression by WT1. We now describe the positive regulation of bcl-2 promoter activity by the A-Myb transcription factor. The Myb family of transcription factors, which includes the structurally related A-, B-,and c-Myb genes, is thought to play a pivotal role in differentiation and proliferation of various cells. Each member is able to transactivate promoters with the consensus sequence PyAAC(G/T)G (16.Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H.

In this study, we show that A-Myb and B-Myb, but not c-Myb, are expressed in t(14;18) lymphoma cells. We also demonstrate that A-Myb is an effective activator of thebcl-2 promoter in t(14;18) and mature B cells, but it does not bind to a consensus sequence within the bcl-2 promoter. We show that A-Myb mediates positive regulatory activity through a Cdx homeodomain protein binding site and that A-Myb and a Cdx family member, Cdx2, are components of the complex formed at this sequence. By cotransfection studies, we demonstrate that the expression of A-Myb and Cdx2 results in a marked increase in bcl-2 promoter activity. The endogenous Bcl-2 protein is also increased when A-Myb and/or Cdx2 are transfected into B cells. Because the role of Bcl-2 in protection from apoptosis is well established in B cells, A-Myb functions as an anti-apoptotic factor through its ability to up-regulate Bcl-2 expression. The bcl-2-promoter-luciferase constructs have been described previously (11.Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Deletions of the bcl-25′-flanking sequence were made by polymerase chain reaction subfragment cloning or by insertion of restriction enzyme sites using site-directed mutagenesis methods (CLONTECH and Stratagene) followed by subfragment cloning. Constructs with mutations in the Cdx or Myb binding sites were generated from the −748 construct using the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide sequences used as the mutagenic primers are as follows with the transcription factor binding siteunderlined and the mutated bases in boldface: Cdx Mut, GGGAAACGCACCTGATTTTTTACTTCGCCGTTTGTTTTTTCTTTAACCTTTTCAGC; 5′-Myb Mut, GGGCGAGAGGTG TCGAAGGCCCCCGTTAC; 3′-Myb Mut, GCCGTTGGCCC TCGAAG CTTTTCCTCTGGG. The construct with mutations in both Myb binding sites was generated from the 3′-Myb Mut construct. The oligonucleotide sequence used as the mutagenic primer was: GGGCGAGAGGTG TCGAAGGCCCTCGAAGC. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The rat Cdx2 expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. Eric Sibley (Stanford University). The human A-, B-, and c-Myb and the rat Cdx2 expression vectors consisted of the full-length coding region under the control of the SV40 promoter or the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. The Cdx2-myc tag construct (Cdx2-M) was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rat Cdx2 coding region using the previously described Cdx2 expression vector and Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The antisense primer used for amplification introduced a HindIII site in place of the stop codon, whereas the sense primer reflected the Cdx2 sequence. The amplified product was cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The gel-purified Cdx2 DNA was cloned into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of the pCMV-Tag5 vector (Stratagene) resulting in the Cdx2 sequence followed in frame by the c-Myc epitope sequence. The Cdx2-M construct showed the same activity on the bcl-2 promoter in transient transfection assays as the original Cdx2 construct. The deletion constructs of A-Myb have been described previously (27.Facchinetti V. Loffarelli L. Schreek S. Oelgeschlager M. Luscher B. Introna M. Golay J. Biochem.

DNA transfections were performed as described previously (8.Heckman C. Mochon E. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19609-19614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For cotransfections, 10 μg of the reporter plasmid was transfected with 5 μg of the A-Myb and/or Cdx2 expression vectors or empty expression vector. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant at 20 μg using empty expression vector as needed. Reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase assay system (Promega). Each transfection was performed at least three times in duplicate with at least two different plasmid preparations. The normalized average values with standard deviations were plotted. Total RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). For each sample, 25 μg of RNA was loaded onto a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The RNA was blotted onto a Nytran Plus filter (Schleicher & Schuell) and UV cross-linked using a UV-Stratalinker (Stratagene). Hybridization was performed using the high efficiency hybridization system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Research Center). Probes of cdx2, A-, B-, and c-myb were obtained by digestion of the cDNA with EcoRI, SpeI,XhoI, or BamHI, respectively. The cDNA fragments were labeled by random priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human β-actin cDNA was used to control for variations in RNA loading. The antibodies specific for B- and c-Myb, Bcl-2, and c-Myc were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody to β-Actin was from Sigma. The A-Myb-specific antiserum and the immunoblotting procedure have been previously described (25.Golay J. Facchinetti V. Ying G. Introna M. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1997; 26: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To strip the blots for re-probing, the nitrocellulose membranes were placed in a buffer consisting of 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, and incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. The blots were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline-Tween for 10 min at room temperature before blocking and incubation with antibody. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used for EMSA of the A-Myb-responsive region in the bcl-2 P2 promoter are shown below with the Cdx binding site underlined and the mutated bases inboldface. SEQUENCE 1 SEQUENCE 2 The oligonucleotides were synthesized with 5′-overhangs and labeled by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow polymerase. The binding reaction mixture contained 10mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 ng (104cpm) of end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probe, and 5–10μg of protein from crude nuclear extract. Electrophoresis was performed as described previously (30.Phan S.C. Feeley B. Withers D. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2387-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as above with the binding reaction scaled up 5-fold. UV cross-linking and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described previously (30.Phan S.C. Feeley B. Withers D. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2387-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides representing the Bcl-2 Cdx and mutated Cdx (Mut Cdx) sequences shown above were synthesized, and 5 μg of the sense strand of each sequence was 3′-labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Stratagene) and biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc.). The biotin-labeled sense strands were annealed to 5 μg of their complementary antisense strand and purified over a Sephadex column. The concentration of purified oligos was measured by a 260-nm absorbance measurement, and equal amounts of the annealed Cdx and Mut Cdx oligos were incubated separately with strepavidin-coated magnetic beads (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. Coupling of the oligos to the magnetic beads was assessed by absorbance measurement at 260 nm. For the binding reactions, 500 μg of nuclear extract prepared from DHL-4 cells transfected with the Cdx2-M vector was incubated with 100 μl of Cdx- or Mut Cdx-coupled beads in EMSA buffer (30.Phan S.C. Feeley B. Withers D. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2387-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg of poly(dI·dC) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then captured by a magnet, washed three times with EMSA buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Detection of Cdx2-M, A-Myb, and B-Myb was performed using the c-Myc, A-Myb, and B-Myb antibodies and the immunoblotting procedure described above. DHL-9 or DHL-4 cells were transfected using the previously described procedure with 10 μg of the pHook2 vector (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of A-Myb and/or 5 μg of Cdx2-M vectors or an equivalent amount of empty expression vector. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the transfected cells were selected for sFV expression using hapten-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of transfected or nontransfected control cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Western detection was done using the previously described Bcl-2 antibody, whereas the β-actin antibody was used to assess protein loading and normalize the level of Bcl-2 expression. To elucidate the role of the Myb family of transcription factors in the up-regulation of bcl-2 gene expression, we determined the pattern of Myb expression in malignant B cells. We tested for A-, B-, and c-myb RNA expression in the four B cell lines Nalm-6, DHL-9, DHL-4, and Raji by Northern blot analysis. Using radiolabeled probes specific for either A-, B-, or c-myb, we found that A-myb was expressed in the two cell lines containing translocations, DHL-4 and Raji, but A-myb was not expressed in Nalm-6 or DHL-9 cells (Fig.1 A). In contrast to A-myb, c-myb was not expressed in DHL-4 or Raji cells but was expressed in Nalm-6 and DHL-9 cells (Fig. 1 A). B-myb was expressed in all four cell lines (Fig.1 A). To determine if myb RNA levels correlated with Myb protein levels, we examined a number of B cell lines for A-, B-, and c-Myb protein expression by Western blot analysis. In testing for A-Myb expression, the BJAB Burkitt's cell line and the IM-9 myeloid cell line were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Similar to the Northern data, A-Myb was expressed in DHL-4 cells and Raji but not in DHL-9 or Nalm-6 cells (Fig. 1 B). The Nalm-6, DHL-9, DHL-4, and Raji cells were examined for B- and c-Myb protein expression. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the pattern of B- and c-Myb protein expression exactly paralleled the pattern of RNA expression. A schematic representation of the human bcl-25′-flanking and 5′-untranslated regions is shown in Fig.2 A. Sequence analysis revealed two potential binding sites for Myb proteins in the bcl-2 P2 promoter. To determine if the Myb transcription factors were capable of regulating the bcl-2 5′-(P1) and 3′-(P2) promoters, cotransfection experiments were performed. Transfection of DHL-9 cells with the construct containing both thebcl-2 P1 and P2 promoters and an A-Myb expression vector resulted in a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity over the activity of the promoter construct when cotransfected with an empty expression vector (Fig. 2 B). When the same construct was transfected with a B- or c-Myb expression vector, there was little change in the promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). When a construct containing thebcl-2 P2 promoter was transfected with the A-Myb expression vector into DHL-9 cells, the result was a 6- to 7-fold increase in luciferase activity, which was similar to that of the construct containing both the P1 and P2 promoters (Fig. 2 B). Transfection of the same construct with the B-Myb expression vector showed less than a 3-fold induction of luciferase activity, whereas transfection with the c-Myb expression vector resulted in less than a 2-fold increase (Fig. 2 B). These data suggested that B- and c-Myb, both of which are expressed in DHL-9 cells, have very little effect on bcl-2 promoter activity. Although A-Myb is not expressed in DHL-9 cells, it was a strong inducer of thebcl-2 promoter, primarily acting through the P2 promoter. Because A-Myb is expressed in DHL-4 cells but not in DHL-9 cells, our studies focused on DHL-4 cells. To assess the activity of the Myb proteins on the bcl-2promoter in t(14;18) cells, the same constructs were transfected into the DHL-4 cell line. In these cells, A-Myb acted as a powerful inducer of the bcl-2 promoter. When the construct containing the P1 and P2 promoters was transfected with the A-Myb expression vector into DHL-4 cells, the result was a 30-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2 C). A-Myb also increased the activity of thebcl-2 P2 promoter by more than 30-fold (Fig. 2 C). Unlike A-Myb, B- and c-Myb had no significant effect on thebcl-2 P2 promoter activity in DHL-4 cells (Fig.2 C). These results suggested that A-Myb, rather than B- or c-Myb, was the functional Myb family member with respect tobcl-2 promoter activity in DHL-4 cells. Both the P1 and P2 promoters are utilized in DHL-4 cells, and A-Myb acts primarily through the P2 promoter. To identify the region of thebcl-2 P2 promoter responsive to A-Myb, deletion constructs of this promoter were transfected with an A-Myb expression vector into DHL-4 cells. Sequence analysis of the P2 promoter revealed a TATA-box, a CCAAT element, an octamer site, and two potential Myb binding sites (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, results from the transfection studies showed that the region mediating induction by A-Myb was between −297 and −324, which is upstream of the Myb consensus sequences (Fig. 3 B). When this region was deleted, induction of the bcl-2 P2 promoter by A-Myb was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3 B). Comparison of this region with a transcription factor data base revealed a potential binding site for the Cdx homeodomain protein family members flanked by stretches of AT-rich sequences. These results suggested that induction of thebcl-2 P2 promoter by A-Myb was not mediated by the Myb binding sites but possibly through a homeodomain protein binding site. To determine if a protein interacted specifically with the A-Myb-responsive region of the bcl-2 P2 promoter, EMSA was performed using an oligonucleotide encompassing the sequence. Two specific complexes and a few nonspecific complexes formed when the labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with DHL-4 nuclear extract (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Formation of the specific complexes could be prevented by competition with a 100-fold or greater molar excess of unlabeled cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–4), but not by a 500-fold molar excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A, lane 8). To assess the involvement of the Cdx sequence in the specific complex formation, an oligonucleotide containing a change of the core Cdx binding site from ATTA to GCGG was used as a competitor. As shown in Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–7, this oligonucleotide was not able to compete for the two specific complexes formed by the wild-type sequence, even at a 500-fold molar excess. When the mutant oligonucleotide was labeled and incubated with DHL-4 nuclear extract, no specific complexes were formed (Fig.4 A, lanes 9–12). EMSA followed by UV cross-linking and SDS denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed to determine the composition of the two specific complexes. In each case, a single protein was observed (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). After correction for the bound oligonucleotide, the molecular mass was 32 kDa (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). This is approximately the size of the Cdx homeodomain proteins. There was no antibody available against Cdx so we were not able to confirm by Western blot analysis that this protein was a Cdx family member. We also do not have an antibody to supershift A-Myb so we could not confirm by EMSA that A-Myb was in the complex binding to the Cdx site. We also attempted to characterize the faster migrating EMSA complexes because these displayed such strong binding. Loss of these complexes in the EMSA studies could only be achieved by mutation of the Cdx binding site as well as the AT-rich sequences flanking the Cdx site. 2C. A. Heckman, J. W. Mehew, and L. M. Boxer, unpublished data. EMSA followed by UV cross-linking and SDS denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed that the complexes involved a protein of 29 kDa.2 We suspect that this protein may be one of the high mobility group family members, because these proteins bind to AT-rich regions, and they display relatively nonspecific binding. High mobility group 1 has a molecular mass of 29 kDa. Studies with in vitro translated A-Myb and Cdx2-M did not reveal any interaction between these two proteins.2 To determine whether an interaction required DNA or other nuclear proteins, we prepared nuclear extracts from DHL-4 cells transfected with Cdx2-M. The nuclear extract was incubated with the biotinylated Cdx or Mut Cdx oligonucleotide immobilized on strepavidin-coated magnetic beads. After washing the beads, the bound nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Cdx2-M bound to the Cdx oligonucleotide but not to the oligonucleotide with the mutated Cdx2 site. Endogenous A-Myb but not B-Myb was present in the protein complex that bound to the wild-type Cdx site. These results strengthen our conclusion that the UV cross-linked protein of 32 kDa is Cdx2 and demonstrate that A-Myb is a component of the protein complex formed at the Cdx binding site. To determine if the Cdx binding sequence was responsible for the induction of thebcl-2 P2 promoter activity by A-Myb, a construct containing a mutant Cdx site was generated (Fig.5 A). Constructs containing mutations in either of the two Myb consensus sequences, or both, were also generated to eliminate the possibility that these sites were necessary for induction of the bcl-2 P2 promoter by A-Myb (Fig. 5 A). Although some loss of basal transcriptional activity was observed with the construct containing the mutated Cdx binding site, no change was observed in basal activity when the Myb binding sites were mutated.2 As shown in Fig.5 B, disruption of the Cdx binding site resulted in a drastic loss in the ability of A-Myb to induce the P2 promoter in DHL-4 cells (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the constructs containing mutations in the Myb sequences displayed no loss in their induction by A-Myb (Fig. 5 B). Constructs containing mutations in the AT-rich sequences flanking the Cdx binding site were also tested by transient transfection assay, but these mutations showed no loss inbcl-2 promoter activation by"

Regulation of TIMP-1 gene expression is mainly mediated at the level of gene transcription and involves the activation of several well known transcription factors including those belonging to the AP-1, STAT, and Pea3/Ets families. In the current study, we have used DNase-1 footprinting to identify a new regulatory element (5′-TGTGGTTTCCG-3′) present in the human TIMP-1 gene promoter. Mutagenesis and transfection studies in culture-activated rat hepatic stellate cells and the human Jurkat T cell line demonstrated that the new element named upstream TIMP-1 element-1 (UTE-1) is essential for transcriptional activity of the human TIMP-1 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies revealed that UTE-1 can form protein-DNA complexes of distinct mobilities with nuclear extracts from a variety of mammalian cell types and showed that induction of a high mobility UTE-1 complex is associated with culture activation of freshly isolated rat hepatic stellate cells. A combination of UV-cross-linking and Southwestern blotting techniques demonstrated that UTE-1 directly interacts with a 30-kDa nuclear protein that appears to be present in all cell types tested. We conclude that UTE-1 is a novel regulatory element that in combination with its cellular binding proteins may be an important component of the mechanisms controlling TIMP-1 expression in normal and pathological states.

The serum response element, which is critical for responsiveness of the promoter to growth factors, cytokines, and viruses, is composed of binding sites for AP-1 (Fos/Jun), signal transducer and activator of transcription, and Pea3 (Ets) transcription factors. Mutagenesis studies performed in several primary and transformed cell lines have established that the AP-1 site within the serum response element is critical for basal and inducible transcription (26.Campbell C.E.

We have recently reported that this AP-1 site is critical for the function of a minimal active 162-bp human TIMP-1 promoter in human fibroblasts and culture-activated rat HSCs (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33.Clark I.M.

The molecular events underlying HSC activation and induction of TIMP-1 can be studied in a cell culture model in which freshly isolated primary HSCs cultured for several days on tissue culture plastic undergo a similar phenotypic transformation to that observedin vivo (4.Friedman S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 30.Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J.P. Ferris W.F. Alcolado R. Winwood P.J. Clark N.

Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies using this culture model showed that induction of TIMP-1 promoter activity occurred at culture time points (5 days or more) associated with morphological and biochemical activation of rat HSCs and with induced expression of JunD, Fra2, and FosB, implicating these AP-1 proteins in the control of TIMP-1 expression in activated HSCs (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whereas the role of the AP-1 containing serum response element site in the regulation of TIMP-1 gene transcription is well characterized, much of the 162-bp minimal active human TIMP-1 promoter remains functionally undefined. We have therefore used DNase I footprinting (35.Jackson S.P. James B.D. Higgens S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 189-242Google Scholar) to identify DNA-protein interactions occurring on the promoter in cells expressing high levels of TIMP-1. We report the identification of previously undescribed DNA-protein interactions at a novel regulatory sequence named upstream TIMP-1 element 1 (UTE-1). The site appears to be essential for transcriptional activity in a variety of cell types including activated primary human and rat HSCs as well as transformed human cell lines. We describe the characterization of nuclear proteins capable of interacting with the UTE-1 sequence in a specific manner and the identification of a 30-kDa species that directly binds to UTE-1 DNA. HSCs were isolated from the livers of normal Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (400 ± 50 g) by sequential perfusion with pronase and collagenase as described previously (36.Arthur M.J.P. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Bissell D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 84: 1076-1085Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HSCs were separated from the cell suspension over an 11.5% Optiprep (Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo) gradient followed by elutriation. HSCs were seeded onto plastic and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of adult male patients following partial hepatectomy. Sequential perfusion with pronase and collagenase was carried out as described for isolation of rat HSCs (36.Arthur M.J.P. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Bissell D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 84: 1076-1085Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HSCs were separated from the cell suspension over an 11.5% Optiprep gradient and cultured onto plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells using a modified version of the protocol described by Dignamet al. (37.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (107) were harvested into 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation at 2500 rpm. The pellets were resuspended into 100 μl of Dignam buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 s to pellet the Nonidet P-40-insoluble material, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended into 50 μl of Dignam buffer C, incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing to disrupt the nuclear membranes. Extracts were centrifuged for 1 min at 8000 rpm, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were discarded. The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). The TIMP-1 minimal promoter (positions −102 to +60) was 5′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (10 units; Promega). Nuclear extract (10 μg) from HSCs was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) nonspecific DNA competitor (Sigma) for 10 min, and the radiolabeled TIMP-1 minimal promoter (100 ng) was then added and incubated for a further 20 min. DNase I (0.05 units; type 4, bovine pancreas; Sigma) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 min. All reactions were carried out at 4 °C. DNase I footprinting reactions were resolved on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside a purine marker ladder. A 20-base pair oligonucleotide (UTE-1) was constructed to the region of the minimal promoter protected from DNase I digestion in the DNase I footprinting experiments. The UTE-1 sense strand oligonucleotide (5′-AGGCCTGTGGTTTCCGCACC-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled UTE-1 sense strand was then annealed to the UTE-1 antisense strand (5′-GGTGCGGAAACCACAGGCCT-3′). EMSA reactions were performed as described previously (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38.Elsharkawy A.M. Wright M.C.

The standard EMSA reaction consisted of an initial incubation of the nuclear extract (5 μg) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 18 μl for 10 min. The annealed radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (2 μl; 0.1 ng μl−1) was added to the reaction and incubated for a further 20 min. All reactions were carried out at 4 °C. For competition assays excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (2–20 ng; Table I) was added to the reaction mixture with the nuclear extract and poly(dI-dC) for the initial incubation, prior to the addition the probe.

Mutations (5 or 2 base pairs, as underlined) were introduced across the region to determine the essential binding nucleotides for this novel site. A CAT reporter plasmid (pBLCAT3) containing the TIMP-1 162-bp minimal promoter (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) cloned into the HindIII andPstI site, upstream of the CAT gene, was used in all functional studies. The UTE-1 mutant sequence was generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis of the wild type minimal promoter using the following oligonucleotide primers: mutant forward primer (5′-CCTGGAGGCCCAGTAGCTCCACACCCGCTG-3′) and reverse primer (5′- CAAGCTGCAGCCCAGCTCCGGTCCCTGCTG-3′). Primary human and rat HSCs (8-day activated) seeded at 1 × 106/well on a six-well plate and Jurkat T cells (5 × 106) were transfected using 1 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen Maxiprep, Qiagen) with the transfection reagent Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and left in contact with the cells for 48 h. CAT assays were performed as described by Gorman (39.Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). In brief, cell extracts were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw cycles and normalized for protein content using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, and CAT activities were determined using [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and acetyl-CoA (Sigma). Acetylated products were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by phosphor imaging. CAT activities were normalized to the amount of DNA taken up by cultures, determined using a modification of Hirt's assay (40.Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). The UTE-1 oligonucleotide was radiolabeled as described previously for EMSA. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 8 μl for 10 min; the oligonucleotide probe (2 μl; 0.1 ng μl−1) was then added to the reaction and incubated for a further 20 min. DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked by UV radiation for 1 h at 1200 KJ cm−2 (λ = 305 nm) and resolved by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 mA, 1 h). All reactions were carried out at 4 °C. The Southwestern blotting technique is a variation of the traditional Western blotting method (35.Jackson S.P. James B.D. Higgens S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 189-242Google Scholar). Following transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane DNA binding proteins are detected with a radiolabeled DNA probe (UTE-1 oligonucleotide). Nuclear extracts (30 μg) from rat activated HSCs, Jurkat T cells, and Daudi B cells were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The UTE-1 DNA probe (15 ng) was prepared as described for EMSA studies and hybridized to the membrane at room temperature for 30 min. Potential binding sites for transcription factors within the TIMP-1 minimal promoter were identified by DNase I footprinting. Nuclear extract from 1-day and 8-day cultured rat HSCs were used for footprinting in an attempt to identify DNA-protein interactions that are induced during HSC activation. When using nuclear extract from activated 8-day cultured HSCs, a large proportion of the TIMP-1 minimal promoter was protected from the DNase I digestion in comparison with the control track (−) digested in the absence of nuclear extract (Fig. 1 A). The protected regions included the potential Sp1 site, TATA-like box, and a previously undescribed 11-bp region downstream from the AP-1 and Pea-3 sites at nucleotides −63 to −53 of the human TIMP-1 gene (Fig.1 B). The 11-bp region was also protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear proteins isolated from 1-day cultured HSCs, although the intensity of the footprint was markedly reduced relative to that observed with 8-day cultured HSCs (Fig. 1 A). The protected 11-bp sequence (5′-TGTGGTTTCCG-3′) was analyzed on sequence data bases (EMBL, GenBankTM, Transfac) in an attempt to identify possible matches with previously characterized transcription factor binding sites. Some sequence homology was found with the AP3 site (5′-TGGGACTTTCCA-3′) and an AP3-like (AP3-L; 5′-TGTGGAAAATCT-3′) site that resembles the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT-1; 5′-AGGAGGAAAAACT-3′) binding site (41.Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Emiliani S. John M. Jie T. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6113-6127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No exact match was identified; therefore, the footprinted region was named upstream TIMP-1 Element 1 (UTE-1). UTE-1-protein interactions were investigated using a double-stranded 20-base pair oligonucleotide (5′-AGGCCTGTGGTTTCCGCACC-3′), constructed to span the UTE-1 element of the TIMP-1 minimal promoter (TableI). Since TIMP-1 is expressed by a variety of different cell types, it was of interest to establish the expression pattern of UTE-1-binding proteins in various mammalian cell lines as well as primary human and rat HSCs. Fig.2 A shows that a retardation complex was obtained with nuclear extracts from all cell types tested, although there were distinct qualitative and quantitative differences observed between the cells. Culture-activated primary rat HSCs and human Jurkat T cells gave rise to similar high mobility UTE-1 DNA-protein complexes, although the relative abundance was far greater for Jurkat T cells. Culture-activated primary human HSCs assembled a lower mobility complex that was of similar mobility and abundance to UTE-1 complexes observed with Daudi B cell and THP-1 monocyte-macrophage cell lines. Passaging of human HSCs, which gives a higher selectivity for HSCs over other cell types (Kupfer cells in particular) that contaminate the original primary culture, was associated with a change in the mobility and abundance of the UTE-1 binding complex. These changes generated a DNA-protein complex that was more similar to the complex observed with pure (95%) primary rat HSCs. These results suggest that UTE-1-binding proteins probably exist in most mammalian cell types; however, the nature and abundance of the DNA-protein complexes formed at promoters may vary between cell types. Since we have previously reported that transcriptional activity of the human TIMP-1 promoter is induced during HSC activation (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) it was of interest to determine if UTE-1-binding proteins are also induced during the culturing of freshly isolated HSCs. For these experiments, we used rat HSCs previously shown to support transcriptional activity of the human TIMP-1 promoter (31.Bahr M.J. Vincent K.J. Arthur M.J.P. Fowler A.V. Smart D.E. Wright M.C. Clark I.M. Benyon R.C. Iredale J.P. Mann D.A. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EMSA reactions with nuclear extracts from different time points of HSC activation on plastic revealed the existence of multiple DNA-protein complexes of dissimilar electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 2 B). Freshly isolated HSCs expressed multiple UTE-1 complexes that upon culturing were replaced by two complexes of lower mobility that persisted for the first 24 h of culture. Subsequent periods of culture were associated with the loss of the low mobility complexes and induction of at least one higher mobility complex that was maximally expressed at day 5 of culture and persisted for at least a further 9 days (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the appearance of the high mobility UTE-1 complex at 3 days and its maximal induction at 5 days are synchronous with thede novo expression and peak induction of TIMP-1 mRNA, respectively (30.Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Arthur M.J.P. Ferris W.F. Alcolado R. Winwood P.J. Clark N. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 176-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence specificity of the UTE-1 DNA-protein interaction was tested by competition EMSA reactions. A 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild type (wt) double-stranded oligonucleotide competed out all protein binding to the radiolabeled UTE-1 site using nuclear extracts from activated rat HSCs (Fig. 3 A). Hence, binding of nuclear proteins to the UTE-1 sequence is s"

In the present study, we have identified the epitope of two PAI-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MA-33H1F7 and MA-55F4C12). Based upon differential cross-reactivity data of these monoclonals with PAI-1 from different species and on a sequence alignment between these PAI-1s, combined with the three-dimensional structure, we predicted that the residues Glu128-Val129-Glu130-Arg131and Lys154 (at the hinge region between α-helix F and the main part of the PAI-1-molecule) might form the major site of interaction. Therefore a variety of alanine mutants were generated and evaluated for their affinity toward both monoclonal antibodies. The affinity constants of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 for PAI-1 were 2.7 ± 1.6 × 109m−1 and 5.4 ± 1.7 × 109m−1, respectively, but decreased between 13- and 270-fold upon mutation of Lys154 to Ala154 or Glu128-Val129-Glu130-Arg131to Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala. The combined mutations (PAI-1-EVER/K), however, resulted in an absence of binding to either of the antibodies.

PAI-1 is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in plasma (5.Kruithof E.K.O. Tran-Thang C. Ransijn A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PAI-1 is unique among the serpins because of its functional and conformational flexibility. The active conformation of PAI-1 inhibits its target proteinases by the formation of a stable, inactive complex. After the formation of an initial, reversible Michaelis-like complex, the proteinase cleaves the active site of PAI-1 and forms a stable, covalent complex resulting in the inactivation of the proteinase (6.Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The structure of a covalent complex between PAI-1 and t-PA in particular, or between a serpin and its target proteinase in general, is presently unknown. However, two different models have been proposed. According to one model, the proteinase moves after the initial attack to the opposite pole of the serpin, thereby resulting in a complete insertion of the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop (7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternatively, it was hypothesized that movement of the proteinase following the initial proteinase/serpin interaction is less extended, yielding a complex in which the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop is only partially inserted (10.Aertgeerts K.

Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and stabilized by multiple interactions between serpin and proteinase.Although PAI-1 is synthesized as an active molecule, it converts spontaneously to an inactive, latent form that can be partially reactivated by denaturing agents (12.Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this latent conformation, the active site is inaccessible for the target proteinases as a result of the insertion of the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop in β-sheet A of the PAI-1 molecule (13.Mottonen J.

This form of PAI-1 reacts with t-PA or u-PA, resulting in a cleavage of the active site of PAI-1 but without the formation of a covalent complex (17.Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Previously, we have characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies that neutralize PAI-1 activity by converting the active pathway into the non-inhibitory substrate pathway (18.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For two of these antibodies, MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7, the binding region was found to be located remote of the reactive-site loop, within a region comprising residues at positions 128–156 (19.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, these residues cover α-helix F (residues 128–145) and part of the turn connecting α-helix F and β-strand s3A (residues 146–156).In the present study, we hypothesized that evaluation of the differential species reactivity of these antibodies, combined with a linear sequence alignment of the region from 128 to 156 in PAI-1 of various species and with the relative three-dimensional localization of these residues, could provide unambiguously which amino acids are directly involved in the interaction with the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The obtained data demonstrate that the epitope is composed of five residues at maximum. The precise nature and the location of this non-linear epitope have important implications for the structural basis of the neutralizing mechanism of the antibodies and for the model of the complex between serpins and their target proteinase.DISCUSSIONIn this study the epitope of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 was identified within a stretch of 29 amino acids in PAI-1 (region Glu128–Ala156), mainly based on the differential reactivity of these antibodies for PAI-1 from different species. In combination with the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, this approach allowed to designate five amino acids (Glu128, Val129, Glu130, Arg131, and Lys154) that are the major determinants for the interaction between PAI-1 and the antibodies. Thus, the epitope of the antibodies does not cover the complete α-helix F and turn connecting α-helix F and β-strand s3A, but is restricted to the hinge region between α-helix F and the main part of the PAI-1 molecule (Fig. 1).To check the importance of the five residues, eleven alanine mutants were produced and characterized. The replacement of the bulky or charged residues (Glu128, Val129, Glu130, Arg131, and Lys154) into small, non-charged alanines was predicted to destroy the epitope. This approach (“alanine-scan”) has already been used before to detect epitopes or functional determinants (30.Collen D. Bernaerts R. Declerck P. De Cock F. Demarsin E. Jenne S. Laroche Y. Lijnen H.R. Silence K. Verstreken M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31.Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that mutation of residue Arg131 was included primarily based on its location in the three-dimensional structure.Comparison of the affinity constants in Table IV, part Dversus those in part C and those for PAI-1-K, indicate that for MA-55F4C12 all five residues act cooperatively in the binding to the antibody and constitute the epitope. A similar comparative analysis for MA-33H1F7 reveals that the residues Glu128 and Val129 most likely do not contribute significantly, thereby suggesting that the epitope of MA-33H1F7 is predominantly composed of three residues (Lys154/Glu130/Arg131), positioned virtually linearly in the three-dimensional structure.It has been suggested previously that in serpins α-helix F, together with β-strands s1–3A, can move relative to the remainder part of the molecule and that this movement is a prerequisite for the inhibitory activity (32.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of the epitope within the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1 is thus likely to form the molecular basis for the PAI-1 neutralizing properties of these antibodies. Indeed, binding of MA-55F4C12 or MA-33H1F7 to this particular region can be expected either to restrict the conformational flexibility of α-helix F and β-strands s1–3A or to reposition this region relative to the remainder part of the molecule. Either of these effects will disturb the shutter-like movement in β-sheet A required to accommodate properly the new β-strand s4A during interaction between PAI-1 and t-PA and to lock subsequently the serpin-proteinase complex. Consequently, the rate or the extent of insertion of the reactive-site loop into β-sheet A will be reduced, resulting in a shift from the inhibitory to the substrate pathway (18.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the current view that the kinetics and/or extent of insertion of the reactive-site loop plays an important role in the inhibition mechanism of the serpins (6.Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Even though some of the mutants in the EVER region (Table II) exhibit an increased substrate behavior, further supporting the role of this region in the inhibitor versus substrate properties of serpins, we, as well as others (34.Sui G.C. Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), have no straightforward explanation for these modified biochemical properties. It could be speculated that replacement of the charged residues by alanines and subsequent loss of interaction within the N-terminal portion of α-helix F, might result in a repositioning of α-helix F relative to the main β-sheet A (e.g. closer to β-sheet A, closer to the s3A-s5A opening) thereby impairing the shutter-like movement in β-sheet A, required for the inhibitory properties of a serpin.Localization of the epitope has also implications for the mechanism of complex formation between PAI-1 and its target proteinase. Structures of the serpin/proteinase complexes are not elucidated yet, but several models have been proposed for such covalent complexes (7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). According to one model (Fig.2 C), the proteinase moves 180° after the initial complex formation to form a stable covalent complex in which the reactive-site loop is completely inserted (7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is obvious that the epitope of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 is not accessible in this model (Fig. 2 D). According to another model (Fig. 2 A), the proteinase moves only to a limited extent such that the reactive-site loop is only partially inserted (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A. Declerck P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the latter model the epitope clearly remains accessible since the proteinase is located rather remote from the epitope (Fig.2 B). According to the affinity constants (Table IV), the antibodies MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 bind to PAI-1 in complex with t-PA with an affinity similar to that for free PAI-1, demonstrating that the epitope is neither disturbed nor covered by complex formation. Taken together these findings rule out the model in which full insertion is proposed, but are compatible with the models in which partial insertion is proposed (Fig. 2 A) (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A. Declerck P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this conclusion is also in agreement with a recent study (35.Picard V. Marque P.-E. Paolucci F. Aiach M. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4586-4593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which localization of a neoantigenic epitope in antithrombin-III/thrombin complexes indicates that in this complex at the most, residue P14 to P6 of the reactive-site loop can be inserted in β-sheet A.Figure 2Models of serpin/proteinase complexes.

The identified epitope is different from the epitopes of other monoclonal antibodies with an inhibitory effect on a serpin. Asakura et al. (36.Asakura S. Hirata H. Okazaki H. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5135-5138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified an epitope in the reactive-site loop of anti-antithrombin III (P8–P13), whereas Keijeret al. (37.Keijer J. Linders M. van Zonneveld A.-J. Ehrlich H.J. de Boer J.-P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the binding region of an inhibitory antibody was situated between amino acid residues 320 and 379 of PAI-1, a region containing the reactive-site loop. According to Björquist et al. (38.Bjorquist P. Ehnebom J. Inghardt T. Deinum J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a panel of PAI-1-inhibiting antibodies can be divided into at least three groups, representing three non-overlapping epitopes. None of the suggested epitopes were located at the hinge region of α-helix F, although the epitope of CLB-2C8 is located near this area (residues 128–145) (39.van Zonneveld A.J. van den Berg B.M. van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other antibodies have been described with an epitope partially covering the same area (residues 125–132), that did not exert any inhibitory effect on PAI-1 (40.Perrie A.M. MacGregor I.R. Booth N.A. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 7: 257-263Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This further confirms that the functional properties of the currently described antibodies are due to the simultaneous interaction with residues Glu128–Arg131 and with residue Lys154.In conclusion, this study describes the localization of a conformational epitope of two anti-PAI-1 inhibitory antibodies, thereby providing a molecular explanation for their neutralizing mechanism. The precise localization of the epitope has also implications for the model of the complex between serpins and their target proteinases,i.e. only a model in which the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop of serpins is partially inserted is compatible with the current observation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1),1 a member of theserine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily (1.Pannekoek H. Veerman H. Lambers H. Diergaarde P.

PAI-1 is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in plasma (5.Kruithof E.K.O. Tran-Thang C. Ransijn A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 is unique among the serpins because of its functional and conformational flexibility. The active conformation of PAI-1 inhibits its target proteinases by the formation of a stable, inactive complex. After the formation of an initial, reversible Michaelis-like complex, the proteinase cleaves the active site of PAI-1 and forms a stable, covalent complex resulting in the inactivation of the proteinase (6.Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The structure of a covalent complex between PAI-1 and t-PA in particular, or between a serpin and its target proteinase in general, is presently unknown. However, two different models have been proposed. According to one model, the proteinase moves after the initial attack to the opposite pole of the serpin, thereby resulting in a complete insertion of the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop (7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it was hypothesized that movement of the proteinase following the initial proteinase/serpin interaction is less extended, yielding a complex in which the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop is only partially inserted (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A. Declerck P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), accompanied by a distortion of the catalytic triad of the proteinase (6.Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and stabilized by multiple interactions between serpin and proteinase. Although PAI-1 is synthesized as an active molecule, it converts spontaneously to an inactive, latent form that can be partially reactivated by denaturing agents (12.Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this latent conformation, the active site is inaccessible for the target proteinases as a result of the insertion of the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop in β-sheet A of the PAI-1 molecule (13.Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In addition, a third conformation with substrate properties has been identified (14.Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Munch M. Heegaard C.W. Andreasen P.A. Biochim. Biophys.

This form of PAI-1 reacts with t-PA or u-PA, resulting in a cleavage of the active site of PAI-1 but without the formation of a covalent complex (17.Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previously, we have characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies that neutralize PAI-1 activity by converting the active pathway into the non-inhibitory substrate pathway (18.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For two of these antibodies, MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7, the binding region was found to be located remote of the reactive-site loop, within a region comprising residues at positions 128–156 (19.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, these residues cover α-helix F (residues 128–145) and part of the turn connecting α-helix F and β-strand s3A (residues 146–156). In the present study, we hypothesized that evaluation of the differential species reactivity of these antibodies, combined with a linear sequence alignment of the region from 128 to 156 in PAI-1 of various species and with the relative three-dimensional localization of these residues, could provide unambiguously which amino acids are directly involved in the interaction with the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is obvious that the epitope of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 is not accessible in this model (Fig. 2 D). According to another model (Fig. 2 A), the proteinase moves only to a limited extent such that the reactive-site loop is only partially inserted (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A. Declerck P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the latter model the epitope clearly remains accessible since the proteinase is located rather remote from the epitope (Fig.2 B). According to the affinity constants (Table IV), the antibodies MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 bind to PAI-1 in complex with t-PA with an affinity similar to that for free PAI-1, demonstrating that the epitope is neither disturbed nor covered by complex formation. Taken together these findings rule out the model in which full insertion is proposed, but are compatible with the models in which partial insertion is proposed (Fig. 2 A) (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A. Declerck P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this conclusion is also in agreement with a recent study (35.Picard V. Marque P.-E. Paolucci F. Aiach M. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4586-4593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which localization of a neoantigenic epitope in antithrombin-III/thrombin complexes indicates that in this complex at the most, residue P14 to P6 of the reactive-site loop can be inserted in β-sheet A.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the elucidation of an epitope of a serpin-neutralizing monoclonal antibody down to five residues, being non-linear (“conformational”) and remote of the active site. The identified epitope is different from the epitopes of other monoclonal antibodies with an inhibitory effect on a serpin. Asakura et al. (36.Asakura S. Hirata H. Okazaki H. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5135-5138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified an epitope in the reactive-site loop of anti-antithrombin III (P8–P13), whereas Keijeret al. (37.Keijer J. Linders M. van Zonneveld A.-J. Ehrlich H.J. de Boer J.-P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the binding region of an inhibitory antibody was situated between amino acid residues 320 and 379 of PAI-1, a region containing the reactive-site loop. According to Björquist et al. (38.Bjorquist P. Ehnebom J. Inghardt T. Deinum J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a panel of PAI-1-inhibiting antibodies can be divided into at least three groups, representing three non-overlapping epitopes. None of the suggested epitopes were located at the hinge region of α-helix F, although the epitope of CLB-2C8 is located near this area (residues 128–145) (39.van Zonneveld A.J. van den Berg B.M. van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other antibodies have been described with an epitope partially covering the same area (residues 125–132), that did not exert any inhibitory effect on PAI-1 (40.Perrie A.M. MacGregor I.R. Booth N.A. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 7: 257-263Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This further confirms that the functional properties of the currently described antibodies are due to the simultaneous interaction with residues Glu128–Arg131 and with residue Lys154.In conclusion, this study describes the localization of a conformational epitope of two anti-PAI-1 inhibitory antibodies, thereby providing a molecular explanation for their neutralizing mechanism. The precise localization of the epitope has also implications for the model of the complex between serpins and their target proteinases,i.e. only a model in which the N-terminal side of the reactive-site loop of serpins is partially inserted is compatible with the current observation. In this study the epitope of MA-55F4C12 and MA-33H1F7 was identified within a stretch of 29 amino acids in PAI-1 (region Glu128–Ala156), mainly based on the differential reactivity of these antibodies for PAI-1 from different species. In combination with the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, this approach allowed to designate five amino acids (Glu128, Val129, Glu130, Arg131, and Lys154) that are the major determinants for the interaction between PAI-1 and the antibodies. Thus, the epitope of the antibodies does not cover the complete α-helix F and turn connecting α-helix F and β-strand s3A, but is restricted to the hinge region between α-helix F and the main part of the PAI-1 molecule (Fig. 1). To check the importance of the five residues, eleven alanine mutants were produced and characterized. The replacement of the bulky or charged residues (Glu128, Val129, Glu130, Arg131, and Lys154) into small, non-charged alanines was predicted to destroy the epitope. This approach (“alanine-scan”) has already been used before to detect epitopes or functional determinants (30.Collen D. Bernaerts R. Declerck P. De Cock F. Demarsin E. Jenne S. Laroche Y. Lijnen H.R. Silence K. Verstreken M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31.Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that mutation of residue Arg131 was included primarily based on its location in the three-dimensional structure. Comparison of the affinity constants in Table IV, part Dversus those in part C and those for PAI-1-K, indicate that for MA-55F4C12 all five residues act cooperatively in the binding to the antibody and constitute the epitope. A similar comparative analysis for MA-33H1F7 reveals that the residues Glu128 and Val129 most likely do not contribute significantly, thereby suggesting that the epitope of MA-33H1F7 is predominantly composed of three residues (Lys154/Glu130/Arg131), positioned virtually linearly in the three-dimensional structure. It has been suggested previously that in serpins α-helix F, together with β-strands s1–3A, can move relative to the remainder part of the molecule and that this movement is a prerequisite for the inhibitory activity (32.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of the epitope within the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1 is thus likely to form the molecular basis for the PAI-1 neutralizing properties of these antibodies. Indeed, binding of MA-55F4C12 or MA-33H1F7 to this particular region can be expected either to restrict the conformational flexibility of α-helix F and β-strands s1–3A or to reposition this region relative to the remainder part of the molecule. Either of these effects will disturb the shutter-like movement in β-sheet A required to accommodate properly the new β-strand s4A during interaction between PAI-1 and t-PA and to lock subsequently the serpin-proteinase complex. Consequently, the rate or the extent of insertion of the reactive-site loop into β-sheet A will be reduced, resulting in a shift from the inhibitory to the substrate pathway (18.Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the current view that the kinetics and/or extent of insertion of the reactive-site loop plays an important role in the inhibition mechanism of the serpins (6.Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B.A. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17.Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though some of the mutants in the EVER region (Table II) exhibit an increased substrate behavior, further supporting the role of this region in the inhibitor versus substrate properties of serpins, we, as well as others (34.Sui G.C. Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), have no straightforward explanation for these modified biochemical properties. It could be speculated that replacement of the charged residues by alanines and subsequent loss of interaction within the N-terminal portion of α-helix F, might result in a repositioning of α-helix F relative to the main β-sheet A (e.g. closer to β-sheet A, closer to the s3A-s5A opening) thereby impairing the shutter-like movement in β-sheet A, required for the inhibitory properties of a serpin. Localization of the epitope has also implications for the mechanism of complex formation between PAI-1 and its target proteinase. Structures of the serpin/proteinase complexes are not elucidated yet, but several models have been proposed for such covalent complexes (7.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to one model (Fig.2 C), the proteinase moves 180° after the initial complex formation to form a stable covalent complex in which the reactive-site loop is completely inserted (7.Wright H.T.

According to another model (Fig. 2 A), the proteinase moves only to a limited extent such that the reactive-site loop is only partially inserted (10.Aertgeerts K. De Ranter C.J. Booth N.A.

NBP-45 mRNA is expressed at low levels and in variable amounts in all mouse tissues tested but is especially abundant in RNA extracted from 7-day-old mouse embryos, suggesting that it functions in early embryonic development. NBP-45 is composed of 406 amino acids and is encoded by a single size transcript. The region spanning the N-terminal 85 amino acids contains three segments that are highly homologous to functionally important domains in the HMG-14/-17 protein family: the nuclear localization signal, the nucleosome binding domain, and the chromatin unfolding domain. The protein region spanning the C-terminal 321 amino acids has a 42% content of negatively charged residues. The first 23 amino acids contain a region necessary for nuclear entry of the protein, the region spanning residues 12–40 is the main nucleosomal binding domain of the protein, and the negatively charged, C-terminal domain is necessary for transcription activation.

In addition, structural proteins that lack known enzymatic activity, such as the high mobility group (HMG)1 proteins, are also known to modify the structure of their DNA binding site and induce an architecture that facilitates and enhances various DNA-related activities (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 35-100Google Scholar). The HMG protein family is subdivided into three subfamilies: the HMG-1/-2 subfamily, the HMG-I/Y subfamily, and the HMG-14/-17 subfamily. Each of these subfamilies has a unique protein signature and a distinct functional motif. The HMG-1 domain is the functional domain of the HMG-1/-2 subfamily, the AT-hook is the functional domain of the HMG-I/Y family, and the nucleosomal binding domain is the functional motif of the HMG-14/-17 proteins. Through these domains the HMG proteins bind to their DNA or chromatin target, with little if any specificity for the underlying DNA sequence (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 35-100Google Scholar). Two of the HMG functional domains, the HMG-1, and the AT-hook motifs have been identified as embedded in numerous nuclear proteins that interact with DNA in a sequence specific manner (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 12.Bianchi M. Lilley D. DNA:Protein: Structural Interactions.

These motifs are major sites of interaction between the proteins and their specific binding sites. The third HMG motif, the HMG-14/-17 nucleosomal binding domain, seems to be much less prevalent (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 35-100Google Scholar) and has been detected by yeast two-hybrid system, only in Trip-7, isolated as a cDNA clone from a HeLa cell cDNA library (14.Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interaction of the translation product of this clone with nucleosomes has not been yet described, the high degree of sequence homology with HMG-14/-17 proteins suggest that Trip-7 will interact with chromatin subunits. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel protein, which we named NBP-45 (nucleosomal bindingprotein 45), that contains a region highly homologous to the nucleosome binding domain of the HMG-14/-17 proteins but is clearly distinct from these ubiquitous nuclear proteins. NBP-45 is a 406-amino acid-long protein. The N-terminal region of NBP-45 contains several domains that are homologous to evolutionarily conserved functional domains of the HMG-14/-17 protein family; however, most of the protein (85% of the sequence) has an unusually high content of negatively charged amino acids (42%). We demonstrate that NBP-45 is a nuclear protein, that it binds specifically to nucleosome core particles, that it is expressed in variable amounts in most mouse tissues, and that NBP-45 transcripts are especially abundant in the RNA isolated from 7-day-old embryos. Our findings suggest that proteins other than HMG-14 or HMG-17 contain a functional nucleosomal binding domain (NBD) that may act as a module that facilitates the binding of nuclear proteins to chromatin. Thus, all the known functional motifs present in the ubiquitous HMG proteins are also found embedded in other, non-HMG nuclear proteins. The EST data base from several organisms was searched with the protein sequence EPKRSARLSA using the TBLASTN program (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)). A mouse EST clone (accession number AI04663) contained the above sequence but was clearly not an HMG-14 or an HMG-17 protein. The clone, in Escherichia coli DH10B, was obtained from Research Genetics. The plasmid DNA was purified by the alkaline lysis procedure using the Qiagen plasmid purification system and the insert excised by digestion with DraIII and XhoI. The insert was blunt ended with Klenow fragment and subcloned into vector pCR-BluntIITOPO (Invitrogen) and propagated in bacterial strain DH5α, and its sequence was determined with the Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) and a 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Mouse RNA master blot, mouse MTN blot, and mouse embryo MTN blots were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and probed, as recommended by the manufacturer, either with 32P-labeled the full-length cDNA or with a 32P-labeled fragment spanning nucleotides 43–418 of the cDNA. After hybridization, the membranes were washed with 0.1× SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and the radioactive signal was visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–406, 24–406, or 1–108 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All of the 5′-primers contained a BamHI site. The 3′-primers for mammalian expression contained a SalI site, whereas the 3′-primers for bacterial expression contained a HindIII site. The amplified DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from the agarose gel by the Geneclean II kit (Bio101Inc) procedure, and digested with either BamHI/SalI orBamHI/HindIII. These fragments were ligated into either the BamHI/SalI site of the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV-4C (Stratagene), which codes for FLAG fusion proteins, or into the BglII/SalI site of the mammalian expression plasmid pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH), which codes for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins. For bacterial expression, the DNA fragments were ligated into theBamHI/HindIII site of plasmid pET-23a (Novagen), which codes for T7-tagged fusion proteins. All the constructs were propagated in E. coli DH5α. The sequence of each of the insert was confirmed by sequence analysis. All of the bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). E. coli cells containing the expression construct were selected and grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced when the A 600 of the culture was 0.4–0.6 by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 150 volume of BagBuster solution (Novagen), and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The supernatant containing expressed proteins was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C, and the T7-tagged proteins were purified on a anti-T7 tag antibody affinity resin (Novagen) followed by ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column, (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. After elution from the resin, the solution containing recombinant protein was dialyzed against NEH buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The protein concentration was determined with the BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. HeLa cells grown in 3-cm-diameter dishes were transfected, using the LipofectoAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 0.7 μg of plasmid DNA expressing either the entire, or the truncated cDNA fragments, as recommended by the manufacturer. For Western analysis, 48 h after transfection the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min, the pellets were suspended in SDS gel loading buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 6% glycerol), and the cell lysates were electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein bands were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% dried milk, the membranes were reacted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 0.8 μg/ml in TBS-T containing 10% dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and reacted with anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). The bound antibodies were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of GFP fusion protein, the transfected cells were grown on a coverslip, washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and observed under microscopy using the appropriate filters. For detection of FLAG fused protein, cells grown on a coverslip were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with TNBS (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum, 0.1% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min at room temperature. The location of the FLAG conjugates was visualized as described elsewhere (15.Hock R. Wilde F. Scheer U. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6992-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using anti-FLAG antibody (8 μg/ml in TNBS) as the first antibody and anti mouse IgG antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as the second antibody. 0.3 μg of the reporter plasmid pCH110 (Amesharm Pharmacia Biotech) was co-transfected with 0.7 μg of DNA of each expression construct into HeLa cells grown in 3-cm culture dishes. After 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested, and the β-galactosidase activity of the lysates was measured with the Glacto Light Plus kit (Tropix). Each assay was done with 10 μg of total protein, as determined by the BCA (Pierce) protein assay kit (about 10 μl of extract). Nucleosome core particles were isolated from chicken red blood cell nuclei as described previously (16.Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17.Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DNA was purified from nucleosome core particles by digestion with Proteinase K, extraction with phenol, and ethanol precipitation. 32P-End labeled core particles were prepared with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then dialyzed against NEH buffer. Nucleosome core particles or core particle DNA were incubated with NBP-45 in 10 μl of either 2× or 0.5× TBE (1× TBE = 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min on ice. After incubation, 10% Ficol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in either 2× or 0.5× TBE was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the mixture was loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gels were run at 15 V/cm at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 10 min, and the DNA was detected either under UV illuminator or after drying by phoshorimage analysis. The signature of the HMG-14/-17 proteins is a stretch of 28 amino acids comprising the nucleosomal binding domain of these nonhistone chromosomal proteins (11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 35-100Google Scholar, 18.Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal half of this region, 10 out of 11 amino acid positions are invariant among all known members of the HMG-14/-17 protein family. We used the sequence EPKRRSARLSA, corresponding to the conserved region of HMG-14, to search the mouse EST data base (NCBI) using the TBLASTN program (NCBI), and detected a new sequence, expressed in mouse liver (GenBankTM accession number AI046632) that contained this invariant HMG-14/-17 motif. The insert from clone AI046632 was obtained by digestion with DraIII and XhoI, and the resulting 1889-nucleotide-long DNA fragment was sequenced (Fig.1 A). Northern analysis of mouse liver RNA, with a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 43–418, revealed a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 1.9 kilobases (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the sequenced fragment represents all or most of the single transcript present in this tissue. The DNA contained an open reading frame encoding a 406-amino acid-long protein (Fig. 1 A). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that this protein contained several regions that are homologous to structural domains characteristic of the HMG-14/-17 protein family (bold letters in Fig. 1, A and D). Thus, the first 4 amino acids, PKRK of this protein are also the first 4 amino acids in all the known HMG-14/-17 proteins. The region spanning amino acids 13–40 of this protein is homologous to the highly conserved nucleosomal binding domain of the HMG-14/-17 protein family, and the peptide AENGEAK, spanning amino acids 77 and 83, is homologous to a highly conserved peptide region in the C-terminal of all the HMG-14/-17 proteins. Thus, the N-terminal portion of the new protein contains three regions that are identical or highly homologous to regions known to be functionally relevant in HMG-14/-17 proteins. The first region of homology is part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal of HMG-14/-17 (19.Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the second region is their main nucleosomal binding domain (20.Crippa M.P. Alfonso P.J. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the third region of homology is part of the chromatin unfolding domain (21.Trieschmann L. Postnikov Y. Rickers A. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6663-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5843-5855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the protein is 45 kDa. Because the protein contains a putative nucleosomal binding domain it was named NBP-45 (nucleosomalbinding protein 45). To verify that the open reading frame indeed encodes a protein, we transfected HeLa cells with an expression plasmid containing a truncated cDNA sequence in which the FLAG tag was inserted at the TAA termination codon. Western analysis of the protein purified from the transfected cells revealed the presence of a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3). Likewise, bacterial expression of the entire open reading frame fused at the N-terminal with a T7 tag, produced a protein with the same molecular mass (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). Apparently NBP-45 has an anomalous electrophoretic mobility in SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels, perhaps because of its unusual, highly acidic, amino acid composition (23.Korschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Muller F. Dose A. Godde M. et al.Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 37.Saperas N. Chiva M. Aligu Itoh T. Katagiri C. Subirana J.A. Ausio J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NBP-45 is a 406-amino acid-long protein and contains several overlapping repetitive sequence motifs (Fig. 1 A). It is a highly acidic protein containing 110 glutamic acid and 44 aspartic acid residues, i.e. 37.9% of the residues are negatively charged. Only 16% of the residues are positively charged, and the protein has a calculated pI of 4.2. The charged residues are asymmetrically distributed along the polypeptide chain: in the first 50 N-terminal amino acids there are 13 positively charged residues and only three negatively charged residues, i.e. the basic to acidic ratio is 4, whereas in the rest of the protein this ratio is 0.34. The protein contains 7 arginine residues. Strikingly, 6 of these are found in the first 41 amino acids. NBP-45 has an unusually low content of aromatic amino acids, it contains two phenylalanines and one tyrosine and lacks tryptophan residues. The lack of tryptophan, the low content of aromatic residues, the clustering of arginine residues, and the asymmetric distribution of charged resides along the polypeptide chain are characteristic of the HMG-14/-17 protein family (11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 35-100Google Scholar, 24.Johns E.W. The HMG Chromosomal Proteins. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). Thus, NBP-45 bears significant structural similarity to the nucleosomal binding proteins HMG-14/-17. However, NBP-45 is clearly a new protein that is distinct from the HMG-14/-17 proteins. HMG-14 and HMG-17 are relatively small molecular mass proteins containing less than 100 amino acids. NBP-45 contains 406 amino acids; only the N-terminal 85 amino acids are homologous to HMG-14/-17 proteins. The rest of the protein is extremely acidic and has an unusually high content of glutamic acid residues, similar to that of a set of glutamic acid-rich proteins (GARPs) found in rod photoreceptors (25.Korschen H.G. Beyermann M. Muller F. Heck M. Vantler M. Koch K.W. Kellner R. Wolfrum U. Bode C. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To test whether NPB-45 is indeed a nuclear protein, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids expressing either NBP-45-GFP fusion constructs or NBP-45 containing the FLAG tag at its C-terminal. Fluorescence microscopy clearly indicated that both constructs efficiently localized to the nucleus (Fig.2, A and B). Likewise, a FLAG-tagged NBP-45 deletion mutant lacking the 298 C-terminal amino acid residues did accumulate into the nuclei (Fig.2 C). In contrast, a deletion mutant of the NBP-45-GFP construct lacking the 23 N-terminal amino acids failed to enter the nucleus and accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that this protein region contains at least one element necessary for nuclear entry. We already demonstrated that for HMG-14/-17, the first 4 amino acids PKRK, are part of the nuclear localization signal (19.Hock R. Scheer U. Bustin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because this invariant sequence is also present in NBP-45, we suggest that these residues are part of its nuclear localization signal signal. We conclude that NPB-45 is a nuclear protein and that, similar to the nucleosomal binding proteins HMG-14/-17, its nuclear entry is mediated by an intrinsic nuclear localization signal. The 147-base pair-long nucleosome core particle is the basic building block of the chromatin fiber. The only nuclear proteins known to recognize structural features of this chromatin subunit and bind to it specifically, independent of the underlying DNA sequence, are the ubiquitous HMG-14/-17 proteins. The main site of interaction between the HMG-14/-17 proteins and the nucleosome core particle is the highly conserved nucleosomal binding domain (20.Crippa M.P. Alfonso P.J. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26.Abercombie B.D. Kneale G.G. Crane-Robinson C. Bradbury E.M. Goodwin G.H. Walker J.M. Johns E.W . Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27.Cook G.R. Minch M. Schroth G.P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1799-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a region of NBP-45 (amino acids 12–36; Fig. 1) is highly homologous to the nucleosomal binding domain of HMG-14/-17, we tested whether this protein also binds specifically to nucleosome core particles. To this end, we expressed the full-length NBP-45, an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the first 23 N-terminal amino acids, and a 108-amino acid-long, C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the last 298 amino acid residues, in bacteria. All of the proteins were affinity purified using the T7 epitope, which was fused at the N-terminal (Fig.3 A). Mobility shift assays of the full-length NBP-45 protein with 147-base pair-long DNA isolated from chicken core particles or with a mixture of this DNA and isolated nucleosome core particles clearly indicated that the protein binds specifically to the chromatin subunits. Thus, addition of increasing amounts of NBP-45 to 147-base pair DNA produced nonspecific smears and aggregates that accumulated at the top of the native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–5). In contrast, when added to a mixture of DNA and nucleosome core particles, the protein produced a specific band (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6–10). The appearance of the specific mobility shift correlated with the depletion of the nucleosome core particle band. Significantly, although the band corresponding to the core particle was totally depleted, the band corresponding to free DNA was almost intact (Fig. 3 B, lane 10), a clear indication that the binding of NBP-45 to core particles is significantly stronger that its binding to protein-free DNA. We conclude therefore that NPB-45 binds specifically to nucleosome core particles. The N-terminal deletion mutant of NBP-45, lacking residues that are highly homologous to the nucleosomal binding domain of HMG-14/-17, does not produce specific mobility shifts with core particles (Fig.3 C, lanes 5–7). In contrast, a C-terminal deletion mutant lacking 75% of the amino acids but containing the region homologous to the HMG-14/-17 nucleosomal binding domain produces a specific mobility shift (Fig. 3 C, lanes 8–10). We conclude therefore that the main nucleosomal binding domain of NBP-45 is the region that is homologous to the nucleosomal binding domain of the ubiquitous HMG-14/-17 proteins. We note, however, that the band produced by the C-terminal deletion mutant is somewhat diffuse and less well defined then that produced by the intact NBP-45 (Fig.3 C, lane 4, and B–D) or by the HMG-17 protein (Fig. 3 D). Amino acid residues absent from the C-terminal deletion mutant may be necessary for stabilizing the interaction of NBP-45 with core particles. The interaction of HMG-14/-17 proteins with core particles is dependent on ionic strength. In 2× TBE, an ionic strength close to physiological, the proteins bind to the nucleosome core cooperatively and form homodimeric complexes containing either two molecules of HMG-14 or two molecules of HMG-17. At low ionic strength, the binding is noncooperative producing heterodimeric complexes containing one molecule of each HMG protein (28.Postnikov Y.V. Trieschmann L. Rickers A. Bustin M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We tested whether the interaction of NBP-45 with core particles is similar to that of the HMG-14/-17 proteins. In 2× TBE solution, the addition of core particles to a solution containing both HMG-17 and NBP-45 proteins produced only two type of nucleosome core complexes: one with a mobility characteristic of a homodimer of HMG-17 and one with a mobility characteristic of the NBP-45:core particle complex (Fig. 3 D). Quantitative two-dimensional gel analysis suggests that this complex also contains two molecules of NBP-45. Under these conditions, the dissociation constant for the binding of NBP-45 to nucleosome cores, determined as described before (29.Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is 0.4 × 10−7 ×m−1, a value similar to that of HMG-14/-17 (29.Postnikov Y.V. Lehn D.A. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Shiloach J. Bustin M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At low ionic strength, in 0.5× TBE solutions, the binding of NBP-45 to core particles still produces only one major complex, whereas the binding of HMG-17 is clearly noncooperative and produced complexes containing either one or two molecules of HMG-17 (Fig. 3 D,lane 5). At this ionic strength, a mixture containing both HMG-17 and NBP-45 produces an additional band with a mobility intermediate between that of an NBP-45 homodimer and that of an HMG-17 homodimer, suggesting the existence of a heterodimeric complex containing one molecule of HMG-17 and one of NBP-45 (asterisk in Fig. 3 D). The amount of protein in this band was too low for reliable quantification by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We conclude that the interaction of NBP-45 with core particles and DNA is very similar to that of the ubiquitous HMG-14/-17 protein. NBP-45 produces nonspecific complexes with DNA, binds specifically to nucleosome cores, and at physiological ionic strength produces homodimeric mixtures. Thus, NBP-45 is indeed a nucleosomal binding domain protein. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the existence of a functional HMG-14/-17 nucleosomal binding domain in proteins other that the “canonical” HMG-14/-17 protein themselves. The asymmetric distribution of charged residues along the NBP-45 polypeptide chain creates an unusually long protein domain of very high negative charge density. In the region spanning residues 50–406 (85% of the protein) there are 108 glutamic acid and 41 aspartic acid residues, i.e. 42% of the residues are negatively charged. In numerous transcription factors, a negatively charged region is the protein domain mainly responsible for the transcription activation activity (30.Blair W.S. Bogerd H.P. Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7226-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31.Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32.Ruden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33.Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). To test the potential transcriptional activation activity of NBP-45, we cotransfected into HeLa cells, the reporter plasmid pCH110, in which the expression β-galactosidase is driven by the SV40 promoter, with plasmids expressing either intact or with C-terminal deletion mutants of FLAG tagged NBP-45. Western analysis of extracts from the transfected cells indicated that all of the polypeptides were expressed (Fig.4 A). Cells transfected with full-length NBP-45 expressed 8-fold more β-galactosidase than cells transfected with the control vector pCMV-Tag4C (Fig. 4 B). Deletion of the 214 C-terminal amino acids decreased the stimulation activity of NBP-45 from 8- to 4-fold. A longer deletion mutant lacking all but the first 108 amino acids stimulated transcription only 2-fold, i.e. 4-fold lower than the intact protein. The C terminus of this deletion mutant is still negatively charged; in the 42 C-terminal residues there are 17 negatively charged and only three positively charged amino acids. We conclude, therefore, that NBP-45 has the potential to function as a general transcriptional activator and that the transcriptional stimulation correlated with the length of the C-terminal region of the protein. The negatively charged residues may serve to mobilize additional transcription factors to form multiprotein complexes, as has been suggested for numerous site specific transcription activators, (30.Blair W.S. Bogerd H.P. Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7226-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31.Roberts S.G. Green M.R.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Alternatively, by analogy to HMG-14/-17 proteins, the negatively charged domain may enhance transcription by modifying the higher order chromatin structure of the transfected plasmid (21.Trieschmann L. Postnikov Y. Rickers A. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6663-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Ding H.F. Bustin M. Hansen U. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9409-9414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The main functional domains of NBP-45 are outlined in Fig.4 C. The first 23 amino acids contain a region necessary for nuclear entry of the protein. The region spanning residues 12–40 is the main nucleosomal binding domain of the protein because it is highly homologous to the nucleosomal binding domain of HMG-14/-17, and the deletion of a region containing part of this region is sufficient to abolish nucleosomal binding. The negatively charged, C-terminal domain activates transcription. The functional domains of NBP-45 are indicative of a nuclear protein that binds to nucleosomes, thereby creating a chromatin region of extremely high local negative charge. To gain insights into the tissue specificity and expression levels of NBP-45 we used the entire 1889-nucleotide-long cDNA sequence to query several data bases using the BLASTN (NCBI) program. In the data base of Expressed Sequence Tags, we obtained 15 hits of partial homology with mouse sequences expressed in blastocysts, T-cells, liver, hippocampus, and embryos. The non redundant data base (NCBI) contained a mouse sequence (GARP45, GenBankTMaccession number AB018374) that was deposited while this work was in progress, identical to NBP-45. We obtained three hits with rat EST clones and two hits with human EST clones. A similar analysis with the mouse HMG-14 or HMG-17 sequence yielded over 100 sequences that were identical to the query sequences. These findings suggest that the NBP-45 mRNA has a very low abundance or alternatively that the message is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We used an RNA Master Blot containing mRNA from 22 different mouse tissues (CLONTECH) to examine the tissue specific expression of NBP-45 transcripts. In this blot the amounts of RNA spotted are normalized to the transcription levels of eight housekeeping genes; therefore, the intensity of the signal is indicative of the relative mRNA abundance in a tissue. Quantitative analysis of the signal indicated that in adult mouse the abundance of the NBP-45 mRNA varied over a 6-fold range (Fig.5, A and B). It was highest in the submaxilary gland, thymus, kidney, and liver and lowest in brain, lung, pancreas, and eye. Because Northern analysis with the same probe indicated that the mouse liver contains only a single size mRNA (Fig. 1 B), it is highly likely that the signal is due only to the presence of NBP-45 mRNA. We conclude that NBP-45 mRNA is present in variable amounts in most and perhaps all adult mouse tissues. NPB-45 mRNA was especially abundant in RNA extracted from 7-day-old embryos. At this developmental stage the abundance of NBP-45 is 4-fold higher than that of any adult tissue and almost 10-fold higher than that present in the uterus, ovary, or later embryonic stages (11, 15, 17-day-old embryos). Northern analysis of RNA obtained at the different embryonic stages verified that the probe hybridizes to a single, 1.9-kilobase mRNA species and that the abundance of this species was highest in the RNA isolated from 7-day-old embryos (Fig.5 C). Taken together, the results suggest that NBP-45 is expressed at low levels and in variable amounts in most and perhaps all adult mouse tissues. The presence of NBP-45 transcripts in all the mouse tissues tested suggest that this protein may have a housekeeping function. We postulate that the binding of NBP-45 to nucleosomes would introduce a high local density of negative charges, which could lead to significant structural changes in chromatin. In addition, the elevated levels of transcripts in 7-day-old embryos suggest that the protein may have an important function during specific developmental stages. The only protein domain known to bind preferentially to the 147-base pair nucleosome core particle in a sequence-independent fashion is the NBD, which until now was functionally detected only in the canonical HMG-14/-17 nuclear proteins. A possible protein closely related to the HMG-14/-17 proteins, Trip-7, had been detected in a HeLa cDNA library by a yeast two-hybrid assay (14.Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, so far the protein has not been isolated, and its interaction with nucleosomes has not been examined. We now report the cloning and characterization of a new protein, which we named NBP-45 that contains a functional NBD. NBP-45 is clearly a new type of protein, which is significantly different from the ubiquitous HMG-14/-17 proteins. These findings suggest that the NBD protein motif may be more widespread than previously thought and that the NBD may be embedded in nuclear proteins that target the nucleosomal chromatin structure. In this respect, the nucleosomal binding domain,i.e. the functional motif of the HMG-14/-17 protein family, resembles the functional motifs of the two other members of the HMG proteins: the HMG-1/-2 and the HMG-I/Y/C proteins. The functional motifs of these proteins, the HMG-1 box and the AT-hook, have been identified in numerous nuclear proteins that interact with DNA (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 11.Bustin M. Reeves R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology.54.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, all of the functional motifs present in the ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved HMG proteins are also present in non-HMG proteins. A characteristic property of all the HMG functional motifs is their ability to modify the structure of their binding site and induce a conformation that facilitates the progression of DNA-dependent activities such as transcription and replication (10.Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Our studies establish the NBD as a general protein motif, which is found in other than just HMG-14/-17 proteins. This protein motif may facilitate binding to nucleosomes in chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2083821124,"Previous reports have described the human DNA CGG repeat-binding protein (CGGBP1 or p20), which binds specifically to nonmethylated, but not to methylated, 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats in the promoter of the fragile X mental retardation 1(FMR1) gene. The results of transfection experiments into human HeLa cells using a p20-green fluorescent protein fusion construct indicate that the p20 protein is targeted to the nucleus. By deletion analyses, a nuclear localization signal has been found between amino acids 80 and 84. Deletions between amino acids 69 and 71 and between 95 and 167 interfere with 5′-(CGG)n-3′ binding. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays using DNA with 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats of different lengths render it likely that oligomers of the p20 protein bind to the repeat. In cotransfection experiments, the activity of the FMR1 promoter is reduced by the presence of p20. Upon transfection of the p20 cDNA construct into HeLa cells, transcription of the endogenousFMR1 gene is decreased. The green fluorescent protein-p20 fusion protein associates preferentially with the telomeres of the short arms of human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. Their telomeres carry the genes for the 28 S rRNA, which contain 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats. The translated region of the p20 gene from three healthy, five fragile X syndrome, and five premutation-carrying individuals has been sequenced, but mutations have not been detected.

The fragile X syndrome (FraX)1 is a frequent cause of mental retardation in human males. A naturally occurring 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat on Xq27.3 with normaln values between 6 and 50 can expand to values between 50 and 200 in nonsyndromic premutation carriers and, upon passage through a female germ line, to values of n > 200, leading to the disease, in case these expansions become 5′-CG-3′ methylated (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Mandel J.L.

In recent work, we have purified and characterized a 20-kDa 5′-(CGG)n-3′-binding protein termed CGGBP1 or p20 from the nuclei of human HeLa cells (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of this 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat-binding protein has been determined, an expressed sequence tag cDNA clone with a complete open reading frame has been identified in GenBankTM, and the p20 protein has been synthesized from a recombinant clone in Escherichia coli (17.Deissler H.

The recombinant protein has 5′-(CGG)n-3′ binding properties akin to the protein purified from HeLa cells. Thep20 coding sequence is highly conserved among mammals and is also found in chicken. The protein data base lacks sequences with homologies to p20. There is a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) (18.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem.

In this communication, we demonstrate that removal of the NLS from thep20 cDNA abolishes the ability of the p20 protein to localize exclusively to the nucleus of HeLa cells. We present evidence that the p20 can affect the activity of the endogenous FMR1promoter and when this promoter is located on a transfected construct. A fusion product of the p20 protein with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) can bind specifically to the telomeric regions on the short arms of human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. The translated sequence of the p20 gene is not mutated in the genomes of several individuals with premutation or full expansion 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats in their genomes. In the pFMR1-luc (luciferase) construct, the 2.7-kilobase pair SmaI-NheI fragment of pE5.1 (5.Verkerk A.J.M.H. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.-H. Kuhl D.P.A. Pizutti A. Reiner O. Richards S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar) was inserted into pGL2-Basic (Promega). pFMR1-ΔRep-luc was obtained by replacing the 5′-UTR of the FMR1 gene between the XhoI and NarI restriction endonuclease sites with the 5′-(CGG)16-3′ repeat by a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide without the repeat. pFMR1-NH08-luc was constructed by insertion of a cloned 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat from a natural premutation in the FMR1 promoter (20.Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For this purpose, pRW3308 was cleaved with the XbaI andHindIII endonucleases, and the 500-base pair fragment harboring an AGG/CAG-interrupted 5′-(CGG)160-3′ sequence was inserted into the NheI and HindIII endonuclease sites of pFMR1-luc 56 base pairs downstream of the endogenous 5′-(CGG)16-3′ repeat in the 5′-UTR. pAd2E2AL-luc was described earlier (21.Muiznieks I. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pEGFP-p20 expressing the p20 protein as a C-terminal fusion construct to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) from Aequorea victoria was obtained by cloning a PCR fragment from the p20 coding region flanked by aBamHI and a KpnI site into the BglII and KpnI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). For the construction of pCMV-p20, the plasmid pEGFP-p20 was cut withAgeI and XmnI endonucleases to remove the EGFP gene, and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was ligated via a synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide to thep20 cDNA coding sequence. Single nucleotide exchanges and a deletion were introduced into the coding sequence of p20 by PCR as described elsewhere (22.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Briefly, pairs of overlapping PCR products (5′-primary and 3′-primary products) containing the same mutations in the overlapping regions were synthesized by PCR with clonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), purified, and denatured. The reannealed heteroduplexes carrying recessed 3′-ends were filled in with Pfu DNA polymerase (2 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C), and the complete, mutated coding sequence was amplified with primers p20–5′-AgeI (5′-AGAACCGGTATGGAGCGATTTGTAACAG-3′) or p20–5′-BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGAGCGATTTGTAGTAACA-3′) and p20–3′-KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCTCAACAATCTTGTGAGTTGAG-3′). PCR amplification was performed as described by the manufacturer using expressed sequence tag clone ID269133 as template and an annealing temperature of 50 °C. The 5′-primary PCR products were PCR-amplified with either primer p20–5′-AgeI or p20–5′-BamHI and a primer carrying a deletion or point mutation. 3′-primary PCR products were amplified with p20–3′-KpnI and the corresponding mutated primer. Sequences of the mutated primers were (for p20-Δ(69–84)) 5′-AAGAGATGCAGTTAGG‖GGGGTATGAGCTTTGACTTGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCAAGTCAAAGACTCATACCCC‖CCTAACTGCATCTCTT-3′. Deletions are marked by a vertical line. Several point mutations were introduced in a similar way. Purified PCR products were cleaved withAgeI/KpnI (for fusions without the EGFP sequence) or BamHI/KpnI (with the EGFP sequence) and ligated into the appropriately precleaved pEGFP-C1-terminal protein fusion vector (Promega). E. coli DH5-α clones were isolated, and the nucleotide sequences of the p20 mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were grown to semiconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (23.Bablanian R. Eggers H.J. Tamm I. Virology. 1965; 26: 100-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). About 107 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml RPMI medium without glutamine or dye (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 μg of different plasmid constructs with 100 μg of autoclaved salmon sperm DNA were added and electroporated in 4-mm cuvettes with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 210 V, 960 μF at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in 37 °C Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on plates for 24 h. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline without Mg2+ and Ca2+, the cells were either analyzed by UV-microscopy or lysed for 10 min in 25 mmTris-phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the lysates were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) as described (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A published method (24.Williams M. Brys A. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4935-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) correlates the dependence of the mobility of a complex on gel concentration. This method yields an estimate of the molecular size of a complex. Under native conditions, the mobility of larger complexes is more sensitive to an increase in gel concentration than that of smaller ones. We used ovalbumin, catalase, and bovine serum albumin monomers, dimers and trimers as markers in 4–10% polyacrylamide gels in ½ TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to determine relative electrophoretic mobilities of the p20–5′-(CGG)17-3′ complex in the same gel. ForR f determination, the part of the gel with the marker proteins was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the EMSA part with the radiolabeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., X-OMAT). In vitro binding of proteins to radiolabeled double-stranded DNA was performed as described previously (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fragment 823 from the human 28 S rRNA gene was used that contained an interrupted 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat (5′-GCG CGG GTC GGG GCG GCG GCG GCG GCG GCG GTG GCG GCG GCG GCG GGG GCG GCG GGA CCG-3′, double-stranded; nucleotides 8758–8817, GenBankTMaccession number U13369; Ref. 25.Gonzalez I.L. Sylvester J.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and a mutated version, in which CGG triplet tracks were interrupted by AGGs (5′-GCG CGGGTC GGG GCG GAG GCG GAG GCG GAG GTG GCG GAG GCG GAG GGG GCG GAG GGA CCG-3′, double-stranded). Five fmol of labeled DNA were incubated with 1 μg of protein from cellular extracts. In control experiments, 0.5 pmol of competitor DNA was used. In supershift experiments, 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions of rabbit anti-p20 polyclonal antiserum were added. The reaction products were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in ½ TBE buffer. Binding of proteins to DNA containing longer repeats was investigated under similar conditions. Five fmol of the radiolabeledXbaI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pRW3316 (20.Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) containing 81 interrupted repeats ((CGG)11AGG(CGG)60CAG(CGG)8) were incubated with either 0.5 or 3 μg of total protein from crude cellular extracts. Competitor DNA was used as described. The products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film. HeLa cells, 5 × 106 cells per 8-cm-diameter plate, were transfected by the Superfect protocol (Qiagen) with 5 μg of pFMR1-luc, its mutants, or pAd2E2AL-luc plus 1–3 μg of pCMV-p20. Subsequently, cells were grown for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before luciferase activity was measured (21.Muiznieks I. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A total of 107 HeLa cells was electrotransfected with 5 μg of pCMV-p20, expressing the wild type p20 from the CMV immediate early promoter or with 5 μg of pCMV-p20-Δ(69–84), an amino acid 69–84 deletion mutant of p20 that lacks DNA binding activity. Total RNA was isolated from the cells 24 h posttransfection (RNeasy Mini Preparation, Qiagen), and 100 ng of RNA were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using primers for the FMR1 mRNA 5′-UTR (5′-AGCGCCCGCAGCCCACCTCTCGG-3′, sense) and exon 5 (5′-TCATTGTAAGTTGCATCACATGCTGC-3′, antisense). Amounts of 2.5–20 fg of an artificial, nonhomologous DNA fragment were used as internal standard that binds to the same primer pair. This protocol was reported to minimize errors (26.Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using AMV-reverse transcriptase and Tfl-DNA polymerase in the same tube (Access, Promega). In parallel, expression of the β-actin gene as a control of RNA quantity and quality was analyzed by amplification with a second primer pair (5′-CTCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGAG-3′, sense, exon 4; 5′-GATGGAGTTGAAGGTAGTTTCGTG-3′, antisense, exon 5). RT-PCR was carried out with 150 ng of each primer, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.2 mm of the four dNTPs in the presence of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and 2.5 units of both enzymes in AMV/Tfl buffer (Promega) in a volume of 25 μl by using a DNA Thermo Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). Temperature cycling was as follows: 48 °C for 30 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 45 s; and 68 °C for 5 min, allowing sequential reverse transcription and PCR without interruption. Aliquots of 6 μl of the PCR reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by using a phosphorimager. Binding targets of p20 on human chromosomes were identified by expressing the p20 protein as a C-terminal fusion product to the EGFP in HeLa cells: 20 μg of pEGFP-p20 were electrotransfected into 107 cells. Cells were harvested 24 h later and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (see above). Crude lysates were directly incubated with spreads of human chromosomes that were prepared as described (27.Hilger-Eversheim K. Doerfler W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly prepared chromosome spreads on microscope slides were incubated with 20 μl of crude extract diluted 10-fold in gel shift reaction buffer (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. Metaphase spreads were analyzed in an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope. Individual human chromosomes were identified by Giemsa trypsin G-banding following fluorescent in situ binding. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood of FraX, premutation, and unaffected individuals, and the translatedp20 region was PCR amplified by using the primers 5′-CAAGGAGTGGACCTGATTGCGA-3′ (nucleotides 10,143–10,164 in the genomic p20 sequence; GenBankTM accession numberAF094481) and 5′-CTCCACATTTATCTTGATCACAA-3′ (nucleotides 10,926–10,904). Reaction conditions were as follows: 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), 0.24 mm each of the dNTPs, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, 200 ng of genomic DNA. The mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus Gene Amp PCR system 9600. Products were elongated for 4 min at 72 °C, gel purified and cloned into the pGEM-T-vector (Promega). After clone isolation fromE. coli strain XL1-blue, the p20 coding sequence was determined in several clones. Because the p20 protein had been isolated from nuclear extracts of human cells (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Deissler H. Wilm M. Genç B. Schmitz B. Ternes T. Naumann F. Mann M. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16761-16768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was likely a nuclear protein. Moreover, a putative NLS was detected in the amino acid sequence of p20. More direct experiments were devised to investigate the subcellular localization of p20. Amino acid comparisons between the p20 protein and the SV40 large T antigen, nucleoplasmin, or the nuclear protein N1 (18.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar, 19.Makkerh J.P.S. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) render the sequence domain between amino acids 80 and about 84 a candidate for a NLS (Fig.1 a). Several p20mutants were created in fusion constructs containing the gene for GFP with enhanced activity from A. victoria (pEGFP). These pEGFP-p20 variants with deletions (Δ) or point mutations in thep20 coding region were electroporated into HeLa cells in culture. At 24 h after transfection, GFP fluorescence was determined by UV light microscopy (Fig. 1 b). Deletion mutants (Δ) impairing the domain of amino acids 80–84 in the p20 protein eliminated its physiological transport to the nucleus (wild type), as evidenced by homogeneous fluorescence throughout the cell. The deletion of amino acids 95–167 revealed a weak effect on nuclear transport. Selected point mutations within the critical amino acid 69–84 region had no influence on nuclear transport (data not shown). EMSAs using crude extracts of wild type p20- or mutant-transfected HeLa cells and 32P-labeled 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligomer as the probe (Fig. 1 c) revealed that deletions of amino acids 14–94, 69–84, 69–71, or 95–167 in the p20 protein led to very poor binding, if any at all, to the specific oligomer. Deletion of amino acids 80–84 reduced oligomer binding of the p20 protein. Weak background binding in the “negative” controls was probably due to endogenously synthesized p20 in HeLa cells. The formation of the cI complex (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was competed by unlabeled 5′-(CGG)17-3′ competitor. The data presented in this section demonstrate that the segment between amino acids 80 and 84 is essential and possibly sufficient for the nuclear localization of the p20 protein. The domain between amino acids 95 and 167 could also be part of the NLS. DNA binding of the p20 protein requires at least two of its domains, one between amino acids 69 and 71 and another one between amino acids 95 and 167. Thus, the two activities of the p20 protein, NLS and DNA binding, reside in two different, possibly partly overlapping, regions of the amino acid sequence. The possibility exists that the p20 protein, due to its specific binding to the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat, exhibits a direct effect on the FMR1 promoter. When the p20 protein is overexpressed under the control of the immediate early CMV promoter after cotransfection of the pCMV-p20 construct with the pFMR1-luc plasmid into HeLa cells, the FMR1 promoter is inhibited (Fig. 2, pFMR1-luc). Upon removal of the endogenous 5′-(CGG)16-3′ repeat from the 5′-UTR of the FMR1 promoter, the 5-fold repression by p20 overexpression is decreased to less than 2-fold (pFMR1-ΔRep-luc). The residual inhibition may be due to the more than 15 5′-CGG-3′ triplets in the 100 base pairs flanking the deleted 5′-(CGG)16-3′ repeat. In contrast, when a 5′-(AGG/CAG)-3′-interrupted 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat of n = 160 is inserted 56 base pairs downstream of the endogenous 5′-(CGG)16-3′ repeat, inhibition by overexpression of p20 is about 10-fold (pFMR1-NH08-luc). The activity of a luciferase gene construct under the control of the late E2A promoter of adenovirus type 2 (Fig.2, pAd2E2AL-luc) without 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats is not affected by the overexpression of the p20 protein in HeLa cells. These results demonstrate that the activity of the FMR1 promoter can be inhibited by the p20 protein in human HeLa cells. The extent of inhibition may depend on the length of a 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat. Because we found repression of the FMR1 promoter by p20 overexpression in cotransfection experiments, we also investigated whether elevated levels of p20 protein had an effect on the transcription of the endogenous FMR1 gene. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids overexpressing the p20 wild type protein or, as a control, a mutant form that could no longer bind to DNA. By functional analyses using gel shift assays, we estimated the p20 binding levels in transiently pCMV-p20-transfected cells to be about 4–5-fold higher than in mutant-transfected or nontransfected cells that only express the endogenous p20 protein (data not shown). Subsequently, total RNA was isolated from the cells and theFMR1 mRNA levels were analyzed by radioactive quantitative RT-PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Different amounts of an artificial internal standard (Fig. 3, R) were added and amplified by the same primer pair as the FMR1 cDNA (FMR1). As a further control, β-actin (Fig. 3, β-act) mRNA was amplified in the same reaction. Two alternatively spliced FMR1 mRNA products spanning exons 1–5 were detected in HeLa cells. When RNA from the lymphoblastoid cell line TR91.0042 (TR42), which had been derived from a fragile X patient, was analyzed, no FMR1 expression was detectable. Because the relative quantities of RT-PCR products reflect the representation of transcripts in the initial RNA pool (26.Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 244-249PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorimager quantitations of the FMR1 products compared with the product from the internal standards provided an estimate of the relative amounts of FMR1 mRNA in the cells. Our data indicate that the FMR1 mRNA is reproducibly underrepresented in the cells, which overexpress wild type p20, by a factor of 2–3 when compared with FMR1 mRNA levels in mutant p20-transfected cells. These data support the notion that p20 can play a role in the regulation of the transcription of the endogenousFMR1 gene. The degree of inhibition of theFMR1 promoter by the p20 protein seems to be dependent on the length of the repeat. Therefore, we have applied the relative mobility method (24.Williams M. Brys A. Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4935-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to test whether more than one p20 molecule can bind to a 5′-(CGG)n-3′ stretch at the same time. The estimated molecular size of the cI complex (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of 105 kDa (Fig.4 a) suggests that the 36-kDa 5′-(CGG)17-3′ DNA is indeed occupied by several p20 molecules. Moreover, EMSA experiments with longer 5′-(CGG)81-3′ repeats (20.Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have revealed a ladder of retarded bands supporting this hypothesis (Fig. 4 b). Does the pEGFP-p20 fusion protein overexpressed in HeLa cells bind directly to other 5′-(CGG)n-3′-rich regions on human chromosomes? As described under “Experimental Procedures,” extracts from HeLa cells, which overexpress this fusion protein, were directly added to and reacted with spreads of human chromosomes that were subsequently photographed under UV light. Green fluorescence reveals a specific weak chromosome banding. Most notably, the EGFP-p20 fusion protein binds specifically to the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, and 21 and more weakly to that of chromosome 22 (Fig.5, a and c). These chromosomes have been identified by their acrocentric morphology and their specific Giemsa banding patterns (Fig. 5, b andc). Binding to specific chromosomes, although less well identified, has also been observed with metaphase spreads from Syrian hamster and fish cells and more weakly with those from mouse cells (data not shown). The specificity of fluorescent in situbinding is supported by successful competition experiments. The simultaneous addition of 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligomers results in the complete loss of detectable binding, whereas mutated oligomers did not work as competitors (data not shown). The fluorescent in situ binding signals were eliminated by DNase but were resistant to RNase treatment. Thus, DNA appears to be the target for p20 protein binding on the chromosomes. The genes for the large ribosomal RNA are located in large tandem repeats in the acrocentric regions of the mentioned human chromosomes (28.Henderson A.S. Warburton D. Atwood K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3394-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 29.Evans H.J. Buckland R.A. Pardue M.L. Chromosoma. 1974; 48: 405-426Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). As documented by EMSA experiments using oligodeoxyribonucleotides from the 28 S rDNA (Fig.5 c), p20 can bind specifically to the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats in this gene flanked by 28 S structural sequences (25.Gonzalez I.L. Sylvester J.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). From the peripheral white blood cells of three healthy and five full expansion FraX males and their premutation mothers, part of the 5′-UTR and the translated region of the p20 gene was PCR-amplified and cloned, and the nucleotide sequences of these PCR products were determined (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Mutations in thep20 coding region of FraX or premutation individuals were not detected. These results render a direct role of mutations in the coding part of the p20 gene in the causation of the FraX syndrome unlikely. In addition, we prepared nuclear extracts from activated lymphocytes from FraX, premutation, or unaffected individuals. The results of EMSA experiments revealed that proteins from either group of probands had the same binding activity to the 5′-(CGG)17-3′ oligodeoxyribonucleotide (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Deissler H. Wilm M. Genç B. Schmitz B. Ternes T. Naumann F. Mann M. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16761-16768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Apparently, active p20 is expressed in the lymphocytes of FraX patients and premutation carriers. The p20 protein is a nuclear protein that has originally been isolated from human HeLa cells and is abundant in mammalian species (16.Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17.Deissler H. Wilm M. Genç B. Schmitz B. Ternes T. Naumann F. Mann M. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16761-16768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The p20 protein binds specifically to 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats in the (human) genome. The p20 protein fails to show homologies to yeast proteins; thus, revealing biochemical analogies are not available. We have started to investigate possible functions of the p20 protein: it recognizes specific trinucleotide repeats and binds at such sites in the genome. The data adduced in this series of investigations support the following additional conclusions. The p20 protein is located in the nucleus and carries a nuclear localization signal between amino acids 80 and 84, the removal of which leads to the homogeneous distribution of the p20 protein over the entire cell. The segment between amino acids 95 and 167 might weakly contribute to the NLS activity. The p20 regions between amino acids 69 and 71 and between amino acids 95 and 167 are responsible for 5′-(CGG)n-3′ binding. Apparently due to its binding capacity to the 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat in the promoter of the human FMR1 protein, the p20 protein—at least when overexpressed in human cells—is capable of reducing the activity of this promoter, particularly when the repeats are expanded. The p20 protein probably forms oligomers in its association with 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats. In this way, the effect of repeat length on p20 protein binding and repression might be explained. We have also tested the effect of p20 overexpression on the amount of endogenous FMR1 mRNA present in human HeLa cells. The observed reduction in the transcription of the FMR1 gene further supports the notion that p20 acts as a regulator of theFMR1 and other promoters due to its capability to bind to 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeats. In FraXA patients or in premutation individuals, mutations in the translated sequence of the p20 gene have not been found. Thus, it is unlikely that alterations in the p20 gene could play a direct role in the causation of the FraXA phenotype. The p20 protein can bind specifically to the short arms of the acrocentric human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, presumably to a 5′-(CGG)n-3′-rich region associated with the 28 Sribosomal RNA genes. It will be interesting to investigate which other promoters can be regulated by p20. Our data imply a role of p20 in the inactivation of the FMR1gene that occurs following 5′-(CGG)n-3′ repeat expansion. A stepwise amplification of the repeat might result in the binding of an increasing number of p20 molecules to the 5′-region of theFMR1 gene that tunes down gene activity progressively and finally results in the silencing of FMR1 expression. This hypothesis predicts that functional p20 is found in FraX patients as demonstrated in this report. We have not observed differences in expression levels of p20 between healthy individuals and those affected by the fragile X syndrome. We thank Robert D. Wells (Houston, TX) for the plasmids pRW3316 and pRW3308 and Frank Kooy (University of Antwerp) for providing the cell line TR91.0042. H.

This insect has several physiologically active molecules in its saliva that assist its blood-sucking behavior (1.Ribeiro J.M.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2.Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 87-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Hellmann and Hawkins (3.Hellman K. Hawkins R.I. Nature. 1965; 207: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) first reported an anticoagulation activity in its saliva and named a possible anticoagulant prolixin-S. We have already reported purification, characterization, and the cDNA sequence of a salivary anticoagulant from this insect and pointed out that this inhibitor was the prolixin-S reported previously (4.Sun J.

In addition, we reported that prolixin-S specifically prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).1 This activity was explained by inhibition of the intrinsic Xase. Prolixin-S is a hemoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa, structurally and immunologically related to other hemoproteins (nitrophorins) identified in the salivary gland of R. prolixus (4.Sun J.

These hemoproteins, including prolixin-S, bind nitric oxide (NO) in their heme groups and are thought to transport NO to the host blood vessel, where NO acts as a vasodilator and a platelet aggregation inhibitor to assist blood feeding (9.Ribeiro J.M.C.

It was also demonstrated that its heme moiety, therefore also NO, was not involved in its anticoagulation activity (10.Yuda M. Higuchi K. Sun J. Kureishi Y. Ito M. Chinzei Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following initiation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, generated factor XIa activates factor IX to factor IXa. On the other hand, in the extrinsic coagulation pathway, factor VIIa forms a complex with tissue factor on the phospholipid membrane surface and activates factor IX (11.Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 12.Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Factor IX activated by these different coagulation pathways forms “intrinsic Xase complex” together with factor VIIIa and Ca2+ on the phospholipid membrane surface (11.Davie E.W. Fujikawa K.

Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which results in generation of thrombin and clot formation. In addition, generated thrombin further enhances the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway by activation of factor XI and subsequent generation factor IXa (16.Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1993; 19: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, factor IX plays a central role in both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulations. In this paper, we show that prolixin-S directly binds to both factor IX and factor IXa. We suggest that prolixin-S binding to factor IXa may inhibit the intrinsic Xase complex formation itself. In addition, we demonstrated that prolixin-S binding to factor IX inhibits factor IX activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor complex and factor IX activation by factor XIa. Our results show that prolixin-S inhibits all coagulation pathways in which factor IX participates and that prolixin-S would act as an inhibitor of both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulations. Human factors IX, IXa, XIa, X, Xa, and VIIa were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant human factor VIII was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT), and activated before use as described by Astermark et al. (18.Astermark J. Hogg P.J. Bjork I. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3249-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant tissue factor was purchased from American Diagnostica Inc., and its relipidation was prepared as described by Zhong et al. (19.Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine protein concentrations, the following extinction coefficients ( E2800.1%) and molecular weights were used: human factor IX, 1.33 and 57,000; factor IXa, 1.4 and 46,000; factor XIa,1.34 and 143,000; factor X, 1.16 and 56,500; factor Xa, 1.16 and 46,500; factor VIIa, 1.16 and 56,500. The Gla-domainless factor IXa was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of factor IXa as described by Morita et al. (20.Morita T. Kisiel W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Morita T. Fukudome K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Sigma. Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicle suspension (PC and PS in a 7: 3 (w/w) ratio) was prepared as described by Komiyama et al. (22.Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and quantified by standard method. Recombinant prolixin-S (designated rProlixin-S hereafter) was produced using a baculovirus system, purified and reconstituted with hemin as described previously (10.Yuda M. Higuchi K. Sun J. Kureishi Y. Ito M. Chinzei Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). rProlixin-S has been demonstrated to have the same activity as native protein (10.Yuda M. Higuchi K. Sun J. Kureishi Y. Ito M. Chinzei Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GST-fused prolixin-S (designated GST-prolixin-S hereafter) was produced in Escherichia coli (BL21 strain). In brief, cDNA fragments encoding prolixin-S without signal peptide were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into a expression plasmid, pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Produced GST-prolixin-S was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The specific activity (per weight) of GST-prolixin-S was estimated by inhibition of Xase activity in a reconstituted assay system (without VIIIa, see below) and shown to be approximately 2% of rProlixin-S. Since the specific activity did not increase even after removal of GST from the fusion protein, reduction of the activity would be due to improper folding and degradation of the recombinant protein in E. coli. Surface plasmon resonance studies were performed using a BIAcore X instrument (Biacore AB, Sweden). Coagulation factor was immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding analyses were performed using HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween 20) as running buffer at 25 °C. Forty microliters of varying concentrations of rProlixin-S (1.31–100 nm) was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Association was monitored during a 2-min injection of analyte. Dissociation was monitored during 2 min after return to buffer flow. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was achieved by a pulse injection of 0.5 m EDTA. To determine the kinetic binding constants (ka , kd , andK d), the binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression (23.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) using the evaluation software (BIAevaluation 3.0). The experimental data fit well with a 1:1 binding model (Langmuir). The Ca2+ dependence of rProlixin-S binding to factor IX/IXa was also investigated by the same method. In this experiment, HBS buffer was passed through a column of Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) to remove metal contaminants before adding CaCl2. Each of proteins was dialyzed in a metal-chelating HBS buffer containing 0.1% Chelex 100. rProlixin-S (100 nm) was injected at different Ca2+ concentrations. To monitor the factor IX/IXa-phospholipid interaction, surface of a sensor chip HPA was coated with lipid monolayer (PC:PS = 7:3) according to manufacturer's instruction. Factor IX/IXa and rProlixin-S were preincubated for 5 min in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2), and the mixture was loaded onto the sensor chip surface. Three micrograms of factor IX or factor IXa were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing GST-prolixin-S (approximately 1 μg of protein/1 μl of bed volume) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% BSA, 0.025% Triton X-100) containing 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times, boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and directly subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for detection with antibody. Wells of a microtiter plate (Immulon 2, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.) were incubated with different coagulation factors in buffer A overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 5% BSA, washed twice, and incubated with GST or GST-prolixin-S in buffer A containing 1% BSA for 1 h. Wells were then washed three times with buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with anti-GST polyclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) for 1 h, and washed five times. Peroxidase activity was detected with 0.05% (w/v) 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzoline-6-sulfonic acid) and 0.05%(v/v) H2O2, and absorbance was read at 405 nm. The effect of Ca2+ concentration on the binding of prolixin-S to factor IX/IXa was investigated by the same procedure with modifications as follows. The buffer used in this assay was passed through a column of Chelex 100. Protein solution (GST-prolixin-S, factor IX, and factor IXa) were dialyzed against buffer containing 0.1% Chelex 100 resin. The wells coated with factor IX or factor IXa (10 nm) were incubated with GST-prolixin-S (4.7 μg/ml) and then washed in buffer containing various concentrations of CaCl2. Factor IXa (9 μg, 200 pmol) was incubated with various concentrations of rProlixin-S in buffer A for 10 min and then added to 600 μl of the same buffer containing 9 μg of phospholipid vesicles. The interaction of factor IXa with phospholipid membrane surface was evaluated by the relative 90° light-scattering technique using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 nm as described by Nelsestuen and Lim (24.Nelsestuen G.L. Lim T.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4164-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For the assay in the presence of factor VIIIa, factor IXa (500 pm, in final concentration) was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with rProlixin-S (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 nm) in buffer buffer A containing 1% BSA and added to reaction mixture (the same buffer containing 1.5 units/ml factor VIIIa, 40 μm phospholipid suspension and 400 nmfactor X). For the assay in the absence of factor VIIIa, factor IXa (50 nm, in final concentration) was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with rProlixin-S (0, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 250 nm) and added to the reaction mixture without factor VIIIa. After 10 min of incubation, the activity of generated factor Xa was determined using chromogenic substrate S-2222 (Chromogenix AB). Factor IX (750 nm) was preincubated with rProlixin-S (0, 375, 750, or 2250 nm) in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000 at 37 °C for 10 min and then activated by addition of factor XIa (0.54 nm). Aliquots were removed from this mixture at time intervals and immediately added to SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol in order to stop the reaction. These samples were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by FMBIO-II Multi-View system (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.) after stained with the SYPRO® Red protein stain (FMC BioProducts). The total intensity of each band was analyzed with the aid of software (FMBIO Analysis version 6.0), and the progress of the reaction was evaluated. To prepare the reaction mixture containing factor VIIa/tissue factor/phospholipid-enzyme complex, lipidated tissue factor (35 nm) was incubated with factor VIIa (25 nm) and 1 mm phospholipid in buffer B at 37 °C for 30 min. Factor IX (600 nm) was preincubated with rProlixin-S (0, 600, or 1800 nm) in buffer B at 37 °C for 10 min and added to the reaction mixture. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at designated time points, and the progress of the activation was evaluated as described above. Factor IX (600 nm) was preincubated with rProlixin-S (0, 600, and 1800 nm) in buffer B at 37 °C for 10 min. This mixture was added to the reaction mixture (buffer B containing 400 μm phospholipid suspension and 50 nm factor X). The progress of the factor IX conversion to factor IXα was monitored and analyzed as described above. In the previous paper (4.Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Yuda M. Miura K. Takeya H. Hirai M. Matsuoka H. Ando K. Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Chinzei Y. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that prolixin-S inhibited intrinsic Xase activity in the absence of factor VIIIa. This result suggests that prolixin-S may inhibit intrinsic Xase activity by direct interaction with factor IXa. Therefore, we performed SPR analysis in order to examine direct interactions between prolixin-S and factor IX/IXa. As shown in Fig.1, the injections of prolixin-S onto immobilized factor IX/IXa gave significant responses, indicating that prolixin-S binds both zymogen and enzyme form of factor IX. At a standard condition (pH = 7.4 and [Ca2+] = 5 mm), ka , kd , and K d for prolixin-S binding to factor IXa were 3.11 ± 0.35 × 105m−1s−1, 4.06 ± 0.61 × 10−3s−1, and 13.2 ± 0.24 nm, respectively. On the other hand, those values to factor IX zymogen were 5.03 ± 0.46 × 105m−1 s−1, 6.47 ± 0.62 × 10−3 s−1, and 13.0 ± 0.14 nm, respectively. In contrast, Prolixin-S showed no interactions with other coagulation factors tested, even when excess of ligand was immobilized (Fig. 2). In addition, prolixin-S failed to interact with Gla-domainless factor IXa. This indicates that the binding site would be located in the Gla domain of factor IXa (see “Discussion”).Figure 2Sensorgrams for the interaction between prolixin-S and several coagulation factors. Factor IXa, IX, XIa, VIIa, X, Xa, and Gla-domainless factor IXa were coupled onto sensor tips at final levels of 980, 830, 2300, 2170, 2820, 3190, and 2890 RUs, respectively. Sensorgrams (association phases) were obtained from injections of prolixin-S (100 nm) at flow rate of 20 μl/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since it had been reported that factor IX/IXa changes its conformation depending on Ca2+ binding (see “Discussion”), we monitored the rProlixin-S binding to factor IX/IXa at different Ca2+ concentrations. Responses were not observed at 0.2 mm or less, rapidly increased depending on Ca2+concentrations over 0.2 mm, and nearly reached plateau at 1 mm. The results presented above were also supported by assays performed with GST-prolixin-S. GST-pull down assay showed that factors IX and factor IXa bound to GST-prolixin-S only in the presence of Ca2+ ions (data not shown). Solid phase binding assay showed that GST-prolixin-S bound to factor IX/IXa but not to other factors tested (factor XIa, factor X, and factor VIIIa). Solid phase binding assay also showed that binding potency of GST-prolixin-S to factor IX/IXa rapidly increased dependent on the Ca2+concentrations especially between 0.3 and 1 mm (data not shown). In order to investigate whether prolixin-S binding to factor IXa affects its interaction with phospholipids, we monitored the interactions (association phases) in the presence of rProlixin-S by SPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the response decreased with increasing rProlixin-S content, showing that rProlixin-S inhibits the factor IXa binding to phospholipids. Light-scattering experiment also supported this result. The light scattering intensities due to factor IXa-phospholipid vesicle complex formation dramatically decreased concomitant with increasing rProlixin-S content (data not shown). The scattering intensity was reduced to 28% after incubation with equimolar rProlixin-S. Our previous study showed that prolixin-S inhibited factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X (4.Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Yuda M. Miura K. Takeya H. Hirai M. Matsuoka H. Ando K. Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Chinzei Y. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of this reaction by prolixin-S did not appear so potent because complete inhibition was not observed, even when an excess of prolixin-S was used. In the previous experiments, prolixin-S was preincubated together with factor IXa, factor VIIIa, and phospholipids and the reaction was started with addition of factor X. We thought the inhibitory activity of prolixin-S would have been underestimated in this procedure, if the inhibitory effect by prolixin-S resulted from interference with Xase complex formation itself. Therefore, in these experiments, we altered the order of rProlixin-S addition as follows. rProlixin-S was preincubated with factor IXa in Ca2+-containing buffer and reaction was started by adding it to a reaction mixture containing phospholipid in the presence and absence of factor VIIIa. As shown in Fig. 4 A, in the presence of factor VIIIa, rProlixin-S inhibited factor X activation by factor IXa in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of excess rProlixin-S resulted in almost complete inhibition. Dose-dependent inhibition by rProlixin-S was also observed in the absence of factor VIIIa (Fig. 4 B). Our previous studies using a synthetic substrate showed that prolixin-S could not inhibit factor XIa amidolytic activity (4.Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Yuda M. Miura K. Takeya H. Hirai M. Matsuoka H. Ando K. Watanabe T. Suzuki K. Chinzei Y. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5.Yuda M. Sun J. Yamaguchi M. Ando K. Chinzei Y. Med. Entomol. Zool. 1996; 47: 263-272Crossref Google Scholar). However, this result does not rule out a possibility that prolixin-S could inhibit activation of a physiological substrate, factor IX. Furthermore, it was shown above that prolixin-S binds to factor IX in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Based on this reason, we investigated the inhibitory effect of prolixin-S on factor XIa-catalyzed activation of factor IX in a reconstitution system. In these experiments, factor IX was preincubated with rProlixin-S before addition of factor XIa, and activation of factor IX was checked by SDS-PAGE after time intervals following addition of factor XIa. Fig.5 shows the results of the time-course study. Factor IXa generation by factor XIa was inhibited by the addition of rProlixin-S in a dose-dependent manner. The rate of factor IX activation was reduced by 91% after incubation with equimolar rProlixin-S and almost completely inhibited after incubation with a 3-fold molar excess of rProlixin-S. These results suggest that prolixin-S binds to factor IX stoichiometrically 1:1, resulting in almost complete inhibition of factor IX activation by factor XIa. On the other hand, also shown in Fig. 5, when molar ratios between rProlixin-S and factor IX were 1:2, factor IX was completely activated by factor XIa within 60 min. This make clear contrast to strong inhibitory effect of rProlixin-S observed when molar ratios between rProlixin-S and factor IX were 3:1 and 1:1. We suppose that the result would be explained by the fact that rProlixin-S binds to the reaction product (factor IXa) as well as factor IX with almost the same kinetics, i.e. in the progress of the reaction, a ratio of prolixin-S bound to factor IXa gradually increased and then excess factor IX was sequentially activated, resulting in the complete activation. In order to clearly demonstrate this assumption, we compared the activation of factor IX between the following conditions, that is, with molar ratios between prolixin-S and factor IX 2:1 and 2:4 and the concentrations of factor XIa (1.35 nm) and prolixin-S (1500 nm) kept constant. As shown in Fig.6, factor IX was almost fully activated within 30 min when an inhibitor/factor IX ratio was 2:4. In contrast, a considerable amount remained unactivated when the inhibitor/factor IX ratio was 2:1. This result means that a larger amount of substrate was digested although other conditions were identical. These results would be explained only by the assumption presented above. The factor VIIa-tissue factor complex proteolytically activates factor IX on phospholipid membrane in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Factor IX should bind to the phospholipid membrane surface to be catalyzed as a substrate of this reaction. Thus, it was supposed that prolixin-S would inhibit factor IX activation by interference with its binding to the phospholipid membrane. We examined this possibility by the time-course study in a reconstitution system. As shown in Fig.7 A, factor IXa generation by factor VIIa was inhibited by the addition of rProlixin-S in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of a 3-fold molar excess rProlixin-S resulted in almost complete inhibition (99.7%) of factor IXa generation. Membrane-bound factor Xa converts factor IX to factor IXα, an intermediate product in factor IX activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. Lawson and Mann (12.Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a model that this proteolytic conversion of factor IX to factor IXα cooperatively enhances generation of factor IXaβ by factor VIIa-tissue factor complex in the initial stage of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Since this proteolytic conversion also proceeds on the phospholipid membrane, we examined inhibitory effect of prolixin-S on this reaction using a reconstitution system. As shown in Fig.7 B, rProlixin-S inhibited the proteolysis in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of a 3-fold molar excess rProlixin-S resulted in 84.1% inhibition of factor IXa generation. In this study, we attempted to clarify the mechanism by which prolixin-S inhibits blood coagulation. We found that prolixin-S had the specific ability to bind to factor IX and factor IXa. Prompted by this finding, we found that prolixin-S binding to factor IXa interfered with its association with phospholipids. This interference would lead factor IXa to failure to form intrinsic Xase on the phospholipid membrane surface and results in reduction of its Xase activity. We also demonstrated that prolixin-S binding to factor IX inhibited activation of factor IX by factor XIa. This finding shows that prolixin-S could acts on the earlier phase of the intrinsic coagulation than it has been believed. Since the activation of factor IX by factor XIa does not require a phospholipid membrane, the inhibition of factor IX activation cannot be explained by interference with factor IX binding to phospholipids. As discussed later, we supposed that Gla domain binding of prolixin-S would directly interfere with interaction between factor IX and factor XIa. We think these distinct inhibitory mechanisms may contribute to the intrinsic pathway inhibition and severe prolongation of APTT by prolixin-S. In addition to the intrinsic pathway inhibition mentioned above, we found that prolixin-S also acts as an inhibitor of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Reconstitution experiments showed that prolixin-S inhibited factor IX activation by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. In addition, prolixin-S inhibited the conversion of factor IX to IXα by factor Xa (12.Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11317-11327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3574-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These inhibitory activities may be due to its interference with factor IX binding to phospholipids because both proteolysis of factor IX should proceed on the phospholipid membrane surface (13.Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that prolixin-S hardly elongated prothrombin time. It made a clear contrast with its potent prolongation of APTT. This result would be due to the fact that, in prothrombin time assays, a high concentration of tissue factor and phospholipid was used to initiate the reaction. Direct factor X activation by excess amount of factor VIIa-tissue factor complex would have masked the inhibitory effect of prolixin-S on factor IX activation by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex (13.Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, prolixin-S could act as an extrinsic pathway inhibitor in physiological hemostasis because, in vivo, only a limited amount of tissue factor contacts the blood and forms a complex with factor VIIa. Since extrinsic coagulation is known to be crucial for initiation of the physiological hemostasis following vesicular injury, the extrinsic pathway inhibition would be important for the blood sucking insect to arrest blood coagulation in the initial phase. We think that prolixin-S shows these activities by binding to the Gla domain of factor IX (IXa). Gla domain of factor IX is known to be a phospholipid binding domain of factor IX/IXa and dramatically change its conformation with Ca2+ binding, especially in Ca2+ concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mm. This conformation change enables this domain to interact with phospholipid membranes (25.Schwalbe R.A. Ryan J. Stern D.M. Kisiel W. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20288-20296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results of SPR analysis and solid phase binding assays showed that binding property of prolixin-S to factor IX and factor IXa dramatically changed between 0.3 and 1 mm. This suggests that prolixin-S binds to factor IX/IXa by recognizing a Ca2+-dependent conformation of the Gla domain and inhibits its interactions with phospholipid vesicles. It was strongly supported by the findings that prolixin-S could not interact with factor IXa without the Gla domain (Fig. 2). Interestingly, inhibitory properties of prolixin-S are similar to those of the Ca2+-induced conformation specific antibodies (27.Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies bind to the Gla domain of factor IX/IXa by recognizing its Ca2+-dependent conformation change and inhibit the binding to phospholipid vesicles. Furthermore, these antibodies inhibit the activation of factor IX by factor XIa (27.Liebman H.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7605-7612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Jacobs M. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25494-25501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These coincidences suggest that prolixin-S and some of these antibodies recognize the same or a related site on the Gla domain formed by Ca2+ binding. It is also suggested that the Gla domain plays an important role in the activation of factor IX by factor XIa as well as in the binding to phospholipids. In fact, Wojcik et al. (29.Wojcik E.G. Van Den Berg M. Poort S.R. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the conformational change of Gla domain is important for the factor IX activation by factor XIa. In conclusion, we identified factor IX and factor IXa as target molecules of prolixin-S. We show that prolixin-S affects all known proteolytic reactions in which factor IX participates and that the vital point of this factor may be present in the Gla domain. We thank Dr. Gerard R.

Attachment is mediated by a type II integral membrane protein with hemagglutinin and sialidase activities, termed the hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN). Fusion is caused principally by a type I integral membrane protein, termed the fusion protein (3.Morrison T. Portner A. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses.

Other members of the paramyxoviridae have similar membrane glycoproteins to orchestrate transmission of their nucleocapsids, containing their negative sense RNA genomes, into host cells. All members of the paramyxoviridae have fusion proteins with very similar structural motifs; however, the attachment proteins of the different subfamilies and genera exhibit different functional profiles and substantial structural variability. Members of theparamyxovirus genus (e.g. parainfluenza viruses) also have HN proteins, and members of the morbillivirusgenus (e.g. measles virus) have a similar protein with hemagglutinin (H) activity and little (9.Langedijk J.P.M.

Virol. 1997; 71: 6155-6167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Colman P.M. Hoyne P.A. Lawrence M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Epa V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutagenesis studies (31.McInnes L.W. Morrison T. Virology. 1994; 200: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have provided some experimental support for these predictions; however, the complete disulfide bond pattern of the protein has not been determined experimentally. This report describes isolation of NDV HN ectodomains, generation and isolation of disulfide-linked peptides from the HN, and a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis of the disulfide linkages between and within these peptides. The experimentally determined complete disulfide bond arrangement of the NDV HN is reported herein and compared with the disulfide bond patterns predicted by previous molecular modeling and cysteine mutagenesis studies. Dispase grade I (a neutral protease fromBacillus polymyxa), n-octylglucoside, pepsin, peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tributylphosphine was from Tokyo Kasei and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and cyanogen bromide were from Pierce. 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (MUNANA) was from Sigma. A vaccine preparation of the V4 isolate of the Queensland strain of NDV was obtained from Arthur Webster Pty. Ltd., Northmead, New South Wales, Australia. 2,6-Dihydroxyacetophenone from Fluka was recrystallized from 20% (v/v) ethanol while α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid from Aldrich was recrystallized from methanol. All other reagents were of either reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) grade or the highest quality analytical reagent grade. NDV was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and harvested as described previously (35.Hodder A.N. Selleck P.W. White J.R. Gorman J.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36.Hodder A.N. Liu Z.Y. Selleck P.W. Corino G.L. Shiell B.J. Grix D.C. Morrow C.J. Gorman J.J. Avian Dis. 1994; 38: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The final pellet of virions was suspended to a concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (HNE) buffer (pH 7.2). An equal volume of 4% (w/v) n-octylglucoside in H2O was added to the virus preparation, and the mixture was allowed to stand at 22 °C for 30 min. Released nucleocapsids and any insoluble membrane aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 110,000 × g and 15 °C. Dispase (10 mg/ml in HNE buffer (pH 7.2)) and CaCl2 were added to the separated supernatant of the detergent-solubilized virions to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 10 mm, respectively. Dispase digestion was then conducted for 2 h at 37 °C, and the digest was cooled to 4 °C prior to adding 10 volumes ofn-butanol at −20 °C. The n-butanol and aqueous phases were mixed gently until any signs of an emulsion disappeared, and precipitation of proteins was allowed to proceed for 16 h at −20 °C. Precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation at −10 °C, washed twice with n-butanol at −20 °C and once with diethylether at −20 °C, and subsequently dried under a stream of high purity nitrogen gas. The dried protein preparation was resuspended in HNE buffer (pH 7.2), clarified by centrifugation, and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane prior to application to a column of Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.6 cm × 95 cm). Separation of the proteins was achieved by elution at 2 ml/min and 22 °C with HNE buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The effluent was continuously monitored at 280 nm for the presence of protein, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Detection of sialidase activity in column fractions was achieved by using MUNANA acid as a substrate. This involved incubation of 5 μl of each fraction with 50 μl of a solution containing 85 μm MUNANA, 8.5 mm CaCl2, and 85 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5). After incubation for 5 min at 22 °C in the dark the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 133 mm glycine, 33 mmNa2CO3 (pH 10.7). Liberation of methylumbelliferone as a consequence of sialidase activity was determined by reading the resultant fluorescence in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorimeter fitted with a plate reader and set for excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm. The fractions of apparent homogeneity by polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and highest specific sialidase activity were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C to 10–12 mg/ml using an Amicon-stirred cell fitted with a YM 10 membrane. Concentrated protein preparations were stored at 4 °C. Pepsin digestion of HN ectodomains was conducted on ∼400 μg of HN after precipitation of the protein from HNE buffer by the addition of 9 volumes of methanol at −20 °C and leaving the protein at −20 °C for 16 h. The resultant pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed with −20 °C methanol, and dried in vacuo. The dried pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mm acetic acid, 100 mm formic acid and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h after adding 20 μg of pepsin in 2 μl of 100 mm acetic acid, 100 mm formic acid. PNGase F/trypsin digestion was performed after reconstitution of the contents of dried RP-HPLC fractions in 20 μl of 100 mmammonium bicarbonate containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, by the addition of 5 units of PNGase F and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequent tryptic cleavage was achieved by the addition of 1 μg of trypsin and incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Chymotryptic digestion was performed after RP-HPLC fractions were dried in vacuo and reconstituted in 10 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate by the addition of 0.5 μg of chymotrypsin solution and incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. Cyanogen bromide treatment was performed on RP-HPLC fractions that had been dried in vacuo and reconstituted in 9 μl of 70% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Cleavage was achieved by the addition of 1 μl of 1 m cyanogen bromide in acetonitrile and incubation at 22 °C for 13 h. The sample was evaporated in vacuo, and residual cyanogen bromide was removed by three cycles of reconstitution in 20 μl of 33% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and evaporation. Prior to further analysis the sample was desalted on a microcolumn of C18 silica. Manual Edman degradation was performed in 1-ml tapered Reactivials. Dried samples were reconstituted in 20 μl of 50% (v/v) pyridine:water containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide; 5 μl of 50% (v/v) pyridine:water saturated with phenyl isothiocyanate was added, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min under nitrogen. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with 400 μl of heptane:ethyl acetate 2:1 (v/v) and then dried in vacuo. Cleavage was performed by adding 20 μl of trifluoroacetic acid and heating at 50 °C for 7 min under nitrogen. Trifluoroacetic acid was removed in vacuo, and the tube was washed with diethyl ether. After drying the tube in vacuo the truncated peptide was dissolved in 33% acetonitrile:water (v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for subsequent analysis. A Hewlett Packard 1090M system was used for preparative RP-HPLC. Peptide separation was achieved at 0.15 ml/min using a 2.1 mm × 25 cm C18 column (Vydac, catalog number 218TP52) with a linear gradient from 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid to 32% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min and a subsequent linear increase in the acetonitrile concentration to 80% (v/v) over 20 min. A HP1090 photodiode array detector was used to continuously monitor the eluant at 214 and 280 nm. Fractions were collected into polypropylene tubes for subsequent analysis. Where required, peptic digests were reduced prior to RP-HPLC by the addition of 6 μl of 1 mammonium bicarbonate to 30 μl of the digest, followed by 5 μl of 1% (v/v) tributylphosphine in isopropanol. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and then evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Traces of tributylphosphine were removed by two cycles of adding 20 μl of isopropanol and re-evaporation. The reduced digest was reconstituted in 50 μl of 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Protein molecular weight determination was performed in linear mode using a Bruker Reflex time-of-flight instrument fitted with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Samples were ionized from a matrix comprised of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone containing diammonium hydrogen citrate (38.Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and bovine serum albumin was used for external calibration. Protein ions were accelerated at 20 kV and detected with a Bruker HIMAS detector. Peptides were analyzed in reflector mode with delayed extraction using an acceleration voltage of 20.0 kV and a reflectron voltage of 22.8 kV. Peptide data were generally collected after ionization from the above matrix at 500 MHz in the m/z = 500 to 8000 range with the instrument calibrated externally using a mixture of human angiotensin II, ACTH clip (residues 18–39), and bovine insulin. Peptide sequencing by post-source decay (PSD) employed an acceleration voltage of 26.3 kV and a series of 14 reflectron voltage steps from 30 to 0.95 kV. Individual spectra were obtained at each step by collecting ∼50–100 laser shots. A pulsed gate mounted shortly after the ion source was used to select precursor ions. Bruker XMASS software was used to assemble resulting spectra onto a continuous true m/z scale. PSD spectra were calibrated using a calibration file created with fragments of ACTH residues 18–39 (39.Rouse J.C., Yu, W. Martin S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 822-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reduction of disulfide-linked peptides prior to MALDI-TOF-MS was performed by mixing 4 μl of digest or RP-HPLC fraction with 0.5 μl of 1 m diammonium hydrogen citrate and 0.5 μl of 50 mm TCEP and incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 60 min (38.Gorman J.J. Ferguson B.L. Nguyen T.B. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For molecular weight determination of the reduced peptides, 1 μl of the reduction mixture was mixed with 1 μl of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone solution (10 mg/ml in 1:1 ethanol:acetonitrile (v/v)), and 1 μl of this mixture was dried briefly in vacuo on a stainless steel sample target. For PSD analysis of reduced peptides, 0.5 μl of the reduction mixture was mixed with 0.5 μl of 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, placed on a preprepared thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (40.Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar), and dried briefly in vacuo. The sample spot was then washed with two 1-μl aliquots of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, excess solvent being removed with a stream of nitrogen. A Hewlett Packard 1100 system was used for liquid chromatography-MS with separation performed on a 1 mm × 25 cm C18 column (Vydac, catalog number 218TP51) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min using the same gradient as was used for preparative RP-HPLC except the initial and final trifluoroacetic acid concentrations were 0.05 and 0.045% (v/v), respectively. A HP 1100 photodiode array detector was used to continuously monitor the absorbance of the eluate at 214 and 280 nm, and the outlet of the flow cell was connected directly to the ESI source of a PE-Sciex 150EX liquid chromatography-MS system via a short length of fused silica tubing. The mass spectrometer was scanned fromm/z = 100 to 3000 with an ion source orifice potential of 50 V. For experiments involving the production of in-source collisional fragmentation an orifice potential of 80 V was used. The mass spectrometer was scanned with a 0.25 atomic mass unit step and a dwell time of 0.40 or 0.50 ms/step. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments were performed using a PE-Sciex API-300 system. Samples, in a solvent of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid were continuously infused into the ion source via a Micro-ion Spray interface at a flow rate of 12 μl/hour maintained with a Harvard Model 55–1111 syringe pump. Precursor ions were selected at a resolution of 0.6 Da and fragmented by collision with nitrogen at an energy of 60 or 40 eV. Data were accumulated and averaged over a period of ∼15 min. Automated Edman degradation was performed using a Hewlett Packard 241 (N + C) protein sequenator. Disulfide linkages are indicated by slashes as follows: Cysm/Cysn indicates linkage of a peptide containing cysteine residue m in the protein sequence to a peptide containing cysteine residue n; Cysw/(Cysx, Cysy, Cysz/) indicates that a peptide containing cysteine residue w is linked to a peptide containing cysteines x, y, and z, which contains an additional intrachain disulfide; Cysw/(Cysx,Cysy)/Cyszindicates that separate peptides containing cysteines w and z, respectively, are linked to a peptide containing cysteines x and y but the linkage pattern is not defined; Cysw/Cysx, Cysy/Cysz indicates that a peptide containing cysteine residue w is linked via cysteine x to a peptide containing cysteines x and y which, is in turn linked to another peptide by linkage between cysteines y and z. Similarly, Xaaj-Xaak/Xaap-Xaaqdescribes a disulfide linkage between a peptide segment encompassing amino acid residues j to k and a peptide segment encompassing amino acid residues p to q and Xaaa-Xaab/Xaac-Xaad/Xaae-Xaafindicates that peptide segments encompassing residues a to b and e to f, respectively, are linked by disulfide bonds to a peptide segment encompassing residues c to d. The supernatants from high speed centrifugation of detergent-solubilized NDV preparations showed a major Coomassie Blue staining component of 71 kDa upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig.1 A, lane 1). This component appeared to be converted to a band of 63 kDa upon exposure to Dispase (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Analysis of fractions produced by chromatographic separation of the Dispase-treated detergent extract on Superose 12 revealed that the majority of the sialidase activity was evident in a symmetrical peak with maximal absorbance in fraction 51 (Fig. 1 B). A trace of sialidase activity co-eluted with a peak of absorbance in the void volume of the column. The major sialidase activity peak also contained the 63-kDa product of Dispase cleavage (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Selection of fractions 48–54 to pool for further processing was based on homogeneity estimations by SDS-PAGE gels and sialidase activity of individual fractions. N-terminal sequence analysis of the protein present in the pooled peak of sialidase activity from the Superose 12 column indicated that Dispase cleavage produced soluble HN ectodomains with ragged N termini corresponding to Ala117, Ala118, or Ser119 of the untruncated protein sequence (Fig.2 A). This finding indicates that an asparagine usually found at position 119 (28.Sakaguchi T. Toyoda T. Gotoh B. Inocencio N.M. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nagai Y. Virology. 1989; 169: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was a serine in the isolate of NDV used in this study. SDS-PAGE analysis of the nonreduced protein revealed a molecular weight consistent with disulfide linkage of two monomers (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). MALDI-TOF-MS of the product showed a broad base peak ofm/z = 113,000 and a smaller peak at m/z= 56,615 consistent with the doubly charged version of this ion (supplemental Fig. S1). These data are also consistent with disulfide linkage of two truncated NDV HN ectodomains. Assuming that Dispase did not cleave the C terminus of the ectodomains, these data also indicate that glycosylation contributes approximately 12,700 Da to the mass of the dimer. RP-HPLC of nonreduced peptic digests of HN produced a chromatogram consisting of relatively broad and incompletely resolved peaks (Fig.3 A). A chromatogram was also obtained by reduction of the peptic digest before performing RP-HPLC (Fig. 3 B). Careful comparison of the RP-HPLC chromatograms of the nonreduced and reduced samples revealed five major peaks in the nonreduced digest (P1–P5 in Fig. 3 A) that were affected by reduction indicating that they contained disulfide-linked peptides. Several peaks appeared in the chromatogram of the reduced peptic digest that apparently corresponded to cysteine-containing peptides released from disulfide linkage by reduction. Peaks P1–P5 from the nonreduced digest were isolated by RP-HPLC of the nonreduced peptic digest for further analysis to determine the disulfide linkages in HN. The strategy for determination of the disulfide linkages of HN was to use MALDI-TOF-MS as the primary tool to analyze disulfide-linked peptic peptides in peaks P1–P5. In cases where this did not produce conclusive results, peptides were subjected to further treatment(s) involving deglycosylation and/or additional peptide bond cleavages. Peptides subjected to these supplementary treatments were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and, where necessary, ESI-MS/MS. The simplest cases, peptic peptides containing single inter- or intrachain disulfides, generally only required MALDI-TOF-MS to identify the cysteine residues involved in linkage of the chains. This usually involved analysis of the constituents of the relevant peak before and after reduction with TCEP and rationalization of mass changes that accompanied reduction with reference to cysteine-containing segments of the HN ectodomain sequence (Fig. 2 A). In some cases this alignment process was aided by the presence of sequence tags originating from ragged peptic cleavage(s) of the linked chain(s). PSD analysis was also used to identify reduced chains. In the more complex cases, with peptides containing both intra- and interchain disulfides, MALDI-TOF-MS usually enabled identification of the linked chains; however, secondary peptide bond cleavage(s) was required to convert the intrachain bond into an interchain bond.

https://openalex.org/W1502806109,"Upon stimulation of cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor through one or both of its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, is phosphorylated by the receptor kinase, and is thereby activated to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Association of PLC-γ1 with the insoluble subcellular fraction is also enhanced in PDGF-stimulated cells. The individual roles of the two SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 in mediating the interaction between the enzyme and the PDGF receptor have now been investigated by functionally disabling each domain. A critical Arg residue in each SH2 domain was mutated to Ala. Both wild-type and mutant PLC-γ1 proteins were transiently expressed in a PLC-γ1-deficient fibroblast cell line, and these transfected cells were stimulated with PDGF. The mutant protein in which the COOH-terminal SH2 domain was disabled bound to the PDGF receptor. Accordingly, it was phosphorylated by the receptor, catalyzed the production of inositol phosphates, and mobilized intracellular calcium to extents similar to (but slightly less than) those observed with the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the mutant in which the NH2-terminal SH2 domain was impaired did not bind to the PDGF receptor and consequently was neither phosphorylated nor activated. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal SH2 domain, but not the COOH-terminal SH2 domain, of PLC-γ1 is required for PDGF-induced activation of PLC-γ1. Functional impairment of the SH2 domains did not affect the PDGF-induced redistribution of PLC-γ1, suggesting that recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the particulate fraction does not involve the SH2 domains.

These domains share an ability to bind to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, but they also possess independent binding sites for the residues surrounding the target phosphotyrosine (1.Birge R.B.

Each SH2 domain thus recognizes specific sequence patterns with a high selectivity and thereby promotes specific protein-protein interactions (4.Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F.

The specificity of such interactions is further increased through an avidity effect when the participating proteins possess additional complementary binding sites. Proteins such as phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2), the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), Ras GTPase-activating protein, the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SH-PTP), and members of the Syk family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) contain two SH2 domains (5.Ottinger E.A.

The tandem SH2 domains of Syk PTKs interact with the biphosphorylated tyrosine-based activation motif that is present in various immune receptors (5.Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to its receptor results in dimerization of receptor subunits, activation of the intrinsic PTK activity of the receptor, and autophosphorylation of the intracellular region of the receptor. The phosphorylated residues in the receptor initiate intracellular signaling by serving as specific binding sites for various SH2 domain-containing molecules, including PI 3-kinase, PLC-γ1, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and SH-PTP. Eight autophosphorylation sites have been identified in the β-receptor for PDGF (β-PDGFR), of which Tyr740 and Tyr751are recognized by the tandem SH2 domains of the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit (9.McGlade C.J. Ellis C. Reedijk M. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Reith A.D. Panayotou G. End P. Bernstein A. Kazlauskas A. Wakefield M.D. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, single autophosphorylation sites of β-PDGFR are sufficient for binding of and propagation of signals through Ras GTPase-activating protein (Tyr771), SH-PTP2 (Tyr1009), or PLC-γ1 (Tyr1021) (10.Kazlauskas A.

Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), suggesting that only one of the two SH2 domains of each of these molecules might participate in β-PDGFR signaling (unless the two SH2 domains can span identical sites in activated receptor homodimers). The two SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 share only 35% sequence identity and exhibit different binding specificities, as revealed by studies of their interaction with a random library of synthetic peptides containing phosphotyrosine (3.Songyang Z.

The sequence surrounding the Tyr1021 residue of β-PDGFR matches more closely the specificity of the COOH-terminal SH2 (C-SH2) domain of PLC-γ1 than it does that of the NH2-terminal SH2 (N-SH2) domain. Indeed, a dodecapeptide derived from β-PDGFR and containing phosphorylated Tyr1021 showed a higher affinity for a C-SH2 fusion protein than it did for an N-SH2 fusion protein (13.Larose L. Gish G. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3858-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging has revealed the structure of a tightly bound complex of the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 with a phosphopeptide representing the Tyr1021 autophosphorylation site of β-PDGFR (14.Pascal S.M.

In addition, although C-SH2 alone bound inefficiently to activated β-PDGFR, its binding was greatly increased by the presence of N-SH2 in the same fusion protein (13.Larose L. Gish G. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3858-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, in vitro studies have yielded inconsistent results with regard to identifying the SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 that is primarily responsible for binding to the activated PDGFR. Furthermore, these types of studies with phosphorylated peptides and fusion proteins do not shed light on the roles of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 in the tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein by the receptor PTK and in its subsequent activation. We have now investigated the role of each SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 in the PDGF-dependent activation of this protein by transiently expressing site-directed SH2 domain mutants in a PLC-γ1-deficient cell line. Given the abundance and widespread expression of PLC-γ1, the use of such cells was important for this study in order to prevent interference from the endogenous enzyme. myo-[2-3H]Inositol was obtained from NEN Life Science; PDGF-BB and monoclonal antibody 4G10 to phosphotyrosine were from Upstate Biotechnology; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), myo-inositol-free DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc.; protein G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Fura-2/AM was from Calbiochem; the Partisil SAX 10 column was from Alltech; and Superfect transfection reagent was from Qiagen. Null-TV1 cells derived fromPlcg1 –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (15.Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by G. Carpenter (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). Null-TV1 cells were grown at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Full-length rat PLC-γ1 cDNA inserted in the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) was used to generate the SH2 domain mutants by the polymerase chain reaction. Primers corresponding to the mutation of Arg586 to Ala for N-SH2 or of Arg694 to Ala for C-SH2 were designed, and fragments of PLC-γ1 encompassing the mutation were amplified. The mutant fragments were then cloned in PLC-γ1-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Null-TV1 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well in six-well plates or at 6 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish for measurement of inositol phosphates and immunoprecipitation studies, respectively. After 24 h, cells were incubated with 4 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Superfect in a total volume of 700 μl of DMEM-FBS per well, or with 10 μg of DNA and 25 μl of Superfect in 1 ml of DMEM-FBS per dish. The cells were incubated for 2 h, washed and incubated for 24 h with DMEM-FBS, and then incubated for an additional 24 h in DMEM without FBS. PSC11-PLC-γ1, a vaccinia expression vector harboring the entire coding sequence of rat brain PLC-γ1, has been described (16.Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours before experiments, cells were transferred to myo-inositol-free DMEM and incubated in the presence ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml; 25 Ci/mol). After washing with myo-inositol-free DMEM, cells were incubated for 15 min in myo-inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mm LiCl and then exposed to PDGF at the indicated dosages for various times. The medium was subsequently removed and cells were scraped into 1 ml of 5% (w/v) perchloric acid on ice. After centrifugation of the cell lysates, the supernatant was assayed for inositol phosphates by high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (17.Zhang L. Buxton I.L.O. Bird I.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 105. Humama Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 47-63Google Scholar), Briefly, the acidic supernatant was adjusted to a pH of 8 with 2 m KOH and centrifuged again. A portion (500 μl) of the resulting supernatant was then analyzed with a Partisil SAX 10 column and a 20-min nonlinear gradient of 0–1m (NH4)H2PO4 at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Radioactivity in the eluate was monitored with an on-line Flow-One detector (Packard). Retention times of the peaks corresponding to the various inositol phosphates were determined with the use of 3H-labeled standards for IP1, IP2, and IP3. Results are expressed as the sum of IP1 + IP2 + IP3 (IPs), after normalization with an internal standard (GDP). Before stimulation, cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 10 min in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 μmNa3VO4. After stimulation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysate was then transferred to an Eppendorf tube, sonicated, and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was incubated (with rocking) for 90 min at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody to PLC-γ1 and then for an additional 90 min with 30 μl of a 20% slurry of protein G-Sepharose. The protein G-Sepharose beads were then separated by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer and once with water, and suspended in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine or to PLC-γ1. Immune complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G and ECL reagents. Null-TV1 cells cultured in DMEM containing 1% FBS were removed by mild trypsinization and incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μmFura-2/AM in DMEM as described previously (18.Balla T. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16101-16107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Fura-2 loaded cells (∼6 × 106) were spun down and transferred to a cuvette containing 2.5 ml of modified Krebs-Ringer solution (2.42 mm KCl, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 118 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose) containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). Fluorescence measurements were performed in a Deltascan dual wavelength fluorescence photometer (Photon Technology International Inc.). Null-TV1 cells that had been maintained for 24 h in DMEM containing 1% FBS were washed with serum-free DMEM and stimulated with PDGF for 3 min. Stimulation was stopped by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were rapidly frozen. Frozen cells were thawed and lysed in 1 ml of ice cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, leupeptin (3 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. After removal of unbroken cells by a brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the lysates were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants and pellets were used for measurement of PLC-γ1 by immunoblot analysis. The pellets were washed by suspending in the lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and before analysis. Functional impairment of C-SH2 and N-SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 was induced by mutation of an Arg residue located in the β-strand βB5 (Arg586 for N-SH2 and Arg694 for C-SH2) to Ala. These Arg residues are essential for the binding of SH2 domains to the phosphate moiety of the phosphotyrosine of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (1.Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. Science. 1993; 262: 1522-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14.Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamasaki T. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection of Null-TV1 cells with CMV-derived vectors encoding wild-type, N-SH2 mutant (N–), or C-SH2 mutant (C–) PLC-γ1, the expression of each recombinant protein was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1, inset). In three independent experiments, the relative levels of expression of the three proteins varied less than 2-fold. The transfected cells were then stimulated for various times with PDGF (100 ng/ml), and the accumulation of IPs was measured and normalized on the basis of the level of PLC-γ1 expression. (Fig. 1). At all times examined, the amount of IPs produced by cells expressing the C– mutant of PLC-γ1 was similar to (but slightly less than) that produced by cells expressing the wild-type protein. In contrast, cells expressing the N– mutant showed virtually no accumulation of IPs in response to PDGF. Similar results were obtained when cells were incubated for 15 min with various concentrations of PDGF: whereas the PDGF-induced accumulation of IPs in cells expressing the C– mutant was reduced only slightly compared with that in cells expressing the wild-type protein, cells expressing the N– mutant showed virtually no IP response to PDGF (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the integrity of the N-SH2 domain, but not that of the C-SH2 domain, is essential for the activation of PLC-γ1 by the PDGFR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and its association with the PDGFR were evaluated by immunoprecipitation of PLC-γ1 from lysates of transfected cells incubated in the absence or presence of PDGF, followed by immunoblot analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitates with antibodies to PLC-γ1 or to phosphotyrosine (Fig.3). Whereas the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the C– mutant of PLC-γ1 induced by incubation of cells for 10 min with PDGF (100 ng/ml) was similar to that apparent for the wild-type protein, PDGF did not induce phosphorylation of the N– mutant. Furthermore, whereas β-PDGFR was detected by antibodies to phosphotyrosine in the wild-type or C– PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates prepared from PDGF-treated cells, it was not apparent in the corresponding immunoprecipitate derived from cells expressing the N–mutant. Thus, whereas the C– mutant appeared to be capable of associating with β-PDGFR, the N– mutant did not. Similar results were obtained when the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to β-PDGFR (data not shown). Although the intensities of the β-PDGFR immunoreactive bands were too weak to be evaluated quantitatively, the amount of β-PDGFR associated with the C– mutant appeared to be less than that associated with the wild-type protein. The amount of β-PDGFR co-immunoprecipitated from Null-TV1 cells was substantially reduced relative to that observed with NIH 3T3 cells, probably because Null-TV1 cells contain much less β-PDGFR than do NIH 3T3 cells, as indicated by immunoblot analysis of crude extracts (data not shown). These results suggest that functional impairment of the C-SH2 domain has little effect on the ability of PLC-γ1 to associate with and become phosphorylated by β-PDGFR, whereas mutation of the N-SH2 domain prevented both events. In another series of experiments, we used a vaccinia virus vector, which is highly efficient in both transfection and expression, to express PLC-γ1 transiently in Null-TV1 cells. The level of expression of PLC-γ1 achieved with this vector was about 3-fold that obtained with the CMV-derived vector used for the experiments shown in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. Consistent with the data in Figs. 1 and 2, the results obtained with the vaccinia virus vector showed that the extent of PDGF-induced accumulation of IPs in cells expressing the C– mutant of PLC-γ1 was slightly less than that observed in cells expressing the wild-type protein, whereas cells expressing the N– mutant showed almost no IP response (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, consistent with the data in Fig. 3, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with the vaccinia virus vector showed that N-SH2, but not C-SH2, is required for both association of PLC-γ1 with and its phosphorylation by the β-PDGFR (Fig. 4 B). The relatively high background levels observed for both IP accumulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 are likely due to the fact that vaccinia virus encodes a peptide that is homologous to epidermal growth factor and that activates epidermal growth factor receptors (19.Brown J.P. Twardzik D.R. Maquardt H. Todaro G.J. Nature. 1985; 313: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); Null-TV1 cells express these receptors. Growth factor receptor PTKs and nonreceptor PTKs phosphorylate PLC-γ1 on tyrosine residues 771, 783, and 1254 (20.Kim J.W. Sim S.S. Kim U.H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first two of which are located in the SH region comprising the SH3 and two SH2 domains. To demonstrate that the failure of the N− mutant of PLC-γ1 to undergo PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is not due to a structural defect that blocks access of PTKs to its tyrosine phosphorylation sites, we examined the effect of H2O2 on tyrosine phosphorylation of this mutant expressed from the vaccinia virus vector. Hydrogen peroxide reversibly inactivates protein-tyrosine phosphatases (21.Lee S.R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and thereby induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins, including PLC-γ1, by basal PTK activities (22.Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 23.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chok P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The extents of tyrosine phosphorylation of both N– and C– mutants of PLC-γ1 were similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig.5), suggesting that neither of the SH2 domains is required for the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 by basal PTK activities. The cytoplasmic calcium responses of Null-TV1 cells infected with PLC-γ1-expressing vaccinia viruses upon PDGF treatment were also measured in Ca2+-free medium (Fig.6). In good agreement with the IP response, the extent of increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cells expressing the C−mutant of PLC-γ1 was comparable to (but slightly less than) that of cells expressing wild-type PLC-γ1, whereas no change in [Ca2+]i was recorded in response to PDGF in cells expressing the N− mutant of PLC-γ1 or in cells infected with empty vaccinia virus. Treatment with the calcium mobilizing agent LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) resulted in a similar increase in [Ca2+]i in Null-TV1 cells regardless of whether wild-type or SH2 mutant PLC-γ1 was being expressed (not shown). Stimulation of cells with EGF or PDGF causes translocation of PLC-γ1 from the soluble to insoluble subcellular fractions (24.Todderud G. Wahl M.I. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 249: 296-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Molecules that mediate the PLC-γ1 translocation have not been clearly identified. Binding to the autophosphorylated growth factor receptor via the SH2 domains (25.Yang L.J. Rhee S.G. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7156-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to cytoskeletal proteins via the SH3 domain (26.Seedorf K. Kostka G. Lammers R. Bashkin P. Daly R. Burgess W.H. van der Bliek A.M. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16009-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) via the PH and/or SH2 domains (27.Falasca M. Logan S., K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 28.Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kaslauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) has been implicated as the cause of translocation. In Null-TV1 cells about 5% of the total PLC-γ1 was found associated with particulate fraction, regardless of whether wild-type or SH2 mutant PLC-γ1 was delivered by vaccinia, and the amount of the particulate-associated PLC-γ1 increased significantly upon stimulation with PDGF (Fig.7). Interestingly, the association of PLC-γ1 with the particulate fraction in response to PDGF seems to be unaffected by the impairment of either the N-SH2 or the C-SH2 domains of PLC-γ1. These results suggest that the recruitment of PLC-γ1 to the particulate fraction does not involve the binding via its SH2 domains. In this study, we have demonstrated that the two SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 function differentially in activation of the enzyme by the PDGF receptor. Whereas the N-SH2 domain plays an essential role in activation of PLC-γ1, disruption of the C-SH2 domain had only minor effect on this phenomenon. By expressing epitope-tagged SH2 domain mutants of PLC-γ1 in cultured T cells, Stoica et al. (29.Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Graham L. Rellahan B., L. Alava M., A. Laborda J. Bonvini E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar) previously showed that the N-SH2 domain is essential for T cell receptor-induced phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and for the binding of PLC-γ1 to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (linker for activation of T cells) protein. However, the role of the SH2 domains in PLC-γ1 activation could not be assessed in this previous study because of interference from the endogenous enzyme. Furthermore, although PLC-γ1 has been detected in complexes with the CD3 components of the T cell receptor (30.Dasgupta J.D. Granja C. Druker B. Lin L.L. Yunis E., J. Relias V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with the T cell-specific nonreceptor PTKs (Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70) (31.Nakanishi O. Shibasaki F. Hidaka M. Homma Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10754-10759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Weber J.R. Bell G.M. Han M.Y. Pawson T. Imboden J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33.Nel A.E. Gupta S. Lee L. Ledbetter J.A. Kanner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18428-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and with LAT (34.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), the physiological binding targets of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 and the PTK responsible for the phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 during T cell activation remain unknown. In contrast, the binding targets of PLC-γ1 and the PTKs responsible for its phosphorylation during activation of the enzyme induced by growth factors, especially PDGF, are better understood. The binding of PLC-γ1 to phosphorylated receptor PTKs appears to be important not only for its tyrosine phosphorylation but also for targeting the activated enzyme to the cell membrane, where its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), is located. Recent evidence suggests that PDGF-induced generation of PI(3,4,5)P3, catalyzed by PI 3-kinase, also contributes to the translocation of PLC-γ1 to the plasma membrane and thereby promotes the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 (27.Falasca M. Logan S., K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 35.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of PI(3,4,5)P3 generation in PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells by a specific blocker of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin or LY294002) resulted in an ∼40% decrease in the extent of intracellular accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate without affecting the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (27.Falasca M. Logan S., K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 35.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to the NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (27.Falasca M. Logan S., K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) as well as to the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 (28.Rameh L.E. Rhee S.G. Spokes K. Kaslauskas A. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23750-23757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), both of these domains likely contribute to the PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent translocation of PLC-γ1 to the cell membrane. In the present study, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 induced a small (<15%) but reproducible decrease in the extent of PDGF-dependent activation of PLC-γ1 in Null-TV1 cells (data not shown). It is therefore possible that the slightly reduced activity of the C– mutant of PLC-γ1 (compared with that of the wild-type enzyme) observed in the present study is attributable to inefficient interaction of the mutant with PI(3,4,5)P3. Alternatively, the C-SH2 domain might make a small contribution to the activation of PLC-γ1 by interacting weakly with one of the eight autophosphorylation sites of β-PDGFR. The dispensability of the C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 for enzyme activation suggests that this domain plays a distinct, as yet unidentified role. The previous observation that overexpression of a catalytically inactive PLC-γ1 initiated a mitogenic response suggested that PLC-γ1 possesses an activity independent of its lipase activity (36.Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Mattews N.T. Rhee S.G. Sung W.K. Kung H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6554-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that microinjection of a recombinant protein containing the SH region of PLC-γ1 was sufficient to induce a mitogenic response (37.Huang P.S. Davis L. Huber H. Goodhart P.J. Wegrzyn R.E. Oliff A. Heimbrook D.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38.Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Kim C.G. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. Kung H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggests that this additional activity is mediated by the SH region, which likely interacts with other mitogenic signaling intermediates. The C-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 thus might be required for this linker function associated with the mitogenic activity of the enzyme. Identification of a protein that specifically interacts with the N– mutant of PLC-γ1 but not with the C– mutant might shed light on such a role. The tandem SH2 domains of both SH-PTP1 and the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit also perform differential functions. Whereas the N-SH2 domain of SH-PTP1 is both necessary and sufficient for autoinhibition and growth factor-induced activation of the enzyme, the C-SH2 domain contributes little to these processes (7.Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C., T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-SH2 domain of p85 is the principal regulator of the catalytic activity of the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase (39.Yu J. Wjasow C. Baker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). While this report was in preparation, Ji et al. (40.Ji Q.-S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported on the roles of PLC-γ1 SH2 domains in the same Null-TV1 cells. In keeping with our observation, the N-SH2 domain, but not the C-SH2 domain, was sufficient to mediate the association of PLC-γ1 with PDGF receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. However, they found that both N– and C– mutants of PLC-γ1 were unable to mediate PDGF-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and I(1,4,5)P3 production. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear at the present time. The different methods used to express PLC-γ1 and to analyze PLC products and intracellular calcium might be the cause. We used transiently expressing cells, whereas Ji et al. (40.Ji Q.-S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used permanently established cell lines. We followed the fluorescence of the total cell population for the measurement of intracellular Ca2+concentration, whereas Ji et al. (40.Ji Q.-S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) counted the number of cells emitting fluorescence above a certain threshold. For PLC-γ1 activity, Ji et al. (40.Ji Q.-S. Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) presented the result of I(1,4,5)P3 measurement. We found that, as in most cells, more than 95% of I(1,4,5)P3 produced in response to PDGF was rapidly metabolized to IP1 and IP2 in Null-TV1 cells. Thus, the measurement of total inositol phosphates reflects PLC activity more accurately than does measurement of I(1,4,5)P3. We are grateful to Dr. T. Balla and P. Varnai for their help in the calcium measurement experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2072791216,"Type I signal peptidases are integral membrane proteins that function to remove signal peptides from secreted and membrane proteins. These enzymes carry out catalysis using a serine/lysine dyad instead of the prototypical serine/histidine/aspartic acid triad found in most serine proteases. Site-directed scanning mutagenesis was used to obtain a qualitative assessment of which residues in the fifth conserved region, Box E, of the Escherichia coli signal peptidase I are critical for maintaining a functional enzyme. First, we find that there is no requirement for activity for a salt bridge between the invariant Asp-273 and the Arg-146 residues. In addition, we show that the conserved Ser-278 is required for optimal activity as well as conserved salt bridge partners Asp-280 and Arg-282. Finally, Gly-272 is essential for signal peptidase I activity, consistent with it being located within van der Waals proximity to Ser-278 and general base Lys-145 side-chain atoms. We propose that replacement of the hydrogen side chain of Gly-272 with a methyl group results in steric crowding, perturbation of the active site conformation, and specifically, disruption of the Ser-90/Lys-145 hydrogen bond. A refined model is proposed for the catalytic dyad mechanism of signal peptidase I in which the general base Lys-145 is positioned by Ser-278, which in turn is held in place by Asp-280. Type I signal peptidases are integral membrane proteins that function to remove signal peptides from secreted and membrane proteins. These enzymes carry out catalysis using a serine/lysine dyad instead of the prototypical serine/histidine/aspartic acid triad found in most serine proteases. Site-directed scanning mutagenesis was used to obtain a qualitative assessment of which residues in the fifth conserved region, Box E, of the Escherichia coli signal peptidase I are critical for maintaining a functional enzyme. First, we find that there is no requirement for activity for a salt bridge between the invariant Asp-273 and the Arg-146 residues. In addition, we show that the conserved Ser-278 is required for optimal activity as well as conserved salt bridge partners Asp-280 and Arg-282. Finally, Gly-272 is essential for signal peptidase I activity, consistent with it being located within van der Waals proximity to Ser-278 and general base Lys-145 side-chain atoms. We propose that replacement of the hydrogen side chain of Gly-272 with a methyl group results in steric crowding, perturbation of the active site conformation, and specifically, disruption of the Ser-90/Lys-145 hydrogen bond. A refined model is proposed for the catalytic dyad mechanism of signal peptidase I in which the general base Lys-145 is positioned by Ser-278, which in turn is held in place by Asp-280. signal peptidase I isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The majority of proteins exported from a cell are made with a signal or leader peptide. These peptides are responsible for targeting proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes (1.Wickner W. Dreissen A.J. Hartl F.-U. Annu.

These endopeptidases are membrane-bound and specific for the region within the signal peptide immediately preceding the cleavage site. The substrate protein is cleaved during or after the protein is transported across the membrane bilayer. Cleavage occurs by way of nucleophilic attack by a catalytic serine Oγ on the peptide bond between the presequence and the mature region of the pre-protein.The best-studied enzyme of this family is SPase I, or leader peptidase, of Escherichia coli. It has been cloned (13.Date T. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6106-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), sequenced (14.Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol.

Additional analysis is required to provide insight into other residues near this dyad in the SPase family and the roles they play, if any, in the structure and function of these enzymes.The recent crystal structure (27.Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) of the catalytic domain of SPase I (28.Kuo D.W. Chan H.K. Wilson C.J. Griffin P.R. Williams H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 3935-3941Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has revealed that most of the amino acids that are strictly conserved in Boxes B, C, D, and E of the signal peptidase family (30.Dalbey R.E. Lively M.O. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) are found to be located near the active site (see Fig. 1 A). In E. coli, the Box B conserved region contains the catalytic serine (Ser-90), and Box D contains the catalytic lysine (Lys-145). Box E contains the conserved GDN (Gly-272, Asp-273, and Asn-274 in E. coli), Ser-278, Asp-280, and Arg-282 (Fig.1 B). In this work, we have employed a scanning mutagenesis approach to obtain a qualitative assessment of which residues in the conserved Box E are critical for maintaining a functional SPase I. We find that Ser-278, which contributes a hydrogen bond to Lys-145 and therefore helps position this residue, is critical for activity. In addition, substitution of Gly-272 with an alanine leads to a marked effect on activity. Gly-272 most likely plays a structural role, because it is located adjacent to the catalytic Ser-90 and Lys-145 dyad. Any side chain other than hydrogen at 272 results in steric crowding and perturbation of the active site. Asp-280 and Arg-282 are also important for SPase I activity. Asp-280, which forms a hydrogen bond to Ser-278, may help to position the general base Lys-145. Finally, the salt bridge between Asp-273 and Arg-146 is not required for activity.RESULTSThe x-ray crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of SPase I (27.Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) has revealed potentially important amino acid residues located near the active site (Fig.1 A). This information coupled with knowledge of residues conserved in both prokaryotic SPase I and eukaryotic SPase I homologs enabled the rational design of mutants. In this work, we have focused on the conserved Box E region of the signal peptidase family (Fig. 1 B). Box E contains the conserved tripeptide, GDN (Gly-272, Asp-273, and Asn-274 in E. coli), as well as the conserved Ser-278, Asp-280, and Arg-282 residues (inE. coli). Glycine and aspartate in the GDN consensus are strictly conserved, and the asparagine is highly conserved in all type I SPases. Ser-278 is only conserved in prokaryotic, mitochondrial SPase I (Imp1/Imp2) and the chloroplast thylakoid processing peptidase (chloroplast SPase I). We have constructed a number of mutants to test the importance of these residues and measured activity in vitro using the substrate pro-OmpA nuclease A. Mutants with a significant reduction in substrate processing were further analyzedin vivo, and their contribution to the structure and protein stability of the enzyme were also examined.To increase protein expression over the original pING construct (33.Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15925-15931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the SPase I gene was cloned into the pET23b vector. The increased expression was needed for the two-part purification procedure employing ion exchange and nickel affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) (35.Smith M.C. Furman T.C. Ingolia T.D. Pidgeon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7211-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in order to obtain higher yields of pure mutant SPase I. With this new protocol the purity of each mutant (Fig.2, lanes 1–11 and13–14) is comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme (lane 12). For purposes of CD spectroscopic analysis, the nickel affinity column was also used to exchange the detergent Triton X-100 for the non-UV-absorbing β-octylglucopyranoside. Lanes 10, 11, and 12 in Fig. 2 are preparations in which this detergent exchange method was applied.Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of purified 6-His SPase I proteins.

SPase I enzymes with the single mutations T94V, R146A, R146M, G285A, N277A, and N277D all maintained activity out to 104-fold dilution, indicating these residues were not critical for catalysis. Since amino acid substitutions at these positions had little, if any, catalytic effect, further studies were not performed. Although the S281A enzyme showed a 100-fold decrease in activity, we also did not investigate this residue further because it is not conserved in all type I SPases and because mutation of the homologous serine residue in theBacillus subtilis SipS enzyme had very little affect on activity (40.van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Figure 3Mutations of some conserved residues near the active site do not affect in vitro processing.Processing of pro-OmpA nuclease A (described under “Experimental Procedures”) is initiated by the addition of 1 μl of serially diluted SPase I enzyme and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C.

The mutation of Ser-278 to an Ala would remove the hydrogen bond from Ser-278 to the catalytic Lys-145 (Fig. 1 A; See TableI for H-bond distances). This alteration leads to a significant loss of catalytic activity in vitro. Processing of the pro-OmpA nuclease A substrate by this mutant exhibited a 300-fold decrease as compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4 A). The activity of the Ser-278 mutant was also assayed using the more sensitive in vivo assay, where SPase I activity was measured in its native membrane environment. This assay examines whether the plasmid-encoded S278A SPase I can restore processing of pro-OmpA at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C in the temperature-sensitive SPase I strain, IT41 (31.Inada T. Court D.L. Ito K. Nakamura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 585-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that the processing of pro-OmpA by E. coliSPase I is slowed at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 °C in IT41 bearing no plasmid, with an approximate t 12 of 60 s. In contrast, processing of pro-OmpA is rapid (t 12 < 10 s) at 42 °C when it contains the pET23lep vector encoding wild-type 6-His SPase I. IT41 containing a plasmid-encoding signal peptidase S278A exhibited slow processing of pro-OmpA when compared with wild-type. The t 12 for the S278A enzyme is between 20 and 30 s. Immunoblot analysis indicates that the signal peptidase S278A mutant is expressed within the cell in comparable amounts as wild-type (data not shown). Thesein vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the Ser-278 residue is required for rapid SPase I processing.Figure 4Ser-278 is required for SPase I activity bothin vitro and in vivo.

Both S278A SPase I and the wild-type enzyme retain identical spectra between 200 and 250 nm (Fig.5), providing evidence that the S278A protein is not grossly misfolded. Thus, the decrease in activity is consistent with and attributable to the loss of the hydrogen bonding capability of Ser-278 to Lys-145.Figure 5CD spectra of the wild-type (WT), S278A, and G272A SPase I mutants.

Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we investigated their impact on catalysis. In vitrostudies of G272A and N274A signal peptidases are shown in Fig.6. The exchange of an alanine for an asparagine at position 274 had little effect on substrate processing (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). In contrast, substitution of the glycine at position 272 to alanine led to a marked effect on in vitro processing (Fig. 6 A, top panel). Quantitation of the pro-OmpA nuclease A processing by gel band densitometry for the G272A mutant indicated that processing was impaired roughly 750-fold relative to wild-type enzyme (data not shown).Figure 6The role of Gly-272 and Asp-273 for the activity of the E. coli SPase I.

As can be seen in Fig. 6 B, SPase I G272A has impaired in vivo processing of pro-OmpA in IT41 at 42 °C (t 12 ∼ 50 s), consistent with the in vitro results. Again, the global structural integrity of this SPase I protein appeared unperturbed as demonstrated by the CD spectrum (Fig. 5).The Salt Bridge between Aspartic Acid 273 and Arginine 146 Is Not Required for Activity of the E. coli SPase IThe x-ray structure has revealed that aspartic acid 273 forms a salt bridge with arginine 146 and a hydrogen bond with threonine 94 (Fig. 1 A). To assess the significance of these interactions, we first mutated Asp-273 to alanine or asparagine. Since sufficient amounts of the Asp-273 mutants could not be purified because of the lowered expression levels and the failure to solubilize the SPase I mutant from the membrane with detergent, 2P.

Dalbey, unpublished data. we measured the activity of the Asp-273 mutants in vivo. In Fig.6 B it is evident that the D273A (middle panel) and D273N (bottom panel) SPase I mutants have impaired processing in vivo. The processing activity at 42 °C is only slightly better with these mutants than when no plasmid is present (Fig. 4 B). The processing t 12 of the D273A and D273N enzymes are close to 30 s. This demonstrates that the aspartic acid residue at position 273 is required for efficient SPase I activity when its interacting salt bridge partner, Arg-146, is also present.As a control, we tested whether the decreased in vivoactivity results from lower expression levels within the cell. The amount of signal peptidase expressed was determined by Western blotting using SPase I antiserum. As can be seen in Fig.7, both SPase I D273A and D273N are expressed at approximately one-fifth the level as pET23lep-encoded wild-type SPase I. Decreased expression levels of Asp-273 mutants may contribute slightly to the lower processing of pro-OmpA to mature OmpA in IT41 at the nonpermissive temperature.Figure 7Expression levels of Asp-273 SPase I mutantsin vivo.

To our surprise, the double mutant T94V/R146A maintained almost full activity (Fig.8 A), demonstrating that neither the salt bridge between Asp-273 and Arg-146 nor the Thr-94/Asp-273 hydrogen bond is required (Fig. 1 A, Table I). Moreover, SPase I is still functional when the Asp-273 residue is conservatively replaced with a glutamic acid side chain (Fig.8 A).Figure 8The Salt bridge between Asp-273 and Arg-146 is not required for activity of the E. coli SPase I.

In Fig. 8 B, in vivo processing is more rapid in the mutants that contain substitutions both at Arg-146 and Asp-273 (D273A/R146A and D273A/R146A/T94V) versus only the single (D273A) mutant (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, the results indicate that the Asp-273 and Arg-146 salt bridge is not required for activity, and the acidic Asp-273 is only required when the basic Arg-146 is present as well.Aspartic Acid 280 and Arginine 282 Mutations Affect Optimal ActivityThe E. coli SPase I crystal structure (27.Paetzel M.

The homologous residue to Asp-280 was found to be critical for activity inB. subtilis (40.van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol.

D280A and D280E mutants of E. coli SPase I were constructed and expressed, but purification of these proteins proved rather difficult. Purification trials of the Asp-280 variants resulted in proteins exhibiting lower concentration with evidence of proteolytic degradation (Fig.9 A). Compared with wild-type enzyme at similar concentrations, the D280A and D280E mutants maintained more than a 1000-fold reduction in activity in vitro (Fig. 9 B). With the in vivo assay, however, the D280A and D280E mutants of E. coli SPase I demonstrated much higher activity levels (Fig. 9 C). The D280A and D280E mutants displayed slightly less in vivoactivity than wild-type (Fig. 4 B) but greater activity than the S278A and G272A mutants (Figs. 4 B and 6 B). Pulse-chase analysis indicates that the Asp-280 mutants are stablein vivo (Fig. 9 D), and immunoblot analysis (data not shown) was used to verify that the lower molecular bands of purified D280A and D280E (Fig. 9 A) were fragments of the Asp-280 mutants.Figure 9Asp-280/Arg-282 mutations affect E. coli SPase I activity.

Purification of this Arg-282 variant resulted in a protein of lower concentration than wild-type enzyme but with less degradation than the Asp-280 mutants (Fig. 9 A). Like the Asp-280 mutants, the R282M mutant displayed significantly less activityin vitro compared with wild-type (Fig. 9, B andC). Also, the R282M mutant displayed greater in vivo than in vitro activity but not as dramatic as the Asp-280 mutants.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have established that the catalytic mechanism ofE. coli SPase I requires an essential Ser-90 (37.Sung M.

Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) crystal structure of the inhibitor-bound soluble fragment of E. coli SPase I has provided the first direct evidence of the nucleophilic nature of Ser-90 and a glimpse of the neighboring residues in the active site. In the consensus sequence of the SPase I family, Ser-90 of the E. coli enzyme is found in the second conserved domain (Box B), whereas the catalytic Lys-145 is in the fourth conserved domain (Box D). One of the most prominent aspects of the crystal structure was the fact that the entire fifth conserved domain (Box E) of E. coli SPase I was found in the active site area. This Box E consensus sequence contains a cluster of three residues, GDN (beginning with Gly-272), the conserved Ser-278, the strictly conserved Asp-280, and the conserved Arg-282.In the present study, we show that Asn-277, Gly-285, and Thr-94, are not important for in vitro substrate processing. This suggests that these residues are not important for enzymatic function. Although mostly conserved in the bacterial SPases, the homologous subunits (i.e. Sec11, Spc18, and Spc21) in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase do not share the same conservation at these positions. The toleration of these changes with respect to activity is therefore not unexpected.In contrast, Ser-278 is necessary for efficient enzymatic action, as demonstrated by the in vitro and in v"

Similarly, both the 35- (D1) and 29-kDa (D2) subunits were D subunit isoforms, although the similarity of the amino acid sequences is still unknown. In immunoblot analyses, two or three E subunit isoforms with molecular masses ranging from 29 to 40 kDa were detected in other plants. Two isotypes of V-ATPase from the pea epicotyl were separated by ion exchange chromatography and had subunit compositions differing only in the ratio of E1 and E2. There was a difference in theV max and K m of ATP hydrolysis between the two isotypes. E1 was scarcely detected in crude membrane fractions from the leaf and cotyledon, while E2 was detected in fractions from all of the tissues examined. The compositions of D subunit isoforms in the leaf and epicotyl were different, and the vacuolar membrane in the leaf did not contain D2. The efficiency of H+ pumping activity in the vacuolar membrane of the leaf was higher than that of the epicotyl. The results suggest that the presence of the isoforms of D and E subunits is characteristic to plants and that the isoforms are closely related to the enzymatic properties.

Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase),1 together with H+-pyrophosphatase, generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane and provides a driving force for secondary active transporters. V-ATPase is composed of two general domains, a peripheral catalytic domain (V1) and a transmembranous proton channel (V0) (2.Sze H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 175-208Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Sze H. Ward J.M. Lai S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The V1 domain of animal and yeast enzymes consists of eight subunits: three copies of A and B subunits and one copy of several other accessory subunits of C to H (4.Xie X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The V0 domain consists of five subunits: six copies of the c subunit and one copy of other accessory subunits of a, c′, c“, and d (5.Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In the coated vesicle V-ATPase, the stoichiometry was determined to be A3B3C1D1E1a1c6(6.Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of V-ATPase is similar to that of F-ATPase (7.Boekema E.J. Ubbinkkok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). High resolution analysis of the structure of the mitochondrial F1 domain (peripheral domain) revealed that the central cavity of the F1 domain is formed by alternating the α and β subunits (α3β3), which correspond to the B and A subunits in V-ATPase, respectively, and is occupied with γ subunit (8.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). The γ subunit has recently been demonstrated to rotate against the α3β3 complex during ATP hydrolysis (9.Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 10.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). The rotation of the γ subunit is thought to be physicochemically coupled with H+ translocation in the F0 domain (membrane domain). In V-ATPase, the homologue of the γ subunit has not yet been identified, although some candidates have been recommended, such as the D subunit (11.Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or a pair of D and E subunits (12.Tomashek J.J. Garrison B.S. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Xie reported that at least the A, B, C, E, and G subunits, but not the D or F subunits, were essential for ATP hydrolysis (4.Xie X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have been studying V-ATPase properties in the mung bean (chilling-sensitive) and pea (chilling-tolerant) from the viewpoint of cold inactivation of the enzyme (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M.

There are a few reports on the isoforms of the accessory subunits in the V1 domain. V-ATPases in the plasma and microsomal membranes of the kidney brush border have the heterogeneity of the 31-kDa subunit (E subunit), although the E subunit was encoded by a single gene (26.Hemken P. Guo X.L. Wang Z.Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crider et al. (27.Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z. Li X. Mattsson J.P.

In addition to these works, there have been some studies on the V-ATPase isotypes purified from different tissues. V-ATPases in the kidney cortex brush border and cortex microsome were different in pH optimum,K m for ATP, phospholipid dependence, and the structural microheterogeneity of the B and E subunits (28.Gluck S.

V- ATPases purified from the fruit and epicotyl of the lemon have different features such as subunit composition, shape in electron micrography, efficiency of H+ pumping activity, and sensitivity to vanadate (30.Müller M.L. Irkens Kiesecker U. Kramer D. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12762-12770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An investigation of the isotypes of V-ATPase with a different subunit isoform and the tissue specificity of isoforms may help us to understand both the structure-function relationship and the physiological significance of tissue-specific expression of the subunit isoforms. In this work, we mainly investigated the isoforms of V-ATPase subunits, the isotypes of V-ATPase, and the tissue-specific distribution of the subunit isoforms. We also investigated the relationship between the E subunit of the pea and the corresponding subunits of other organisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the E subunit isoforms of V-ATPase at the protein level. Seeds of the pea (Pisum sativumL. cv. Kinusaya) were sown in moist vermiculite in the dark at 20 °C and left to grow for 7 days. The epicotyls, leaves, cotyledons, and roots were then removed from the etiolated seedlings and used for membrane preparation. Mature leaves and flower petals were excised from pea plants that had been growing for 2 months in the field. Seeds of the mung bean (Vigna radiata L. cv. Wilczek) were imbibed in 1 mm CaSO4 and sown in the dark at 26 °C. Hypocotyls from the etiolated 3.5-day-old seedlings were used to prepare vacuolar membranes. Seeds of Arabidopsis thalianawere germinated and grown on moist rock wool in the light at 22 °C for 1 month, and green leaves were used for membrane preparation. Leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) were purchased at a local market and used for membrane preparation. The total crude membrane and vacuolar membrane fractions were prepared from epicotyls and other tissues of the pea and mung bean by differential and floating centrifugation methods as described previously (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31.Yoshida S. Mastuura C. Etani S. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 634-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes (3 mg of protein/ml) were treated with 5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 0.1 m KCl, and then V-ATPase was solubilized from the membrane with 2 mg/ml lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma, egg yolk, type I) (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified by ion exchange chromatography using a column of QAE-Toyopearl 550C (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) pre-equilibrated with a running buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (buffer A). The column (bed volume: 4 ml) was washed with 20 ml of buffer A containing 0.2m NaCl, and then the ATPase was eluted from the column with 20 ml of buffer A containing 0.4 m NaCl (pea enzyme) or 0.3m NaCl (mung bean enzyme). The enzyme solution from QAE-Toyopearl chromatography was desalted and concentrated using an Ultrafree UFC3 LTK 00 (Millipore) at 0 °C. The concentrated fraction (0.4 ml) was layered onto 4 ml of linear glycerol density gradient of 20–40% (w/v) glycerol in 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and centrifuged at 200,000 × g (45,000 rpm) in a swinging rotor (Hitachi, RPS-56 rotor) for 10 h at 4 °C. The gradient after centrifugation was fractionated into 0.25-ml aliquots, and the fractions were subjected to ATPase assay. The major peak fractions of ATPase activity were further purified by ion exchange chromatography of Mono Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column (bed volume: 1 ml) was pre-equilibrated with buffer A, and then the V-ATPase was eluted with 60 ml of a shallow linear gradient of 0.2–0.4 m NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min and fractionated into 0.5-ml aliquots at room temperature. ATPase activity was assayed at 30 °C in 0.25 ml of medium containing 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgSO4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 20 μg of phosphatidylcholine (Sigma, soybean, type IV-S), and 25 mm Hepes-BTP (pH 7.2) (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Released Pi was colorimetrically measured by the modified method of Hoges and Leonard (32.Hodges T. Leonard R. Bucker C. Keenan T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using γ-globulin as the standard (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). H+ pumping activity and ATPase activity were simultaneously measured by the modified method of Palmgren (34.Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or Mülleret al. (35.Müller M.L. Jensen M. Taiz L. J Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 10706-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The assay medium consisted of 25 mmHepes-BTP, pH 7.2, 250 mm sorbitol, 3 mm ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 μm valinomycin (Sigma), 0.25 mm very freshly prepared NADH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), 20 μm acridine orange, and 25 μl/ml of a mixture of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma) and was equilibrated at 25 °C. An aliquot (2.955 ml) of the assay medium was transferred to a quartz cuvette, and 30 μl of the vacuolar membrane was added. After incubation for 3 min, the reaction was started by the addition of 15 μl of MgSO4 to a final concentration of 3 mm, and the absorbance at 340 and 495 nm was recorded in 10-s intervals with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV-160) that can measure the absorbance at two different wavelengths by automatic switching between them. In this assay, H+ pumping activity was measured by the absorbance decrease of acridine orange at 495 nm, and ATPase activity was simultaneously measured by coupling the appearance of ADP to the oxidation of NADH, which was followed by the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. SDS-PAGE on 13% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS was carried out according to Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar), and then proteins in the gels were visualized with silver staining (37.Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was performed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) as the first dimension and SDS-PAGE as the second dimension. IEF was carried out according to the method of O'Farrel et al. (37.Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). The electrotransfer of proteins in a gel onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and immunostaining with the antibodies were performed according to the standard procedure (39.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44911) Google Scholar). The antigens on PVDF membranes were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit goat IgG (40.Harlow E. Lane E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as color development reagents. To prepare the antibodies, we thoroughly purified the 40- and 37-kDa subunits of V-ATPase by SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme and electroelution with an Electroeluter (Bio-Rad, model 422). Before immunization, we confirmed that each purified fraction contained a single polypeptide band in SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Antibodies against the subunits were raised in rabbits by injection of each subunit (total amount, 80 μg) in 50% adjuvant (Titer Max, CytRx Co.) solution. The immunoglobulin G fraction was prepared from each antiserum by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and affinity chromatography on an Ampure PA column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibodies against the 40- and 37-kDa subunits were designated anti-40 and anti-37. The antibodies against the A, B, and 32-kDa subunits of mung bean enzyme were prepared as described previously (14.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and were designated anti-A, anti-B, and anti-32, respectively. The 40-, 37-, and 35-kDa subunits of V-ATPase from the pea epicotyl were isolated by SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Proteins after elution were precipitated by cold acetone and then dried. A 100-μl aliquot of digestion buffer containing 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8), 2m urea, and 40 pmol of V8 protease (Wako) was added to the precipitates of the 40- and 37-kDa subunits, and a 100-μl aliquot of digestion buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% SDS, 4 m urea, and 40 pmol of lysylendopeptidase (Wako) was added to the precipitate of the 35-kDa subunit. The resulting peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. The peptides on PVDF membrane were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining, and the bands were excised from the membrane for amino acid sequencing. Amino acid sequences of the NH2 termini of the proteolytic fragments were determined by Edman degradation in a gas phase sequencer (Shimadzu, model PPSQ-10). After V-ATPase was solubilized by lysophosphatidylcholine from vacuolar membranes, the enzyme in a detergent-soluble fraction was purified by ion exchange chromatography of a QAE-Toyopearl column. At this step, the proteins in the eluted fraction were mostly V-ATPase complexes (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mung bean V-ATPase is composed of nine subunits: 68- (A subunit), 57- (B subunit), 44-, 38-, 37-, 32-, 16- (proteolipid subunit), 13-, and 12-kDa subunits, as reported previously (13.Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of pea V-ATPase was compared with that of the mung bean enzyme using QAE-Toyopearl fractions (Fig. 1). In the pea V-ATPase, the 68- and 57-kDa polypeptides correspond to the A and B subunits of V-ATPase, judging from the immunoreactivity with antibodies to the A and B subunits of mung bean enzyme (for example, Fig. 7). The two species had different subunits with molecular masses ranging from 40 to 30 kDa, although the molecular masses of the other subunits, including the 100- and 51-kDa subunits, were almost identical. We therefore determined the internal, partial amino acid sequences of the 35-kDa subunit of pea enzyme after treatment with lysylendopeptidase and the 40- and 37-kDa subunits of pea enzyme after treatment with V8 protease (Fig. 2). A homology search showed that one peptide sequence (Pea-40k-1) from the 40-kDa subunit and three (Pea-37k-1, -2, and -3) from the 37-kDa subunit were homologous to the E subunits of V-ATPase in several organisms (Fig. 2 A). The partial sequence of 40k-1 was identical to the portion of 37k-2. The partial sequences of 37k-3, 37k-4, 40k-2, and 40k-3 were very similar, but some amino acid residues were different from those of other species. We concluded that the 40- and 37-kDa subunits were isoforms of the E subunit and designated them E1 and E2 subunits, respectively. The partial sequence of pea 35-kDa subunit corresponded to the D subunit sequences of other organisms, such as A. thaliana (41.Kluge C. Golldack D. Dietz K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1419: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar),Saccharomyces cerevisiae (42.Graham L.A. Hill K.H. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), andCaenorhabditis elegans (National Center for Biotechnology (NCB) accession no. P34462) (Fig. 2 B). Because the antibody specific to the 32-kDa subunit of mung bean enzyme (anti-32) reacted with the pea 35-kDa subunit, the 32-kDa subunit of the mung bean was also concluded to be a D subunit (see, for example, Fig. 7). Immunoblot analysis with anti-32 showed that the 29-kDa subunits of the pea and mung bean were immunochemically similar to the D subunit.Figure 7Comparison of the composition of subunits in V-ATPase isotypes. The same amount of protein (4 μg) of two peak fractions of pea (A–D) or four peak fractions of mung bean (E–H) was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (A and E) or immunoblot analyses with a mixture of anti-A and anti-B (B and F), a mixture of anti-40 and anti-37 (C and G), and anti-32 (D and H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Internal amino acid sequences of the 40-, 37- and 35-kDa subunits of pea V-ATPase. A, the 40- and 37-kDa subunits isolated from the pea enzyme were treated with V8 protease and were then subjected to internal amino acid sequence analyses. The sequences of three and four fragments from 40- and 37-kDa subunits, respectively, were determined (40k-1 to-3, 37k-1 to -4). The internal sequences of the 40- and 37-kDa subunits were compared with the homologous sequences deduced from the cDNA for spinach (S. oleracea) (43.Dietz K.J. Hollenbach B. Arnold J.

B, the 35-kDa subunit isolated from the pea enzyme was treated with lysylendopeptidase and then the internal sequences were determined. The internal sequence of the 35-kDa subunit was compared with the homologous sequences deduced from the cDNA for A. thaliana (41.Kluge C. Golldack D. Dietz K.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Anti-40 reacted preferentially with the E1 subunit and also with the E2 subunit of pea V-ATPase (Fig. 3, lane 1). Anti-37 strongly reacted with the E2 subunit and slightly with the E1 subunit of pea enzyme (Fig. 3, lane 2). Both 40- and 37-kDa polypeptides in the microsome fraction as well as in the purified V-ATPase were detected by using either anti-40 or anti-37 (see, for example, Fig. 9), indicating that the E1 and E2 subunits of pea V-ATPase are immunologically similar. Immunoblot analysis of mung bean enzyme revealed that both anti-40 and anti-37 cross-reacted equally with 38- and 37-kDa subunits of mung bean enzyme (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that these two polypeptides are also closely related to the 40- and 37-kDa subunits of the pea. The 38- and 37-kDa subunits of mung bean enzymes were also thought to be isoforms of the E subunit.Figure 9Tissue specificity of the E subunit isoforms in plants. Immunoblot analysis with a mixture of anti-40 and anti-37 was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, crude membranes of the pea prepared from etiolated leaves (lane 1, 48 μg), cotyledons (lane 2, 112 μg), mature leaves (lane 3, 42 μg), petals (lane 4, 74 μg), upper parts of epicotyls (3 cm in length from the tip) (lane 5, 44 μg), lower parts of epicotyls (5 cm in length from the base) (lane 6, 42 μg), and roots (lane 7, 76 μg).B, crude membranes prepared from mung bean mature leaves (lane 1, 24 μg), hypocotyls (lane 2, 22 μg), and roots (lane 3, 24 μg).

Fig. 3 shows the results of immunoblot analysis of the crude membrane fraction from A. thaliana and vacuolar membrane fractions from spinach and pea with anti-40 and anti-37. A. thaliana gave two immunostained bands of 32 and 29 kDa with anti-40 and one band of 32 kDa with anti-37 (lanes 5 and 6). Vacuolar membranes from spinach gave a single band of 34 kDa with both antibodies (lanes 7 and 8). Thus, there is variation in the molecular mass of the E subunits among plant species. To obtain more information about E subunit isoforms, we performed two-dimensional PAGE and immunoblot analysis of pea and mung bean enzymes. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the E1 and E2 subunits of pea enzyme gave a single spot with pI values of 6.4 and 5.5, respectively. The 38-kDa subunit of mung bean enzyme also gave a single spot with a pI value of 5.9, while the 37-kDa subunit gave two spots with pI values of 6.5 and 6.3, respectively (Fig. 4 B). The existence of isoforms suggests the presence of isotypes of V-ATPase. For detailed studies of the V-ATPase isotypes, the enzyme fraction of the pea epicotyls that was purified by"

Elongin is composed of a transcriptionally active A subunit and two small regulatory B and C subunits, the latter of which bind stably to each other to form a binary complex that interacts with Elongin A and strongly induces its transcriptional activity. To further understand the roles of Elongin in transcriptional regulation, we attempted to identify Elongin-related proteins. Here, we report on the cloning, expression, and characterization of human Elongin A2, a novel transcription elongation factor that exhibited 47% identity and 61% similarity to Elongin A. Biochemical studies have shown that Elongin A2 stimulates the rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II and is capable of forming a stable complex with Elongin BC. However, in contrast to Elongin A, its transcriptional activity is not activated by Elongin BC.

At least six general transcription initiation factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH)1have been identified in eukaryotic cells and found to promote selective binding of RNA polymerase II to promoters and to support a basal level of transcription (1.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In addition to the general initiation factors, six general elongation factors (SII, P-TEF-b, TFIIF, Elongin, eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein, and the Cockayne syndrome complementation group B protein) have been defined biochemically and found to increase the efficiency of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (2.Aso T.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Of the general elongation factors, SII and P-TEFb prevent RNA polymerase II from prematurely arresting transcription. All of the rest of the elongation factors, TFIIF, Elongin, eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein, and Cockayne syndrome complementation group B protein, act to increase the overall rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing the transient pausing of polymerase at many sites along the DNA template. Elongin was initially identified as a heterotrimer composed of A, B, and C subunits of ∼770, 118, and 112 amino acids, respectively (5.Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elongin A is the transcriptionally active component of the Elongin complex, whereas Elongins B and C are positive regulatory subunits. Biochemical studies have shown that Elongins B and C form a stable Elongin BC complex that binds to Elongin A and strongly induces its transcriptional activity (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Elongin C functions as the inducing ligand and activates transcription through interaction with a short conserved motif (consensus sequence LXXXCXXX(V/L/I) in the elongation activation domain of Elongin A (9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Elongin B, a member of the ubiquitin homology gene family, appears to play a chaperone-like role in the assembly of the Elongin complex by binding to Elongin C and facilitating its interaction with Elongin A (7.Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Notably, Elongins B and C are also found as integral components of a multisubunit complex containing the product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene (10.Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 11.Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin W.G. Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Elongin A and the VHL protein share the Elongin BC binding site motif, and consistent with the assumption of a role for the Elongin BC in tumor suppression, more than 70% of VHL mutations found in VHL families and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas are associated with mutation or deletion of this site; in all the cases tested, these mutant VHL proteins exhibited substantially reduced binding to Elongin BC (10.Duan D.R.

As part of our effort to understand the function, mechanism of action, and regulation of the Elongin complex, we attempted to identify homologs of the Elongin subunits. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of Elongin A2, a novel Elongin A-related transcription elongation factor from human cells. Unlabeled ultrapure ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate and [α-32P]CTP (>400 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bovine serum albumin, polyvinyl alcohol type II, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine were obtained from Sigma, placental ribonuclease inhibitor was from Promega, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni2+-agarose) was from Qiagen. The data base of human expressed sequence tags was searched with the human Elongin A cDNA sequence (13.Aso T. Haque D. Fukudome K. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and a 420-base pair sequence (accession numberAA861139), part of which had exhibited homology to the 3′-end of the coding region of the Elongin A cDNA, was found in a human testis expressed sequence tag data base. This 420-base pair cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a plasmid pAP3neo human testis cDNA library (TAKARA), and one positive cDNA clone encoding amino acids 263–753 of human Elongin A2 was obtained. The human Elongin A2 partial cDNA sequences enabled us to design a gene-specific primer, 5′-CTTGTTCGAGTGACTGTGCTGAGGC-3′, which was used to obtain the 5′-end of human Elongin A2 by rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) with Marathon-Ready testis cDNA as the template (CLONTECH). The resulting 960-base pair 5′-RACE product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Full-length human Elongin A2 cDNA was obtained by overlap extension (14.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO). DNA sequencing was performed by using an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 310, Applied Biosystems). Human multiple tissue Northern blots I and II (CLONTECH), containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/sample, were hybridized using ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) under stringent conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. The Elongin A2 probe contained sequences encoding amino acids 1–753, and the Elongin A probe contained sequences encoding amino acids 263–772. The direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method was used for chromosomal assignment of the human Elongin A2 gene. Preparation of R-banded chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization were in accordance with previously described procedures (15.Takahashi E. Hori T. Lawrence J.B. McNeil J. Singer R.H. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Jpn. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 34: 307-311Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16.Takahashi E. Hori T. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Hum. Genet. 1990; 86: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte culture was synchronized by thymidine block, and 5-bromodeoxyuridine was incorporated during the late replication stage for differential replication staining after the release of excessive thymidine. R-band staining was performed by exposure of chromosome slides to UV light after staining with Hoechst 33258. The chromosome slides were hardened at 65 °C for 3 h, denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2× SSC, and then dehydrated in a 70–85-100% ethanol series at 4 °C. The 2.3-kb coding region of human Elongin A2 cDNA inserted into pET16b was labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragment was ethanol-precipitated with salmon sperm DNA and Escherichia coli tRNA and then denatured at 75 °C for 10 min in 100% formamide. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to obtain a final concentration of 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A 20-μl aliquot of mixture containing 250 ng of labeled DNA was placed on the denatured slide, covered with parafilm, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed for 20 min in 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 37 °C, and in 2× SSC, and 1× SSC for 20 min each at room temperature. After rinsing in 4× SSC, they were incubated under a coverslip with anti-biotin antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4× SSC for 1 h at 37 °C. They were sequentially washed with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, and 4× SSC for 5 min each and then stained with Cy2-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at 37 °C. After sequential washing with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, and 4× SSC for 10 min on a shaker, the slides were rinsed with 2× SSC and stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Excitations at wavelength 450–490 nm (Nikon filter set B-2A) and near 365 nm (UV-2A) were carried out for observation. Kodak Ektachrome ASA100 films were used for microphotography. The coding region of human Elongin A2 was amplified by KOD DNA polymerase using two primers (5′-CCCATATGGCGGCAGGGTCCACTACGC and 5′-CCGGATCCTTATCGTCGGGAGAATCTTCTC). The amplified 2.3-kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the vector pET16b (Novagen) to generate a plasmid (pET-hEloA2) for expression of a 10-histidine-tagged Elongin A2. A 500-ml culture ofE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) transformed with pET-hEloA2 was grown to an A 600 of 0.6 in Luria broth (LB) containing 200 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C. Following induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 30 min. After two cycles of freeze-thaw, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. Inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension of the pellet in 50 ml of ice-cold 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), and 0.5 mm PMSF, and the resulting suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. Recombinant Elongin A2 was purified from the supernatants using Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography. A 20-ml aliquot of the supernatant was applied to a 2-ml Ni2+-agarose column preequilibrated with 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), and 0.5 mm PMSF. The column was washed with 20 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mmimidazole (pH 7.9), and 0.5 mm PMSF, and recombinant Elongin A2 was eluted with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), and 0.5 mm PMSF. After renaturation and dialysis, the Elongin A2 preparation was centrifuged at 60,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a TSK SP-5PW column (7.5 mm × 75 mm, Toso-Haas) preequilibrated with 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 m KCl. The column was eluted at 1 ml/min with a 50-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.8 m KCl in the same buffer. Elongin A2 was eluted between 0.45 and 0.50m KCl. Recombinant Elongin A, B, and C subunits were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding human Elongin A2 and rat Elongin A containing 10-histidine and FLAG tags at their NH2 termini were cloned into the NcoI-BamHI site of the pBacPAK-His1 vector (CLONTECH). cDNAs encoding untagged rat Elongin B and rat Elongin C were cloned into theXhoI-BglII site of the pBacPAK8 vector (CLONTECH). Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9) cells were cultured as monolayers in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences) at 27 °C. Recombinant transfer plasmid containing each Elongin subunit was cotransfected withBsu36I-digested BacPAK6 virus DNA (CLONTECH) into Sf9 cells by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) -mediated transfection, and the resultant viral pool was collected four days later and amplified three times. For expression of the recombinant proteins, Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 107 cells/175-cm2 flask and infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing 10-histidine-tagged Elongin A2 or Elongin A either with or without baculoviruses expressing untagged Elongin B and C subunits at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20. 60–72 h after infection, the cells were gently dislodged from culture flasks and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 1 mmdithiothreitol). The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine) and lysed by brief sonication. The cell lysates were then clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble materials. Recombinant Elongin A2, Elongin A, Elongin A2-BC complex, and Elongin A-BC complex were purified from the soluble fraction of lysates using Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography. 5 ml of each supernatant was applied to 1-ml Ni2+-agarose column pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.9) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the column was washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mmimidazole (pH 7.9). The recombinant proteins were eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), and the fractions (1 ml) were collected. The peak fractions of each eluate were dialyzed against the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and aliquots were used for Western blotting and the oligo(dC)-tailed template assay. RNA polymerase II was purified as described from rat liver nuclear extracts (17.Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1990; 248: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase assays were carried out essentially as described previously (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase II (0.01 unit) and 100 ng of pCpGR220S/P/X were incubated at 28 °C in the presence of 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 3 units of recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor, 50 μm ATP, 50 μm GTP, 2 μm CTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. After a 20-min labeling, 100 μm nonradioactive CTP, 2 μm UTP, and the indicated amounts of Elongin subunits were added, and the reactions were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide-7.0 m urea gels. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing human Elongin A2 or rat Elongin A with both 10-histidine and FLAG epitope tags at their NH2 termini were infected into Sf9 cells either with or without baculoviruses expressing untagged rat Elongins B and C. The cells were harvested 60–72 h postinfection, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine), and lysed by brief sonication. The cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with ∼100 μl of Ni2+-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.9) and then centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 rpm. Following centrifugation, the supernatants containing the unbound proteins were collected, and the Ni2+-agarose was washed four times by resuspension in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.9) and centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 rpm. Finally, bound proteins were eluted with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.9). Aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with the appropriate antibody. To study the possible existence of a novel member of the Elongin protein family, a data base of human expressed sequence tags was searched with the human Elongin A sequence (13.Aso T. Haque D. Fukudome K. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as the query sequence. One expressed sequence tag clone (accession number AA861139) was found in a testis data base that showed 50% identity to the 3′-end of the coding region of human Elongin A at the amino acid level. An insert of this clone was used to screen a human testis cDNA library, and one cDNA clone containing the 1.8-kb insert was obtained. The 5′-end of cDNA was obtained by 5′-RACE analysis with pooled human testis cDNAs. Full-length Elongin A2 cDNA was obtained by overlap extension (14.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using these two cDNA fragments as templates. The cDNA clone covered 114 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the whole coding region, and 328 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated sequence. The nucleotides flanking the start methionine conformed to the Kozak consensus sequence (18.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). An in-frame stop codon was located 111 nucleotides upstream from the start ATG. The 3′-untranslated sequence contained the putative polyadenylation signal TATAAA, which is accompanied 12 base pairs downstream by a poly (A)+ tail of 20 nucleotides (these cDNA sequences are not shown but have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base). The Elongin A2 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 753 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 83,932 Da (Fig. 1). As determined by the MegAlign program of the Lasergene (Madison, WI) system, Elongin A2 is 47% identical and 61% similar to human Elongin A. Although Elongin A2 has no obvious structural motifs such as zinc finger, leucine zipper, or helix-turn-helix motifs commonly found in transcription factors, comparison between Elongin A2 and Elongin A revealed two conserved structural features. The first was the SII similarity domain (motif I) present at the NH2 terminus. The two proteins exhibited 64% identity over a 107-amino acid overlap. The other was the Elongin BC binding sequence (motif II) present at the COOH terminus of these proteins. This ∼10-amino acid-consensus sequence ((T/S)L XXX C XXX (V/L/I)) has been found not only in Elongin A, but also in VHL, and the suppressor of cytokine signaling family of proteins (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19.Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). To examine the tissue distribution of Elongin A2 and Elongin A expression, Northern blots containing poly(A)+RNA from various human tissues were hybridized with Elongin A2- and Elongin A-specific probes. As shown in Fig.2, only the RNA from the testis showed a single band of ∼3.0 kb hybridizing with the human Elongin A2 probe. On the other hand, the Elongin A probe hybridized to two mRNA species of ∼5.2 and ∼2.8 kb. Although the intensity of the signals exhibited tissue-to-tissue variation, these two mRNA species were detected in all of the tissues examined. It remains to be determined whether the ∼5.2 and ∼2.8 kb mRNAs were alternatively spliced forms of Elongin A or a cross-hybridized form from a closely related gene. The chromosomal location of human Elongin A2 gene was determined by fluorescencein situ hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Metaphase chromosomes with replication bands were hybridized with a biotinylated human Elongin A2 cDNA probe. The hybridized signals were located on the q21.1 band of human chromosome 18, and no accumulation of signals was observed on any other chromosomes (Fig. 3). In a previous study, we demonstrated that Elongin A is capable of stimulating the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Elongin A2 is also capable of stimulating transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, a DNA fragment containing the open reading frame of Elongin A2 was introduced into both E. coliand baculovirus expression vectors. Recombinant Elongin A2 with an NH2-terminal 10-histidine tag was expressed in E. coli and purified from guanidine-solubilized inclusion bodies by sequential Ni2+-agarose and TSK SP-5PW chromatography. Recombinant Elongin A2 with 10-histidine and FLAG tags at the NH2 terminus was expressed in insect cells and purified from the soluble fraction of the cell lysates by Ni2+-agarose chromatography. Recombinant Elongin A2 in both preparations had an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa and a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility than Elongin A (Fig.4). To examine the ability of Elongin A2 to stimulate the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II and to compare its activity with that of Elongin A, an oligo(dC)-tailed template assay was performed. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, transcription was initiated by the addition of RNA polymerase II to reaction mixtures containing the pCpGR220S/P/X template and ATP, GTP, and [α-32P]CTP. After a 20-min incubation, transcripts of ∼135 nucleotides were synthesized on the T-less cassette of the template (right panel, lane 1). These transcripts were then chased with a limiting concentration of UTP and an excess of nonradioactive CTP in the presence or absence of equivalent amounts of baculovirus-expressed recombinant Elongin A2 or Elongin A. In the absence of Elongin, a substantial portion of the ∼135-nucleotide transcripts persisted for at least 7 min after the addition of UTP and nonradioactive CTP (left panel, lane 1). In the presence of increasing concentrations of either Elongin A2 or Elongin A (left panel, lanes 2–7), nearly all of the ∼135-nucleotide transcripts had been chased into longer transcripts. Notably, the transcripts synthesized in the presence of Elongin A were substantially longer than those synthesized in the presence of Elongin A2. When we used E. coli-expressed Elongin A2 and Elongin A, almost identical results were obtained (data not shown). Thus, Elongin A2 is capable of stimulating RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of other transcription factors, although it appears to be less active than Elongin A. These findings were confirmed by an experiment in which we measured the kinetics of accumulation of the long transcripts and of the distribution of RNA intermediates in the presence or absence of equivalent amounts of Elongin A2 or Elongin A (Fig. 5, right panel). In the absence of Elongin, nearly all of the ∼135-nucleotide transcripts had been chased into longer transcripts ∼20 min after the addition of UTP (lanes 2–5). With the addition of Elongin A2, RNA chain elongation progressed at an intermediate rate, with nearly all of the ∼135-nucleotide transcripts disappearing within 10 min (lanes 6–9). With the addition of Elongin A, the elongation progressed more rapidly, with nearly all of the ∼135-nucleotide transcripts disappearing within 5 min (lanes 10–13). Because of the high degree of conservation of the putative Elongin BC binding residues in Elongin A2, we expected that Elongin A2 would also interact with Elongins B and C. To assess the ability of Elongin A2 to bind with Elongins B and C to form an Elongin A2-BC complex, we assayed human Elongin A2 containing 10-histidine and FLAG tags at the NH2terminus for its ability to retain the untagged Elongins B and C on Ni2+-agarose. In this experiment, Elongin A2 was coexpressed with Elongins B and C in Sf9 cells, and cell lysates were subjected to Ni2+-agarose chromatography. Unbound and bound protein fractions were collected, and equivalent amounts of each fraction were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophresis and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.6, untagged Elongins B and C did not bind to Ni2+-agarose (lanes 1–3), but were retained on the column in the presence of 10-histidine-tagged Elongin A2 (lanes 7–9). The amounts of Elongins B and C retained on the column were approximately equivalent to those retained by Elongin A (lanes 13–15). Thus, as predicted by the sequence homology, Elongin A2 can also bind to Elongin BC as strongly as Elongin A. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of Elongin A is strongly activated by Elongin BC (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of Elongin BC to the transcriptional activity of Elongin A2, purified Elongin BC complex at increasing concentrations was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of purified Elongin A2 or Elongin A and their activities were then measured using the oligo(dC)-tailed template assay (Fig.7, left panel). As we reported previously, purified Elongin BC complex by itself had no detectable effect on the rate of RNA chain elongation (lanes 1–3), and the activity of Elongin A on RNA chain elongation was strongly activated by Elongin BC (lanes 7–9). However, the addition of the increasing concentrations of Elongin BC had no detectable effect on the activity of Elongin A2. We considered a possible explanation for the observed unresponsiveness of Elongin A2 to Elongin BC. First, it is possible that Elongin A2 purified from insect cells is associated with endogenous insect cell Elongin BC. To rule out this possibility, we performed an oligo(dC)-tailed template assay using E. coli-expressed Elongin A2 (Fig. 7, right panel). The activity of Elongin A2 purified from E. coli was not activated by Elongin BC (lanes 5–7), suggesting that the lack of stimulation of Elongin A2 by the Elongin BC complex was not due to contaminating insect cell Elongin BC in our Elongin A2 preparations. Second, it is also possible that Elongin A2 may not be able to fold properly in the absence of Elongin BC, and coexpression of Elongin A2 and Elongins B and C is essential for the assembly of functional heterotrimers. We therefore infected baculoviruses expressing Elongin A2 in the presence or absence of baculoviruses expressing Elongins B and C in insect cells and purified the Elongin A2-BC complex or Elongin A2 using Ni2+-agarose chromatography. We then compared the specific activity of these proteins. However, no detectable difference was observed (data not shown), suggesting that coexpression is not important for the responsiveness of Elongin A2 to Elongin BC. In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a human cDNA encoding Elongin A2, a novel RNA polymerase II elongation factor that is specifically expressed in the testis. Elongin A2 is a 753-amino acid protein exhibiting 47% identity and 61% similarity to the previously characterized transcription elongation factor, Elongin A (8.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13.Aso T. Haque D. Fukudome K. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Like Elongin A, Elongin A2 is able to stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA plolymerase II in the oligo(dC)-tailed template assay, suggesting that it stimulates elongation through a direct interaction with RNA polymerase II, template DNA, the nascent transcript, or some combination of these components of the ternary RNA polymerase II elongation complex. We note that the SII similarity region (motif I) at the NH2terminus of Elongin A is highly conserved in Elongin A2. The previous results indicate that the NH2 termini of both Elongin A and SII are dispensable for the elongation-stimulatory activities of these proteins in vitro and for the rescue of the phenotype of an SII deletion mutant in the yeast (20.Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22.Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The findings that the NH2 termini of both Elongin A and SII are capable of binding to RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (23.Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), however, suggests that this region may play an in vivo regulatory role not yet revealed by current assays. Elongin A2 also contains the Elongin BC binding sequence (motif II), consensus (T/S)LXXXCXXX(V/L/I), at the COOH terminus. Our previous results indicate that this sequence motif is important for the induction of the transcriptional activity of Elongin A by Elongin BC (9.Aso T. Haque D. Barstead R.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. EMBO. J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with the conservation of this sequence motif, Elongin A2 was shown to be able to form a stable complex with Elongin BC. In contrast to Elongin A, however, the transcriptional activity of Elongin A2 was not activated by Elongin BC. What is the reason for the unresponsiveness of Elongin A2? Although the mechanism of induction of Elongin A by the Elongin BC complex has not yet been established at the molecular level, binding of Elongin BC could cause the elongation activation domain of Elongin A to adopt a more transcriptionally active conformation. If Elongin A activity were solely induced by this allosteric mechanism, it is possible that the elongation activation domain of Elongin A2 might be less flexible than that of Elongin A and resistant to conformational change. Indeed, although the sequence constituting the elongation activation domain of Elongin A, residues 520–690, is well conserved in Elongin A2, they do not share sequence similarity throughout this region. The other possibility is that Elongin A2 might have its own partners in vivo, as noted for the TATA-binding protein-related factor (24.Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,25.Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Drosophila TATA-binding protein-related factor is expressed only in the central nervous system and the testis and is complexedin vivo with its own set of associated factors (designated neuronal TATA-binding protein-associated factors) apparently distinct from the TATA-binding protein-associated factors (24.Crowley T.E. Hoey T. Liu J.K. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 361: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25.Hansen S.K. Takada S. Jacobson R.H. Lis J.T. Tjian R. Cell. 1997; 91: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The localization of the TATA-binding protein-related factor to a small number of specific loci on Drosophila polytene chromosomes suggests that the TATA-binding protein-related factor-neuronal TATA-binding protein-associated factor complex supports transcription from a subset of tissue-specific genes. A similar situation might exist for Elongin A2, and it is possible that the activity of Elongin A2 is only regulated by factors, such as testis-specific homologs of Elongins B and C. What might be the function of Elongin A2 in vivo? Because Elongin A, TFIIF, and eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia protein are capable of stimulating the rate of elongation through a wide variety of DNA templates tested in vitro, these factors have been considered to be general elongation factors. If this were also the case with Elongin A2, this factor could function as a testis-specific general elongation factor and work cooperatively with Elongin A to support the relatively high level of transcription in this tissue. Alternatively, Elongin A2 could regulate the expression of only a subset of genes. The discovery that DNA binding transcriptional activators, such as VP-16, E1A, and p53, which regulate transcription in part by stimulating the rate of elongation, raises the possibility that transcription elongation factors including Elongin A2 could be targets for gene-specific transcriptional activators in vivoand are recruited to the promoter regions of specific genes (26.Yankulov K. Blau J. Purton T. Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 27.Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although Elongin A2 did not exert any detectable inhibition of Elongin A activity in the in vitro assay (data not shown), it is also possible that Elongin A2 works as a negative regulator of Elongin A in vivo by binding to Elongin BC and inhibiting its ability to activate the transcriptional activity of Elongin A in the testis. Future biochemical characterization of these proteins that associate with Elongin A2, as well as identification of potential Elongin A2-responsive genes will undoubtedly clarify this issue. Finally, the testis-specific expression of Elongin A2 together with the overexpression of RNA polymerase II and several transcription initiation factors in this tissue suggests that Elongin A2 plays some important role in spermatogenesis (28.Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. Development. 1995; 121: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Upadhyaya A.B. Lee S.H. DeJong J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18040-18048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because expression of Elongin A2 is not detectable in the ovary, Elongin A2 does not appear to play any general role in meiosis. Determination of the cell type specificity of Elongin A2 expression and generation of Elongin A2-deficient mice will be required to gain insight into the function of Elongin A2 in vivo. We thank Drs. Takumi Kamura, Joan W. Conaway, and Ronald C. Conaway for providing valuable reagents."

We herein demonstrate that this transport is mediated by the canine homologue of glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), one of the glutamate transporter subtypes abundant in the central nervous system. We also demonstrate that GLAST is the most ubiquitous glutamate transporter among the transporter subtypes that have been cloned to date. The GLAST protein content was extremely reduced in variant red cells, low glutamate transport (LGlut) red cells characterized by an inherited remarkable decrease in glutamate transport activity. All LGluT dogs carried a missense mutation of Gly492 to Ser (G492S) in either the heterozygous or homozygous state. The GLAST protein with G492S mutation was fully functional in glutamate transport in Xenopus oocytes. However, G492S GLAST exhibited a marked decrease in activity after the addition of cycloheximide, while the wild type showed no significant change, indicating that G492S GLAST was unstable compared with the wild-type transporter. Moreover, LGluT dogs, but not normal dogs, heterozygous for the G492S mutation showed a selective decrease in the accumulation of GLAST mRNA from the normal allele. Based on these findings, we conclude that a complicated heterologous combination of G492S mutation and some transcriptional defect contributes to the pathogenesis of the LGluT red cell phenotype.

Several distinct glutamate transporters, GLAST,1 GLT-1, EAAC1, EAAT4, and EAAT5 have been cloned, and their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties have been characterized (1.Storck T.

In the central nervous system, these transporters are highly differentially localized and participate in glutamate uptake into glial or neuronal cells to terminate excitatory neurotransmission (6.Nicholls D. Attwell D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 462-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In particular, glial transporters GLAST and GLT-1 play critical roles to maintain the extracellular glutamate concentration at the submicromolar level, thereby preventing accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, which causes overstimulation of the receptors and neurodegeneration. Dysfunction of glutamate transporters has been considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (7.Lin C.L. Bristol L.A. Jin L.

In peripheral tissues, glutamate transporters are believed to have pivotal functions in epithelial transport and absorption of acidic amino acids (9.Schneider E.G. Hammerman M.R. Sactor B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7650-7656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Rajendran V.M. Harig J.M. Adams M.B. Ramaswamy K. Am. J.

Physiol. 1987; 63: 1966-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). EAAC1 is presumed to be a transporter in the epithelia of the intestine and kidney, because its transcripts were identified in those peripheral tissues as well as in neurons (3.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). However, physiological and pathological functions of other transporter isoforms in peripheral tissues have not been well characterized. We have been interested in the structure, function, and regulation of expression of the red cell glutamate transporter in dogs. Canine red cells possess a high affinity Na+- and K+-dependent l-glutamate andl-aspartate transport system (12.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 312-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Sato K. Inaba M. Maede Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), despite the fact that most mammalian red cells are impermeable to these acidic amino acids (14.Young J.D. Ellory J.C. Ellory J.C. Lew V.L. Membrane Transport in Red Cells. Academic Press, London1977: 301-325Google Scholar). Dogs usually have red cells with low K+ and high Na+ concentrations (LK red cells) because they lose red cell Na,K-ATPase during reticulocyte maturation (15.Maede Y. Inaba M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3337-3343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16099-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some Japanese Shiba and mongrel dogs have HK red cells with high Na,K-ATPase activity, resulting in high K+ and low Na+ concentrations, and this HK phenotype is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (17.Maede Y. Inaba M. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1983; 61: 493-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HK red cells show accelerated Na+/K+-dependent glutamate/aspartate uptake due to an increased concentration gradient of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane, leading to marked accumulations of intracellular glutamate, aspartate, and glutamine (12.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 312-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Maede Y. Inaba M. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1983; 61: 493-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased concentration of glutamate further results in an elevated level of reduced glutathione and affects the redox state and protection against oxidative stress of the red cell (18.Maede Y. Kuwabara M. Sasaki A. Inaba M. Hiraoka W. Blood. 1989; 73: 312-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these breeds also include dogs characterized by reduced (19.Fujise H. Hamada Y.

Such a hereditary defect of the glutamate transporter in mammals has never been described so far as we know, although several pathological studies on mice lacking glutamate transporters due to gene disruption has been reported (20.Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K. Iwama H. Nishikawa T. Ichihara N. Kikuchi T. Okuyama S. Kawashima N. Hori S. Takimoto M. Wada K.

Neurosci. 1998; 10: 976-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The observations in dogs suggested that the functions of the glutamate transporters contributed to protect cellular contents from oxidative damage in peripheral tissues. Defining the molecular basis that underlies the transport deficiency in canine red cells may facilitate our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for expression of, and the physiological and pathological roles for, the glutamate transporter in various tissues, including the brain. We have postulated that, based on observations of its kinetic and pharmacologic properties, the canine red cell glutamate transporter is EAAC1 (13.Sato K. Inaba M. Maede Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study is to precisely define the glutamate transporter in canine red cells, thereby clarifying the underlying cause for the hereditary deficiency of the transport. The dogs used in this study were from a family of Japanese mongrel dogs that were a mixed breed of Japanese Shiba. Some pure Shiba and Beagle dogs were also used. These dogs were clinically healthy, and hematological parameters of their red cells were within reference ranges except that HK red cells had a mean corpuscular volume slightly larger than that of LK red cells as demonstrated before (17.Maede Y. Inaba M. Taniguchi N. Blood. 1983; 61: 493-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for isolation of total RNA, poly(A)+ RNA, and genomic DNA, reverse transcription, PCR, and cloning of PCR products were described previously (23.Inaba M. Yawata A. Koshino I. Sato K. Takeuchi M. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Yawata Y. Kanzaki A. Sakai J. Ban A. Ono K. Maede Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1804-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). RNAs were treated with DNase I. DNA sequencing was carried out using a Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) on an automated DNA sequencer ALF express (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) or using a BigDye primer or terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a 377A DNA sequencer. Total RNA from various tissues was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified with PCR to detect cDNA fragments of GLAST, GLT-1, EAAC1, and EAAT4. Primer pairs used were as follows: GLAST, 5′-ATT GTA CAA GTG ACA GCT GCA GAC GCC-3′ and 5′-TTT CCC TGC AAT CAG GAA GAG GAT GCC C-3′ (nt 481–507 and nt 938–912 of canine GLAST, respectively); GLT-1, 5′-GCC ATG GTG TAT TAC ATG TCC ACA ACC A-3′ and 5′-CCA TCC TTG AAC TCC AAG CCC TTC TTG-3′ (corresponding to nt 358–385 and nt 713–687 of rat GLT-1 (2.Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar)); EAAC1, 5′-TGG GAA ATA TTC CGC AAG CTA GGC CTT-3′ and 5′-TTT CTT CTG CAC AGC GGA AAG TGA CAG G-3′ (corresponding to nt 826–851 and nt 1,039–1,012 of rabbit EAAC1 (3.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar)); and EAAT4, 5′-CAC TCA TTG TCT CCA GCC TGG TCA CAG-3′ and 5′-TCT TGA ACT GTT TGA AGC AGG CCT CCA-3′ (corresponding to nt 317–343 and nt 598–572 of human EAAT4 (4.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar)). These sequences specific to canine glutamate transporter subtypes were derived from those of cDNA fragments amplified by PCR from canine brain cDNAs using degenerate primers designed according to the sequences of rat GLAST (5′-ACC AC(C/T) ATC ATT GCT GTG GTG-3′ and 5′-GC(A/G) GTC CCA TCC ATG TTA ATG-3′, corresponding to nt 388–408 and nt 1,208–1,188 of rat GLAST (1.Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10955-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar)), rat GLT-1 (5′- CTG GAT GCT AAG GCT AGT GGC CGC-3′ and 5′-GC(A/G) GTC CCA TCC ATG TTA ATG-3′, corresponding to nt 322–345 and nt 1,202–1,182, respectively), rabbit EAAC1 (5′-GG(A/C/G/T) GAA ATC CTG ATG AGG ATG CTG-3′ and 5′-GC(A/G) GTC CCA TCC ATG TTA ATG-3′, corresponding to nt 166–189 and nt 1,112–1,092, respectively) and human EAAT4 (5′-GG(A/C/G/T) GAA ATC CTG ATG AGG ATG CTG-3′ and 5′-GGG GAA GGG GTT CCG GTG AGT GAC-3′, corresponding to nt 277–300 and nt 1,116–1,093, respectively). Canine glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene transcripts were also amplified as an internal control using primers (5′-TGC TCC TTC TGC TGA TGC CCC CAT-3′ and 5′-TCT GGG TGG CAG TGA TGG CAT GGA-3′) prepared according to the sequence reported by Grone et al. (24.Grone A. Weckmann M.T. Capen C.C. Rosol T.J. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1996; 57: 254-257PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel (see Fig. 2) and sequenced to confirm the specificity of the products. The similarities of nucleotide sequences of each PCR product to rat GLAST, rat GLT-1, rabbit EAAC1, and human EAAT4 were 86.7, 86.6, 88.8, and 93.3%, respectively. Adapter-ligated cDNAs were prepared from poly(A)+ RNA from the forebrain cortex of a dog, using a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RACE reactions were performed using Advantage Klen Taq DNA polymerase (CLONTECH) with the adapter primers supplied by the manufacturer and gene-specific primers synthesized according to the sequences of the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment of canine brain GLAST. The GLAST-specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE were 5′-TGC CCC CCA ATT ACT CCC ATG TCT TCC-3′ (nt 938–912) and 5′-ATT GTA CAA GTG ACA GCT GCA GAC GCC-3′ (nt 481–507), respectively. Nested primers were 5′-TTT CCC TGC AAT CAG GAA GAG GAT GCC C-3′ (nt 900–873) for 5′-RACE and 5′-AAA GTG CCC ATC CAG TCC AAT GAG ACG-3′ (nt 598–624) for 3′-RACE. PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 by the TA cloning method (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and combined into pSPORT1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc., Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) to create 5′- and 3′-stretched canine brain GLAST cDNA, pcGLAST. A bone marrow GLAST cDNA clone (pcGLASTbm) was also prepared in the same manner. Oocytes (stage V and VI) were isolated from Xenopus laevis under ice-cold anesthesia and defolliculated by treatment with 0.2% collagenase in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5). The oocytes were microinjected with 1–25 ng of capped synthetic GLAST RNAs (50 nl). GLAST RNAs were transcribed from pcGLAST or pcGLASTbm linearized with BglII immediately downstream from the termination codon or withMluI within the vector sequence using MaxiScript or MegaScript kit with T7 RNA polymerase and a cap analogue (Ambion, Austin, TX). The oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 36–72 h. In some experiments, cycloheximide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was added to the medium at a concentration of 10 μg/ml, and incubation was continued for 12 h. Multiple antigen peptides were synthesized using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase method for the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region of canine GLAST (NH2-Asn-Ser-Val-Ile-Glu-Glu-Asn-Glu-Met-Lys-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Gln-Leu-COOH; residues 511–525; see Fig. 1) using a peptide synthesizer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at Dr. Y. Takakuwa's laboratory (Tokyo Women's Medical University). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 100–200 μg of peptides with Freund's complete adjuvant followed by three successive immunizations with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Antisera were obtained 3 days after intravenous injection of the peptides. Anti-GLAST antibody was purified on an affinity chromatography medium that was prepared by immobilizing synthetic peptides to an N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml packed gel. Antibodies bound to the column were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine/Tris, pH 2.7, and neutralized immediately with Tris. Red cell ghosts were prepared as described (16.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16099-16105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude synaptic membranes from brain were prepared according to Kanner (25.Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli's system) on 8% gels (23.Inaba M. Yawata A. Koshino I. Sato K. Takeuchi M. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Yawata Y. Kanzaki A. Sakai J. Ban A. Ono K. Maede Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1804-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The GLAST polypeptides were detected by immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-GLAST antibodies and an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, membrane proteins were solubilized in 2% (w/v) CHAPS (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and kept on ice for 30 min to induce oligomerization of the GLAST proteins, which leads to efficient detection of the polypeptides with the antibodies. Solubilized proteins were concentrated with ultrafiltration units (Ultrafree MC, 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. pcGLAST was transcribed and translated using a TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) with or without canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (EXPRE35S35S; 1,175 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Translated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by exposure to Kodak BioMax MR films. Red cell membranes and crude synaptic membranes were deglycosylated using peptide:N-glycosidase F (NEN Life Science Products). Briefly, the membrane proteins (100–150 μg) were solubilized in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 30 min. After the addition of 110 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, samples were incubated with 2,000 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Uptake of l-glutamate in canine red cells was measured as described previously (12.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 312-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Sato K. Inaba M. Maede Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with synthetic RNA were incubated at 19 °C in ND96 medium containing l-[3,4-3H]glutamate (49 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 1.8 mmCaCl2 (100 μl/oocyte). After incubation, oocytes were washed three times with an excessive amount of ice-chilled ND96 medium. Each oocyte was transferred into a 1.5-ml tube and lysed in 200 μl of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was determined using ReadyCap (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). To estimate Na+-independent transport, NaCl was substituted for equimolar choline chloride. Under these conditions, the Na+-dependent component, given by subtraction of the values in the absence of Na+ from those in the presence of Na+, increased linearly for the initial 5 min. The sensitivity of the transporter to the inhibitor was estimated by determining the transport activity for 5 μml-glutamate in the presence of appropriate concentrations of various compounds. A restriction enzyme assay was carried out to determine genotypes for G492S mutation. PCR fragments corresponding to nt 1,427–1,657 of canine GLAST cDNA were amplified using genomic DNA from dogs as the templates. The resulting PCR products were digested with NgoMIV and separated on 4% agarose gel. GLAST mRNA was quantitated by RT-PCR combined with a 5′-nuclease assay or SYBR green detection using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). A 5′-nuclease assay of GLAST mRNA was carried out with PCR primers 5′-AAT GTG TCG GAA GCC ATG GAG-3′ (nt 646–666) and 5′-TTG ACC CCA TTC ACA GAC CCT-3′ (nt 725–705) in the presence of a TaqMan probe of 5′-ACA AGG ATC ACG GAG GAG TTG ATC CCA G-3′ (nt 673–700) and was normalized with the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. In our preliminary experiments, PCR amplification of canine brain cDNA generated cDNA fragments corresponding to those of four different glutamate transporter subtypes, GLAST, GLT-1, EAAC1, and EAAT4. Nucleotide sequences of these cDNA fragments from dogs showed high similarities to those from other sources as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, when the same procedure was applied to cDNA from bone marrow cells, only cDNA fragments corresponding to GLAST were obtained, suggesting that the GLAST protein functions in canine erythroid cells. Primers specific to the “GLAST-like” sequences obtained were prepared, and 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were carried out using canine brain and bone marrow cDNAs as templates. The 5′- and 3′-RACE products were subcloned and combined. The cDNA clones from the brain (pcGLAST) and bone marrow cells (pcGLASTbm) were both about 3.8 kilobase pairs in length with a 1,629-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 542 amino acid residues with the theoretical molecular mass of 59,757 Da. The size of the GLAST mRNA was confirmed by Northern blotting, although the signal intensity was very weak for bone marrow mRNA even when more than 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was applied (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity, over 96%, to human, bovine, and rat GLASTs (Fig.1) and significant but much lesser similarity to the other glutamate transporters, GLT-1, EAAC1, EAAT4, and EAAT5 (50–66%). Thus, recent models for membrane topology of human GLAST (26.Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27.Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with 10 or 11 membrane-spanning regions and cytoplasmic localization of NH2 and COOH termini can be adopted to the canine homologue. This prediction supposes two potentialN-glycosylation sites, at Asn206 and Asn216, with N-glycosylation consensus sequences (Asn-X, where X represents any residue except Pro-Ser/Thr) within the putative second extracellular loop. RT-PCR analysis indicated amplification of GLAST cDNA with strong signals in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (Fig.2). Amplification was also observed in other tissues and cells except that a very faint band and no bands were obtained in reticulocytes and liver, respectively. It should be emphasized that signals for GLAST cDNA were detected clearly in reticulocytes and liver when the PCR cycles were increased (Fig. 2,right panels). Signals were also detected in all other tissues examined, including colon, spleen, pancreas, thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and testis, with intensities similar to those of reticulocytes and liver (data not shown). Under the PCR conditions employed, no noticeable amplification of the transporter cDNA other than that of GLAST cDNA was observed in bone marrow cells and reticulocytes, although EAAC1 showed a very faint band of PCR products in bone marrow after extended PCR cycles. These results demonstrated a ubiquitous expression of GLAST transcripts in a variety of cells and tissues in dogs and indicated that canine erythroid cells contained the GLAST mRNA but not the transcripts of other glutamate transporter genes. Oocytes injected with synthetic RNA of canine GLAST showed high affinity Na+-dependent glutamate uptake that was completely abolished when the extracellular Na+was replaced by choline. The Na+-dependent uptake was dominated by a saturable component obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3 A). TheK m value for l-glutamate obtained from a Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3 B) was 36.3 μm. This value was slightly higher than that estimated for the uptake in canine red cells at 37 °C (7–14 μm; Refs. 12.Inaba M. Maede Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 312-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 13.Sato K. Inaba M. Maede Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas lower affinity was reported for other mammalian GLAST homologues in oocytes (70–80 μm) (1.Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K.

Several structural analogues of l-glutamate were tested for their inhibitory effects on glutamate transport to compare the pharmacological properties of canine GLAST and canine red cells (TableI). Potent inhibition of the glutamate uptake was observed in response to threo-3-hydroxyaspartate,l-glutamate, and l- and d-aspartate but not by d-glutamate. These were the properties common to all the brain glutamate transporters (31.Kanai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Dihydrokainate andl-cysteine, which are selective inhibitors for human GLT-1 (32.Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J.

Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), respectively, poorly inhibited the glutamate transport by canine GLAST. Thus, the responses of canine GLAST expressed in the oocytes were consistent with those of the glutamate transport system in canine red cells (Table I).Table ICross-inhibition with structural analogues of glutamate transport by canine GLAST expressed in oocytesInhibitorsUptake (percentage of control)OocytesRed cellsaReference data for dog red cells at 37 °C determined in our previous study (13) except forl-cysteine.%%None100.0 ± 21.8100.0 ± 5.0l-Glutamate46.3 ± 24.022.3 ± 0.3d-Glutamate87.8 ± 21.376.7 ± 11.8l-Aspartate43.9 ± 16.920.3 ± 0.9d-Aspartate61.5 ± 27.953.2 ± 2.2threo-3-Hydroxyaspartate15.7 ± 5.616.6 ± 0.4l-Cysteinesulfinate43.5 ± 6.020.6 ± 1.0Dihydrokainate (500 μm)73.1 ± 21.256.4 ± 11.7 (1 mm)l-Cysteine (500 μm)73.3 ± 10.788.4 ± 1.0The uptake of 5 μm l-[3H]glutamate was measured in oocytes expressing canine GLAST at 19 °C for 5 min in ND96 medium containing a 25 μm concentration of each analogue.

Affinity-purified antibodies to the synthetic peptide of GLAST reacted with 60-kDa proteins in membranes from the cerebral cortex, while the antibodies immunospecifically recognized polypeptides with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa in red cell membranes, as documented in Fig. 4 A(Membranes). When the brain membranes were solubilized with CHAPS, the distinct higher molecular mass signals at 120 kDa appeared on the immunoblot (Fig. 4 A, CHAPS extracts) as reported for rat GLAST (34.Haugeto O.

https://openalex.org/W2044428309,"Expression of the human protein ST5-p70 correlates with reduced tumorigenic phenotype in mammalian cells, reverts their transformed phenotype, and restores their contact-dependent growth. Furthermore, expression of p70 in COS-7 cells suppresses activation of mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK2 by the largest ST5 product, p126, in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. Here we show that deletions of the COOH-terminal region of p70 transform NIH3T3 cells and induce their anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of signaling leading to MAPK/ERK2 stimulation revealed that in COS-7 cells, expression of either p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 markedly enhanced ERK2 activity in a growth factor-independent manner. Whereas wild-type p70 slightly inhibited ERK2 activation by RAS and MEK2, co-expression or p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 with either protein stimulated ERK2 cooperatively. This activity was completely blocked by the dominant negative mutants RAS17N or MEKAA, suggesting that p70 functions upstream of RAS. Unlike wild-type p70, expression of p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 mutant did not interfere with the ability of ST5-p126 to stimulate ERK2. Taken together, the data suggest that the COOH-terminal tail, residues 489–609, contains some of the critical determinants for the function of p70. Loss of this region converts the protein from an inhibitor to a constitutive activator of the RAS-ERK2 pathway.

Modi W.S. Seuanez H.N. Howley P.M. Cell Growth. Diff. 1992; 3: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is the smallest of three overlapping ST5 gene products which share common COOH-terminal sequences but differ in the amino-terminal segments of the proteins. Whereas the two larger proteins, p126 and p82, are the products of alternative splicing, the 2.8-kilobase mRNA species encoding p70 derives from a distinct promoter located within an intron of the ST5 gene (2.Richard C.W. Boehnke M. Berg D.J. Lichy J.H. Meeker T.C. Hauser E. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Modi W.S. Lichy J.H. Dean M. Seuanez H.N. Howley P.M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1991; 58: 1968Google Scholar). The p70 protein consists of 609 amino acids, shared in common with the other two isoforms. The sequence of p70 contains a region of homology to a group of GDP/GTP exchange proteins specific for the rab3 family of small GTP-binding proteins (5.Iwasaki K. Staunton J. Saifee O. Nonet M. Thomas J.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and to the MAP1 kinase-activating death domain protein, a protein identified as a binding partner of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor (4.Schievella A. Chen J.H. Graham J.R. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12069-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In HeLa/fibroblast somatic cell hybrids and a variety of other cell lines, p70 expression correlates with reduced tumorigenic phenotype, a feature that is not displayed by p126 or p82. This differential expression of p70 suggests a regulatory function in tumor suppression (1.Lichy J.H. Modi W.S. Seuanez H.N. Howley P.M. Cell Growth. Diff. 1992; 3: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this role, we previously reported that expression of p70 in transformed NIH3T3 cells could induce a flattened, nontransformed morphology and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (6.Hubbs A.E. Majidi M. Lichy J.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2519-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on previous observations, it appears likely that p70 exerts its effect on cytoskeletal organization and cell growth regulation through its participation in cellular signaling. In COS-7 cells, the largest ST5 isoform, p126, stimulates the activation of the MAP kinase ERK2 in response to epidermal growth factor (7.Majidi M. Hubbs A.E. Lichy J.H. J. Biol.

One of the proline-rich regions in p126 interacts strongly with c-Abl in vitro and allows p126 to cooperate with c-Abl in activation of ERK2. Expression of p70 interferes with the ability of p126 to recruit the c-Abl protein to the ERK2 signaling pathway, again supporting a negative regulatory function for p70 in the MAPK/ERK2 cascade (7.Majidi M. Hubbs A.E. Lichy J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16608-16614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To fully understand the signaling role of p70 in cell growth and morphology, it will be important to elucidate the structure-function relationships at the cellular as well as biochemical levels. In this report, we show that deletion of the C-terminal tail, residues 489–609, converts the protein from an inhibitor of signaling to an activator of the pathway. Furthermore, in contrast to p126, these deletion mutants activated MAP kinase even in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Stable expression of these p70 mutants resulted in morphological transformation of NIH3T3 cells and induction of anchorage-independent growth. COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Deletion mutations were introduced directly into the 2.8-kilobase cDNA/pcDNA3 plasmid using the quickchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) to insert stop codons followed by an XbaI site at various sites in the p126 cDNA. The cDNA segment downstream of the stop codon was then excised from the plasmid by XbaI digestion and religation. The following mutagenic oligonucleotides were used, with the inserted sequence marked by slashes: deletion (489, 609), upper strand, 5′-GCT CTG GAG AGG AAG/TAA CTC TAG A/AA TGA GCT GAT CTC C-3′; the lower strand, 5′-GGA GAT CAG CTC ATT/TCT AGA GTT A/CT TCC TCT CCA GAG C-3′; deletion (309, 609), upper strand, 5′-CCT TTC ATG AGA AGT/TAA CTC TAG A/CT CAT GGA GTC GCCG C-3′; the lower strand, 5′-GGG CGA CTC CAT GAG/TCT AGA GTT A/AC TTC TCA TGA AAG G-3′. The deletions were confirmed by sequencing. DNA transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (18.Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt P.R. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17896-17901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were seeded (5 × 105) cells per plate) one day prior to transfection with 4 μg of the expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were split into medium containing 800 μg/ml of the antibiotic G418 (Calbiochem) to generate stable transfectants. All plates were fed at 4-day intervals thereafter. Multiple isolated 3T3 cell clones derived from each expression vector were randomly picked, then expanded and passaged in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 for subsequent analysis. From the clonal NIH3T3 cell lines, either 5000 or 10,000 cells were plated in 60-mm diameter plate in 2.5 ml of medium containing 0.3% agar, which was overlaid onto 7 ml of solidified medium containing 0.5% agar. The medium used for soft agar assay was 2 × Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were fed weekly with 2 ml of a mixture of 33% medium and 67% soft agar. Eighteen days post-transfection, the number of colonies (with more than 20 cells) were counted to determine the efficiency of colony formation. COS-7 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 10-cm diameter plate and grown for 24 h. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged ERK2 and 4 μg of expression vector by the calcium phosphate method. The total amount of DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 vector to 20 μg per plate. Two days post-transfection, the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h and were either stimulated with EGF (150 ng/ml) or left untreated. Then the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After centrifugation, the epitope-tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the supernatants using monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune precipitates were washed three times in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate; one time in 100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m lithium chloride; and once in kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). The immune complexes were incubated in a 30-μl kinase reaction containing 40 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), 10 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reactions were quenched in 4 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was measured with a Molecular Dynamics Storm Imaging System. To verify approximately equal levels of expression of HA-ERK2 in all plates, the anti-HA precipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the epitope-specific monoclonal mouse antibody, 12CA5 (1:4000). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody, bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutant p70 cDNAs were constructed in the expression vector pcDNA3. The wild-type 70 construct contains the full-length open reading frame encoding 609 amino acids. Construct p70-ΔC1 deleted the COOH-terminal tail, residues 489–609. Construct p70-ΔC2 further truncated the 3′-end of the p70 cDNA removing 306 residues, including the GEF homology domain. The structures of the two mutants are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Wild-type p70, p70-ΔC1, or p70-ΔC2 mutants were transfected into NIH3T3 cells and the transfected cells selected for resistance to G418. An activated Ha-RAS cDNA (RAS12V) was used as positive control for transformation. After 2 weeks of drug selection, individual G418-resistant clones were screened for morphological transformation, expression of the ST5 proteins, and growth in soft agar. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with either empty vector or wild-type p70 resulted in uniformly flat colonies of contact inhibited cells (Fig.2 A and B). In contrast, transformed colonies were readily apparent on plates transfected with the p70 mutants, p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2. To determine the fraction of G418 colonies that expressed the transfected cDNA and estimate the level of expression, 20 individual colonies per plasmid (screened from four plates per experiment) were subjected to Western blot analysis using an ST5 antiserum. Of a total of 20 colonies examined from each transfection, five were found to express p70-ΔC1 and seven to express the p70-ΔC2 proteins. Whereas the nonexpressing colonies were not transformed, all of the expressing clones grew with a transformed morphology, forming colonies of densely packed refractile, fusiform cells (Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig.3). As judged by apparent growth rate and saturation density, the transforming activity of the p70-ΔC2 mutant appeared to be more potent than that of p70-ΔC1.Figure 3Elevated expressions of p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC1 is sufficient for transformation. 3T3 cells of the indicated transfection were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antisera specific for ST5 proteins. Positions of size standards are indicated in kilodaltons at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, individual colonies expressing either wild-type or mutant p70 were tested for anchorage-independent growth. In soft agar, control cells or cells expressing the wild type protein failed to grow and persisted as a single cell, whereas cells expressing mutant p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 formed medium or large colonies, respectively (Fig.4). This result contrasts with the approximately equal plating efficiencies of p70 wild-type and mutant expressing cells on plastic tissue culture plates. As reflected by colony size and number, the transformed phenotype induced by p70-ΔC2 again appeared to be more complete than that induced by p70-ΔC1. These findings demonstrate that expression of the two deletion mutants, p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2, can transform NIH3T3 cells and induce anchorage independent-growth. In a previous study, we found that p126 stimulated the response of ERK2 to EGF stimulation. Without EGF stimulation, little effect of p126 was observed (7.Majidi M. Hubbs A.E. Lichy J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16608-16614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression of p70 blocked this activity of p126. These results suggest that p70 functions as a negative regulator in signaling pathways activated by p126 (7.Majidi M. Hubbs A.E. Lichy J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16608-16614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the COOH-terminal domains in the negative regulatory function of p70 in the MAPK/ERK2 pathway, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ERK2 cDNA and expression vectors for either the wild-type p70, p70-ΔC1, or p70-ΔC2. After 48 h in complete medium and overnight starvation in serum-free medium, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with EGF (150 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were then lysed, the lysates precipitated with HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates assayed for ERK2 kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As expected from previous observations, expression of wild-type p70 did not have any effect on ERK2 activity. In contrast, both mutants, p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2, markedly stimulated this activity (Fig.5). Interestingly, and in contrast to the activity of p126 (7.Majidi M. Hubbs A.E. Lichy J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16608-16614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this activation of ERK2 did not depend on growth factor stimulation. Under starved conditions, p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2 enhanced ERK2 activity by 6- and 7.5-fold, respectively (Fig.5 B). A similar effect was observed when transfected NIH3T3 cells were treated with EGF for 15 min. Consistent with these findings, a marked elevation in ERK2 activity was also observed in the transformed p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2 expressing NIH3T3 clones (data not shown). These results demonstrate that deletion of the C terminus of p70 changes the protein from an inhibitor of ERK2 activation to a growth factor-independent activator of this kinase. Since RAS proteins play critical roles in the control of normal and transformed cell growth, we tested whether constitutive activation of MAPK/ERK2 by p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 mutant involves RAS. First, COS-7 cells were transfected with the constitutively active mutant Ras12V either alone or in combination with one of the ST5 cDNAs. RAS12V alone resulted in a 7–10-fold activation of ERK2. Expression of the wild-type p70 had a very modest inhibitory effect on RAS12V stimulation of ERK2 activity. However, co-expression of either deletion mutant with RAS12V enhanced this activity profoundly (Fig. 6). Transfection with P70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 constructs resulted in 17- and 20-fold increase, respectively, over basal levels. In a second series of experiments, the effect of the dominant negative mutant, RAS17N, on ERK2 activation mediated by the deletion mutants was analyzed. Whereas each mutant by itself resulted in a marked stimulation of ERK2 activity, co-expression of RAS17N completely abrogated this stimulatory effect (Fig. 7). These results imply that in the MAPK/ERK2 signaling pathway, the p70 protein signals through RAS.Figure 7Effect of dominant negative RAS on p70 mutant-mediated activation of ERK2.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the effect of p70 expression on other components of the ERK2 pathway, COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA-ERK2 cDNA together with the activated dual specificity kinase MEK (19.Ignotz R.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MEKEE, and either wild-type p70, p70-ΔC1, or p70-ΔC2 cDNAs. Fig. 8 shows that expression of wild-type p70 had a slight inhibitory effect on MEKEE stimulated ERK2 activity. Co-transfection of the deletion mutants p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2 with MEKEE resulted in a 15- and 17-fold activation of ERK2, respectively. This level of expression was 1.5–2-fold higher than that observed by expression of the mutants alone. Expression of dominant negative MEK, MEKAA, blocked this activity (Fig. 9), suggesting that p70 signals to regulate MEK.Figure 9Effect of dominant negative MEK on p70 mutant-mediated ERK2 activation. COS-7 cells were co-transvected with 2 μg of MEKAA and 4 μg of expression plasmids. Cells extracts were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since expression of wild-type p70 blocks the stimulatory effect of the largest ST5 gene product, p126, on ERK2 activity, the effects of expression of p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 on p126 signaling were examined. As expected, co-transfection of COS-7 with either p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 cDNAs did not interfere with the ability of p126 to activate ERK2 (Fig. 10). Consistent with our above findings, these data support the conclusion that the COOH-terminal tail of p70, residues 489–609, contains elements that are critical for the negative regulatory function. Two deletions of the ST5 COOH terminus, a region shared in common by the three mRNA species derived from this gene, were studied for their ability to activate MAP kinase, inhibit the signaling activity of ST5 p126, and to transform NIH3T3 cells. The deletion end points were chosen so that one would lie upstream (p70-ΔC2) and the other downstream (p70-ΔC1) of the GEF homology domain. Both mutants were found to function similarly, although p70-ΔC2 appeared to be more potent at transforming NIH3T3 cells and promoting anchorage-independent growth. The results demonstrate that the COOH terminus of p70 plays a critical role in the ability of this protein to induce morphologic changes and to inhibit signaling through the RAS-MAP kinase pathway. In NIH3T3 cells, deletion of the COOH-terminal tail, residues 489–609, resulted in major changes in the activity of the protein. Whereas the full-length protein did not alter morphology in 3T3 cells, expression of the truncated p70 proteins, p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2, resulted in morphological transformation. In addition, cells transfected with either of these mutants reached a saturation density 2–4-fold greater than that of control cells. In soft agar growth assays, p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 transfected cells formed colonies, while control or p70 wild-type transfectants did not (Fig. 4), indicating that both mutants can induce anchorage-independent growth, one of the most fundamental differences between transformed and normal cells (20.Cluck V. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ben-Zeev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7039-7043Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At the biochemical level, we found that in COS-7 cells deletion of the COOH-terminal tail of p70 converts the protein from an inhibitor of signaling to one that constitutively activates ERK2 (Fig. 5). Analysis of downstream effectors leading to the activation of ERK2 revealed a strong synergy between p70-ΔC1 or p70-ΔC2 mutants and activated mutants of RAS and MEK in the stimulation of ERK2 (Figs. 6 and 8). This activity of the two p70 mutants was completely abrogated when either of the dominant negative mutants RAS17N or MEKAA was expressed (Figs. 7and 9), suggesting that the p70-ΔC1 and p70-ΔC2 mutants function upstream of RAS. Several observations suggested that the p70-ΔC2 mutant possesses a more potent transforming activity than p70-ΔC1. In comparison with the p70-ΔC1 expressors, the p70-ΔC2 expressing clones grew to a higher saturation density, demonstrated a higher cloning efficiency in soft agar, and formed larger colonies. One possible explanation for these results is that quantitative differences in expression levels of the truncated proteins may be responsible for the different phenotypes observed. However, on Western blots of stable transfectants, the p70-ΔC2 protein was generally expressed at levels similar to those observed with p70-ΔC1, as illustrated in Fig. 3. A second possibility is that the greater apparent potency of p70-ΔC2 could reflect the complete loss of a binding site, only partly lost in p70-ΔC1, for a ligand critical for the negative regulatory properties of this protein. The present results do not resolve the question of how precisely p70 signals to regulate the RAS-ERK2 pathway. However, it is clear that the COOH-terminal tail interferes with the ability to constitutively activate this pathway. These findings suggest that this COOH-terminal region might participate in macromolecular complex formation with other proteins, therefore blocking the stimulating effect of the p70 protein. One interaction currently being investigated is the possibility of heterodimer formation with another ST5 isoform, such as p126. We have noted that on Western blots with the ST5 antibody, clones stably expressing one of the p70 mutant proteins often overexpress a protein consistent in size with p126. Therefore it is possible that the transforming activity that we have observed results in part from the stabilization of endogenous ST5 p126. The region between the two deletion end points examined in this study contains a segment of homology to GEFs for the Rab3 family of small GTP binding proteins. The presence of this domain raises the possibility that the ST5 proteins may function as GEFs in a manner analogous to that of other proteins with this activity, including Sos, Dbl, ARNO, and GRF/mCDC25 (21.Cheadle C.

It is interesting to note that many of the GEF proteins were discovered by virtue of their ability to transform NIH3T3 cells when overexpressed or when activated by truncation (25.Cox A.D. Garcia A.

The results with the deletion mutants revealed unexpected constitutive activation of the RAS-ERK2 pathway. A search of GenBankTMwith the COOH-terminal sequence downstream of the GEF homology region revealed no informative homologies and no recognizable protein motifs. However, we note that this deletion resulted in placing the sequence CVIS near the COOH terminus. This sequence is a CAAX motif (where C indicates a cysteine, A an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). This motif is present at the COOH terminus of RAS proteins, where it signals RAS to undergo a series of posttranslational modifications including truncation, farnesylation, and carboxymethylation (26.James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.McGuire F.T. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Sun J. Marlowe T. Corey S.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These modifications are required for RAS proteins to become associated with plasma membrane. It is possible that the CAAX motif near the COOH terminus of the p70-ΔC2 mutant serves as a membrane localization signal that permits the truncated protein to interact with effectors that the wild-type p70 would not normally contact due to its cytoplasmic localization. This motif is present in p70-ΔC1 but lies further from the COOH terminus of the protein, possibly accounting for the difference in potency of the two mutants in the transfection assays. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis. The results presented demonstrate that the COOH-terminal tail of the p70 protein contains elements that are critical to the negative regulatory role of this protein in signal transduction pathways as well as in the regulation of cell growth and morphology. Further studies will be aimed at obtaining additional information regarding the mechanisms by which ST5 proteins regulate signaling pathways and the transformed phenotype.

Limited self-proteolysis (cis-cleavage) seems to be restricted to active β subunits as follows: β subunit of Thermoplasma; Pre3/β1, Pup1/β2, and Pre2/β5 of yeast; δ/Y, Z, and X/MB1 (and the exchangeable γ-interferon inducible subunits LMP2, MECL1, and LMP7) of mammals. The non-active subunits in yeast (Pre4/β7, Pre1/β4, Pup3/β3, and Prs3/β6), as shown for Pre4/β7 (11.Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol.

Similar studies with the yeast 20 S proteasome have demonstrated that processing of pro-Pre2p/β5 (pro-Doa3) occurs when two half-proteasome precursors associate, triggering the autocatalytic removal of the propeptides and final maturation of active sites (10.Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).

Ump1p, a short-lived chaperone, has recently been shown to be required for the correct maturation of the yeast 20 S proteasome, and the propeptide of Pre2p is required for the function of Ump1p in proteasome maturation (16.Ramos P.C.

Complete pre-proteasomes (13 S, 15 S) have been postulated to be “half-proteasomes” composed of a full α ring and a full pro-β ring with a molecular mass of 300 kDa, although not all the β subunits may be present in those intermediates (15.Nandi D. Jiang H. Monaco J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). A similar half-proteasome intermediate is also found in yeast (16.Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A.

The fast dimerization of half-proteasomes together with the autocatalytic processing of the pro-β subunits will result in the formation of mature active proteasomes (15.Nandi D. Jiang H. Monaco J.J.

As a consequence the assembly and processing of the constitutive β subunits have been studied indirectly.The C5 component of the proteasome belongs to the β-type subunit family and has been cloned from yeast (19.Lee D.H.

A. 1993; 90: 8842-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the initial report on C5 cDNA isolation from rat (21.Tamura T. Tanaka K. Kumatori A. Yamada F. Tsurumi C. Fujiwara T. Ichihara A. Tokunaga F. Aruga R. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was suggested that an NH2-terminal proteolytic processing had taken place in the C5 subunit for its incorporation into mature proteasomes. In the current work, we characterize the processing and assembly of the C5 subunit in mammalian systems by using C5 subunit-specific antibodies. These antibodies immunoprecipitate the C5 precursor (25 kDa) but not the native 20 S proteasome complex that contains the mature C5 (23 kDa). The C5 precursor remains free in the cell, and its conversion to the 23-kDa polypeptide occurs concomitantly with its incorporation into 15 S proteasome intermediate and 20 S mature proteasomes.DISCUSSIONMammalian proteasomes are composed of seven different α subunits and seven different β subunits that have to be assembled into an ordered structure with the configuration α7β7β7α7 (1.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6772) Google Scholar). Proteasome subunits are synthesized as independent polypeptides encoded by different mRNAs, and initially they should behave as free non-assembled subunits in the cell. α subunits of the mature proteasome complex seem to have the same amino acid sequence as their primary translation product, whereas most of the β subunits are synthesized as precursors (pro-β subunits) that subsequently undergo proteolytic processing in their NH2 terminus (5.Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The steady state levels of free α and β subunits in the cell seem too low to be detected by conventional analysis (gradient sedimentation or gel filtration followed by immunoblot of the corresponding fractions). Yang et al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated the presence of free non-assembled subunit C9 in RMA cells after a radioactive pulse for 30 min. We have data (not shown) that demonstrate the presence of free non-assembled subunit C2 and C9 after a 30-min pulse in NRK, CHO, and HeLa cells. With regard to the pro-β subunits, Yang et al.(17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) mentioned the detection of free pro-LMP2, and Thomson and Rivett (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed the presence of free pro-N3. We have shown here the presence of free pro-C5. Therefore, from direct analysis of cells pulse-labeled for a short period with anti-α- and anti-β subunit-specific antibodies, we can draw a tentative conclusion that all newly synthesized α and pro-β subunits are initially free non-assembled subunits.The half-lives of proteasomes are between 8 and 16 days in liver (30.Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,31.Cuervo A.M. Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Knecht E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), 2 days in H6 cells (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 5 days in HeLa cells (32.Hendil K.B. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 471-477PubMed Google Scholar). This long half-life of proteasomes (longer than the doubling time of cells in culture) implies that after a radioactive pulse, labeled subunits once incorporated into mature proteasomes would persist for long periods, just the opposite of what is usually obtained for most cell proteins in pulse-chase experiments. Therefore, a critical issue is whether synthesized subunits (labeled subunits after a short pulse) also have a long half-life like the mature proteasomes or shorter, because free subunits or proteasome intermediates are degraded. We have measured (densitometric scanning of autoradiograms) the radioactivity incorporated into single subunits and proteasome complexes during pulse-chase experiments in NRK and CHO cells. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into α subunits C2, C8, and C9 (data not shown) and into β subunit C5 (see Figs. 4 and 6) remained constant after the pulse and for the next 24 h of chase. To study the fate of proteasome intermediates, we used anti-proteasome antibodies that recognize both intermediate and mature proteasomes and anti-C8 antibodies that only recognize proteasome intermediates. The total amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated by the anti-proteasome antibodies increases during the chase, up to 5-fold with respect to the amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated just after the pulse (Fig.4 B) and then remained constant up to 24 h of chase (Fig. 6). The anti-C8 antibodies immunoprecipitated a set of polypeptides just after the radioactive pulse, and the total amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated increases at the beginning of the chase (up to 1.4-fold) and then starts to decrease, disappearing completely after 24 h of chase (Fig. 6). These results are in perfect agreement with a cell situation in which the rate of degradation of newly synthesized subunits and proteasome intermediates is not very extensive together with a very efficient incorporation of labeled subunits into mature long-lived proteasomes. This efficiency is specifically demonstrated by the data presented for subunit C5. The conversion of pro-C5 to the processed C5 is close to 100% (see Fig. 4,A and B), during the chase we observed a 5-fold decrease in pro-C5 and a 5-fold increase in the processed C5 subunit. Moreover, all the processed C5 subunit is finally incorporated into 20 S mature proteasomes (Fig. 5) with a long half-life (≥24 h, Fig.6). A similar situation can be deduced from the data published with RMA cells by Yang et al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), using anti-C9 antibodies that recognize both proteasome intermediates and mature proteasomes, and by Frentzel et al. (12.Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with antibodies to mature proteasomes that also recognize proteasome intermediates. Our results also indicate that the level of pre-formed proteasome intermediates in the cell lines used in this study is low. This situation (highly efficient incorporation of subunits into mature long-lived proteasomes and low levels of proteasome intermediates) may not be applicable to all cell lines, as demonstrated for H6 cells (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) where proteasome intermediates are only 3–4-fold less abundant than mature proteasomes, and labeled subunits are not very efficiently incorporated into mature proteasomes.Regarding the incorporation of C5 subunit into proteasome complexes (intermediate and mature proteasomes), the current model of proteasome assembly postulates the existence of a half-proteasome, an intermediate containing a ring of 7 α subunits, and a ring of 7 pro-β subunits. What is the evidence supporting the presence of pro-C5 in such a half-proteasome intermediate? Nandi et al. (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) show in their Fig. 3 that the amount of pre-C5 (labeled p1) after a pulse of 45 min is very low both in the anti-C8 and anti-proteasome immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the mature C5 is already present in the anti-proteasome immunoprecipitate (labeled as 1) just after the radioactive pulse, and its amount increases during the chase (around 2-fold). Their interpretation of these results (the same explanation is given for N3/β7 and X/MB1/β5) is that the pro-C5 subunit remains for a short time in proteasome precursors. In the study of Yanget al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) some pro-C5 is present in their anti-C9 immunoprecipitates after pulse (their Fig. 3D), but its amount is very low compared with the amount of processed C5 subunit present after 2 h of chase (their Fig. 3B). The direct interpretation of those data is that most of the C5 subunit present in a complex is a processed C5 subunit; however, with the experiments presented no conclusion can be reached about the status of the pro-C5. The data we have presented conclusively demonstrate that most of the pro-C5 subunit is free and non-assembled, as demonstrated by its direct immunoprecipitation after a pulse (Fig. 4), by its native molecular weight judged by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 5), and by the preclearing experiments with anti-proteasome, anti-C8, and anti-C9 antibodies (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 23-kDa processed subunit C5 seems to be incorporated into a complex, immunoprecipitated by the anti-proteasome, anti-C8, and anti-C9 antibodies and only immunoprecipitated by the anti-C5 antibodies under denaturing conditions (Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 6). The lack of incorporation of pro-C5 into any complex when proteasome activity is inhibited (Fig. 7) suggests that the entrance of pro-C5 into a complex is tightly couple with its processing. A similar situation has been described for pre-N3/β7 (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In conclusion, although a half-proteasome intermediate in proteasome assembly may finally prove to be a correct model, the data presented here for the C5 subunit and previous studies with the N3 subunit (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) strongly challenge the validity of that model as postulated. The C5 and N3 subunits may constitute exceptions, but more exceptions can be found reviewing published data, i.e. the pro-Z subunit, that after a pulse can be found in complexes sedimenting at 15 S and 20 S, see Fig. 4 of Rodriguez and Castaño (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 2S. Rodriguez-Vilariño and J. G. Castaño, unpublished data. Clearly more work is needed to delineate the pathway of assembly of the eukaryotic proteasome (36.Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is the enzyme responsible for most non-lysosomal protein degradation in eukaryotes, and structural homologues are present in archeons and eubacteria (1.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6772) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the proteasome is a hollow cylinder composed of four heptameric rings in the configuration α7β7β7α7. The crystal structure of the Thermoplasma and yeast 20 S proteasomes (3.Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 4.Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) implies the hydroxyl group of the NH2-terminal threonine residue of the 7 identical β subunits of theThermoplasma and 3 of the 7 distinct β subunits of yeast proteasome are responsible for catalyzing peptide bond hydrolysis. These catalytic sites are located on the inner surface of a central chamber formed by the two inner β subunit rings. Most of the β subunits are synthesized as precursors containing a propeptide that is cleaved off by cis- and trans-autocatalysis yielding the mature NH2 terminus (5.Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Processing has been observed in Thermoplasma (6.Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct.

Limited self-proteolysis (cis-cleavage) seems to be restricted to active β subunits as follows: β subunit of Thermoplasma; Pre3/β1, Pup1/β2, and Pre2/β5 of yeast; δ/Y, Z, and X/MB1 (and the exchangeable γ-interferon inducible subunits LMP2, MECL1, and LMP7) of mammals.

The assembly of the Thermoplasma proteasome has been elucidated (6.Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The precursor β peptide is dispensable and does not play any role in the assembly nor does its length or sequence, except for the glycine at −1 position, affect the processing (7.Seemuller E.

The C5 component of the proteasome belongs to the β-type subunit family and has been cloned from yeast (19.Lee D.H. Tanaka K. Tamura T. Chung C.H. Ichihara A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1993; 90: 8842-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the initial report on C5 cDNA isolation from rat (21.Tamura T. Tanaka K. Kumatori A. Yamada F. Tsurumi C. Fujiwara T. Ichihara A. Tokunaga F. Aruga R. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was suggested that an NH2-terminal proteolytic processing had taken place in the C5 subunit for its incorporation into mature proteasomes. In the current work, we characterize the processing and assembly of the C5 subunit in mammalian systems by using C5 subunit-specific antibodies. These antibodies immunoprecipitate the C5 precursor (25 kDa) but not the native 20 S proteasome complex that contains the mature C5 (23 kDa). The C5 precursor remains free in the cell, and its conversion to the 23-kDa polypeptide occurs concomitantly with its incorporation into 15 S proteasome intermediate and 20 S mature proteasomes. DISCUSSIONMammalian proteasomes are composed of seven different α subunits and seven different β subunits that have to be assembled into an ordered structure with the configuration α7β7β7α7 (1.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6772) Google Scholar). Proteasome subunits are synthesized as independent polypeptides encoded by different mRNAs, and initially they should behave as free non-assembled subunits in the cell. α subunits of the mature proteasome complex seem to have the same amino acid sequence as their primary translation product, whereas most of the β subunits are synthesized as precursors (pro-β subunits) that subsequently undergo proteolytic processing in their NH2 terminus (5.Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The steady state levels of free α and β subunits in the cell seem too low to be detected by conventional analysis (gradient sedimentation or gel filtration followed by immunoblot of the corresponding fractions). Yang et al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated the presence of free non-assembled subunit C9 in RMA cells after a radioactive pulse for 30 min. We have data (not shown) that demonstrate the presence of free non-assembled subunit C2 and C9 after a 30-min pulse in NRK, CHO, and HeLa cells. With regard to the pro-β subunits, Yang et al.(17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) mentioned the detection of free pro-LMP2, and Thomson and Rivett (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed the presence of free pro-N3. We have shown here the presence of free pro-C5. Therefore, from direct analysis of cells pulse-labeled for a short period with anti-α- and anti-β subunit-specific antibodies, we can draw a tentative conclusion that all newly synthesized α and pro-β subunits are initially free non-assembled subunits.The half-lives of proteasomes are between 8 and 16 days in liver (30.Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,31.Cuervo A.M. Palmer A. Rivett A.J. Knecht E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), 2 days in H6 cells (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 5 days in HeLa cells (32.Hendil K.B. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 471-477PubMed Google Scholar). This long half-life of proteasomes (longer than the doubling time of cells in culture) implies that after a radioactive pulse, labeled subunits once incorporated into mature proteasomes would persist for long periods, just the opposite of what is usually obtained for most cell proteins in pulse-chase experiments. Therefore, a critical issue is whether synthesized subunits (labeled subunits after a short pulse) also have a long half-life like the mature proteasomes or shorter, because free subunits or proteasome intermediates are degraded. We have measured (densitometric scanning of autoradiograms) the radioactivity incorporated into single subunits and proteasome complexes during pulse-chase experiments in NRK and CHO cells. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into α subunits C2, C8, and C9 (data not shown) and into β subunit C5 (see Figs. 4 and 6) remained constant after the pulse and for the next 24 h of chase. To study the fate of proteasome intermediates, we used anti-proteasome antibodies that recognize both intermediate and mature proteasomes and anti-C8 antibodies that only recognize proteasome intermediates. The total amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated by the anti-proteasome antibodies increases during the chase, up to 5-fold with respect to the amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated just after the pulse (Fig.4 B) and then remained constant up to 24 h of chase (Fig. 6). The anti-C8 antibodies immunoprecipitated a set of polypeptides just after the radioactive pulse, and the total amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated increases at the beginning of the chase (up to 1.4-fold) and then starts to decrease, disappearing completely after 24 h of chase (Fig. 6). These results are in perfect agreement with a cell situation in which the rate of degradation of newly synthesized subunits and proteasome intermediates is not very extensive together with a very efficient incorporation of labeled subunits into mature long-lived proteasomes. This efficiency is specifically demonstrated by the data presented for subunit C5. The conversion of pro-C5 to the processed C5 is close to 100% (see Fig. 4,A and B), during the chase we observed a 5-fold decrease in pro-C5 and a 5-fold increase in the processed C5 subunit. Moreover, all the processed C5 subunit is finally incorporated into 20 S mature proteasomes (Fig. 5) with a long half-life (≥24 h, Fig.6). A similar situation can be deduced from the data published with RMA cells by Yang et al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), using anti-C9 antibodies that recognize both proteasome intermediates and mature proteasomes, and by Frentzel et al. (12.Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with antibodies to mature proteasomes that also recognize proteasome intermediates. Our results also indicate that the level of pre-formed proteasome intermediates in the cell lines used in this study is low. This situation (highly efficient incorporation of subunits into mature long-lived proteasomes and low levels of proteasome intermediates) may not be applicable to all cell lines, as demonstrated for H6 cells (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) where proteasome intermediates are only 3–4-fold less abundant than mature proteasomes, and labeled subunits are not very efficiently incorporated into mature proteasomes.Regarding the incorporation of C5 subunit into proteasome complexes (intermediate and mature proteasomes), the current model of proteasome assembly postulates the existence of a half-proteasome, an intermediate containing a ring of 7 α subunits, and a ring of 7 pro-β subunits. What is the evidence supporting the presence of pro-C5 in such a half-proteasome intermediate? Nandi et al. (29.Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) show in their Fig. 3 that the amount of pre-C5 (labeled p1) after a pulse of 45 min is very low both in the anti-C8 and anti-proteasome immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the mature C5 is already present in the anti-proteasome immunoprecipitate (labeled as 1) just after the radioactive pulse, and its amount increases during the chase (around 2-fold). Their interpretation of these results (the same explanation is given for N3/β7 and X/MB1/β5) is that the pro-C5 subunit remains for a short time in proteasome precursors. In the study of Yanget al. (17.Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) some pro-C5 is present in their anti-C9 immunoprecipitates after pulse (their Fig. 3D), but its amount is very low compared with the amount of processed C5 subunit present after 2 h of chase (their Fig. 3B). The direct interpretation of those data is that most of the C5 subunit present in a complex is a processed C5 subunit; however, with the experiments presented no conclusion can be reached about the status of the pro-C5. The data we have presented conclusively demonstrate that most of the pro-C5 subunit is free and non-assembled, as demonstrated by its direct immunoprecipitation after a pulse (Fig. 4), by its native molecular weight judged by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 5), and by the preclearing experiments with anti-proteasome, anti-C8, and anti-C9 antibodies (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 23-kDa processed subunit C5 seems to be incorporated into a complex, immunoprecipitated by the anti-proteasome, anti-C8, and anti-C9 antibodies and only immunoprecipitated by the anti-C5 antibodies under denaturing conditions (Figs. 1, 4, 5, and 6). The lack of incorporation of pro-C5 into any complex when proteasome activity is inhibited (Fig. 7) suggests that the entrance of pro-C5 into a complex is tightly couple with its processing. A similar situation has been described for pre-N3/β7 (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In conclusion, although a half-proteasome intermediate in proteasome assembly may finally prove to be a correct model, the data presented here for the C5 subunit and previous studies with the N3 subunit (13.Thomson S. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) strongly challenge the validity of that model as postulated. The C5 and N3 subunits may constitute exceptions, but more exceptions can be found reviewing published data, i.e. the pro-Z subunit, that after a pulse can be found in complexes sedimenting at 15 S and 20 S, see Fig. 4 of Rodriguez and Castaño (17.Yang Y.

There are now four members of the erbB gene family: erbB1, erbB2, erbB3, anderbB4 (8.Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 9.Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). They are all located at the cell surface and function as growth factor-activated membrane tyrosine kinase receptors (9.Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Many ligands for the erbB family have been identified including epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, heregulin, neu differentiation factors, amphiregulin, and the expanding family of neuregulins (10.Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 11.Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Despite intense efforts over the years, no direct ligand for the erbB2 protein has been found, and its very existence has recently been questioned (13.Klapper L.H. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4995-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, erbB2 appears to play a central role in the signal transduction pathway for other family members, as it is a preferred dimerization partner (13.Klapper L.H. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4995-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 14.Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). HER2 is one of the most commonly altered proto-oncogenes in human cancers (9.Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 16.Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17.Bacus S.S. Zelnick C.R. Plowman G. Yarden Y. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 102: S13-S24PubMed Google Scholar) and almost always involves amplification and overexpression. Recent studies have suggested that certain subtle deletions of the erbB2 gene product might accompany overexpression (18.Siegal P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), resulting in an activation of its signal transduction pathway. As many as 20–30% of human breast and ovarian cancers are found to exhibit HER2 gene amplification or overexpression (19, 20, and reviewed in Ref. 16.Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which correlates with reduced survival (19.Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar, 20.Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar). A correlation between tumor erbB2status and resistance to therapy has also been demonstrated (16.Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21.Yu D. Liu B. Tan M. Li J. Wang S.-S. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1359-1365PubMed Google Scholar), although others have suggested that this effect might be cell line- or tumor-specific (22.Pegram M.D. Finn R.S. Arzoo K. Beryt M. Pietras R.J. Slamon D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It has been clearly demonstrated that overexpression of erbB2 causes cell transformation (23.Di Fiore P.P.

Biol. 1991; 11: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), adenoviral E1A (30.Yu D. Suen T.-C. Yan D.-H. Chang L.-S. Hung M.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4499-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), SV40 large T antigen (31.Matin A. Hung M.-C. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1051-1056PubMed Google Scholar), and Rb (32.Matin A. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1333-1339PubMed Google Scholar), were found to suppressneu gene expression through the neu gene promoter (33.Hung M.-C. Matin A. Zhang Y. Xing X. Sorgi F. Huang L. Yu D. Gene. 1995; 159: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanisms of how these genes suppressneu are not well understood, the E1A gene has now proceeded to early clinical testing in breast cancer patients with tumors overexpressing HER2 (34.Ueno N.T., Yu, D. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35.Deng J. Xia W. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, E1A and the other genes as mentioned above, are known to participate in a wide spectrum of important cellular processes and are likely to have undesired effects if given clinically. Thus, a more specific repressor of neugene transcription would be most desirable. We report here the sequence of a 1-kb1 DNA fragment, located upstream to the proximal 500-bp neu gene promoter (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which possesses such repressor activity. Subcloning different fragments from this 1-kb DNA into reporter gene constructs, using successive deletions from the 5′-end, and analyzing in an heterologous promoter allowed us to narrow the repressor activity to a 148-bp fragment. Detailed functional analyses and protein binding electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) correlated protein binding activity to a 120-bp NlaIV-MslI fragment, with transcriptional repressor activity detected in various cell lines. Interestingly, the immediate 3′ 28-bp MslI-RsaI fragment was able to function as a transcriptional activator in a colon carcinoma cell line. The functional stimulatory effect of this 28-bp fragment correlated with the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes, detectable only with nuclear extract isolated from the same colon carcinoma cell line. As HER2 gene overexpression has been demonstrated in colon cancer, this cis-acting activator element and its interacting proteins might play a role in colon cancer. The characterization and localization of the repressor element provides a good starting point for subsequent isolation of the interacting protein(s). In the future, it may be possible to use such proteins as anti-cancer therapy in patients with tumors that overexpressHER2. Restriction enzymes and other DNA modifying enzymes including Klenow fragment, T4 polymerase, T4 ligase, and calf intestinal phosphatase were purchased from Life Technologies Inc., New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All isotopes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemicals used for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were the products of Eastman Kodak Co. Cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. The plasmid pBluescript(IIKS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for general subcloning purposes. pMT.IC3 is a plasmid containing multiple cloning sites that was placed upstream of the CAT gene (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most of the neu promoter DNA restriction fragments were cloned into pBluescript(IIKS) and were then shuffled into the matching unique restriction sites on the polylinker of pMT.IC3. DNA fragments were blunt-ended with Klenow fragment or T4 polymerase when no appropriate restriction enzymes could be used for directional cloning. The pNeuEcoRVCAT construct containing the proximal 500-bpneu gene promoter linked to the CAT gene has been previously described (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a reporter for analyzing the effects of various subcloned DNA fragments on the transcriptional activity of the native neu gene promoter. The plasmid pBLCAT2 (37.Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked upstream to the CAT gene, was used for analyzing the effects of various subcloned fragments on the transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter. Successive deletions from the 5′-end of neu promoter were generated with appropriate restriction enzyme sites. pCMVβ (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), a plasmid that contains the lacZ gene driven by the cytomegalovirus enhancer (38.MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), was used for monitoring transfection efficiency. Detailed methodology with respect to the construction and maps of all plasmids used in this study will be distributed along with the materials upon request. Oligonucleotides, obtained from the Hospital for Sick Children Biotechnology Center, Toronto, Ontario, were as follows: Sequencing primer, Neu-438 (5′-CCCGTCTTTGCAGCTCCGG-3′), Neu-625 (5′-CCAGCCTGATCTTAGAGGAACC-3′), Neu-900 (5′-GCAAGTGCAGTGCATGTTCTG-3′), Neu-1100 (5′-GCAGGAGACATGTTTACACGG-3′), Neu-1421 (5′-CCTGAGTTCATATCTTCACTC-3′), pMTIC3 (5′-TAGGCGTATCACGAGGCCC-3′), and pBluescript(IIKS) (the reverse primer or universal primer (Stratagene) was used). The T7 polymerase sequencing kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded plasmids with [α-35S]dATP or [α-35S]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed according to the manufacturer. A primer (neu-438) complementary to the 5′-end of the proximal neu gene promoter was synthesized and used in sequencing the plasmid pNeuXbaICAT (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). New primer, close to the upstream end of each sequence obtained, was synthesized and used in another round of sequencing of pNeuXbaICAT. Successive rounds of primer synthesis and sequencing produced overlapping sequence information in a 3′ to 5′ direction with respect to the neu gene promoter. The complete 1-kb DNA sequence was also confirmed when deletion mutants and individual subcloned fragments were sequenced. Several cell lines that represent different tissues of origin were used in this study and are all available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). This includes a Chinese hamster ovary cell line; HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line; Caco2, a human colon carcinoma cell line; MCF7 and MDA-MB453, human mammary carcinoma cell lines; and C2C12, a mouse myoblast cell line. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium (Life Technologies Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kept in a humidified, 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator. A calcium phosphate precipitation method (39.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) was used for transfection as modified and described previously (29.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were split at a predetermined ratio into 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) the day before transfection. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 μg of pCMVβ and 10 μg of a CAT reporter DNA were co-precipitated in the buffer at room temperature for 25 min before they were added directly to the cells. Precipitate was incubated with the cells for 16–20 h, after which the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, re-fed with fresh medium, and returned to the 37 °C incubator. Cells were washed and harvested after 20–24 h, and the freeze/thaw/vortex cycle method was used to lyse the cells. One-fifth of the cell lysate was used for the β-galactosidase assay usingO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate, and the results were used to adjust the amount of lysate for the CAT assay. The TLC method of CAT assays was performed as described previously (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except that the standard [14C]chloramphenicol was replaced with 1-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]deoxychloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (40.Suen T.-C. Goss P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31297-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The single acetylated product improves the quantitative aspect of the assays. EMSAs were performed as described previously (40.Suen T.-C. Goss P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31297-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract was isolated from the different cell lines by the Dignam method (41.Dignam J.D. Leibovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments were isolated by digesting a plasmid subclone with appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP (depending on the restriction site) by a Klenow fragment. A final volume of 30 μl of reaction mixture was prepared in the order of H2O, 10× binding buffer (1×: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol), 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of nuclear extract, an appropriate amount of unlabeled competitor if desired, and last, 20,000 cpm of probe. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 25 min, after which it was loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried under vacuum in a gel dryer and exposed to a Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C. The relative position of the 1-kb XbaI -EcoRV repressor fragment in relation to the transcription start sites of neu is shown at the top of Fig. 1. As described previously, the nucleotide A at the translation start site (ATG) ofneu gene was assigned +1, and nucleotides upstream of +1 were assigned negative numbers (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Complete sequencing revealed a 1,046-bp DNA fragment. Multiple E-boxes (CANNTG, marked bystippled boxes underneath the nucleotides), representing canonical binding sites for the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors (42.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), were found. Two GT boxes (GGGTGG, on the opposite strand, marked by striped boxes above the sequences), which represent consensus recognition sequences for the Sp1 family of transcription factors (43.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), were observed. Numerous TC-rich (or GA-rich on the opposite strand) sequences of various lengths (marked by open boxes beneath the nucleotides), which are potential binding sites for the Sp1 (43.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and ets (44.Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) family of transcription factors, were detected throughout the 1-kb fragment. An A-rich (35 out of 45 nucleotides) sequence could be detected between −715 and −759. Extensive discussion of consensus transcription factor binding sites is not meaningful unless functional relevance is demonstrated. Our discussion will therefore be limited to several sites that were located within the minimized functional repressor element as noted in a later section. It has been shown previously that the sequence between the XbaI (−1543) and EcoRV (−502) sites contains a transcriptional repressor element (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Before the sequence information was obtained, blunt end restriction fragments from the 1-kb DNA were randomly cloned upstream of the proximal neu gene promoter-CAT reporter construct, pNeuEcoRVCAT (36.Suen T.-C. Hung M.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6305-6315Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their activities were compared with that of pNeuEcoRVCAT (assigned an activity of 100 as a reference) (Fig. 2 A). A 600-bp AluI-AluI fragment (construct pNeu(AA2)EcoRVCAT) was found to lower CAT activity by 3-fold, whereas another smaller AluI-AluI fragment (pNeu(AA1)EcoRVCAT) did not alter CAT activity significantly. Repressor activity could be further localized to a 215-bp AluI-RsaI fragment (constructs pNeu(ARV)EcoRVCAT and pNeu(ARs)EcoRVCAT). These fragments, which showed repressor activity, were sequenced, and their positions were mapped when the completeXbaI-EcoRV sequence was obtained. However, during the analysis of the random fragments from the 1-kb repressor, a 106-bpAluI-EcoRV fragment (located between −705 and −600, the closed box at bottom of Fig. 2 A) was not tested. To confirm if repressor function could be mapped to the same (AluI-RsaI) region as in Fig. 2 A, a series of deletions from the 5′-end were generated (Fig.2 B). The activities of these deletion constructs were evaluated in two more cell lines, HeLa and C2C12 as shown. Consistent with the data from the random subcloned fragments, the pNeu5′AluICAT and pNeuAccICAT were both 3–5-fold less active than the pNeuEcoRVCAT in both cell lines. The transcriptional activity gradually increased with further deletion to the HaeIII and SphI sites. The 2- to 2.5-fold lower activity of pNeu3′AluICAT and pNeuNdeICAT, when compared with pNeuEcoRVCAT, was observed only in C2C12 cells. These data suggested that repressor activity could be found between the AluI and SphI sites, which encompasses the 215-bp AluI-RsaI fragment as seen in the random subcloning experiments. An interesting feature of the 215-bpAluI-RsaI fragment is the existence of numerous pairs of direct or inverted repeats (Fig.3 A, shown as arrowsabove or below sequences with numbers, indicating the matching pair of repeats). Two GT boxes (GGGTGG), representing the consensus binding sites for the Sp1 family (43.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), could be found on the bottom strand at −1321 and −1307 (striped boxes above nucleotides). An E-box (CANNTG), which represents a consensus binding site for the family of helix-loop-helix proteins (42.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), is found at −1268 (astippled box below nucleotides). Various restriction fragments within the 215-bpAluI-RsaI region (shown schematically in Fig.3 B) were isolated and subcloned upstream of the pNeuEcoRVCAT construct. Only results from C2C12 are shown (TableI, column 1), since HeLa cells gave similar results as observed in the previous experiments (Fig.2 A). The 5′-most 67-bp (AluI-NlaIV, insert 2) fragment appeared to be dispensable for repressor activity, since it did not alter the activity of the proximal promoter (pNeuEcoRVCAT, which was set as 100). The 3′ 148-bpNlaIV-RsaI fragment (insert 4) in contrast was able to suppress the activity of pNeuEcoRVCAT activity by 5-fold, which was stronger than the 3-fold suppression conferred by the complete 215-bp AluI-RsaI fragment (insert1). The 3′ 84-bp HaeIII-RsaI (insert6) fragment was not effective in suppressing transcriptional activity of the pNeuEcoRVCAT. These data suggested that the 64-bpNlaIV-HaeIII (insert 5) fragment was responsible for repressor activity. However, when this 64-bp fragment (insert 5) was analyzed in the same way, the repressor activity was 2-fold weaker than the NlaIV-RsaI (insert 4) fragment. The addition of sequences to theNlaIV-HaeIII fragment (insert 5) from the 5′ end (AluI-HaeIII, insert 3) also increased its repressor activity. Therefore, although theNlaIV-HaeIII (insert 5) fragment was able to suppress the neu gene promoter by 2.5-fold, addition of sequences from either the 5′ or the 3′-end resulted in an enhancement of repressor activity. It is interesting that neither the 5′ AluI-NlaIV (insert 2) nor the 3′HaeIII-RsaI (insert 6) fragments alone contain appreciable repressor activity. These results suggested that possible interactions among the fragments may contribute to the overall repressor activity. This is consistent with the progressive loss of repressive activity being observed with successive 5′ deletions from the AluI site to the SphI site in Fig.2 B.Table IEffect of various fragments within the 215-bp AluI-RsaI DNA on the transcriptional activity of the neu and TK promotersRowInsertNeuEcoRV CAT (C2C12 cells)TK-CATC2C12 cellsCaco2 cells1AluI-RsaI37452992AluI-NlaIV10057893AluI-HaeIIII2667934NlaIV-RsaI19331135NlaIV-HaeIII42601156HaeIII-RsaI7477336Rows 1–6 indicate the correspondingly numbered fragments as drawn in Fig 3 B.

The activity of the parental construct is always assigned as 100. No cross-comparison of the activities should be made with respect to cell lines or parental reporters. To confirm repressor activity and to test its functionality in the context of a heterologous promoter, the individual fragments (Fig. 3 B, inserts 1–6) were cloned upstream of the TK promoter. A colon carcinoma cell line, Caco2, was also examined in these experiments to provide stronger evidence for the functional activity and test whether the observed activity was tissue-specific. As seen with the native neu gene promoter, the NlaIV-RsaI fragment (insert 4) was able to suppress the TK promoter (activity was assigned 100 as a reference) by 3-fold in the C2C12 cells (Table I, column 2), thereby confirming its function as a repressor element. All the other fragments except the entire 215-bp (insert 1, a 2.5-fold suppression) were not very effective in suppressing the TK promoter. Most interestingly, the 215-bp AluI-RsaI fragment (insert 1), although able to suppress both neuand the TK promoter in C2C12 cells, was found to have the opposite effect, i.e. transcription activation, in the Caco2 cells. This 3-fold transcriptional stimulatory effect could be mapped to the 3′ 84-bp HaeIII-RsaI (insert 6) fragment. Thus, the suppressive effect of theNlaIV-RsaI (insert 4) fragment (on either the neu or TK promoter in C2C12"
