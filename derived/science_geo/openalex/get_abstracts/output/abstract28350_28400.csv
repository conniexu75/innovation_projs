https://openalex.org/W2021218223,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) acts as a growth inhibitor, yet it can stimulate proliferation; 1-2 fg/cell of TGF-beta 1 elicits maximal proliferation of dense and sparse cultured smooth muscle cells (SMCs), whereas higher amounts are less stimulatory. This bimodal response is not limited to SMCs, as TGF-beta induces a similar response in human fibroblasts and chondrocytes. The amount of TGF-beta 1 per cell that induces maximal proliferation is identical for dense and sparse SMCs. At low concentrations of TGF-beta, there is a 10-12 hr delay in DNA synthesis compared with that elicited by PDGF. PDGF-AA is detected in the culture medium at 24 hr, and anti-PDGF IgG blocks DNA synthesis. At higher concentrations, TGF-beta 1 decreases transcripts and expression of PDGF receptor alpha subunits. Hence, TGF-beta induces proliferation of connective tissue cells at low concentrations by stimulating autocrine PDGF-AA secretion, which at higher concentrations of TGF-beta, is decreased by down-regulation of PDGF receptor alpha subunits and perhaps by direct growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2011557383,"PDGF promotes the growth of oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) glial progenitor cells and allows their timely differentiation into oligodendrocytes, the CNS myelin-forming cells. We demonstrate that basic FGF is a potent mitogen for brain O-2A progenitor cells, but blocks their differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Treatment with basic FGF also influences the level of expression of PDGF receptors on O-2A progenitor cells. These cells express only the alpha chain PDGF receptor, and the levels of PDGF alpha receptors decrease as the cells differentiate. In contrast, basic FGF maintains a high level of functionally responsive PDGF alpha receptors in O-2A progenitors. Thus basic FGF activates a signaling pathway that can positively regulate PDGF receptors in O-2A progenitor cells. In this way basic FGF or an FGF-like factor may modulate the production of myelin-forming cells in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W1569409978,"Two membrane fractions of intermediate density between and mitochondrial membranes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from osmotically lysed mitochondria and mitoplasts of liver. These fractions were characterized by the presence of both monamine oxidase and cytochrome c oxidase activities and bound hexokinase. 1) The content of the fractions in proteins and lipids was assessed by biochemical determination. Thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography showed that the two contact site-enriched fractions contain predominantly phosphatidylcholine (31%), phosphatidylethanolamine (27%, half-unsaturated), and cardiolipin (27%, fully unsaturated). 2) The dynamics of the fractions were assessed by fluorescence polarization techniques using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a probe and by fluorescence decay measurements. We have verified that differences in static anisotropy cannot be exclusively attributed to differences in fluorescence lifetimes. On the contrary, the results indicated an increased lipid mobility in inner membrane contact sites, which is probably related to a lower cholesterol to phospholipid ratio, as well as a lower saturation of the fatty acyl chains when compared with outer membrane contact sites. Taken all together, the spectroscopic measurements confirm the biochemical results, leading to the idea that the two populations of contact sites have different physicochemical properties, which are probably mainly determined by the membrane from which they are derived. They constitute microdomains enriched either in or mitochondrial membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2050569727,"Efficient retroviral growth requires integration of a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome into a chromosome of the host. As a first step in analyzing the mechanism of integration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA, a cell-free system was established that models the integration reaction. The in vitro system depends on the HIV integration (IN) protein, which was partially purified from insect cells engineered to express IN protein in large quantities. Integration was detected in a biological assay that scores the insertion of a linear DNA containing HIV terminal sequences into a Î» DNA target. Some integration products generated in this assay contained five-base pair duplications of the target DNA at the recombination junctions, a characteristic of HIV integration in vivo; the remaining products contained aberrant junctional sequences that may have been produced in a variation of the normal reaction. These results indicate that HIV IN protein is the only viral protein required to insert model HIV DNA sequences into a target DNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1677719282,"A panel of 71 chemically mutagenized Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cell clones were selected based on their resistance to the growth inhibitory action of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and TGF-beta 2. Characterization of TGF-beta receptors in these mutants indicates that the TGF-beta-binding membrane proteoglycan, betaglycan, is apparently normal in all of them. However, 14 of the mutant clones are defective in TGF-beta receptor type I, and 22 clones are simultaneously defective in receptor types I and II. The clones with type I receptor defects fall into two distinct phenotypes, called R and LR. The R phenotype is characterized by the lack of detectable type I receptors, and has been previously described (Boyd, F. T., and Massague, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2272-2278). LR mutants are characterized by expression of low levels of type I receptor and are, like the R mutants, completely resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-beta 1 or -beta 2. Mutant clones that are simultaneously defective in receptor types I and II fall into three distinct phenotypes. These included DRa mutants which are characterized by lack of detectable receptor types I and II, DRb mutants which are characterized by low expression of both receptor types and an anomalously fast electrophoretic mobility of the type II receptor protein. All mutants that have a low level of type II receptor are also defective in type I receptor. In addition to the loss of growth inhibitory response, the receptor-defective mutants described here have lost all other responses to TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2 known to occur in parental Mv1Lu cells. The defects present in these mutant clones are not encountered in clones isolated from nonmutagenized parental Mv1Lu cells or in mutagenized cells that had not been exposed to selection with TGF-beta. The results implicate TGF-beta receptor types I and II in the mediation of a common set of cellular responses to TGF-beta. Furthermore, the high relative frequency of isolation of DR mutants raises the possibility that receptor types I and II interact as part of a common signaling TGF-beta receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1991009763,"Changes in DNA supercoiling in response to environmental signals such as osmolarity, temperature, or anaerobicity appear to play an underlying role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria. Extensive genetic analyses have implicated the osmZ gene in this regulatory process: osmZ mutations are highly pleiotropic and alter the topology of cellular DNA. We have shown that the product of the osmZ gene is the ""histone-like"" protein H1 (H-NS). Protein H1 is one of the most abundant components of bacterial chromatin and binds to DNA in a relatively nonspecific fashion. These data imply a regulatory role for one of the major components of bacterial chromatin and provide support for the notion that changes in DNA topology and/or chromatin structure play a role in regulating gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1646404713,"The liver is the major organ which eliminates leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and other cysteinyl leukotrienes from the blood circulation into bile. Transport of LTC4 was studied using inside-out vesicles enriched in canalicular and sinusoidal membranes from rat liver. The incubation of canalicular membrane vesicles with [3H]LTC4 in the presence of ATP resulted in an uptake of LTC4 into vesicles. The initial rate of ATP-stimulated LTC4 uptake was about 40-fold higher in canalicular than in sinusoidal membrane vesicles. When liver plasma membrane vesicles were incubated in the absence of ATP, an apparent transient uptake of LTC4 was observed which was temperature-dependent and not affected by the osmolarity. This indicates that LTC4 was bound to proteins on the surface of plasma membrane vesicles. Two proteins with relative molecular weights of 17,000 and 25,000 were detected by direct photoaffinity labeling as major LTC4-binding proteins. One protein (Mr 25,000) was ascribed to subunit 1 (Ya) of glutathione S-transferase which was associated with the membrane. LTD4, LTE4, N-acetyl-LTE4, and omega-carboxy-N-acetyl-LTE4 were also transported into liver plasma membrane vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner with initial rates relative to LTC4 (1.0) of 0.46, 0.11, 0.35, and 0.22, respectively. Mutual competition between the cysteinyl leukotrienes and S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione for uptake indicated that they are transported by a common carrier. Apparent Km values of the transport system for LTC4, LTD4, and N-acetyl-LTE4 were 0.25, 1.5, and 5.2 microM, respectively. The ATP-dependent transport of LTC4 into vesicles was not inhibited by doxorubicin, daunorubicin, or verapamil, or by the monoclonal antibody C219, suggesting that the transport system differs from P-glycoprotein. Liver plasma membrane vesicles prepared from mutant rats deficient in the hepatobiliary excretion of cysteinyl leukotrienes lacked the ATP-dependent transport of cysteinyl leukotrienes and S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione. These results demonstrate that the ATP-dependent carrier system is responsible for the transport of cysteinyl leukotrienes and glutathione S-conjugates from the hepatocytes into bile."

The activity responsible for this deflection can be abolished by antibodies raised against tectal membranes and the corresponding Fab fragments. Analysis of tectal membranes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting reveals a 33 kd glycoprotein that has a higher concentration in posterior than in anterior tectum. Its expression is developmentally regulated, and it is sensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These are properties expected for a molecule responsible for the phenomena observed in experiments on in vitro guidance of retinal axons."
https://openalex.org/W1966960186,"To facilitate functional and mechanistic studies of receptorâG protein interactions, the human Î²2-adrenergic receptor (hÎ²-AR) has been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This was achieved by placing a modified hÎ²-AR gene under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. After induction by galactose, functional hÎ²-AR was expressed at a concentration several hundred times as great as that found in any human tissue. As determined from competitive ligand binding experiments, hÎ²-AR expressed in yeast displayed characteristic affinities, specificity, and stereoselectivity. Partial activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway by Î²-adrenergic receptor agonists was achieved in cells coexpressing hÎ²-AR and a mammalian G protein (Gs) Î± subunit-demonstrating that these components can couple to each other and to downstream effectors when expressed in yeast. This in vivo reconstitution system provides a new approach for examining ligand binding and G protein coupling to cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1996899427,"E. coli 4.5S RNA and P48 have been shown to be homologous to SRP7S RNA and SRP54, respectively. Here we report that expression of human SRP7S in E. coli can suppress the lethality caused by depletion of 4.5S RNA. In E. coli, both RNAs are associated with P48. In vitro, both E. coli P48 and SRP54 specifically bind to 4.5S RNA. Strains depleted of 4.5S RNA strongly accumulate pre-Î²-lactamase and fall to accumulate maltose binding protein. These effects commence well before any growth defect is observed and are suppressed by expression of human SRP7S. Strains overproducing P48 also accumulate pre-Î²-lactamase. 4.5S RNA and P48 are components of a ribonucleoprotein particle that we propose to be required for the secretion of some proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1997031612,"Retinoic acid receptors appear to exert profound effects on vertebrate development by regulating the transcription of distinct sets of target genes within different cell types. Several lines of evidence are presented for the existence of multiple, cell type-specific nuclear proteins that function to differentialty increase the binding affinity of the Î± retinoic acid receptor for a variety of response elements. These proteins, which we refer to as retinoic acid receptor coregulators, interact with the retinoic acid receptor via a common dimerization interface that overlaps with its ligand binding domain. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that coregulator proteins serve to restrict and/or direct the effects of retinoic acid receptors on patterns of gene expression during development."
https://openalex.org/W1517162073,"Because of the central role of fibrinogen binding in platelet aggregation and recent evidence implicating S-nitrosothiol compounds in the platelet inhibitory effects of endogenous and exogenous organic nitrate compounds, we examined the effect of the S-nitrosothiol S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNOAC) on fibrinogen binding to gel-filtered human platelets. We found that SNOAC markedly inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to normal human platelets in a dose-dependent fashion and that this inhibitory effect was the result of both an increase in the apparent Kd of the platelet receptor for the fibrinogen molecule (from 6.8 x 10(-7) to 1.8 x 10(-6) M, a 2.7-fold increase) and a decrease in the total number of fibrinogen molecules bound to the platelet (from 76,200 to 38,250, a 50% decrease). In addition, we noted a rapid, dose-dependent rise in platelet cyclic GMP levels following exposure of platelets to SNOAC which was significantly inversely correlated with fibrinogen binding and was accompanied by inhibition of intracellular calcium flux in response to a variety of platelet agonists. Similar dose-dependent inhibition of fibrinogen binding was found in the presence of cyclic GMP analogues and was significantly enhanced by inhibition of platelet cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. These results describe the inhibition of platelet fibrinogen binding by an S-nitrosothiol compound, help define the biochemical mechanism by which S-nitrosothiols inhibit platelet aggregation, and lend support to the view that cyclic GMP is an important inhibitory intracellular mediator in human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1625571551,"An unusual compound, cyclic-bis(3'----5') diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP or cGpGp), is involved in the regulation of cellulose synthesis in the bacterium Acetobacter xylinum. This cyclic dinucleotide acts as an allosteric, positive effector of cellulose synthase activity in vitro (Ka = 0.31 microM) and is inactivated via degradation by a Ca2(+)-sensitive phosphodiesterase, PDE-A (Km = 0.25 microM). A series of 13 analogs cyclic dimer and trimer nucleotides were synthesized, employing a phosphotriester approach, and tested for the ability to mimick c-di-GMP as activators of cellulose synthase and as substrates for PDE-A. Seven of the synthetic compounds stimulate cellulose synthase activity and all of these activators undergo the Ca2(+)-inhibited degradation reaction. The order of affinities for synthase activators is cGpGp approximately cdGpGp approximately cGp(S)Gp (S-diastereomer) greater than cIpGp greater than cdGpdGp greater than cXpGp greater than cIpIp greater than cGp(S)Gp (R-diastereomer). Three cyclic dinucleotides of negligible affinity for either enzyme are cApAp, cUpUp, and cCpCp. This same order of affinities essentially pertains to the analogs as inhibitors of PDE-A activity, but at least one cyclic dinucleotide, cXpXp, which does not bind to cellulose synthase, is also a substrate for the degradation reaction, demonstrating that although the two enzymes share a similar, high degree of specificity for c-di-GMP, their cyclic dinucleotide binding sites are not identical. Phosphodiester bonds of activators in which an exocyclic oxygen is replaced with an atom of sulfur (cGp(S)Gp isomers) resist the action of PDE-A, and such derivatives may be prototypes for synthetic non-hydrolyzable c-di-GMP analogs."
https://openalex.org/W2043673604,"We have identified four T. brucei minicircle sequences that are complementary to cytochrome oxidase III (COIII) edited mRNA sequence and have shown the existence of transcripts from three of these minicircle sequences. These minicircle transcripts potentially serve as guide RNAs (gRNAs) for RNA editing of the COIII transcript. These gRNAs range in size from 55 to 70 nucleotides, are heterogeneous in sequence, and have a 5â² terminal triphosphate. The genes for these gRNAs are flanked by imperfect 18 bp repeats separated by approximately 110 bp. Transcription initiates at the first purine within a conserved sequence, 5â²-RYA-YA-3â², 31 or 32 bp from the upstream inverted repeat. We propose that these 18 bp inverted repeats are important for minicircle gRNA expression in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W1595208257,"The c-raf kinase has been shown to be activated following stimulation of several tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors. We examined changes in c-raf following engagement of the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR), a stimulus which activates both a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C (PKC). We found that activation of the T-cell receptor on the T cell hybridoma 2B4 causes a rapid and stoichiometric hyperphosphorylation of c-raf and an increase in c-raf-associated kinase activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the phosphorylation was entirely on serine residues. High-resolution phosphopeptide mapping showed the appearance of a single major new phosphopeptide with TCR stimulation. That phosphopeptide was shown to comigrate with the major new phosphopeptide induced in response to phorbol ester. When cells were depleted of PKC by pretreatment with high concentrations of phorbol ester, TCR stimulation was no longer capable of inducing c-raf-associated kinase activity. To determine whether activation of the tyrosine kinase alone would activate c-raf, we examined the 2B4 variant cell line FL.8. In response to Thy-1 stimulation, these cells activate the tyrosine kinase but not protein kinase C due to a deficiency in TCR eta chain expression. We found that in contrast to Thy-1 stimulation of 2B4 cells, stimulation of FL.8 cells does not lead to the induction of c-raf-associated kinase activity, although phorbol ester activates the kinase to an equivalent degree in both cells. We conclude that T cell receptor activation of c-raf occurs via phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase PKC. Activation of c-raf through PKC represents a mechanism distinct from that reported for tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1490159978,"Five proteins purified from mouse cells acting together efficiently convert a single-stranded circular DNA template to covalently closed duplex circle by a discontinuous mechanism. DNA polymerase alpha/primase with the assistance of alpha accessory factor covers the single-stranded circle with RNA-primed DNA fragments. Primers are removed by a combination of RNase H-1 and a 5â-exonuclease that was identified by its ability to complete this in vitro system. The 5â-exonuclease is required to remove residual one or two ribonucleotides at the primer/DNA junction that are resistant to RNase H-1. Gap filling is by the DNA polymerase alpha/primase, and DNA ligase I converts the DNA fragments to continuous strand. The concerted action of the five proteins emulates synthesis of the staging strand at the replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1536331044,"This laboratory first provided evidence for a potential signal transduction pathway involving sphingomyelin and its derivatives (Kolesnick, R.N., and Clegg, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6534-6537). Recently, this laboratory demonstrated the existence of the novel sphingolipid ceramide 1-phosphate in human leukemia (HL-60) cells. Ceramide 1-phosphate was synthesized from ceramide derived from sphingomyelin but not glycosphingolipids. This suggested that a specific pathway extended from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate. The present studies provide additional support for this notion by demonstrating the existence of a ceramide kinase activity distinct from diacylglycerol (DG) kinase in HL-60 cells. Microsomal membranes contained a kinase activity that phosphorylated ceramide but not 1,2-DG in the presence of physiologic and higher Ca2+ concentrations (60 nM-3 mM). Kinetic analyses demonstrated an apparent Vmax for ceramide and ATP of 70 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1; apparent Km values were 45 and 25 microM, respectively. The pH optimum was within the physiologic range (pH 6-8). Magnesium but not other divalent cations (Mn2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Zn2+) also stimulated ceramide phosphorylation. Magnesium also induced 1,2-DG phosphorylation. Since DG kinase is a Mg2(+)-stimulable enzyme that may utilize ceramide as substrate, additional studies separated calcium-dependent ceramide kinase from DG kinase activity. 1,2-DGs competitively inhibited magnesium- but not calcium-dependent ceramide phosphorylation. Hence, calcium-dependent ceramide kinase activity neither utilized DG as substrate nor was inhibited by DG. These activities were physically separable. Both activities were solubilized by n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and stabilized by glycerol. Ceramide kinase activity bound weakly to a DEAE-cellulose anion exchange column and eluted with 4-fold purification as a single peak of activity in the flow-through and 0.05 M NaCl elutions. In contrast, the majority of DG kinase activity bound more tightly and was recovered as a broad peak in the 0.2-0.35 M NaCl elutions. These studies demonstrate the existence of a ceramide kinase activity in HL-60 cells which is functionally and physically separable from DG kinase. These studies provide further support for the notion of a specific pathway from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1978399767,"Sodium channels from several sources are covalently modified by unusually large numbers of negatively charged sialic acid residues. In the present studies, purified electroplax sodium channels were treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues and then examined for functional changes in planar lipid bilayers. Neuraminidase treatment resulted in a large depolarizing shift in the average potential required for channel activation. Additionally, desialidated channels showed a striking increase in the frequency of reversible transitions to subconductance states. Thus it appears that sialic acid residues play a significant role in the function of sodium channels, possibly through their influence on the local electric field and/or conformational stability of the channel molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2087619553,"Basic taste qualities are thought to be perceived independently, yet discrete neural coding channels have not been demonstrated in the central nervous system. The response profiles of taste cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the rat were categorized into four groups, and the effects of amiloride, a passive sodium channel blocker, on each were determined. NTS neurons that responded specifically to sodium chloride (NaCl) or to NaCl and sugars were suppressed by amiloride; those broadly sensitive to salts, acids, and bitter stimuli were unaffected. Moreover, the response profile evoked by NaCl lost its distinctiveness after treatment with amiloride, becoming similar to those evoked by acids and quinine. Receptors that respond to sodium must relay their information through independent coding channels to identifiable subgroups of NTS neurons, the activity of which is responsible for the perception of saltiness."
https://openalex.org/W1502613766,"In isolated, 32Pi-loaded, rat adipocytes, we have examined phosphorylation of the major cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) substrate, a protein that appears to be associated with the lipid storage droplet and migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 65-67-kDa doublet. In control cells, a strong phosphorylation signal is detected as the (+/- cAMP) A-kinase activity ratio ranges from approximately 0.1 to approximately 0.3-0.4 with increasing isoproterenol concentrations. By contrast, insulin-treated cells exhibiting A-kinase activity ratios over the range of 0.1-0.25 contain less 32P in the 65-67-kDa protein than control cells exhibiting identical A-kinase activity ratios. At higher activity ratios (greater than 0.3), this reduction in phosphorylation of the 65-67-kDa protein by insulin disappears. It is concluded that insulin stimulates a phosphatase activity that acts on the 65-67-kDa protein. Insulin actions aside, these studies reveal two interesting phenomena. 1) Whereas elevated, steady-state A-kinase activities are established rapidly (1-2 min) upon isoproterenol stimulation, phosphorylation of the 65-67-kDa substrate proceeds through a burst, followed by a decline to a steady-state level by 10-12 min. An adaptation mechanism, providing for a constant response to a constant stimulus, may underlie this lack of parallelism between the time course of phosphorylation and A-kinase activity. 2) Removal of [32Pi] orthophosphate immediately before isoproterenol stimulation leads to a rapid (t approximately 10 min) loss in labeling of the 65-67-kDa protein, whereas the phosphorylation state of other phosphoproteins are not changed. These data suggest that elevation of A-kinase activity leads to a rapid exchange of external Pi with an ATP pool that is used by A-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1513217200,"To delineate the structural determinants of the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) which affect hormone binding specificity we have constructed seven chimeric receptor cDNAs and stably expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Clonal cell lines expressing high levels of each receptor chimera were analyzed for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) binding activity. Measurements of hormone binding and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled receptors showed that all chimeras were properly processed and expressed at the cell surface. The binding data indicate that 56 amino acids of the IR and 52 amino acids of the IGFIR located in corresponding regions of the cysteine-rich domains are the primary determinants of hormone binding specificity. These regions are located between amino acids Asn-230 and Ile-285 on the IR and between His-223 and Met-274 on the IGFIR. In addition, the alpha IR-3 antibody, which competes for IGFI binding, was found to interact with the same 52 amino acids of the IGFIR which determines hormone specificity. Other antibodies which interfere with insulin binding (5D9, MC51, and MA20) interact with epitopes in the COOH-terminal 288 amino acids of the alpha-subunit. We conclude that 56 and 52 amino acids of the cysteine-rich domains of the IR and IGFIR contain the major determinants of hormone binding specificity although other more COOH-terminal regions of both receptors contribute to hormone binding."
https://openalex.org/W1517498188,"Patients with apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) have low or absent activity of the enzyme 11Î²OH steroid dehydrogenase (11SD), and inappropriately high intrarenal levels of cortisol resulting in Na+ retention and hypertension. Pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA), in contrast, is characterized by salt wasting despite hyperaldosteronemia, reflecting low or absent mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). Although AME is presumed to reflect inappropriate cortisol occupancy of MR, several features also suggest inappropriate occupancy of glucocorticoid receptors (GR). To test this possibility, we administered carbenoxolone, which is known to block 11SD, to four patients with PHA, and observed marked mineralocorticoid effects, e.g., antinatriuresis and elevated plasma bicarbonate. To further test the possibility that occupancy of renal GR may induce a classical mineralocorticoid response, we administered the highly specific glucocorticoid RU 28362 to adrenalectomized rats and showed that it has profound antinatriuretic effects. Finally, by selectively blocking MR with RU 28318 or GR with RU 38486, we have shown that corticosterone, the physiologic glucocorticoid in rats, has an antinatriuretic effect in adrenalectomized rats via either MR or GR occupancy. Previous studies have clearly shown that MR are inherently nonselective and have equivalent intrinsic affinity for aldosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol. The present studies suggest that this non-selectivity includes the nuclear response element to which either MR or GR may bind to elicit a mineralocorticoid effect, and further underscore the importance of the enzyme 11SD in the specific mineralocorticoid action of aldosterone.â Funder, J.

https://openalex.org/W1571918776,"Camptothecin (CPT) binds reversibly to, and thereby stabilizes, the cleavable complex formed between DNA and topoisomerase I. The nature of the interaction of CPT with the DNA-topoisomerase I binary complex was studied by the use of two affinity labeling reagents structurally related to camptothecin: 10-bromoacetamidomethylcamptothecin (BrCPT) and 7-methyl-10-bromoacetamidomethylcamptothecin (BrCPTMe). These compounds have been shown to trap the DNA-topoisomerase I complex irreversibly. Although cleavage of DNA plasmid mediated by topoisomerase I and camptothecin was reduced significantly by treatment with high salt or excess competitor DNA, enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage stabilized by BrCTPMe persisted for at least 4 h after similar treatment. The production of irreversible topoisomerase I-DNA cleavage was time-dependent, suggesting that BrCPTMe first bound noncovalently to the enzyme-DNA complex and, in a second slower step, alkylated the enzyme or DNA in a manner that prevented DNA ligation. The formation of a covalent linkage was supported by experiments that employed [3H]BrCPT, which was shown to label topoisomerase I within the enzyme-DNA complex. [3H]BrCPT labeling of topoisomerase I was enhanced greatly by the presence of DNA; very little labeling of isolated topoisomerase I or isolated DNA occurred. Even in the presence of DNA, [3H]BrCPT labeling of topoisomerase I was inhibited by camptothecin, suggesting that both CPT and BrCPT bound to the same site on the DNA-topoisomerase I binary complex. These studies provide further evidence that a binding site for camptothecin is created as the DNA-topoisomerase I complex is formed and suggest that the A-ring of camptothecin is proximate to an enzyme residue."
https://openalex.org/W1557226477,"The G-protein involved in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor signaling was identified using two different approaches. First, purified rat liver membranes were incubated with [alpha-32P]GTP in the absence or presence of the adrenergic agonist (-)-epinephrine, or in the presence of GTP. After UV irradiation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography, covalent labeling of a number of proteins was apparent and could be blocked by unlabeled GTP. In the preparation treated with (-)-epinephrine alone, labeling of a 74-kDa species was markedly enhanced. Enhanced labeling of 40-50-kDa species was also observed. Labeling of the 74-kDa protein was also evident in similarly treated membranes prepared from FRTL-5 thyroid cells, which contain abundant alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, but not in those prepared from turkey erythrocytes or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which are essentially devoid of alpha 1-receptors. Second, alpha 1-agonist-receptor-G-protein ternary complex formation was induced by incubating purified rat liver membranes with (-)-epinephrine. Rauwolscine (10(-7) M) and (+/-)-propranolol (10(-6) M) were included to prevent activation of alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors by (-)-epinephrine. The ternary complex of hormone, receptor, and G-protein was solubilized, partially purified using heparin- and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The vesicles displayed agonist-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding that was blocked by phentolamine (10(-4) M). By contrast, stimulation of GTP gamma S binding was not evident when the vesicles were incubated with the beta-agonist, isoproterenol. Incubation of the vesicles with [alpha-32P]GTP or [alpha-32P]azido-GTP in the presence of (-)-epinephrine, followed by photolysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography, resulted in the covalent labeling of a 74-kDa protein. Labeling of this protein could be blocked by preincubation with phentolamine or unlabeled GTP. These findings provide direct evidence for the coupling of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor to a previously uncharacterized G-protein (termed Gh), which has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 74 kDa."

In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, the stimulatory effect of feeding on fatty acid synthase activity is mimicked by adding triiodothyronine and insulin; the inhibitory effect of starvation is mimicked by adding glucagon or cyclic AMP. We now show that triiodothyronine alone stimulates transcription of fatty acid synthase by 4- to 6-fold, about the same as the increase in fatty acid synthase mRNA. When added alone, insulin has little or no effect on transcription, mRNA level, or enzyme activity. In combination with triiodothyronine, however, insulin amplifies the response to triiodothyronine by about 2-fold, leading to an overall increase of about 10-fold. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has the same effect as insulin, no effect by itself, and amplification of the stimulation by triiodothyronine. A maximally effective dose of insulin has no effect in the presence of a maximally effective dose of IGF-1, suggesting regulation by a common pathway. It takes much less IGF-1 than insulin to achieve a given effect, suggesting that both insulin and IGF-1 may act through IGF-1 receptors. Plasma levels of IGF-1 are decreased by starvation and increased by feeding (reviewed by Froesch, E.R., and Zapf, J. (1985) Diabetologia 28, 485-493). Thus, IGF-1 may play a physiological role in the regulation of hepatic fatty acid synthase during transitions between the starved and fed states, roles previously assigned primarily to insulin and glucagon. IGF-1 regulates transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene. Insulin and IGF-1 also have similar effects on activity, mRNA abundance, and transcription of the malic enzyme gene. Glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibit fatty acid synthase activity and mRNA level in hepatocytes in culture by 70-80% and 60%, respectively, but have no effect on transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of regulation for cyclic AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1570699969,"A kinase activity of purified bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles phosphorylates the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) with high efficiency (Km approximately 50-100 nM). The kinase copurifies in gel filtration, adsorption on hydroxylapatite, and ion exchange chromatography with the HAI assembly proteins which are part of the coat of Golgi-derived clathrin-coated vesicles. The kinase is associated to the 47-kDa subunit of the complex and exhibits properties similar to a casein kinase II: it uses either ATP or GTP as substrate and its activity is stimulated by poly-L-lysine and inhibited by heparin. Using different domains of the CI-MPR as potential substrates, we show that the phosphorylation is restricted to its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibition studies using synthetic peptides and two-dimensional mapping of the tryptic phosphopeptides indicate that this posttranslational modification occurs on serines 2421 and 2492 of the full-length bovine CI-MPR precursor, residues which are located in typical casein-kinase II recognition sequences. Labeling of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells followed by immunoprecipitation of the CI-MPR and analysis of the corresponding tryptic phosphopeptides shows that the same serines are phosphorylated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1509677149,"Abstract In the previous paper, we reported the identification of a 74-kDa G-protein that co-purifies with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor following ternary complex formation. We report here on the purification and characterization of this 74-kDa G-protein (termed Gh) isolated de novo from rat liver membranes. After solubilization of rat liver membranes with the detergent sucrose monolaurate, Gh was isolated by sequential chromatography using heparin-agarose, Ultrogel AcA 34, hydroxylapatite, and heptylamine-Sepharose columns. The protein, thus isolated, is not a substrate for cholera or pertussis toxin but displays GTPase activity (turnover number, 3-5 min-1) and high-affinity guanosine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding (half-maximal binding = 0.25-0.3 microM), which is Mg2(+)-dependent and saturable. The relative order of nucleotide binding by Gh is GTP gamma S greater than GTP greater than GDP greater than ITP much much greater than ATP greater than or equal to adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, which is similar to that observed for other heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in receptor signaling. Moreover, specific alpha 1-agonist-stimulated GTPase (turnover number, 10-15 min-1) and GTP gamma S binding activity could be demonstrated after reconstitution of purified Gh with partially purified alpha 1-adrenergic receptor into phospholipid vesicles. The alpha 1-agonist stimulation of GTP gamma S binding and GTPase activity was inhibited by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. A 50-kDa protein co-purifies with the 74-kDa G-protein. This protein does not bind guanine nucleotides and may be a subunit (beta-subunit) of Gh. These findings indicate that Gh is a G-protein that functionally couples to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514743986,"Thyroid hormone, specifically thyroxine, alters cytoskeletal organization in astrocytes by modulating actin polymerization and, in turn, regulates the turnover of the short-lived membrane protein, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase. In the absence of thyroxine, approximately 35% of the total cellular actin is depolymerized, and greater than 90% of the deiodinase is found in the plasma membrane and not associated with the cytoskeleton. Addition of thyroxine promotes actin polymerization and decreases the depolymerized actin to approximately 10% of the total actin pool, induces binding of the deiodinase to F-actin, and promotes rapid internalization of the enzyme. These data provide direct evidence that the actin cytoskeleton participates in the inactivation pathway of the deiodinase by translocating this short-lived plasma membrane protein to an internal membrane pool."
https://openalex.org/W1568057583,"Binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to its cell surface receptors stimulates a variety of biochemical and biological responses. Two receptor gene products (designated alpha and beta) have been identified, and the different binding affinities of various PDGF isoforms for these receptors are prime determinants of the spectrum of responses observed. The beta receptor binds PDGF-BB, but not PDGF-AA, while the alpha receptor binds PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB. We utilized these different ligand binding specificities to investigate the PDGF-AA binding site in the human alpha-PDGF receptor by constructing chimeric molecules between the human alpha- and beta-PDGF receptors. Our results demonstrate that amino acids 1-340 of the alpha-PDGF receptor comprise the region that confers PDGF-AA binding specificity. This region corresponds to immunoglobulin-like sub-domains 1, 2, and 3 of its external domain."
https://openalex.org/W1529543283,"Abstract Receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover leads to activation of Na+/H+ exchange and subsequent intracellular alkalinization. To probe the effect of increased intracellular pH (pHi) on Ca2+ homeostasis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), we studied the effect of weak bases, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and methylamine (agents which increase pHi by direct passive diffusion), on resting and ATP (purinergic receptor agonist)-induced Ca2+ fluxes. Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) or pHi were monitored in BAEC monolayers using the fluorescent dyes, fura-2 or 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, respectively. NH4Cl-induced, dose-dependent (5-20 mM) increases in [Ca2+]i (maximum change = 195 +/- 26 nM) which were temporally similar to the NH4Cl-induced pHi increases. Methylamine (20 mM) induced a more sustained pHi increase and also stimulated a prolonged [Ca2+]i increase. When BAEC were bathed in HCO3- buffer, removal of extracellular CO2/bicarbonate caused pHi to increase and also induced [Ca2+]i to increase transiently. Extracellular Ca2+ removal did not abolish the rapid NH4Cl-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, although the response was blunted and more transient. NH4Cl addition to BAEC cultures resulted in an increase in 45Ca efflux and decrease in total cell 45Ca content. BAEC treatment with ATP (100 microM) to deplete inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ pools completely blocked the NH4Cl (20 mM)-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. Likewise, prior NH4Cl addition partially inhibited ATP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, as well as slowed the frequency of repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes in single endothelial cells due to agonist. NH4Cl augmented the rate of [Ca2+]i increase that occurs in response to the depletion of agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pools. However, the internal Ca2+ store remained depleted during the continued presence of NH4Cl, as indicated by a decreased [Ca2+]i response to ATP in Ca2(+)-free medium. Finally, NH4Cl exerted these actions without affecting basal or ATP-stimulated IP3 formation. These observations provide direct evidence that increased pHi leads to Ca2+ mobilization from an agonist-sensitive pool and impairs Ca2+ pool(s) refilling mechanisms without altering cellular IP3 levels."
https://openalex.org/W1549399628,"The sexually differentiated microsomal enzyme steroid 5 alpha-reductase (NADPH: delta 4-3-oxosteroid 5 alpha-oxido-reductase, EC 1.3.99.5) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, a more potent androgen. In rat liver, this enzyme is expressed at a 10-fold higher level in adult females as compared to adult males. The pituitary regulation of this enzyme and its mRNA was studied in untreated and hypophysectomized rats and in rats rendered hypothyroid by treatment with the antithyroid drug methimazole. Hepatic 5 alpha-reductase activity was elevated 8-fold, to 85% of adult female levels, in adult male rats given growth hormone by continuous infusion. This same treatment was only partially effective in restoring 5 alpha-reductase in rats depleted of endogenous growth hormone by hypophysectomy, indicating that other pituitary-dependent factors contribute to the elevation observed in the inact animals. Further analysis revealed that thyroxine, but not adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or chorionic gonadotropin, could elevate 5 alpha-reductase activity and mRNA when given to the hypophysectomized rats and that this effect was enhanced by the presence of growth hormone. This thyroid hormone dependence was confirmed by the decrease in hepatic 5 alpha-reductase expression in hypothyroid rats and by its substantial restoration following thyroxine replacement. Thyroxine also stimulated expression of another female-predominant hepatic mRNA, encoding the steroid 16 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450f (IIC7), in a manner that was independent of the stimulatory effect of growth hormone on this transcript. In contrast, thyroid hormone did not significantly affect protein or mRNA levels of the growth hormone-stimulated, female-specific steroid sulfate 15 beta-hydroxylase P-450 2d (IIC12). These findings establish that thyroid hormones act at a pretranslational level to modulate the expression of some, but not all, growth hormone-stimulated hepatic mRNAs and demonstrate that both thyroxine and growth hormone can independently contribute to the sex-dependent expression of hepatic enzymes of steroid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1584009508,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is released from an extensive network of postganglionic sympathetic perivascular neurons. NPY has been shown to affect vascular tone postsynaptically by 1) directly stimulating contraction; 2) inhibiting vasorelaxation; and 3) potentiating contraction elicited by exogenous vasoconstrictors. The molecular mechanisms mediating these effects of NPY are undefined. Therefore, we examined the possibility that NPY could stimulate smooth muscle contraction through myosin light chain phosphorylation in cultured porcine aortic smooth muscle cells. NPY (100 nM) caused a rapid, transient increase in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, an important regulatory event in the initiation of smooth muscle contraction. NPY-stimulated MLC phosphorylation was prevented by preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin and was independent of extracellular Ca2+. In parallel studies, NPY alone had no detectable effect on cellular cAMP or cGMP content; however, NPY potently inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (IC50 = 0.03 nM) through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. NPY had no detectable effect on basal phosphoinositide hydrolysis or protein kinase C activation but enhanced angiotensin II-stimulated production of inositol phosphates and activation of protein kinase C. These results indicate that NPY-stimulated MLC phosphorylation can occur in the absence of detectable changes in cAMP content, cGMP content, inositol phosphate production, or protein kinase C activation; however, the interactions between NPY and other vasoactive agents may be mediated by the indirect effects of NPY on adenylate cyclase activity and phosphoinositide hydrolysis."

This work was undertaken to identify, isolate, sequence, and synthesize the region of SHBG that interacts with its membrane receptor. To accomplish this, highly purified human SHBG was digested with trypsin. The SHBG-derived tryptic peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. They were evaluated for their ability to compete with 125I-SHBG for binding to the SHBG receptor solubilized from human prostatic membranes. Only a single peptide, corresponding to residues 48-57 of the known sequence of human SHBG, inhibited receptor binding. A synthetic decapeptide with this amino acid sequence also competitively inhibited SHBG binding."
https://openalex.org/W1625966268,"Differentiation of the murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines F-9 and PC-13, induced by beta-all transretinoic acid (RA) resulted in an increased level of two lysosomal-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2). After differentiation, the levels of both LAMPs in the EC cells were comparable to those found in visceral and parietal endoderm cell lines (PSA-5E and PYS-2, respectively). RA treatment of the EC cells also resulted in an increase in the apparent Mr of both LAMPs apparently due to increased glycosylation because the deglycosylated LAMP-1 from undifferentiated and from differentiated cells had a similar electrophoretic migration. Indeed, the binding of 125I-labeled L-phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) to glycoproteins with Mr or 90,000-130,000 increased after differentiation and about 24 times more 125I-labeled L-PHA bound to LAMP-1 isolated by immunoprecipitation from extracts of RA-treated F-9 cells than to LAMP-1 from undifferentiated cells. The increased level of the LAMPs was detected in F-9 cells treated with greater than 10(-7) M RA and required greater than 48 h of treatment as did the increased expression of the B1 chain of laminin, an established marker for differentiation in this system. LAMP-1- and L-PHA-reactive glycoproteins were localized by fluorescence techniques to intracellular vesicles, presumably lysosomes, and to the cell surface and both increased after RA treatment. LAMP-2 was barely detectable intracellularly in undifferentiated cells but could be detected clearly after differentiation. In contrast, no LAMP-2 could be detected on the cell surface either before or after differentiation of F-9 cells. The increased level and glycosylation of both LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 was observed also in cells treated with a synthetic chalcone carboxylic acid analog of RA and by combination of either retinoid with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. These results demonstrate that differentiation of EC cells is accompanied by changes in the synthesis and glycosylation of LAMP glycoproteins and that these changes are specific for the cell type that results after differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1579306860,"Abstract We have purified to near homogeneity a site-specific, double-stranded DNA endonuclease (I-Sce II) encoded by intron 4 alpha (aI4 alpha) of the yeast mitochondrial coxI gene. Our purification starts with a high salt extract of mitochondria isolated from a yeast strain that overproduces the enzyme because of a block in splicing of aI4 alpha. The final step of purification is an affinity column consisting of covalently bound double-stranded DNA multimers of a synthetic sequence, 5'-TTGGTCATCCAGAAGTAT-3', which contains the I-Sce II cleavage/recognition site. Typical yields of enzyme are 3-5% with a specific activity of approximately 500,000 units/mg, where 1 unit of activity cleaves 50 ng of DNA substrate/h at 30 degrees C. I-Sce II has a monomer molecular mass of 31 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Active enzyme purifies as a 55-kDa species, which we presume to be a homodimer. I-Sce II monomer comigrates with an in vivo synthesized mitochondrial translation product made in the strain that overproduces the enzyme. We conclude that I-Sce II is derived by proteolytic processing of a precursor polypeptide, p62, encoded by an in-frame fusion of coxI exons 1-4 with the downstream aI4 alpha reading frame. I-Sce II is most active at pH 7.5 and at 20-30 degrees C. Endonuclease activity is sensitive to salt and is dependent upon Mg2+ or Mn2+, but is unaffected by inclusion of ATP or GTP. I-Sce II is the first intron-encoded protein to be purified and characterized from yeast mitochondria."

Two DGK species (DGK-I and DGK-III) were purified to apparent homogeneity, and upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they showed a single band of apparent molecular mass of 152 kDa (DGK-I) or 58 kDa (DGK-III). The peptide mapping analysis showed that DGK-I and DGK-III are structurally different. DGK-II was only partially purified, and its apparent Mr was estimated to be 75,000 by gel filtration. The specific enzyme activities of the three isozymes were increased 1,480-fold (DGK-I), 690-fold (DGK-II) and 2,100-fold (DGK-III) over original platelet cytosol. The activities of DGK-II and DGK-III were markedly enhanced by the presence of deoxycholate or phosphatidylserine, whereas DGK-I activity was not much affected by the anionic compounds. All of the three activities were strongly suppressed by phosphatidylcholine. Triton X-100 and octyl glucoside were strongly inhibitory to all of the enzymes, although to different extents. The DGK inhibitor, R59022, inhibited DGK-II and to a lesser extent DGK-III, but little affected DGK-I activity. DGK-I was much more heat-stable than DGK-II and DGK-III. The Km values for ATP were 150 microM for DGK-I, 245 microM for DGK-II, and 450 microM for DGK-III. The apparent Km values for suspended diolein were not much different among the DGKs and were in the range of 50-80 microM. These observations indicate that human platelet cytosol contains DGK isozymes with different enzymological properties. Furthermore, the three DGKs isolated from human platelets were found not to cross-react with the antibody raised against porcine brain 80-kDa DGK, thus indicating that human platelets contain novel species of DGK."

Ant-dATP competitively inhibited both bacterial enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli (ki approximately 10 microM). Binding of the analogue to adenylate cyclase was monitored by equilibrium dialysis and by an increase in its fluorescence emission at 420 nm upon excitation at 330 nm. Whereas the fluorescence of Ant-dATP was little influenced by divalent cations, CaM, or adenylate cyclase alone, the Ca2+.CaM.cyclase complex increased up to 4 times the quantum yield of Ant-dATP. Binding of the analogue to the catalytic site of BPCYA47 and BACYA62 was specific as shown by its displacement with ATP or 3'-dATP. Our results substantiate the role of CaM in favoring substrate binding to CaM-activated enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1603149709,"Our previous studies showed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) modulated interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity and IL-1 binding to Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts (Bonin, P. D., and Singh, J. P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11052-11055). Subsequent studies have demonstrated an action of PDGF at the level of IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) gene expression. PDGF treatment of Balb/c3T3 cells produces a 10-20-fold stimulation of mRNA for IL-1 receptor. Investigation of the signal transduction pathways shows that activation of either the protein kinase C pathway or the cAMP-mediated pathway leads to the stimulation of IL-1 receptor expression in Balb/c3T3 cells. Treatment of Balb/c3T3 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known activator of protein kinase C, produced an increased 125I-IL-1 binding to cells and stimulation of IL-1R mRNA. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocked the induction of IL-1 binding by PDGF or PMA. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by pretreatment with PMA reduced the subsequent stimulation by PDGF. Chronic treatment with PMA, however, did not produce a complete inhibition of PDGF effect on IL-1R. Further studies showed that the agents that stimulate cAMP accumulation (isobutyl methylxanthine, dibutyryl), directly stimulate adenylate cyclase (forskolin), or activate G protein (choleragen) stimulated 125I-IL-1 binding and IL-1R mRNA accumulation in Balb/c3T3 cells. These studies suggest that potentially two signal transduction pathways mediate IL-1 receptor expression in Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts. Evidence is presented that suggests that stimulation of IL-1R through these two pathways (PMA/PDGF-stimulated and cAMP-stimulated) occurs independent of each other."

As such we chose supercoiled and relaxed DNA minicircles containing a d(CG)7 insert in the Z- and B-conformation, respectively. Filter binding tests and gel retardation assays performed with these ligands showed that the three testis proteins either do not discriminate between Z- and B-DNA (31- and 33-kDa proteins) or even have a preference for B-DNA (58-kDa protein).

https://openalex.org/W1518083762,"Abstract A population of latent (cryptic) receptors for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been characterized in the rat liver plasma membrane (PM). 125I-TNF bound to high (Kd = 1.51 +/- 0.35 nM) and low (Kd = 13.58 +/- 1.45 nM) affinity receptors in PM. Solubilization of PM with 1% Triton X-100 prior to incubation with 125I-TNF increased both high affinity (from 0.33 +/- 0.04 to 1.67 +/- 0.05 pmol/mg of protein) and low affinity (from 1.92 +/- 0.16 to 7.57 +/- 0.50 pmol/mg of protein) TNF binding without affecting the affinities for TNF. Digestion of intact PM with chymotrypsin abolished most of the TNF binding capacity of PM. However, substantial binding activity was recovered by solubilization of chymotrypsin-treated PM with 1% Triton X-100, suggesting the presence of a large latent pool of TNF receptors. The affinities of the high and low affinity sites recovered from chymotrypsin-treated membranes were similar to those of intact PM. Affinity labeling of receptors whether from PM, solubilized PM, or membranes digested with chymotrypsin and then solubilized resulted in cross-linking of 125I-TNF into Mr 130,000, 90,000, and 66,000 complexes. Thus, the properties of the latent TNF receptors were similar to those initially accessible to TNF. To determine if exposure of latent receptors is regulated by TNF, 125I-TNF binding to control and TNF-pretreated membranes was assayed. Specific binding was increased by pretreatment with TNF (p less than 0.05), demonstrating that hepatic PM contains latent TNF receptors whose exposure is promoted by TNF. Homologous up-regulation of TNF receptors may, in part, be responsible for sustained hepatic responsiveness during chronic exposure to TNF."
