https://openalex.org/W2000342325,"One function of heterochromatin is the epigenetic silencing by sequestration of genes into transcriptionally repressed nuclear neighborhoods. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a major component of heterochromatin and thus is a candidate for establishing and maintaining the transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin structure. Here we demonstrate that maintenance of stable heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics correlate with the condensation level of chromatin and are dependent on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h. The chromodomain and the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in euchromatin and heterochromatin. These data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic competition model, and they demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to regulatory factors."

The first step in campylobacter pathogenesis is adherence to intestinal mucosa. We found that such binding was inhibited in vitro by human milk and, with high avidity, by α1,2-fucosylated carbohydrate moieties containing the H(O) blood group epitope (Fucα1,2Galβ1,4GlcNAc … ). In studies on the mechanism of adherence, campylobacter, which normally does not bind to Chinese hamster ovary cells, bound avidly when the cells were transfected with a human α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene that caused overexpression of H-2 antigen; binding was specifically inhibited by H-2 ligands (lectins Ulex europaeus and Lotus tetragonolobus and H-2 monoclonal antibody), H-2 mimetics, and human milk oligosaccharides. Human milk oligosaccharides inhibited campylobacter colonization of mice in vivo and human intestinal mucosa ex vivo. Campylobacter colonization of nursing mouse pups was inhibited if their dams had been transfected with a human α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene that caused expression of H(O) antigen in milk. We conclude that campylobacter binding to intestinal H-2 antigen is essential for infection. Milk fucosyloligosaccharides and specific fucosyl α1,2-linked molecules inhibit this binding and may represent a novel class of antimicrobial agents.

Thus, cell adherence and invasion are essential for the pathogenesis of campylobacter diarrhea. However, binding of host cell surface components by campylobacter is not as well defined as binding by other bacterial enteropathogens such as shigella, yersinia, and salmonella species (12Finlay B.B. Cossart P. Science. 1997; 276: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Although some campylobacter surface proteins associated with binding have been characterized and cloned (13Pei Z.H.

Furthermore, little is known about the host cell surface receptors for this organism.Cohort studies of Mexican children indicate that breast feeding protects against campylobacter diarrhea; milk-specific antibodies contribute to this protection (17Ruiz-Palacios G.M.

Pediatr. 1990; 116: 707-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but other anti-infective components also may be involved. Nonimmunoglobulin fractions of human milk protect against other respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections (18Howie P.W. Forsyth J.S. Ogston S.A. Clark A. Florey C., D. Br. Med. J. 1990; 300: 11-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Teele D.W. Klein J.O. Rosner B. J. Infect. Dis. 1989; 160: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). This protective effect is attributed to blocking activities by complex carbohydrate molecules in human milk, including glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides, which are able to function as soluble receptor analogs (20Newburg D.S. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).At high concentrations, l-fucose inhibits adherence of campylobacter to epithelial cells in vitro (21Cinco M. Banfi B. Ruaro E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 21: 347-351Google Scholar), suggesting that cell receptors for campylobacter may be fucosylated carbohydrate epitopes. Fucosylated oligosaccharide moieties that constitute some of the blood group antigens on erythrocytes are also present in gut epithelial cells and human milk (22Clausen H. Hakomori S. Vox Sang. 1989; 56: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Recently, these antigens have been shown to act as receptors for some enteropathogens,e.g. Lewisb (Leb) forHelicobacter pylori (23Falk P.G. Bry L. Holgersson J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Boren T. Falk P. Roth K.A. Larson G. Normark S.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the host cell receptor for campylobacter might contain a fucosylated epitope of a blood group antigen.This hypothesis was tested in three sets of experiments. The first set was conducted to determine whether the fucosylated oligosaccharide fraction of human milk inhibits campylobacter adherence to epithelial cells in vitro. The second set was conducted to clarify the nature of the host cell receptors involved. The third set of experiments tested biological significance: whether fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides inhibit campylobacter colonization of human intestinal mucosa ex vivo and mouse intestine in vivo, and whether the presence of 2-linked fucosylglycoconjugates in milk of mice transfected with pWAP α1,2-FUT1 inhibits campylobacter colonization in the intestine of their nursing pups. pWAP α1,2-FUT1 expresses H (O) antigen mainly in mammary gland during lactation.DISCUSSIONOur findings indicate that epithelial cell surface H blood group (fucosyl α1,2) epitopes serve as ligands tethering campylobacter to the intestinal mucosa in the essential first step of infection. Cell surface glycoconjugates have been implicated as mediators of cell-to-cell interactions, such as host cell adhesion, leukocyte adhesion and diapedesis. They also mediate adhesion by microbes (37Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar), as pathogenic bacteria have adapted to utilize these cell surface structures for attachment and invasion (6Fauchere J.L. Rosenau A. Veron M. Moyen E.N. Richard S. Pfister A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, campylobacter appears to exploit H(O) antigen, which is located in the intestinal mucosa and widely distributed among humans, to attach to and invade host cells. The H-antigen is a fucosylated structure (Fucα1,2Galβ1,3/4GlcNAc … ) whose expression is determined by the presence of either of two different α1,2-fucosyltransferases regulated primarily by the gene FUT1 (H) in red blood cells and vascular endothelium and by the gene FUT2 (Se) in exocrine secretions and intestinal mucosa (38Reguigne-Arnould I. Couillin P. Mollicone R. Faure S. Fletcher A. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. Oriol R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 71: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Bry L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although H-antigen participates in adhesive events during embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, cellular differentiation, and tumor metastasis (40Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2405-2414PubMed Google Scholar), its role in cell function is not fully defined.Human milk contains large amounts of fucosylated oligosaccharides with a wide array of structures, and the milk of most mothers contains α1,2-linked fucosyloligosaccharides as a prominent feature. The expression of the α1,2-linked epitope is determined by the presence of an active α1,2-fucosyltransferase in the mammary epithelium, which occurs in individuals with the dominant form of the secretor (FUT2) gene. The results presented here add to growing evidence that such fucosylated structures may be major components of the innate immune system of human milk. In the present investigation, they appear to serve as soluble ligands that compete with intestinal epithelial cell surface receptors for binding to campylobacter and other pathogens that target α1,2 ligands.Our solid phase assay confirmed the avidity of campylobacter binding to blood group antigens. The most virulent campylobacter strains bound to several related fucose-containing blood group antigens, but bound most strongly to H ligands. The ability of H moieties to act as campylobacter ligands was then confirmed in CHO cells transfected with the human α1,2-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT1, and expressing the fucosyl α1,2 phenotype. Pathogenic campylobacter strains bound to these cells, but not to identical cells transfected with a transferase gene that does not catalyze production of fucosyl α1,2-linkages or carrying the plasmid vector alone. Agents that specifically bind to H-2, such as mAbs, UEA I and Lotus tetragonolobus lectins, inhibited campylobacter binding toFUT1-transfected CHO cells, confirming that binding by pathogenic campylobacter requires the specific expression and availability of H-2 on its target. Finally, campylobacter binding to the transfected cells was inhibited by soluble H-2 mimetics,e.g. H-2 neoglycoprotein, fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk, and 2′-fucosyllactose, which presumably compete with the cell surface H-2 ligands by binding to the bacterium, inhibiting its ability to adhere to its receptor on the surface of transfected CHO cells. This finding establishes the specificity of campylobacter binding to H-2 antigen of the host cell.Experiments on the binding of pathogenic campylobacter strain 287ip to intact human intestine employed the nonpathogenic strain 57sp as a control. This strain, isolated from an asymptomatic child, did not bind to HEp-2 cells but, surprisingly, bound to intact human intestinal mucosa (though to a lesser extent than did 287ip). Also unexpected was the inhibition of 57sp binding by the milk oligosaccharide fraction. This strain may bind to a different epitope in the intestine, and its binding may be inhibited by components of the milk oligosaccharide mixture other than those containing H-2 epitope. This explanation is supported by 2′-fucosyllactose inhibiting the binding by the pathogenic strain, but not inhibiting the binding by the nonpathogenic strain. Thus, other epitopes of the intestinal epithelium may be important for the binding of other bacteria, including nonpathogenic strains. We are currently investigating several other pathogen/epitope pairs that are inhibited by other human milk glycoconjugates.The differential expression of H-2 blood group antigen at different sites in the gastrointestinal tract could explain features of the pathology of campylobacter diarrhea, e.g. localization of infection. Furthermore, the genotypes of any mother/infant dyad may lead to differences in infant intestinal expression of H(O) antigen and maternal expression of H(O) antigen in milk, and thus may define differences in individual infant's risk of campylobacter infection. Thus, if expression of this antigen in intestinal mucosa is related to its expression in blood, an individual's Lewis blood group type might indicate his or her level of susceptibility to campylobacter (25Ikehara Y. Nishihara S. Yasutomi H. Kitamura T. Matsuo K. Shimizu N. Inada K. Kodera Y. Yamamura Y. Narimatsu H. Hamajima N. Tatematsu M. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers. 2001; 10: 971-977PubMed Google Scholar). Heterogeneity of blood group glycan expression has been related to differential susceptibility to other pathogens. For example, epithelial cells from individuals of the recessive p blood group type do not express a receptor for uropathogenic Escherichia coli (41Kallenius G. Mollby R. Svensson S.B. Winberg J. Lundblad A. Svensson S. Cedergren B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 297Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar,42Lomberg H. Leffler H. Svanborg-Eden C. Lark D.L. Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions in Biological Systems. Academic Press, London1986: 235-238Google Scholar), and these people are resistant to urinary tract infections. Individuals who express less of the P blood group glycolipids in their erythrocytes more frequently develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (43Newburg D.S. Chaturvedi P. Lopez E.L. Devoto S. Fayad A. Cleary T.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 168: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nonsecretors, i.e. individuals who do not secrete certain fucosylated blood group antigens, are more susceptible to recurrent urinary tract infections (44Blackwell C.C. May S.J. Brettle R.P. MacCallum C.J. Weir D.M. Lark D.L. Protein-Carbohydrate Interactions in Biological Systems. Academic Press, London1986: 229-230Google Scholar), and to Candida albicansinfections. In human volunteers, persons with H(O) phenotype were significantly more likely to become infected with Norwalk virus (45Hutson A.M. Atmar R.L. Graham D.Y. Estes M.K. J. Infec. Dis. 2002; 185: 1335-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Susceptibility to cholera is strongly related to ABO status (46Glass R.I. Holmgren J. Haley C.E. Khan M.R. Svennerholm A.M. Stoll B.J. Belayet-Hossain K.M. Black R.E. Yunus M. Barua D. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1985; 121: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); although the molecular basis for this phenomenon has not yet been established, our preliminary investigations indicate that Vibrio cholerae also binds specifically to H(O) blood group antigen.We propose that the interaction of campylobacter with enterocytes entails a progression of events. The initial step, binding to the host cell H-2 epitope, may be common to several enteropathogens. Polyvalency of H-2 epitopes on the host cell surface may amplify the binding specificity and avidity for bacteria. Subsequent steps could be unique to each pathogen. Docking of campylobacter to an H-2-containing transmembrane glycoprotein is likely to trigger host cell events enabling campylobacter invasion, analogous to host cell events seen in other types of bacterial binding to enterocytes (12Finlay B.B. Cossart P. Science. 1997; 276: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 47Mitchell E. Houles C. Sudakevitz D. Wimmerova M. Gautier C. Perez S. Wu A.M. Gilboa-Garver N. Imberty A. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).If H-2 binding by campylobacter is an essential first step in the pathogenesis, then soluble ligands that contain the H-2 epitope would be expected to inhibit colonization and infection by this pathogenin vivo. Colonization of mice by pathogenic campylobacter was indeed reduced by several orders of magnitude if the innoculum was accompanied by human milk oligosaccharides.In a model that more closely resembles the nursing infant, mice were transfected with a WAP vector containing the FUT1 gene that is specifically expressed in the mammary gland during lactation. Large amounts of H-2 antigen are produced in the milks of homozygous dominant transfected mice; the milk of wild-type mice do not contain measurable H-2 antigen. Pups do not express this transfect because WAP expresses only in the actively lactating mammary gland. Pups nursing these transfected dams were strongly protected against intestinal colonization by campylobacter, while those nursing wild-type dams were not. This result not only reinforces that H-2 acts as the receptor for campylobacter, but shows also that soluble ligands containing H-2 epitopes in milk can protect young mammals from campylobacter infection. This experiment also strongly supports the concept that the large amount of H-2 epitopes found in human milk may represent an important component of the innate immune system of milk that can protect nursing infants against pathogens whose initial step of infection is contact with and adherence to intestinal mucosa.Our first mouse model confirms that human milk oligosaccharides contain structures that inhibit binding of campylobacter to its target cellin vivo. The protective activity resides in fucosyl oligosaccharides α1,2 structures, whose epitopes are shared by several blood group antigens. In human milk, the production of such fucosyl has long been attributed principally to the product of the secretor (FUT2) gene, another 2-fucosyltransferase. People with functional FUT2 have appreciable 2-linked fucosylated structures in their secretions, which include milk. However, homozygous recessive individuals for this trait do not produce appreciable fucosylated α1,2 structures in their milk. We are currently studying whether the breastfeeding children of mothers who produce less α1,2 oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates in their milk are at higher risk for campylobacter-associated diarrhea.Our finding that the neutral, fucosylated oligosaccharide fraction of human milk inhibits campylobacter binding to its target cells adds to the body of knowledge concerning the disease-specific, protective, nonimmunoglobulin components of human milk. Previous studies showed that the nonimmunoglobulin fractions of human milk protect against various gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urinary tract infections in breastfed children, and that this protection may be attributed to the pathogen-blocking activity of milk oligosaccharides (48Kunz C. Rudloff S. Acta Paediatr. 1993; 82: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 49Coppa G.V. Gabrielli O. Giorgi P. Catassi C. Montanari M.P. Varaldo P.E. Nichols B.L. Lancet. 1990; 335: 569-571Abstract PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, which probably number in the hundreds, if not thousands, also inhibit secretory diarrhea caused by the stable toxin of E. coli (27Newburg D.S. Pickering L.K. McCluer R.H. Cleary T.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 50Cleary T.G. Chambers J.P. Pickering L.K. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 1114-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 51Crane J.K. Azar S.S. Stam A. Newburg D.S. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 2358-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that human milk glycoconjugates include inhibitors of enteropathogens whose pathogenic mechanisms differ from those of campylobacter.In conclusion, a critical human intestinal ligand for campylobacter contains H-2 antigen, and human milk contains fucosylated oligosaccharides that inhibit campylobacter binding. An H-2 carbohydrate moiety may be the essential component of human milk that acts as a soluble receptor for campylobacter, thereby inhibiting binding of campylobacter to its intestinal receptors, the essential first step of its pathogenesis. The fucosyloligosaccharide concentrations in human milk were ample to inhibit campylobacter binding in vitro, in human intestine ex vivo, and in mice in vivo. Futhermore, when H-2 glycoconjugates are expressed in the milk of transgenic mice, their nursing pups are strongly protected from infection by virulently pathogenic campylobacter. These results strongly suggest that oligosaccharides in human milk contribute to protection of infants against C. jejuni and other enteric pathogens. Synthetic mimics of these oligosaccharides may become a novel class of prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents with mechanisms distinct from the current generation of antibiotics. Intestinal infection by Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of diarrhea worldwide and is the primary cause of ascending motor neuron paralysis (Guillain-Barré syndrome and other variants) (1Ruiz-Palacios G.M. Long S. Pickering L.K. Prober C.G. Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Diseases. Churchill Livingstone, Inc., New York1997: 987-996Google Scholar).

Recently, these antigens have been shown to act as receptors for some enteropathogens,e.g. Lewisb (Leb) forHelicobacter pylori (23Falk P.G. Bry L. Holgersson J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the host cell receptor for campylobacter might contain a fucosylated epitope of a blood group antigen. This hypothesis was tested in three sets of experiments. The first set was conducted to determine whether the fucosylated oligosaccharide fraction of human milk inhibits campylobacter adherence to epithelial cells in vitro. The second set was conducted to clarify the nature of the host cell receptors involved. The third set of experiments tested biological significance: whether fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides inhibit campylobacter colonization of human intestinal mucosa ex vivo and mouse intestine in vivo, and whether the presence of 2-linked fucosylglycoconjugates in milk of mice transfected with pWAP α1,2-FUT1 inhibits campylobacter colonization in the intestine of their nursing pups. pWAP α1,2-FUT1 expresses H (O) antigen mainly in mammary gland during lactation. DISCUSSIONOur findings indicate that epithelial cell surface H blood group (fucosyl α1,2) epitopes serve as ligands tethering campylobacter to the intestinal mucosa in the essential first step of infection. Cell surface glycoconjugates have been implicated as mediators of cell-to-cell interactions, such as host cell adhesion, leukocyte adhesion and diapedesis. They also mediate adhesion by microbes (37Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4963) Google Scholar), as pathogenic bacteria have adapted to utilize these cell surface structures for attachment and invasion (6Fauchere J.L.

Known amyloid inhibitors appear to function by shifting the aggregation equilibrium away from the amyloid state. Here, we describe a series of transthyretin amyloidosis inhibitors that functioned by increasing the kinetic barrier associated with misfolding, preventing amyloidogenesis by stabilizing the native state. The trans-suppressor mutation, threonine 119 --> methionine 119, which is known to ameliorate familial amyloid disease, also functioned through kinetic stabilization, implying that this small-molecule strategy should be effective in treating amyloid diseases."

Moreover, T cell activation greatly increased this mobility, indicating that such a process may facilitate (hetero)chromatin remodeling and permit access of epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors to the many genes that are consequently derepressed."

Allen S.W. Pharmacogen. J. 2001; 1: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Several other functions have been ascribed to hepatic P450s, including control of cholesterol and steroid hormone metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis (4Pikuleva I. Waterman M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1999; 20 (,43–37): 33-42PubMed Google Scholar). However, for certain of these pathways, the exact role of P450s in normal homeostasis is unknown. Over the last four decades, there have been significant advances in understanding the functions, genetics, and regulation of these enzymes and more recently their structure (5Omura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, a great deal remains to be learned about the expression and regulation of P450s, and their endogenous function(s), particularly in individual tissues. The size and diversity of the P450 multigene family results in great difficulties in dissecting out the function(s) of individual enzymes, particularly as many of those involved in foreign compound metabolism exhibit overlapping substrate specificities and may be expressed to a greater or lesser extent in almost every cell and tissue. The contribution that P450s in any particular tissue make to the overall pharmacokinetics of a drug is still, in the majority of cases, unknown. For example, the precise role of P450s in the metabolism of chemotherapaeutic agents, and the generation of side effects, remains unclear, as does the site of metabolism (either systemic (hepatic) or local (tumor site)), or both. To study further the involvement of P450s in the tissue specificity of drug metabolism would require the simultaneous deletion of multiple P450 genes, a process rendered impractical both by the large number of such genes and their location throughout the genome and our lack of knowledge about the regulation of tissue-specific P450 expression. However, all cytochrome P450s receive electrons from a single donor, cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, NADPH:ferrihemoprotein reductase, EC1.6.2.4) (6Goeptar A.R. Scheerens H. Vermeulen N.P. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1995; 25: 25-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Deletion of this protein would therefore inactivate all the P450s located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In view of the known requirement for P450 expression during development, a complete deletion of CPR was anticipated and has recently been shown to be embryonic lethal (8Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6536-6541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We therefore generated mice where CPR could be deleted in the postnatal period in any tissue, using the Cre/loxP system (9Le Y. Sauer B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 17: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Below, we describe the generation and characterization of mice carrying a deletion of hepatic CPR, and thus lacking P450 activity in the liver. Such mice exhibited many intriguing phenotypes, and remarkably they were viable and healthy. In addition, hepatic CPR-null mice had a severely compromised ability to metabolize the narcotic drug pentobarbital or the analgesic acetaminophen, demonstrating the predominant role of the hepatic P450 enzymes in the pharmacology and toxicology of these compounds and also demonstrating the power of this model for understanding P450 functions. A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed from a 12-kbSalI fragment, isolated from a mouse 129/Ola genomic library and containing exons 3–16 of the mouse CPR gene. A cassette, flanked by same orientation loxP sites and containing a selectable marker (neomycin (neo)), driven by the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) promoter, was inserted into anXhoI site in intron 4. A third loxP site was cloned into aBamHI site in intron 15. The correct arrangement of the construct and orientation of all three loxP sites was confirmed by detailed restriction mapping and sequence analysis. The construct was transfected into GK129/1 embryonic (ES) cells by electroporation, and the ES cells were subsequently cultured in 96-well plates and G418 selection applied. Eight G418-resistant clones were found to have undergone specific homologous recombination as demonstrated by Southern analysis, digesting genomic DNA with KpnI and using a 600-bp PCR fragment generated with primers 1105 (5′-GACCCTGAAGAGTATGACTTG-3′) and 1184 (5′-GCTTCCTCTTGCAAAACCACACTGC-3′) (Fig. 1a), and two of these correctly targeted ES cell clones (CPRlox/+) were expanded, injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and transferred into 2.5-day post-coitum (dpc) recipient pseudopregnant mice. Male chimera were bred to C57BL/6 mice, and heterozygous offspring were screened by Southern analysis to confirm germline transmission of the CPRlox/+ genotype. Five of these ES clones containing the CPRlox locus were transiently transfected with a vector containing the Cre recombinase gene (pMC1Cre). Colonies were obtained without selection and were isolated into a 96-well plate; after 3–4 days the plates were split into two duplicate plates, and after an additional 3–4 days one plate was frozen and the other further split. G418 selection was applied for up to 5 days to one of these plates in order to identify sensitive colonies. DNA was prepared from the duplicate plate after 3–4 days. ES clones (800) were tested by Southern blot analysis as described above. Nine of those clones screened showed excision of the floxed sequence including exons 5 to 15. Two of these ES cell clones (CPR+/−) were expanded and chimeric mice generated. Male chimera were bred to C57BL/6 mice and heterozygous offspring were screened by Southern blot analysis to confirm germline transmission. CPR+/− mice were maintained by random breeding with CPR+/+ mice on a 129P2xC57BL/6 genetic background. CPRlox/+ mice were crossed to produce homozygous CPRlox/lox mice and maintained by random breeding on a 129P2 × C57BL/6 genetic background. The CPRlox/lox line was bred with CPR+/− to generate a CPRlox/− line. A transgenic mouse line expressing Cre recombinase under control of the rat albumin promoter (10Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

The presence of the CreALB transgene was determined by PCR (data not shown). All mice were maintained under standard animal house conditions, with free access to food and water, and 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All mouse work was carried out in accordance with the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986), and after local ethical review. Pentobarbital sleep time-adult male CPRlox/lox + CreALB, CPRlox/−+ CreALB, CPRlox/− and CPR+/+ + CreALB mice (n = 3) were given a single intraperitoneal dose of pentobarbital (Sagatal) at 20 mg/kg of body weight. The time taken for the mice to lose, and subsequently to regain, their righting reflex was measured (11Brochet D. Chermat R. DeFeudis F.V. Drieu K. Gen. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mice still asleep 2 h after treatment were sacrificed as required by Home Office License. Acetaminophen treatment-adult male CPRlox/− + CreALB and CPR+/+ + CreALB mice were administered acetaminophen intraperitoneally at 300 mg/kg of body weight in phosphate-buffered saline. At 1, 5, 7, 17, and 24 h after treatment, mice were sacrificed (n = 4) by a rising concentration of CO2, and blood and tissues were taken for analysis. Microsomal fractions were prepared from frozen tissues by differential centrifugation (12Meehan R.R. Forrester L.M. Stevenson K. Hastie N.D. Buchmann A. Kunz H.W. Wolf C.R. Biochem.

Immunoreactivity was determined by chemiluminiscence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) and XAR5 autoradiographic film (Eastman Kodak). Glutathione levels were measured by the method of Sen et al., (16Sen C.K. Marin E. Kretzschmar M. Hanninen O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 73: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).

Serum was either analyzed immediately or stored at −70 °C for a period not exceeding 4 weeks. Analysis for serum alanine aminotransferase and cholesterol was carried out using commercially available kits (Infinity Reagents, Sigma, Poole, UK) on a Cobas Fara II centrifugal analyser (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tissue samples were either fixed in formalin/phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h and transferred to 80% ethanol for storage, or snap-frozen embedded in Cryo-M-Bed (Bright Instrument Co., Huntingdon) on cork discs and stored at −70 °C. Formalin-fixed samples were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or processed for immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody against rat CPR or various P450s (15Forrester L.M. Henderson C.J. Glancey M.J. Back D.J. Park B.K. Ball S.E. Kitteringham N.R. McLaren A.W. Miles J.S. Skett P. Wolf C.R. Biochem.

Snap-frozen tissue samples were cryosectioned and processed for staining with Oil Red O to determine lipid content. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statview program (v4.5) for Macintosh, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA. Fig.1a illustrates the targeting strategy adopted in this study. Correct integration of the floxed CPR targeting construct was confirmed by Southern analysis (Fig.1b) of genomic DNA isolated from CPRlox/+ mice (lanes 1 and 5 (9.2/8-kb bands), while the pattern obtained from a wild-type mouse (CPR+/+) is shown in lane 2 (8-kb band only). Genomic DNA of mice generated from ES cells in which Cre recombinase had been transiently expressed, resulted in deletion of the CPR gene between the first and third loxP sites (Fig. 1b, lane 6(CPR+/−, 8/3.2-kb bands)). Mice homozygous for the floxed CPR locus (CPRlox/lox) or with one floxed and one deleted CPR allele (CPRlox/−) were generated by mating of appropriate mouse lines. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from these mice is shown in lanes 7 and 8(CPRlox/lox, 9.2-kb band only) and in lanes 3and 4 CPRlox/−, 9.2/3.2 kb). These latter mice were apparently completely normal, displaying no phenotypic differences from wild-type littermates: their growth and development, blood chemistry, organ size and structure, and fertility were identical (data not shown). Specific hepatic deletion of CPR was achieved by crossing CPRlox/lox mice into a line where Cre expression was regulated by the rat albumin promoter (10Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Mice identified as CPRlox/+ + CreALB were either backcrossed with CPRlox/lox mice to generate a CPRlox/lox + CreALB line, or crossed with CPR heterozygous nulls (CPR+/−) to generate CPRlox/− + CreALB mice. The presence of the CreALB transgene was determined by PCR (data not shown). Offspring born from either of these crosses were found in Mendelian proportions as predicted from parental genotype, indicating there was no embryonic lethality from opportunistic expression of the Cre transgene during development. As the albumin promoter becomes active neonatally, (10Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) we investigated hepatic CPR levels in adult mice, i.e. from 6 to 8 weeks of age. CPRlox/− + CreALB and CPRlox/lox + CreALB mice displayed no overt phenotypic differences from their wild-type littermates in the postnatal period: mice of these genotypes grew and developed normally. In mice where one CPR allele had been deleted, only half the expression of CPR was found in both males and females (Fig.2a, liver, tracks 2and 3 versus 4 and 5 and tracks 7 and 8 versus 9 and 10). In mice of genotype CPRlox/− + CreALB, an immunoreactive CPR protein band was essentially absent in both males and females (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 and 6, respectively), indicating an almost complete lack of CPR protein in the microsomal fractions of the livers of these animals. Upon prolonged exposure (>10-fold normal) of the immunoblot shown in Fig. 2a, a very faint band corresponding to the correct molecular weight for CPR could be seen (not shown). Hepatic CPR activity in CPRlox/− + CreALB mice was reduced by more than 90% in both males (92.5%) and females (94.5%), and similar reductions were observed in hepatic microsomes from CPRlox/lox + CreALB mice of both sexes (Fig.2b). The activity of cytochrome b5reductase, an enzyme that could conceivably transfer electrons from NADH to the P450 system (18Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Manning N.J. Kaderbhai M.A. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was unchanged (not shown). In liver sections from CPR hepatic-null mice stained with a polyclonal antiserum to CPR, only a very few cells contained immunoreactive protein (Fig.2c), in contrast to the wild-type mice where CPR immunostaining was extensive across the entire section. The specificity of the CPR deletion was demonstrated by showing that no change was observed in CPR expression in the kidneys of CPRlox/+ + CreALB, CPRlox/+ and CPR+/+ + CreALB mice in both sexes (Fig.2a, kidney; lanes 3–5 ♂ and 8–10♀). A reduction in CPR protein level of ∼50% was seen in CPRlox/− + CreALB and in CPRlox/−mice was observed (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 and 2 ♂ and 6 and 7 ♀) in offspring missing only one CPR allele. Generally, protein expression reflected the CPR activity (Fig. 2b) in kidney microsomal fractions, with no significant difference in CPR activity between CPR+/+ + CreALB and CPRlox/lox + CreALB mice of either sex, while CPR activity was lower in CPRlox/− + CreALB mice, significantly so in males. Further confirmation of the tissue-specific nature of the CPR deletion was demonstrated by immunostaining kidney and lung sections from CPRlox/− + CreALB and CPR+/+ + CreALB mice with CPR antiserum (Fig.2c), where the staining was the same in both lines. Hepatic CPR-null mice exhibited no overt phenotypic differences to controls. The mice grew at the same rate as their wild-type counterparts, and there was no change in survival rates or behavior (data not shown). Interestingly, although CPR hepatic-null mice exhibited normal fertility when mated to wild-type (CPR+/+ or CPRlox/lox) mice, when crossed with each other (CPRlox/− + CreALB × CPRlox/− + CreALB or CPRlox/lox + CreALB × CPRlox/lox + CreALB), both fertility and litter size were reduced (data not shown): the reason(s) for this remain unclear. Post-mortem examination revealed that both male and female hepatic CPR-nulls displayed hepatomegaly, the liver being almost doubled in size, in relation to body weight (7.5%), compared with wild-type mice (4%). Furthermore, the liver was pale in color, and the tissue was mottled and friable (Fig. 3, aand b). Microscopic examination revealed the presence of microvisicular and macrovisicular fatty changes, the former predominating (Fig. 3c, plates i and v versus iii and vii). Otherwise, hepatocytes in both the centrizonal and periportal regions appeared normal, with no apparent increase in hepatocyte proliferation or apoptosis. The livers of mice lacking hepatic CPR were hyperlipidaemic, as evidenced by staining with Oil Red O (Fig. 3c, plates ii and vi versus iv and viii). The increase in hepatic lipid was accompanied by a 90% reduction in the volume of bile acids in the gall bladder in hepatic CPR-null mice, compared with wild-type animals (Fig.3d), and a 65% reduction in the level of serum cholesterol (Fig. 3e) and a 50% reduction in serum triglycerides (Fig. 3f). It is interesting to note that these mice also had a slight but significantly elevated serum ALT, indicating a low level of liver damage or an altered rate of hepatocyte turnover (data not shown). In order to determine the effect of CPR deletion on hepatic P450 monoxygenase activities, we measured the microsomal hydroxylation of testosterone (TableI). When expressed as pmol of metabolite per nmol of P450, a 90% reduction in the formation of 6β-hydroxytestosterone, an activity associated with CYP3A proteins, was measured in both males and females, indicating that a lack of CPR in this tissue resulted in severely compromised P450 function. The 7α-hydroxylation of testosterone, catalyzed by P450s of the CYP2A subfamily, was decreased by >99% in both males and females, while 16β-hydroxylation was undetectable in hepatic CPR-nulls of both sexes. In addition to the marked reduction in testosterone metabolism, the O-dealkylation of 7-methoxyresorufin was also almost completely ablated in CPRlox/− + CreALB mice, being reduced by 99.5% in males and 98.5% in females, when expressed as nmol of metabolite per nmol of P450 (not shown). It is thus clear that hepatic deletion of CPR results in the inactivation of multiple P450s in the liver.Table ITestosterone hydroxylation by hepatic microsomes from hepatic CPR-null and wild-type mice6β-OH7α-OH16β-OHMaleCPR+/+ + CrcALB542.09 ± 75.09461.68 ± 71.43256.26 ± 28.67CPRlox/lox + CreALB46.36 ± 9.153.34 ± 0.750(8.5%)(0.72%)(0%)FemaleCPR+/+ + CreALB484.08 ± 122.071736.2 ± 397.52298.74 ± 59.56CPRlox/lox + CreALB48.85 ± 7.5513.65 ± 7.480(10.09%)(0.79%)(0%)Testosterone 6β, 7α, and 16β hydroxylation in liver microsomes from CPR+/+ + CreALB and CPRlox/lox + CreALB mice.

Numbers in parentheses represent % activity in samples relative to wild-type, which is 100%. Assay carried out in duplicate (n = 4). Intriguingly, mice lacking hepatic CPR exhibited a profound increase in cytochrome P450 content; in males the increase was 450%, while in females it was greater than 500% (Fig. 4a). This large increase in P450 expression was further demonstrated by immunoblotting of hepatic microsomes with antisera to P450s from different gene families (Fig. 4b). For certain of the enzymes,e.g. members of CYP2B and CYP3A gene families, the induction was at least as much as observed when potent exogenous P450 inducers are administered to mice. Hepatic immunostaining clearly showed that while expression of CYP3A P450s was confined to the perivenous or centrilobular area in wild-type mice, as has been previously reported (19Oinonen T. Lindros K.O. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20Wolf C.R. Moll E. Friedberg T. Oesch F. Buchmann A. Kuhlmann W.D. Kunz H.W. Carcinogenesis. 1984; 5: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), in null mice CYP3A was localized throughout the section at high levels (Fig. 4c). Acetaminophen was administered as a single intraperitoneal dose (300 mg/kg of body weight) to male wild-type and hepatic CPR-null mice (Fig. 5, a and b). In wild-type mice, a 90% decrease in hepatic glutathione occurred within one hour of administration (Fig.5a), whereas the level remained unchanged in hepatic CPR-nulls. Furthermore, 24 h after treatment, wild-type mice showed a marked rise in serum ALT, indicative of extensive, potentially fatal, liver damage, whereas in mice lacking hepatic CPR ALT remained unchanged. Intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight failed to induce sleep in wild-type mice; however, mice lacking hepatic CPR, of genotype CPRlox/− + CreALB or CPRlox/lox + CreALB, slept for a period in excess of 2 h (Fig.5c). At this point it was necessary to humanely cull the mice under the terms of our Home Office License granted under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Pentobarbital treatment of CPR heterozygous null mice (CPR+/−), i.e.lacking one CPR allele and therefore having ∼50% less CPR activity, resulted in an average sleeping period of ∼50 min. CPR is a multidomain protein containing NADPH/flavinadeninedinucleotide (FAD) and flavinmononucleotide (FMN) binding domains (7Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21Modi S. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Smith G.C. Paine M. Wolf C.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 476SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). When expressed in Escherichia coli, these domains fold to form a functional polypeptide, which can, in the case of the FAD domain, independently catalyze the one electron reduction of a number of foreign compounds (7Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For this reason, the targeting construct was designed to ensure deletion of both of these domains (Fig. 1a), and also utilized Cre/loxP to allow the conditional deletion of CPR and circumvent the anticipated embryonic lethality of a complete CPR knockout (8Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6536-6541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The data presented in the current study is based on the generation of mice from targeted ES cells such that these mice retain all three loxP sites and the selectable marker, as shown in Fig. 1a, either at both CPR alleles (CPRlox/lox) or at one allele with the other CPR allele deleted (CPRlox/−), tissue-specific deletion being achieved by crossing in the CreALB transgene. The CreALB transgene has previously been shown to work with high efficiency in other systems, and in this study resulted in a reduction in hepatic CPR activity of more than 90% in both males and females (Fig. 2b) by 6–8 weeks postpartum. The residual CPR activity observed in hepatic microsomal preparations from CPR hepatic-null mice could be explained by the restriction of albumin promoter activity (and thus Cre recombinase expression) to hepatocytes (10Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) leaving CPR activity undiminished in other liver cell types. This would also account for the CPR immunostaining observed in individual cells in liver sections (Fig. 2c). A further explanation could lie with an alternative electron donor to P450s, i.e.the cytochrome b5/NADH b5 reductase system. CPR has recently been reported to be deleted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and such altered yeast are apparently able to survive by using the cytochrome b5/NADH reductase system to supply both electrons to the P450 during the catalytic cycle (18Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Manning N.J. Kaderbhai M.A. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, although cytochrome b5 has been implicated as participating in the electron transfer cycle for P450s, often resulting in higher P450 activity (22Voice M.W. Zhang Y. Wolf C.R. Burchell B. Friedberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), cytochromeb5 has classically been deemed capable of undertaking transfer of the second, but not the first, electron in the P450 catalytic cycle, and this would seem to be confirmed by the embryonic lethality observed in homozygous CPR-null mice (8Shen A.L.

Previous studies on the cloned nSMase1 had shown that the protein acts primarily as lyso-platelet-activating factor-phospholipase C. Recently the cloning of another putative N-SMase, nSMase2, was reported. In this study, biochemical characterization of the mouse nSMase2 was carried out using the overexpressed protein in yeast cells in which the inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (Isc1p) was deleted. N-SMase activity was dependent on Mg2+ and was activated by phosphatidylserine and inhibited by GW4869. The ability of nSMase2 to recognize endogenous sphingomyelin (SM) as substrate was investigated by overexpressing nSMase2 in MCF7 cells. Mass measurements showed a 40% decrease in the SM levels in the overexpressor cells, and labeling studies demonstrated that nSMase2 accelerated SM catabolism. Accordingly, ceramide measurement showed a 60 ± 15% increase in nSMase2-overexpressing cells compared with the vector-transfected MCF7. The role of nSMase2 in cell growth was next investigated. Stable overexpression of nSMase2 resulted in a 30–40% decrease in the rate of growth at the late exponential phase. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor induced ∼50% activation of nSMase2 in MCF7 cells overexpressing the enzyme, demonstrating that nSMase2 is a tumor necrosis factor-responsive enzyme. In conclusion, these results 1) show that nSMase2 is a structural gene for nSMase, 2) suggest that nSMase2 acts as a bona fide N-SMase in cells, and 3) implicate nSMase2 in the regulation of cell growth and cell signaling.

Sphingolipid metabolites are now recognized as important components in signal transduction, not only in mammalian cells but also in yeast where they are implicated in heat stress responses. Ceramide, a major sphingolipid metabolite, has been shown to play important roles in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Recently, GW4869 was developed as an inhibitor for N-SMase, and it was shown to inhibit TNF-induced activation of N-SMase in MCF7 cells. GW4869 showed no inhibitory activity on other hydrolytic enzymes, such as A-SMase, and it showed significantly higher activity against the rat brain enzyme compared with the human lyso-PAF PLC (17Luberto C.

In fact, we demonstrated that, in cells, nSMase1 functions as a lysophospholipase C and not as a SMase (21Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and this is supported by multiple studies showing that the enzyme shows similar activity in vitro toward SM and lysophosphatidylcholine or lyso-platelet-activating factor (lyso-PAF) (21Sawai H.

The only remaining point is what is the real metabolic function of nSMase1. Studies on the nSMase1 knock out mouse (26Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in which cells were labeled with acetate or lyso-PC did not show changes in sphingomyelin or other lipids. Further studies are required to determine conclusively the metabolic function of nSMase1 and its role in lyso-PAF metabolism. On the other hand, the only published study on nSMase2 demonstrates that it is regulated by PS, and it is abundant in brain (20Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), consistent with the basic properties of the partially purified N-SMase from rat (27Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K.

In light of these studies, we investigated in this work the hypothesis that nSMase2 functions as an endogenous SMase in cells. The goals of this work are as follows: (a) to establish that nSMase2 is a structural gene for sphingomyelinase; (b) to determine the biochemical properties of this enzyme; (c) to investigate the endogenous and physiological substrates of nSMase2 through in vitro and cell studies; (d) to determine whether nSMase2 is a target for GW4869; and (e) to begin defining biological roles for this enzyme.

Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the microsomal and cytosolic fractions. For the studies on cation and lipid effects, and substrate requirements of nSMase2, membranes were delipidated by incubation in lysis buffer in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 90 min, and the supernatant was used for enzymatic determinations. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. MCF7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. nSMase2 cDNA cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (Stratagene) was transfected into MCF7 cells by using the Superfect reagent from Qiagen (30Birbes H.

For the selection of stable transfectants, 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the medium. Independent colonies were picked and cultured in separate wells, and three clones (1, 5, and 30) from single cells expressing the highest N-SMase activity in vitro were used as nSMase2 overexpressors. Reproducible results were obtained with the three clones analyzed for all the assays. Cells were lysed by syringe passage in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A, and post-nuclear lysate (800 × g for 5 min) and supernatant were used for the assay. Proteins (0.5 or 10 μg) from yeast or MCF7 overexpressors were added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm[choline-methyl-14C]SM (10 cpm/pmol). PS was used in the assay at the indicated concentrations. The final volume was adjusted to 200 μl with 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1); the phases were separated by addition of 200 μl of water, and 400 μl of the upper phase was mixed with 4 ml of Safety Solve (Research Products International) for liquid scintillation counting. The assay was performed as described for the N-SMase assay except that the reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The assay was performed as described for the N-SMase assay except that the reaction mixture contained no phosphatidylserine and 100 μm[choline-methyl-14C]PC (10 cpm/pmol) instead of SM. Cell lysate (1–5 μg) was added to 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm1-O-octadecyl-3H-lyso-PAF (20 dpm/pmol) in a final volume of 200 μl. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC in solvent system A (chloroform, methanol, 2n NH4OH, 60:35:5). The TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Biomax MR autoradiographic (Eastman Kodak Co.) films at 80 °C for 4 days. The band corresponding to monoalkylglycerol was identified by comparison to standard and scraped from the TLC plate for liquid scintillation counting. The assay was performed as described for the lyso-PAF-PLC assay except that the reaction mixture contained 100 μm 1-O-octadecyl-3H-PAF (20 dpm/pmol) instead of lyso-PAF. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (32Sawai H. Okazaki T. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Kishi S. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2452-2458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by a 7% SDS-PAGE for analysis of nSMase2. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% dried milk. Proteins were then identified by incubating with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h and 1:3000 dilution of anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 45 min. The signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to Biomax MR film. Cellular lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar), and aliquots of 200 μl were used for phosphorous determination (33Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the measurement of SM, the lipids in chloroform were mixed with the same volume of 0.2n NaOH in methanol and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The phases were separated by the addition of 0.45 volume of 0.2n HCl. Lipids were separated by TLC in solvent system B (chloroform, methanol, 15 mm CaCl2, 60:35:8) and visualized with iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to SM and PC were scraped. Lipids were extracted from the silica gel, and the mass of lipid phosphate was determined as described (33Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 0.3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish in 8 ml of complete growth medium. The next day, the cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (0.5 μCi/ml final concentration in 10 ml of growth medium/plate) for ∼60 h. The cells were then chased with 10 ml of complete medium, and at the indicated time points, the medium from each plate was collected, and the cells were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped on ice in 2 ml of PBS, and each plate was washed with an additional 2 ml of PBS. Cells and washes were pooled with the medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g (4 °C). Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar), and aliquots of 250 μl were used for phosphorous and SM determination as described by Andrieu et al. (34Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in methanol, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar). The chloroform organic phase was divided into aliquots (in duplicates) and dried down for ceramide and phosphate measurements. Ceramide levels were evaluated using the Escherichia colidiacylglycerol kinase assay. Ceramide was quantitated using external standards and normalized to phosphorous content (33Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For labeling with [3H]palmitic acid, 2 × 106 cells were incubated with 5 μCi of [3H]palmitic in 10 ml of medium for 24 or 48 h. For labeling with 1-O-octadecyl-3H-lyso-PAF, medium was replaced by serum-free medium, and then cells were incubated with either 1 μCi/ml 3H-lyso-PAF or 3H-PAF for the indicated times. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC in solvent system B. Cells (3 × 103/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate in 100 μl of RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At the indicated time points, 25 μl of MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (10% SDS in 0.01 mol/liter HCl) to each well and incubated at room temperature overnight. The production of the formazan dye was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm with a multiwell plate reader. The effects of nSMase2 overexpression on cell growth were determined by the trypan blue exclusion method as described (35Zhang J. Reedy M.C. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was examined by detection of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (36Rao J. Otto W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded at 50 × 103 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 12 h in serum-free media and 12 h in 0.5% serum, the cells were grown for 96 h in 10% SFB RPMI and pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in the growth medium for 1 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 2 ml of 0.5% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 20 min. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates in the wells were then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1m NaOH, and after neutralization with 1 m HCl, 200 μl were counted in a scintillation counter. Delipidated or non-delipidated microsome fractions from yeast overexpressing nSMase2 were incubated in the absence or presence of GW4869 at the indicated concentrations. SM hydrolysis was determined as described above, in the presence of the indicated concentrations of PS. The suspension was mixed and warmed at 37 °C until clear. Control membranes were treated with Me2SO containing 5% methanesulfonic acid, similarly to the samples receiving the highest dose of GW4869 solution. In all assays, 30 min of preincubation at 37 °C with the membranes preceded the addition of the substrate. In order to establish that nSMase2 is a structural gene for neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase), we expressed nSMase2 into the JK9-3d yeast (MATa/α trp1 leu2-3 his4 ura3 ade2rme1) strain deleted in ISC1 that encodes for an endogenous inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (Isc1p), as Isc1p shows robust SMase activity and its deletion removes SMase activity from yeast (37Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Luberto C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, overexpression of nSMase2 in the deletion strain showed higher activity than the vector-transfected cells. SMase activity was greatly reduced at acidic pH (0.57 nmol/μg/h), compared with neutral pH (Table I), indicating a neutral pH optimum. Phospholipase activity on PC was very low in lysates of both vector transfectant and nSMase2-overexpressing cells, demonstrating that PC is not a substrate of this enzyme (Table I). In addition, the yeast inositol phosphosphingolipids (inositol phosphorylceramide, mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide, and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide) were not utilized by the enzyme as substrates. 2S. Vaena de Avalos and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished observations. When cell lysates from the overexpressors were fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, in the presence of 50 μm PS (3.3 mol %) the highest specific activity was detected in the pellet fraction (Fig.1A), and only 20% of the total activity was found in the supernatant. The presence of the FLAG-tagged nSMase2 was confirmed in the microsomal fraction at ∼78 kDa by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.1B). Indeed, analysis of the amino acid sequence of the nSMase2 reve"

Signal transduction in prokaryotes was previously thought to occur primarily by histidine kinases, involved in two-component signaling pathways. Lately, bacterial homologues of eukaryotic-type serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases have been found to be necessary for cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, pathogenicity, and secondary metabolism. The Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci, GBS) is an important human pathogen. We have identified and characterized a eukaryotic-type serine/threonine protein kinase (Stk1) and its cognate phosphatase (Stp1) in GBS. Biochemical assays revealed that Stk1 has kinase activity and localizes to the membrane and that Stp1 is a soluble protein with manganese-dependent phosphatase activity on Stk1. Mutations in these genes exhibited pleiotropic effects on growth, virulence, and cell segregation of GBS. Complementation of these mutations restored the wild type phenotype linking these genes to the regulation of various cellular processes in GBS. In vitro phosphorylation of cell extracts from wild type and mutant strains revealed that Stk1 is essential for phosphorylation of six GBS proteins. We have identified the predominant endogenous substrate of both Stk1 and Stp1 as a manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase (PpaC) by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. These results suggest that these eukaryotic-type enzymes regulate pyrophosphatase activity and other cellular functions of S. agalactiae.

Protein phosphorylation is a principal mechanism of signal transduction governing various cellular processes such as physiology, growth, and development. Regulation of protein function or enzyme activity by covalent and reversible phosphorylation is crucial for the regulation of cellular responses of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes to dynamic internal and external environmental conditions. Signal transduction in prokaryotes was thought to occur primarily by histidine kinases that activate transcription by phosphorylation of cognate response regulators at aspartate residues (1Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by serine kinases have also been described in prokaryotes. Examples of signal transduction by serine kinases, specifically in Gram-positives, include the well characterized and novel HPr system with bifunctional kinase/phosphatase activity necessary for carbon catabolite repression (for review, see Ref. 2Saier Jr., M.H. Chauvaux S. Cook G.M. Deutscher J. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Ye J.J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and the isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase system (3LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Other examples of serine phosphorylation involves cognate pairs of kinases and phosphatases that regulate stress responses in Bacillus subtilis (5Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M. Price C.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although these serine kinases are homologous to the two-component histidine kinases (6Kennelly J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SpoIIE, which regulates sporulation in B. subtilis, is homologous to eukaryotic-type protein phosphatases (7Adler E. Donella-Deana A. Arigoni F. Pinna L.A. Stragier P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In eukaryotes, reversible protein phosphorylation via serine, threonine, and tyrosine protein kinases and phosphatases is essential for cell cycle control, cell type determination, and differentiation (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar).

Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) has sparked interest in the function and evolution of these eukaroytic-type signal transduction systems in prokaryotes. It has been described that mutations in STK homologues in Myxococcussp., Streptomyces sp., and other spore-forming bacteria cause premature sporulation or abnormal development (for reviews, see Refs. 19Zhang C.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 20Bakal C.J. Davies E.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic-type STK essential for virulence was reported in Yersinia psuedotuberculosis (21Galyov E.E. Hankansson S. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Nature. 1993; 361: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) andPseudomonas aeruginosa (22Wang J. Li C. Yang H. Mushegian A. Jin S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6764-6768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Yersinia STK (YpkA) is distinct from other prokaryotic homologues because kinase activation occurs only upon binding to host cytoplasmic factors such as actin (23Hakansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A number of STK have also been described inMycobacterium tuberculosis (25Av-Gay Y. Davies J. Microb. Comp.

However, the phenotypes of mutations in these genes and their biological role in pathogenesis have yet to be reported.Eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatases (STP) have been classified into two distinct structural families: PP1/2A/2B and PP2C. These phosphatases are defined by their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures (for review, see Refs. 28Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 21: 331-338Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar and 29Villafranca J.E. Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1996; 7: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The action of cognate pairs of eukaryotic kinases and phosphatases tightly regulate functions of target proteins (30Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). The existence of STP was also presumed to be exclusive to eukaryotes; however, bacterial homologues of eukaryotic-type STP have been described (31Bork P. Brown N.P. Hegyi H. Schultz J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SppA inStreptomyces coelicolor (32Umeyama T, N.A. Horinouchi S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Pph1 in M. xanthus (33Treuner-Lange A. Ward M.J. Zusman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are PP2C-type STP that are important for vegetative growth and development. A recent study on a eukaryotic-type STK and STP in B. subtilis indicated the requirement of these enzymes for normal biofilm and spore formation (17Madec E. Laszkiewicz A. Iwanicki A. Obuchowski M. Séror S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although STK and STP have been identified and biochemically characterized in a number of prokaryotes, their functions are not well understood because of the lack of information on their endogenous phosphorylation targets and activating signals.Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci, GBS) are Gram-positive cocci that are the causal agents of human neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. GBS is also an emerging pathogen in immunocompromised adults (34Schuchat A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 497-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic-type STK and STP have not been reported in the Gram-positive pathogenic cocci such asStreptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., andEnterococcus sp., although recent advances in genome analysis have revealed the presence of their putative homologues. The role of signal transduction pathways essential for regulation of GBS growth in response to environmental conditions, e.g. during infection, have not been thoroughly elucidated. A few virulence determinants of GBS like capsular polysaccharide β-hemolysin and CAMP factor have been described (for review, see Ref. 35Nizet V. Ferrieri P. Rubens C. Stevens D.L. Kaplan E.L. Streptococcal Infections, Clinical Aspects, Microbiology and Molecular Pathogenesis. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 180-221Google Scholar). Recent reports on GBS demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation by CpsD regulates capsular polysaccharide production (36Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation of virulence factors by signal transduction mechanisms.In this study, we describe the existence of a eukaryotic-type serine/threonine kinase (Stk1) and its cognate phosphatase (Stp1) in GBS. Mutants defective for Stk1 or both Stp1 and Stk1 expression exhibit pleiotropic effects on growth, cell segregation, and virulence, suggesting an important role for these enzymes in the regulation of various cellular processes. The kinase and its cognate phosphatase are also essential for reversible phosphorylation of a manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase (PpaC). These studies suggest that one of the functions of these eukaryotic-type enzymes is to regulate pyrophosphatase (PpaC) activity in GBS.RESULTSIdentification of Stk1 and Stp1In a study to identify secreted and membrane-associated proteins of GBS, we cloned random fragments of GBS chromosomal DNA, downstream to the promoter of the Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase gene phoZ in the plasmid pAN200, as described previously (Ref. 41Lee M. Nittayajarn A. Ross P. Rothschild C. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Rubens C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5790-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; also see “Experimental Procedures”). ThephoZ gene in pAN200 lacks its endogenous signal sequence (41Lee M. Nittayajarn A. Ross P. Rothschild C. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Rubens C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5790-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli colonies containing recombinant pAN200 plasmids with ORFs that either encode a signal sequence or hydrophobic domain enable secretion of the alkaline phosphatase and are blue on XP agar (41Lee M. Nittayajarn A. Ross P. Rothschild C. Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Rubens C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5790-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids from approximately 60 independent blue colonies were sequenced, and a number of ORFs of GBS that either encoded secretion signals or transmembrane domains were identified (data not shown). Interestingly, one of these clones showed homology to prokaryotic homologues of eukaryotic-type STK. The portion of the STK gene cloned in pAN200 was ∼0.53 kb in length and comprises a transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids (indicated by solid lines in Fig.1B). A combination of arbitrary primed PCR amplification (57O'Toole G. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar) and genomic DNA sequencing was used to further analyze the ORF encoding the STK and to identify other ORFs in this region (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encoding STK (stk1) spans a region of 1.81 kb with a predicted gene product of 69.0 kDa. Stk1 does not posses a signal sequence, indicating that the protein is not secreted. The N-terminal region contains the consensus Hanks' XI domains (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar), identified as the catalytic domain of eukaryotic STK. A homology sequence alignment of Stk1 with other prokaryotic and eukaryotic STK is shown in Fig. 1B. The predicted transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids (amino acids 345–368, identified in the pAN200 clone) is located at the C terminus of Stk1, which presumably localizes the Stk1 protein to the cell membrane of GBS (Fig. 1, A and B). Topology analysis predicted that Stk1, similar to other membrane-associated STK, localizes to the cytoplasmic membrane. The analysis also predicted that the N-terminal region of Stk1 is located within the cytoplasm and that the C-terminal domain is extracellular.Figure 1A, physical map of the serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase operon in GBS. The thick arrowsdenote ORFs. Promoter and terminator regions are represented asP and T, respectively. The genes sunL,stp1, and stk1 encode RNA methyltransferase, PP2C phosphatase, and serine/threonine kinase, respectively. The genehk1 encodes a histidine kinase, and the question mark indicates an ORF with no homology to the data base. TMdenotes transmembrane domain, and I–XI denote Hanks' conserved domains. Primer 1 was designed toward coding regions instp1, and primers 2 and 3 corresponds to coding regions instk1. The lower panel shows co-transcription ofstp1 and stk1 in GBS. Primer 3 was used to amplify stk1-specific cDNA from total RNA.

Sequence alignment revealed XI conserved domains in Stp1, observed in all PP2C-type protein phosphatases (58Shi L. Potts M. Kennelly P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 229-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For homology sequence alignment see Fig.1C. The gene stp1 encodes a putative cytoplasmic protein of 26.5 kDa. There is a one-base overlap in the ORFs ofstp1 and stk1, suggesting that the genes are co-transcribed. The putative promoter sequence for these genes, −10 (TATAAT) and −35 (TTGACA) were identified within the 3′ end of the gene for RNA methyl transferase (sunL), upstream tostp1. Putative terminator sequences were identified downstream of stk1 (Fig. 1A).Co-transcription of stp1 and stk1Sequence analysis revealed a one-nucleotide overlap between the ORFs of Stp1 and Stk1; it therefore seemed likely that the genesstp1 and stk1 might be co-transcribed. To test this hypothesis, we performed reverse transcriptase PCR analysis as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.1A, primer 3 was used to amplify stk1 specific cDNA from RNA isolated at early and mid-log phase cultures, respectively. The internal primers 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A) were subsequently used to amplify the PCR product from the templatestk1 cDNA. Lanes 1 and 3 in Fig.1A represent RNA isolated from early and mid-log phase cultures of WT GBS. A PCR product of 915 bp is observed in these lanes that is also seen in the DNA control (i.e. lane 5). Corresponding negative control reactions were also performed on RNA without reverse transcriptase (lanes 2 and 4). This confirms that stp1 and stk1 are co-transcribed and suggests that these genes might be regulated in a similar manner.Stk1 Is a Functional Serine/Threonine KinaseTo characterize the biochemical function of Stk1, we constructed an N-terminal GST fusion to stk1. The fusion protein (rStk1) was purified using GST-Sepharose and had the expected molecular mass of 96 kDa. To determine whether Stk1, like most STK, would autophosphorylate in vitro, autophosphorylation reactions were performed in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the products were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. A 96-kDa phosphorylated protein was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 1), indicating rStk1 was capable of autophosphorylation, in contrast to the control GST protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2).Figure 2Stk1 has serine/threonine kinase activity. Autophosphorylation of Stk1. Autophosphorylation reactions were performed by the addition of 2 μg of rStk1 or control GST protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, respectively. The reaction was stopped after 15 min, and the products were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.A, lane 1 shows autophosphorylation of rStk1, andlane 2 represents control GST protein. Positions and molecular masses (kDa) of protein standards are indicated on theleft. B, serine residues are phosphorylated in Stk1. C and D, Stk1 phosphorylates casein and myelin basic protein at threonine residues. Phosphorylation of rStk1, casein, and myelin basic protein was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylated proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl and subjected to two-dimensional, ascending thin layer chromatography. The open circles denote the positions of the nonradioactive phosphoamino acid standards identified by ninhydrin staining. pS, phosphoserine;pT, phosphothreonine; pY, phosphotyrosine. The plates were subsequently exposed to autoradiography. Thenumbers and the arrows indicate the first and second dimensions used for separation of the phosphoamino acids, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the phosphorylated amino acid residues in rStk1, the radiolabeled phosphorylated protein was hydrolyzed, and amino acids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. Fig.2B shows that rStk1 was predominantly phosphorylated at serine residues, demonstrating that it is a serine kinase.STK have been previously shown to phosphorylate casein or myelin basic protein at threonine residues (59Lower B.H. Bischoff K.M. Kennelly P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3452-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We observed that rStk1 phosphorylated both of these proteins at threonine residues (Fig. 2,C and D). Neither casein nor myelin basic protein underwent autophosphorylation in control experiments (data not shown). These results confirm that Stk1 can phosphorylate both serine and threonine residues.Stp1 Has Phosphatase Activity and Dephosphorylates Stk1To study whether Stp1 was a functional phosphatase enzyme, we constructed an N-terminal GST fusion to stp1. Previously characterized protein phosphatases hydrolyze pNPP in the presence of specific divalent cations (46Mackintosh C. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1993: 197-230Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of pNPP was measured by an increase in absorbance at 405 nm over time, and phosphatase activity of Stp1 is expressed as nmol of liberated pNP/μg protein. We observed that purified recombinant Stp1 (rStp1, 52 kDa) hydrolyzed pNPP only in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig.3A). Hydrolysis was not observed with GST alone, confirming that Stp1 is a functional phosphatase. The concentration of Mn2+ also seemed to influence the reaction, and hydrolysis was most effective at 2 mm Mn2+ (data not shown).Figure 3Stp1 has phosphatase activity. A, phosphatase activity of rStp1 was monitored by the hydrolysis of pNPP phosphate into pNP over time, in the presence of various divalent cations. Purified GST protein was included as a control, in similar reaction conditions. The nmol of pNP liberated/μg protein was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that hydrolysis of pNPP was observed only in the presence of Mn2+. B, the kinetic parameters of pNPP hydrolysis by rStp1 was measured at various substrate concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mm) over time (60 min). The reaction velocity was calculated in the linear range of the reaction for each substrate concentration, and a Lineweaver-Burk plot was derived. The Km and Vmaxwas determined as 3.677 ± 0.014 mm and 150 ± 6.4 pmol/min/μg, respectively. C, Stp1 dephosphorylates Stk1. Phosphorylated rStk1 was incubated with rStp1 in phosphatase buffer containing Mn2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the reaction were removed at various time intervals (0–40 min), and the reaction products were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the velocity of the reaction, the substrate concentration (pNPP) was varied between 1 mm and 20 mm while keeping the enzyme concentration constant (3 μg/ml), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphatase activity (nmol of pNP/min/μg) of Stp1 at each substrate concentration was determined over time, and the initial reaction velocity was calculated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the analysis is shown in Fig.3B, and the Km andVmax values were determined as 3.677 ±.0.014 mm and 150 ± 6.4 pmol/min/μg, respectively.Because the genes encoding Stp1 and Stk1 are genetically linked, we hypothesized that Stp1 and Stk1 might function as cognate phosphatase and kinase enzymes, respectively. To test this hypothesis, we examined dephosphorylation of phosphorylated rStk1 by rStp1. Recombinant Stp1 was incubated with autophosphorylated rStk1, the aliquots were removed at various time points, and the products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 3B shows that rStp1 dephosphorylated rStk1 and dephosphorylation increased with time. Also, we did not detect a phosphorylation product corresponding to rStp1 (52 kDa; data not shown), indicating that Stk1 did not phosphorylate Stp1. These results demonstrate that Stk1 is a substrate for Stp1.Mutagenesis of stk1 and stp1To evaluate the role of Stk1 and Stp1 in GBS, we constructed isogenic mutant strains defective for expression of Stk1 (Stk1−, strain LR113) and a double mutant defective in Stp1 and Stk1 (Stp1− Stk1−, strain LR114). Recombinant plasmids complementing these mutations were also constructed and transformed into their respective mutants. The plasmid pLR9 has the wild type stk1 allele and plasmid pLR10 has both stp1 and stk1 alleles in the complementation vector pDC123 (49Chaffin D.O. Rubens C.E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 219: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Introduction of pLR9 (pStk1+) and pLR10 (pStp1+ Stk1+) into LR113 and LR114 resulted in strains LR117 (Stk1−/pStk1+) and LR120 (Stp1− Stk1−/pStp1+Stk1+), respectively. A strain deficient in Stp1 expression was obtained by the introduction of pLR9 into LR114 resulting in LR119 (Stp1− Stk1−/pStk1+). The vector pDC123 was also electroporated into WT, LR113, and LR114 as a control resulting in strains LR115, LR116, and LR118, respectively.Evaluation of Phenotypes of LR113 and LR114Effects on GrowthGrowth characteristics in rich (Todd Hewitt Broth) and chemically defined media indicated that the mutants LR113 and LR114 had an extended lag phase of 60–90 min compared with WT (Fig. 4A). However, the growth and doubling time of these mutants was comparable with WT during exponential phase. The extended lag phase was not due to the presence of the Ωkm-2 insertion, because a control strain (DS101) with an Ωkm-2 insertion in an unknown region on the chromosome showed similar growth as WT. There were also no changes in pH or the presence of growth inhibitors in the spent"
https://openalex.org/W2012884187,"Helicobacter pylori secretes a toxin, VacA, that can form anion-selective membrane channels. Within a unique amino-terminal hydrophobic region of VacA, there are three tandem GXXXG motifs (defined by glycines at positions 14, 18, 22, and 26), which are characteristic of transmembrane dimerization sequences. The goals of the current study were to investigate whether these GXXXG motifs are required for membrane channel formation and cytotoxicity and to clarify the role of membrane channel formation in the biological activity of VacA. Six different alanine substitution mutations (P9A, G13A, G14A, G18A, G22A, and G26A) were introduced into the unique hydrophobic region located near the amino terminus of VacA. The effects of these mutations were first analyzed using the TOXCAT system, which permits the study of transmembrane oligomerization of proteins in a natural membrane environment. None of the mutations altered the capacity of ToxR-VacA-maltose-binding protein fusion proteins to insert into a membrane, but G14A and G18A mutations markedly diminished the capacity of the fusion proteins to oligomerize. We then introduced the six alanine substitution mutations into the vacA chromosomal gene of H. pylori and analyzed the properties of purified mutant VacA proteins. VacA-G13A, VacA-G22A, and VacA-G26A induced vacuolation of HeLa cells, whereas VacA-P9A, VacA-G14A, and VacA-G18A did not. Subsequent experiments examined the capacity of each mutant toxin to form membrane channels. In a planar lipid bilayer assay, VacA proteins containing G13A, G22A, and G26A mutations formed anion-selective membrane channels, whereas VacA proteins containing P9A, G14A, and G18A mutations did not. Similarly, VacA-G13A, VacA-G22A, and VacA-G26A induced depolarization of HeLa cells, whereas VacA-P9A, VacA-G14A, and VacA-G18A did not. These data indicate that an intact proline residue and an intact G14XXXG18 motif within the amino-terminal hydrophobic region of VacA are essential for membrane channel formation, and they also provide strong evidence that membrane channel formation is essential for VacA cytotoxicity.

Marshall B.J. Lancet. 1983; 1: 1273-1275Google Scholar). Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is a strong risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease and distal gastric adenocarcinoma (2Cover T.L. Berg D.E. Blaser M.J. Mobley H.L.T. Groisman E.A. Principles of Bacterial Pathogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 510-558Google Scholar, 3Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol.

Within the gastric mucosa, H. pylori organisms are found predominantly in the gastric mucus layer, but they also adhere to gastric epithelial cells (5Marshall B.J. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1991; 6: 121-124Google Scholar). Adherence of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells triggers the initiation of processes that ultimately result in alteration of gastric epithelial cell function or gastric epithelial cell death. One of the important effector molecules used by H. pylori to modulate eukaryotic cell function is a secreted toxin known as VacA (6Montecucco C. Papini E. de Bernard M. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R.

Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Google Scholar). The secreted VacA toxin is an 88-kDa protein, consisting of about 821 amino acids (9Nguyen V.Q. Caprioli R.M. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 543-546Google Scholar). These 88-kDa VacA monomers spontaneously self-assemble into large water-soluble flower-shaped oligomeric complexes, consisting predominantly of 12 or 14 monomeric subunits (10Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Google Scholar, 11Lupetti P. Heuser J.E. Manetti R. Massari P. Lanzavecchia S. Bellon P.L. Dallai R. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L. J.

When added to eukaryotic cells in vitro, the oligomeric form of VacA is nearly devoid of cytotoxic activity. However, exposure of oligomeric VacA to either acidic or alkaline pH results in disassembly of the oligomeric complexes into monomers that exhibit potent cytotoxic activity (10Cover T.L. Hanson P.I.

The addition of VacA to eukaryotic cells causes multiple alterations in cell structure and function. When VacA is added to cells in the presence of weak bases, the most apparent effect is the development of cytoplasmic vacuolation (16Leunk R.D. Johnson P.T. David B.C. Kraft W.G. Morgan D.R. J. Med.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9277-9282Google Scholar), it is presumed that VacA cytotoxicity results from toxin action at an intracellular site. Endosomal compartments and mitochondria have both been suggested as possible intracellular sites of VacA action (19Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V.

It has been hypothesized that VacA cytotoxicity results primarily from the formation of such channels. One model proposes that VacA forms anion-selective channels in the membranes of endosomes, which leads to osmotic swelling of these compartments (for review, see Refs. 8Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Google Scholar and34Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 457-466Google Scholar). However, it also has been hypothesized that VacA cytotoxicity may result primarily from an unrecognized enzymatic activity and that the formation of anion-selective membrane channels may be a secondary feature (for review, see Ref. 8Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Google Scholar). Support for the latter hypothesis is based on the recognition that numerous A-B type bacterial toxins exhibit an enzymatic activity and also exhibit a capacity for membrane channel formation (for review, see Refs. 35Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. Padovan E. Rossetto O. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 101-111Google Scholar and 36Olsnes S. Stenmark H. Moskaug J.O. McGill S. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 8: 163-168Google Scholar). In support of the view that VacA cytotoxicity results primarily from its capacity to form membrane channels, it has been reported that an inhibitor of anion-selective channels, NPPB,1 blocks VacA cytotoxicity (22Szabo I. Brutsche S. Tombola F. Moschioni M. Satin B. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5517-5527Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that VacA-Δ(6–27), a VacA mutant containing a 22-amino acid deletion, lacks the capacity to form membrane channels and also lacks cytotoxic activity (37Vinion-Dubiel A.D. McClain M.S. Czajkowsky D.M. Iwamoto H. Ye D. Cao P. Schraw W. Szabo G. Blanke S.R. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37736-37742Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither of these experimental approaches provides conclusive evidence indicating that membrane channel formation is essential for VacA cytotoxicity. Interpretation of experiments using NPPB is limited by the possibility that NPPB might exert multiple effects on cells or on the toxin rather than specifically inhibiting VacA channel activity. Also, conclusions from experiments with VacA-Δ(6–27) are limited by the possibility that a 22-amino acid deletion might alter multiple functional activities of the toxin rather than specifically ablating channel forming activity. VacA contains a unique hydrophobic region located near its amino terminus, and it seems possible that such a region might be utilized for insertion of VacA into membranes during the process of membrane channel formation. In a previous study, we used a model system known as TOXCAT to analyze the functional role of the VacA hydrophobic region (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar, 39Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar). The results indicated that the VacA hydrophobic region (amino acids 1–32) mediated insertion of ToxR-VacA-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions into the inner membrane ofEscherichia coli and also mediated protein dimerization. In contrast, a fusion protein containing a mutant VacA hydrophobic region (in which glycine 14 was replaced by alanine) inserted into the inner membrane but dimerized less efficiently than the fusion protein containing the wild-type VacA sequence. These experiments demonstrated that the VacA amino-terminal hydrophobic region is capable of inserting into membranes and undergoing dimerization. Within the VacA hydrophobic region, there are three tandem GXXXG motifs, which are characteristic of transmembrane dimerization sequences (Fig. 1). In the current study, we sought to investigate the functional role of these three GXXXG motifs in membrane channel formation and cytotoxicity and to clarify the role of membrane channel formation in the biological activity of VacA. We report here that alanine substitution mutations at the Gly-14 and Gly-18 positions abolish the capacity of VacA to form membrane channels and also abolish the capacity of VacA to induce cytotoxic effects. We also report that the G14XXXG18 motif is required for dimerization of VacA in a membrane using the TOXCAT system. These results provide further evidence that VacA cytotoxicity occurs via a process that requires membrane channel formation and indicate that the amino-terminal hydrophobic region of VacA plays an essential role in both membrane channel formation and cytotoxicity. The TOXCAT system (Fig. 2) was originally developed by Russ and Engelman (39Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar) to study transmembrane helix-helix associations in a natural membrane environment. In this system, a putative transmembrane (TM) sequence is cloned between a sequence encoding the transcription activator domain of Vibrio cholerae ToxR and a sequence encoding the periplasmic domain of the E. coli MBP. To determine whether the putative transmembrane sequence mediates transmembrane oligomerization, the ToxR-TM-MBP fusion proteins are expressed in E. coli. Membrane localization of the fusion protein is detected based on complementation of a nonpolarmalE mutant E. coli strain. Insertion of the ToxR-TM-MBP fusion protein into the inner membrane, such that the MBP domain localizes to the periplasmic space, is detected by determining whether the bacteria are able to transport maltose and thus grow on maltose-minimal medium. Dimerization of the fusion protein is determined based on expression of the cat gene, which is under the control of the dimerization-dependent transcription activator ToxR. E. coli strains expressing ToxR-TM-MBP fusion proteins that dimerize are resistant to chloramphenicol, whereas strains expressing fusion proteins that lack a dimerization sequence are sensitive to chloramphenicol. Plasmid pccVacA-wt and pccVacA-G14A have been described previously (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar). Additional plasmids containing mutations within the vacAamino-terminal sequence were constructed using the method of Perrin and Gilliland (40Perrin S. Gilliland G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7433-7438Google Scholar). As a control, the portion of vacAcorresponding to amino acids 295–326 was also cloned into the TOXCAT plasmid, generating pccVacA-295/326. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme was measured by an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pAV202 (41McClain M.S. Cao P. Iwamoto H. Vinion-Dubiel A.D. Szabo G. Shao Z. Cover T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6499-6508Google Scholar), which contains 567 bp ofcysS, the cysS-vacA intergenic region, 883 bp of the vacA coding sequence from H. pylori 60190, and a CAT gene inserted at the 3′-terminus of cysS, was used as the template for all site-directed mutagenesis reactions. Mutations encoding single amino acid substitutions were introduced into pAV202 using the method of Perrin and Gilliland (40Perrin S. Gilliland G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7433-7438Google Scholar) or inverse PCR (42Ochman H. Medhora M.M. Garza D. Hartl D.L. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols.

These mutations then were introduced into the H. pylorichromosomal vacA gene by natural transformation and allelic exchange, as described previously (37Vinion-Dubiel A.D. McClain M.S. Czajkowsky D.M.

Mutants were selected on Brucella agar plates containing 5 ॖg/ml chloramphenicol. To confirm that the desired mutations had been introduced successfully into the chromosomal vacA gene, fragments of the 5′-end of vacA were PCR amplified and analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and nucleotide sequence analysis. H. pylori strains were grown in sulfite-free Brucella broth containing activated charcoal (44Hawrylik S.J. Wasilko D.J. Haskell S.L. Gootz T.D. Lee S.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1994; 32: 790-792Google Scholar). VacA was purified in an oligomeric form from culture supernatants of H. pylori strains, as described previously (10Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Google Scholar). Purified VacA preparations were routinely acid activated before the addition of VacA to planar lipid bilayer chambers or cell culture wells, as described previously (13de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Google Scholar, 15McClain M.S. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P.

Planar lipid bilayers, composed of egg phosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidylserine/cholesterol (55:15:30 mol7) dissolved in n-decane were prepared as described previously (31Czajkowsky D.M.

Purified acid-activated VacA toxins were added to the lipid bilayers in a buffer consisting of 5 mmcitric acid (pH 4.0) and 2 mm EDTA, with the salt composition as described under 舠Results.舡 Membrane currents were measured as described previously (37Vinion-Dubiel A.D.

The potential is indicated relative to the cis side, defined as the chamber to which the protein was added. Permeability ratios were determined from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (45Goldman D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 27: 37-60Google Scholar), after the membrane voltage for zero current (reversal potential) in asymmetric salt concentrations was measured. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student'st test. Experiments to analyze the membrane potential of HeLa cells were performed as described previously (22Szabo I. Brutsche S. Tombola F. Moschioni M. Satin B. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5517-5527Google Scholar, 23Schraw W. Li Y. McClain M.S. van der Goot F.G. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34642-34650Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed, and then incubated with bis-(3-propyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol (oxonol VI) (Molecular Probes) in a final concentration of 2.5 ॖm for 15 min at 37 °C. A cell suspension (2 ml) was placed in a stirred quartz cuvette at 37 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorometer. After stabilization of the fluorescence signal (excitation, 585 nm; emission, 645 nm), acid-activated VacA toxins (final concentration 5 ॖg/ml) were added to the cells, and changes in the fluorescence were monitored. Depolarization causes a potential-dependent change in the cytoplasmic/transmembrane distribution of the fluorophore, which is accompanied by a change in fluorescence (46Apell H.J. Bersch B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 480-494Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (modified Eagle's medium containing Earle's salts) containing 107 fetal bovine serum. Acid-activated VacA preparations were incubated with cultured cells in a microtiter format, as described previously (13de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Google Scholar, 15McClain M.S. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 433-442Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h, the cells were examined by inverted light microscopy. Samples that induced vacuolation in >507 of cells were scored as positive for the vacuolating cytotoxin phenotype. In some experiments, vacuolation was also quantified by neutral red uptake assay (47Cover T.L. Puryear W. Pérez-Pérez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Google Scholar). The amino-terminal hydrophobic segment of VacA contains three tandem GXXXG motifs, which are characteristic of transmembrane dimerization sequences (Fig. 1). To investigate the role of these GXXXG motifs in greater detail, we used the TOXCAT model system (Fig. 2), which has been used to study transmembrane oligomerization of proteins in a natural membrane environment (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar, 39Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Google Scholar, 48Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Google Scholar, 49Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Google Scholar, 50Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Google Scholar). We used a previously described plasmid designated pccVacA-wt (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar), which encodes a fusion protein in which the amino-terminal 32 amino acids of VacA are inserted between the transcription activation domain of ToxR and the periplasmic domain of MBP, and which also contains the catgene under the control of the V. cholerae ctx promoter. To examine the role of the GXXXG motifs, we used four related plasmids that were identical to pccVacA-wt except for the presence of mutations within the vacA sequence which resulted in substitution of the Gly-14, Gly-18, Gly-22, and Gly-26 residues by alanine. We also constructed two related plasmids containing mutations within the vacA sequence which resulted in substitution of the Pro-9 and Gly-13 residues by alanine. Pro-9 was selected for analysis because this residue is reported to be important for VacA cytotoxic activity (51Ye D. Blanke S.R. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4354-4357Google Scholar). Gly-13 was selected for analysis as a control because this glycine residue is not located within a GXXXG motif. As an additional control, a 32-amino acid segment (amino acids 295–326) from a predicted hydrophilic region of VacA (Fig. 1) was also cloned into the TOXCAT vector. When analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-MBP antiserum, each of these plasmid-containing E. coli strains produced ToxR-TM-MBP fusion proteins (Fig.3A). To determine whether the putative transmembrane sequences encoded by these plasmids promoted membrane localization of the ToxR-TM-MBP fusion proteins, E. coli strains containing these plasmids were cultured on M9-maltose medium. Consistent with previous results (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar),E. coli strain MM39 containing pccVacA-wt was able to grow on M9-maltose medium, whereas MM39 with no plasmid was unable to grow on this medium (Fig. 3B, data not shown). As expected,E. coli containing pccVacA-295/326 was unable to grow on this medium. The failure of this strain to grow on M9-maltose medium is consistent with the failure of this VacA hydrophilic segment to mediate insertion of the TOXCAT fusion protein into the inner membrane ofE. coli. Each of the plasmids containing mutantvacA sequences grew on M9-maltose medium, similar toE. coli containing the parental wild-type vacAplasmid (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that none of the single amino acid substitutions in the VacA hydrophobic region altered the capacity of this VacA segment to mediate insertion of the ToxR-TM-MBP fusion proteins into a membrane. We next analyzed whether the mutant VacA segments were able to mediate dimerization of the TOXCAT fusion proteins. As reported previously (38McClain M.S. Cao P. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1181-1184Google Scholar), E. coli MM39 containing pccVacA-wt produced high levels of CAT, whereas E. coli MM39 containing no plasmid produced no CAT enzyme (Fig. 3C and data not shown). The control strain containing pccVacA-295/326 produced barely any detectable CAT. Compared with the E. coli MM39 containing pccVacA-wt, E. coli containing plasmids encoding P9A, G13A, and G22A mutations expressed similar high levels of CAT enzyme. In contrast, E. coli containing plasmids encoding G14A, G18A, or G26A mutations expressed significantly lower levels of CAT than did the strain containing pccVacA-wt. These results indicate that several glycine residues within the VacA hydrophobic region contribute to transmembrane protein dimerization and that the glycines located within the G14XXXG18 motif are particularly important for protein dimerization in this system. Although the experiments described above using the TOXCAT system provide useful insights into the function of the VacA amino-terminal segment, it seems possible that the conformation and function of this segment might be considerably different in the context of the native VacA protein interacting with eukaryotic cells, rather than the TOXCAT fusion proteins interacting with the inner membrane ofE. coli. Therefore, we next undertook studies designed to analyze the function of the amino-terminal hydrophobic region in the context of the intact VacA protein produced by H. pylori. For these studies, we introduced mutations encoding P9A, G13A, G14A, G18A, G22A, and G26A into the H. pylori chromosomalvacA gene, as described under 舠Materials and Methods.舡 Each of the mutant strains expressed and secreted VacA proteins of the expected size (Fig. 4A). The level of VacA produced by each of these mutant strains was lower than the level of VacA produced by a wild-type H. pylori strain but similar to the level of VacA produced by a control strain without any vacA mutations in which a chloramphenicol resistance cassette was introduced upstream from the vacA promoter, within the cysS-vacA intergenic region (data not shown). This indicates that the presence of the chloramphenico"

Atrn mutations also cause spongiform neurodegeneration. Here, we show that a null mutation for mahoganoid causes a similar age-dependent neuropathology that includes many features of prion diseases but without accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein. The gene mutated in mahoganoid encodes a RING-containing protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Similarities in phenotype, expression, and genetic interactions suggest that mahoganoid and Atrn genes are part of a conserved pathway for regulated protein turnover whose function is essential for neuronal viability."

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which may indeed apply for certain proteins. In the case of PN it has not been considered that PN can be activated by transition metal ions that may then catalyze the self-nitration of metalloproteins at low PN levels. We have recently provided evidence for this reaction for heme-thiolate (P450) proteins (13Daiber A. Schöneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Daiber A. Herold S. Schöneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J.

Nitric Oxide. 2002; 6: 400Google Scholar) that therefore may serve as a model for the P450 protein PGI2 synthase. PGI2 synthase was inactivated by micromolar PN concentrations (16Zou M.H. Ullrich V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Zou M.H. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) but also by a continuous generation of NO and O2⨪ from SIN-1 (18Zou M.H. Klein T. Pasquet J.-P. Ullrich V. J. Biochem. 1998; 336: 507-512Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In cellular systems the inhibition of nitration by a NO synthase inhibitor and polyethylene-glycolated superoxide dismutase provided evidence for the involvement of PN, whereas nitrite was ineffective (18Zou M.H. Klein T. Pasquet J.-P. Ullrich V. J. Biochem. 1998; 336: 507-512Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because NO and PGI2 are important for the endothelial barrier function the formation of PN and the nitration of PGI2 synthase could play a role in the process of endothelial activation for adhesion and emigration of white blood cells into the tissue (19Ullrich V. Zou M.H. Bachschmid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PGI2 synthase was found localized to the caveolae-like endothelial NO synthase (20Spisni E. Griffoni C. Santi S. Riccio M. Marulli R. Bartolini G. Toni M. Ullrich V. Tomasi V. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and hence PN formation may occur in close vicinity to PGI2 synthase. This localization in a “quasi-extracellular” compartment may be a further important factor for efficient nitration by low concentrations of PN. Beyond this physiological background no proof for the molecular basis of enzyme inhibition has been hitherto obtained by identification of nitrated tyrosine. Substrate analogs of prostaglandin-endoperoxide have been recently shown to inhibit the nitration (17Zou M.H. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which suggested a proximity to the heme attached to the protein by the Cys-441 residue (21Hatae T. Hara S. Yokoyama C. Yabuki T.

In this study we present molecular evidence for the specific nitration of bovine PGI2 synthase at tyrosine 430 by high resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (24Rossier J.S.

We further show an unusually slow digestion by thermolysin, presumably because of a tight fold around the heme, to release a tetrapeptide by an unexpected specific cleavage adjacent to the nitrated tyrosine residue.

Endothelial and smooth muscle layers from 8 to 10 freshly received bovine aorta were isolated by dissection at 4 °C, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Frozen strips were homogenized at 0–4 °C in a Waring blender in 100 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene, and 44 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The microsomal fraction was obtained by centrifugation as described (28Ullrich V. Castle L. Weber P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2033-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to a final volume of 75–100 ml, with a protein concentration of 10–20 mg/ml. The homogenization buffer contained 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, without additional protease inhibitors. Reaction with PN was carried out with microsomes because active enzyme is required for nitration and further purification steps involving denaturating detergents partially inactivate the protein. PN (10 μl) at a defined concentration was quickly added by thorough Vortex mixing to an ice-cold microsomal suspension (990 μl, total protein concentration 1 mg/ml in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). Controls were treated with decomposed PN (24 h at room temperature). The activity for PGI2 formation of PN-treated microsomes was tested by incubation of 100 μl of microsomal suspension (1 mg of protein/ml) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with PGH2 (1 μg) for 1 min at 20 °C. To avoid cross-reactivities with PGH2 degradation products the incubation mixture was stopped with 20 μl of 1 m citric acid and extracted two times with 300 μl of ethyl acetate and separated by TLC (Silica Gel 60, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); solvent: ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethylpentane:acetic acid:water, 10:50:20:100). 6-Keto-PGF1α was identified by an iodine-stained reference (RF value about 0.18). The area of 6-keto-PGF1α was excised, extracted with ethyl acetate, and evaporated to complete dryness. After addition of 100 μl of PBS three dilutions of 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10000 were prepared and tested by EIA (Assay Designs Inc., BioTrend, Köln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The microsomal samples were treated for 5 min at 95 °C with Laemmli buffer and separated by 8% (v/v) SDS-PAGE (30 mA, 1 h). The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by a semidry blot procedure using a constant current of 50 mA for 90 min. The blotting buffer contained 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.037% (w/v) SDS. Transfer efficiency of proteins was examined by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% (v/v) acetic acid. After destaining in PBS, the membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then incubated for 2 h with a polyclonal antibody against PGI2 synthase (1 μg/ml PBS). After repeated washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 the membrane was incubated for 45 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:7500 for 45 min, and ECL was used for detection of antibody binding according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to staining with a second antibody the membrane was stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) under gentle shaking for 60 min at 70 °C. After washing and blocking, the membrane was incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against 3-NT at a dilution of 1 μg/ml, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:7500. PGI2 synthase samples were always stained first with the PGI2 synthase antibody, then stripped one or two times before staining with the NT antibody, to ensure complete denaturation for recognition of nitrated protein. Separation of PGI2 synthase from microsomal membranes and solubilization was performed by adding 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to aortic microsomes. The suspension was stirred for 2 h at 4 °C, then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to yield a clear yellow supernatant. Because SDS-PAGE is hampered by the high actin concentration (about 80–90% of total protein) in microsomes, actin was partially removed by precipitation with 15 mmCaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation of the precipitate for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Because Triton X-100 interfered with SDS-PAGE in subsequent purification steps, detergent was removed by extracting with chloroform and Vortex mixing for a few seconds (29Horikawa S. Ogawara H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 97: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After centrifugation for 30 min at 3000 rpm, the organic and aqueous phases were recovered. Proteins precipitated at the interphase as a solid white layer, and remaining chloroform was removed by evaporation. Proteins were then solubilized in SDS-containing electrophoresis buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Proteins were treated with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C and then separated by 10% (v/v) SDS-PAGE (100 mA, 5 h) on preparative gels (160 × 165 mm, thickness 1.5 mm). Reverse staining by imidazole:zinc was applied for visualization of bands (30Fernandez-Patron C. Castellanos-Serra L. Rodriguez P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 564-573PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were equilibrated for 15 min in 100 ml of 0.2 m imidazole in water with gentle shaking, and then placed for 1 min in 100 ml of 0.3 m ZnCl2. The staining solution was removed when the background became deep white showing the transparent protein bands. The band containing PGI2 synthase was excised with a razor blade, immersed in 2% citric acid solution 2–3 times (10 min) to remove zinc ions from the gel matrix, and washed several times with SDS-PAGE buffer. Recovery of PGI2 synthase was performed by electroelution (ELUTRAP, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) (31Jacobs E. Clad A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein bands were cut to slices, placed in the elution chamber and covered with SDS-PAGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). A voltage of 200 V corresponding to the ∼50 mA current was then applied. After an 8-h elution period proteins accumulated inside a trap (volume 800 μl) between two membranes were collected with a pipette. Protein solutions were finally concentrated with an Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp.) to a 5 μm solution (0.28 mg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC assay (Bio-Rad). Samples of 100 μl of electroeluted PGI2 synthase were treated with different concentrations of PN (0, 10, 50, 100, and 250 μm), heated for 10 min to 95 °C, and then mixed with 10 mm CaCl2 to stabilize proteases. After addition of Pronase (1 mg/ml) the samples were incubated for 24 h at 40 °C, then another 1 mg/ml Pronase was added and incubated again for 24 h at 50 °C. Digestion was repeated with a third and fourth portion (0.5 mg/ml) for 12 h at 50 °C. Prior to HPLC separation the samples were filtered with the 10-kDa MICROCON centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.) by centrifuging for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Products were analyzed on a Jasco HPLC system consisting of a PU-980 pump, a Jasco UV-1575 and Spectra Physics spectra focus UV-visible detector, and a LG-980-02 low pressure mixing unit. A C18 Nucleosil 100-5 250 × 4.6 column from Macherey & Nagel (Düren, Germany) was used with a mobile phase gradient (0–15 min, 0% (v/v) B; 15–30 min, 0–90% (v/v) B; 30–40 min, 90% (v/v) B (A: 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2, B: 80% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid)). The flow rate was 1 ml/min and sample aliquots of 100 μl were injected. Tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and 3-NT were identified and quantified at 270 and 360 nm by internal and external standards. The retention time of 3-NT was 12 min. As a control 3-NT was reduced with sodium dithionite to 3-aminotyrosine. Because of the large amount of SDS in the electroeluted protein solution (>1% SDS) in-gel digestion was more suitable than digestion in solution. Protein solutions (about 0.5 nmol of PGI2 synthase isolated from treated (25 μm PN) or untreated microsomes) were incubated in Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 95 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE on a “Novex” 8% Tris glycine gel (10 wells, Invitrogen; 30 mA, 1 h). Protein bands were visualized by reverse staining with imidazole:zinc as described above. Proteolytic digestion in the gel matrix was carried out according to the procedure of Shevchenko et al. (32Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The protein bands were excised from the gel, cut to pieces and washed with 2% citric acid, then with water to remove staining dye, gel buffers, and SDS, and dried at room temperature in a vacuum centrifuge. The washing step was repeated by dehydration of the gel pieces and discarding the solution. After shrinking by vacuum centrifugation the gel pieces were reswollen in 200 μl of digest solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 25 ng/μl thermolysin, and the supernatant was removed. Proteolytic digestion was carried out for 24 h at 50 °C under gentle shaking. Peptides were extracted several times with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile for 24 h, lyophilized to dryness, and analyzed on the above described HPLC system. A C18 Nucleosil 100-3 125 × 4.6 column from Macherey & Nagel was used with a mobile phase gradient (0–5 min, 0% (v/v) B; 5–50 min, 0–60% (v/v) B (A: 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, pH 2, B: 80% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid)), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Peptide fragments were detected at 220 and 365 nm; peaks showing a strong absorption at 365 nm were collected and lyophilized for further analysis. Sequence determination of the isolated peptide was achieved by Edman amino acid sequencing. NH2-terminal Edman degradation was performed on an Procise HT sequencing system, model 494 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Weiterstadt, Germany), fitted with an online, narrow-bore HPLC-based amino acid analyzer that utilized a 220 × 2.1-mm C18reversed-phase column held at 55 °C in a column heater oven. Released phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivatives from each cycle were separated under the recommended binary gradient conditions using 3.5% tetrahydrofuran in water (buffered with sodium phosphate, pH 4.5; solvent A) and 10% 2-propanol in acetonitrile (unbuffered; solvent B). Prior to sequence determination, samples of peptides were applied to a biobrene-treated glass fiber disk and allowed to dry in a stream of argon. Reagents, operating software, and protocols were used as described from the instrument manufacturer. Chromatographic identification of the UV signals was done by reference to the retention times and the absorbance of a PTH standard run. PTH-derivatives display characteristic UV spectra with an absorbance maximum at 269 nm. The nitrated tetrapeptide LKNY(nitro) was synthesized on a semiautomated peptide synthesizer (EPS-221, Abimed) using solid-phase peptide synthesis Fmoc chemistry methods (33Michels J. Geyer A. Mocanu V. Welte W. Burlingame A.L. Przybylski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with all chemicals of analytical grade or highest available purity. Fmoc amino acids, NovaSyn TGR resin, PyBop, and other reagents were obtained from Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland). To synthesize the peptide with COOH-terminal 3-NT carboxamide the TGR resin was employed with 40 min coupling time and 5 min deprotection in 20% piperidine inN,N-dimethylformamide. Purification of the peptide was performed with preparative HPLC on a Grom-Sil ODS-4Me column. High resolution mass spectrometry was performed with a 7T Bruker Daltonik (Bremen, Germany) Apex II FT-ICR mass spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded 7.0 tesla superconducting magnet (Magnex, Oxford, UK), an APOLLO (Bruker Daltonik) electrospray ionization source and nano-electrospray system, an API1600 ESI control unit, and a UNIX based Silicon Graphics O2 work station. Details of the instrumental conditions of ESI-FT-ICR-MS were as previously reported (34Bauer S.H. Wiechers M.F. Bruns K. Przybylski M. Stuermer C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mass spectra were obtained by collecting 32–124 single scans. Experimental conditions were: full scan mode; 45–70 V capillary exit voltage; setting of skimmer 1, 10; setting of skimmer 2, 7; RF amplitude, 500; offset 0.9; trap, 10; extract, 10; ionization pulse time, 2500 ms; ionization delay time, 0.001 s; excitation sweep pulse 1, 2 ms; excitation sweep attenuation, 1:2.16 dB. Acquisition of spectra was performed with the Bruker Daltonik software XMASS and corresponding programs for mass calculation, data calibration, and processing. Peptide samples were dissolved in a solution of 3% acetic acid in 50% methanol:water. MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed with a Bruker BiFlex-DE mass spectrometer equipped with a Scout MALDI source and video system, a nitrogen UV laser (337 nm), and a dual channel plate detector. Sample preparation was performed with 1 μl of a freshly prepared saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2:1), which was mixed with 0.5 μl of the peptide solution (34Bauer S.H. Wiechers M.F. Bruns K. Przybylski M. Stuermer C.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV and were averaged over 40 single laser shots. Upon treatment of isolated PGI2 synthase with PN no nitrated tryptic peptide(s) could be initially found although immunoprecipitation of the enzyme with a monoclonal NT antibody, as well as conventional acid hydrolysis of the nitrated enzyme, indicated the presence of nitrated tyrosine. In previous work with other P450 proteins a nitration with PN resulted in proteolytic peptides with characteristic absorbance at 365 nm, from which the position of the 3-NT could be identified (13Daiber A. Schöneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Daiber A. Herold S. Schöneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar). Because the postulated mechanism (35Mehl M. Daiber A. Herold S. Shoun H. Ullrich V. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Zou M.H. Daiber A. Peterson J.A. Shoun H. Ullrich V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) suggested that only active PGI2 synthase can be nitrated, bovine aortic microsomes were first nitrated with increasing concentrations of PN and then the enzyme was isolated by gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). Western blot analyses shown in Fig. 1provided identical, specific bands at approximately 52 kDa up to a concentration of 500 μm PN that were stained by a polyclonal antibody against PGI2 synthase, and a monoclonal antibody against 3-NT, whereas higher concentrations than 500 μm caused unspecific additional staining of other proteins. The control also stained weakly, which probably was because of the presence of some atherosclerotic plaques in bovine arteries (37Zou M.H. Leist M. Ullrich V. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1359-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A clear concentration dependence of PN on the extent of nitration was found up to 250 μm, which was at variance with the high affinity seen with the isolated enzyme (16Zou M.H. Ullrich V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Zou M.H. Martin C. Ullrich V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), but may be explained by competitive targets for PN in the microsomal fraction. Indeed, when aortic microsomes were added to P450 BM-3 (Mr116,000) as a model protein for PGI2 synthase its Tyr-nitration was sharply decreased (Fig.2). Because the concentration of PGI2 synthase on the gel is very low its nitration hardly shows. If microsomes were treated with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to block SH groups their inhibitory effect is much less (data not shown), indicating that in microsomes protein thiols compete for PN and therefore higher PN concentrations are required as with the isolated enzyme. Previous studies with other P450 proteins and with model proteins (13Daiber A. Schöneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,14Daiber A. Herold S. Schöneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar, 38Jiao K. Mandapati S. Skipper P.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Wishnok J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) had indicated that multiple Tyr nitrations may occur; therefore, in this study a PN concentration of 25 μm was selected that appeared most suitable to yield selective modification of a single Tyr residue. The inhibition of 6-keto-PGF1αformation was about 50 ± 15% compared with the inhibition at 250 μm, thus matching the NT staining intensities at 25versus 250 μm. Treatment and isolation of bovine aortic microsomes under these conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) provided ∼20 μg of PGI2 synthase isolated on SDS-PAGE from the 52-kDa band (Fig.3, lane D). The protein band was excised and subjected to proteolytic digestion using trypsin and mass spectrometric proteome analysis by MALDI-TOF as well as high resolution FT-ICR (39Fligge T.A. Reinhard C. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Przybylski M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (data not shown), which yielded unequivocal peptide fragment identification of the PGI2 synthase sequence. However, no NT-containing peptides or other modified peptide sites were detected by these mass spectrometric data (see TableI). With low abundance, ATP synthase (56 kDa) and peptide ions because of additional (unidentified) contaminating proteins in very low amounts were found by protein sequence data base analyses (SwissProt data base; data not shown). The contaminating proteins were estimated to account for maximally 20–30% of the protein band (see Fig. 3).Table IExpected cleavage pattern of PGI2 synthase after complete thermolysin digestionPossible Tyr-containing thermol"
https://openalex.org/W2139329845,"Mersacidin belongs to the type B lantibiotics (lanthionine-containing antibiotics) that contain post-translationally modified amino acids and cyclic ring structures. It targets the cell wall precursor lipid II and thereby inhibits cell wall synthesis. In light of the emerging antibiotics resistance problem, the understanding of the antibacterial activity on a structural basis provides a key to circumvent this issue. Here we present solution NMR studies of mersacidin-lipid II interaction in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Distinct solution structures of mersacidin were determined in three different states: in water/methanol solution and in DPC micelles with and without lipid II. The structures in various sample conditions reveal remarkable conformational changes in which the junction between Ala-12 and Abu-13 (where Abu is aminobutyric acid) effectively serves as the hinge for the opening and closure of the ring structures. The DPC micelle-bound form resembles the previously determined NMR and x-ray crystal structures of mersacidin in pure methanol but substantially deviates from the other two states in our current report. The structural changes delineate the large chemical shift perturbations observed during the course of a two-step15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence titration. They also modulate the surface charge distribution of mersacidin suggesting that electrostatics play a central role in the mersacidin-lipid II interaction.

The permeability originates in principle from a nonspecific assembly that results in a pore-like structure where the amphipathic nature of the amino acid composition facilitates the clustering process (for a review, see Ref. 1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Apart from this ubiquitous mechanism, some antimicrobial peptides, such as ramoplanin, enduramycin, and janiemycin and the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin, use specific targets that play a central role in the cell wall synthesis, namely lipid II, to achieve their bioactivity with much higher efficiency (2Brötz H.

(Tokyo). 1993; 46: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Lipid II also serves as a target for the pore-forming peptides nisin and epidermin, which belong to the type A lantibiotic (lanthionine-containingantibiotic) family (2Brötz H. Josten M. Wiedemann I. Schneider U. Götz F. Bierbaum G. Sahl H.-G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H.-G. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Some type B lantibiotics also possess functions of targeted cell wall synthesis inhibition; one of the best studied peptide is mersacidin (see Fig. 1A) (6Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Leopold K. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although these lipid II-targeting antimicrobial peptides share a common binding molecule, the recognition epitopes among these peptides are somewhat different: co-incubation of vancomycin or other inhibitors of transglycosylases or transpeptidases with mersacidin does not impede their lipid II binding capacity (6Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Leopold K. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As antibiotic resistance is becoming more and more severe, the diversity of such a targeting action is of great interest. The sophisticated chemical composition of lipid II provides the complexity that can be targeted in various ways. It consists of a peptidoglycan head group that serves as the building block for the cross-linked cell wall matrix and of a pyrophosphate-undecaprenyl lipid tail that functions as the carrier for the transport of the peptidoglycan moiety from the cytoplasm to the extracellular domain (see Fig. 1B). Although the targeted antimicrobial activity of mersacidin is evident, little detail is known, however, about its mechanism of recognition and inhibition. Mersacidin is a 20-residue peptide with nine post-translationally modified amino acids and a single negatively charged residue, Glu-17 (Fig. 1A) (for reviews, see Refs. 8Brötz H. Sahl H.-G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and 9Jack R.W. Jung G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It contains four ring structures: two separate ones in the N-terminal part and two intertwined ones in the C-terminal part. The three-dimensional structure of mersacidin has been solved both by solution NMR spectroscopy (10Prasch T. Naumann T. Markert R.L. Sattler M. Schubert W. Schaal S. Bauch M. Kogler H. Griesinger C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (11Schneider T.R. Karcher J. Pohl E. Lubini P. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unlike type A lantibiotics, which are mostly extended and flexible, the structure of mersacidin is globular and compact. In both the crystalline and solution states the local ring structures are tightly confined by the lanthionine linkages. The overall conformations obtained from the two different methods are similar except for a minor difference in the orientation of the glycine-rich ring (residues 5–11). These structures were, however, both solved in pure methanol, due to the poor solubility of mersacidin in aqueous solution, and in the absence of lipid II, which is required for its bioactivity. To understand the mechanism of action of mersacidin, knowledge of its structure upon binding to lipid II under physiological conditions is crucial. We report here high resolution NMR spectroscopy studies of the interaction between mersacidin and its binding target lipid II in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC)1micelles, which were used as a membrane mimic.15N-1H HSQC titration experiments provide residue-specific insight into the interaction with lipid II. The solution NMR structures of mersacidin in various sample environments, namely free in methanol/water solution and DPC-bound in the absence and presence of lipid II, are presented. The effect of binding to DPC micelles and lipid II on the mersacidin dynamics are characterized by means of 15N relaxation together with gradient-edited diffusion experiments.

We will show that the differences in sample environments result in substantial conformational changes that modulate the charge accessibility. These changes in charge distributions most likely play a crucial role in the mechanism of mersacidin bioactivity. For the overproduction and purification of [15N]mersacidin, the producer strainBacillus sp. HIL Y-85,54728 was inoculated into 10 ml of tryptone soy broth and incubated overnight. The preculture served as inoculum for 10 ml of synthetic production medium (19Bierbaum G. Brötz H. Koller K.P. Sahl H.-G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 127: 121-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contained 50 mm15NH4Cl (>98%) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, UK) and 10 mm K2SO4. It was incubated at 30 °C to an optical density of 0.1 at 600 nm. 0.1 ml of this culture served as inoculum for 10 100-ml cultures in the same medium that were incubated for 72 h at 30 °C with vigorous agitation in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. The culture supernatant was sterilized by filtration and loaded onto a 50-ml Serdolit PAD-I column (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), which had been washed with methanol and equilibrated with distilled water. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of distilled water and 10 bed volumes of 50% methanol in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, and the peptide was eluted with 500 ml of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoric acid. The antibacterial activity of the fractions was checked in a bioassay usingMicrococcus luteus ATCC 4698 as an indicator strain. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by rotary evaporation, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the concentrate were applied to a POROS 20 R2 HPLC column (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) using the following gradient (eluent A: 0.1% trifluoric acid in water, eluent B: 0.1% trifluoric acid in acetonitrile): 0 min 5% B, 12 min 30% B, 20 min 40% B, 22 min 100% B at a flow of 5 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by evaporation, and rechromatographed on the POROS column. After lyophilization of the active fractions, the peptide was applied to a reversed phase HPLC column (RP18) using the following gradient: 0 min 5% B, 30 min 50% B, 44 min 67.5% B, 47 min 100% B. The mass of the purified peptide, which eluted at 55% B, was checked by mass spectrometry. Lipid II was prepared as described previously (7Brötz H. Bierbaum G. Reynolds P.E. Sahl H.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Due to the solubility problem of mersacidin, freeze-dried mersacidin was first dissolved in perdeuterated d3-methanol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) as a 10 mg/ml stock solution. It was then diluted with sodium phosphate buffer and DPC solution and water. Lipid II was taken from a stock solution (in CHCl3:MeOH = 1:1) and vacuum-dried before mixing. Mersacidin-containing DPC solution was then added to dissolve lipid II, and the resulting sample solution was transferred into an NMR tube for measurements. A short sonication was applied after each mixing step to ensure uniform mixing and proper micelle formation. The typical sample concentration was 2 mm mersacidin in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 with a total volume of 500 μl. The sample hence contained 37% methanol and 63% H2O. For structure determination purposes, 4% (∼100 mm) perdeuterated d38-DPC (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) with or without 2 mm lipid II was added to obtain lipid II embedded in DPC micelles and a control sample of mersacidin in DPC micelles alone. For simplicity, MeOH/H2O, DPCbound, and lipid II are defined here as the three sample conditions of free mersacidin in the methanol/water mixture and in the DPC micelle solution with and without lipid II, respectively. All NMR experiments were carried out on Varian UnityPlus 500 and Bruker DRX600 and DRX750 spectrometers at 293 K. Spectra including two-dimensional NOESY with mixing times of 50, 100, and 200 ms, a total correlation spectroscopy with mixing time of 70 ms, and a three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC with mixing time of 100 ms were collected to obtain complete backbone and side chain proton resonance assignments (21Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. 1st Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). A two-dimensional double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy was recorded to extract the backbone3JHN-Hα coupling constants in combination with a short mixing time (50 ms) NOESY as described previously (22Ludvigsen S. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignment of side chain methylene groups was achieved based on the intensity correlations of the spin systems (23Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Xu R.X. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Basus V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 132-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using the NMRPipe software package (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (27Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) except for those of diffusion measurements (see below). The assigned chemical shift data sets of mersacidin in three different conditions, MeOH/H2O, DPCbound, and lipid II, were deposited into the BioMagResBank under accession codes 5581, 5582, and 5580, respectively. For the starting point corresponding to the free mersacidin in the 37% MeOH, 63% H2O mixture, 1 μmol of the 15N-labeled mersacidin stock solution ind3-methanol was diluted with 50 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and water was added to reach a total volume of 450 μl. In the first titration step, aliquots of a 40% DPC stock solution with 37% methanol content were successively added resulting in DPC concentrations of 0.2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6%. This is respectively equivalent to a range of ratios of mersacidinversus DPC micelles of 20:1 up to 1:1.5, assuming that each DPC micelle consists of 50–55 monomers (28Wymore T. Gao X.F. Wong T.C. J. Mol. Struct. 1999; 486: 195-210Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Marrink S.J. Tieleman D.P. Mark A.E. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 12165-12173Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). At the end of the first titration step (DPCbound) the total volume was 525 μl resulting in a 16% sample dilution but with identical methanol content. For the second titration step, portions of 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 μmol of vacuum-dried lipid II were first prepared in separate containers and then successively dissolved in the sample taken from the NMR tube to reach the same concentration ratios as those of the DPC titration steps. The final sample (lipid II) therefore contained 1 μmol of [15N]mersacidin, ∼1.5 μmol of DPC micelles and 1.5 μmol of lipid II. In both titration steps, the chemical shift changes of mersacidin were all saturated by an excess of DPC micelles and lipid II at a 1:1.25 molar ratio and higher. 15N longitudinal relaxation timesT1, transverse relaxation timesT2, and 1H-15N steady-state NOEs of mersacidin were obtained from series of two-dimensional experiments with coherence selection achieved by pulse field gradients (PFGs) (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). For T1measurements, seven spectra were recorded with relaxation delaysT set to 10, 20, 100, 300, 500, 750, and 1000 ms. For the rotating frame relaxation times T1ρ, spectra were first obtained using a 15N spin lock continuous wave radio frequency (rf) with a field strength ν1 of 1 kHz for seven relaxation delays T of 20, 50, 70, 100, 120, 200, and 350 ms. The relaxation times T1 and T1ρ were then derived from a single exponential decay fitting of the peak intensities usingxcrfit (www.pence.ca/ftp/xcrvfit). TheT2 of each residue was subsequently derived from the observed relaxation time T1ρ by correcting for the offset Δν of the rf field to the resonance by use of the relation 1/T1ρ = (1/T1) cos2θ + (1/T2) sin2θ, where θ = tan−1(ν1/Δν).1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs were determined from the ratio of peak intensities (Ion/Ioff) with and without the saturation of the amide protons for 3 s. All15N relaxation experiments were carried out on a Varian UnityPlus 500 spectrometer at 293 K. Since the structure of mersacidin exhibits high flexibility, quantitative analysis of the relaxation data in terms of spectral density functions is not applicable (31Dayie K.T. Wagner G. Lefevre J.F. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1996; 47: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relaxation data in the three different sample conditions were only compared in a qualitative way. A further simplification allows us to estimate the correlation time from the averaged T2 value (32Anglister J. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1,τc∼1/(5T2)Equation 1 The overall correlation time can also be expressed as a function of the molecular size and the bulk solvent viscosity η. For a spherical molecule of radius a rotating in a liquid of viscosity η, the rotational correlation time τc is given by the Stokes relation (33Wand A.J. Ehrhardt M.R. Flynn P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15299-15302Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) according to Equation 2,τc=4πa3η/3kT=Vη/kT=1/6DrotEquation 2 where V is the volume of the molecule, kis the Boltzman constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Drot is the rotational diffusion constant for a spherical molecule. The molecular radius a is actually the effective hydrodynamic radius Rh of the molecule with the hydration shell. The overall correlation time estimated from NMR relaxation measurements can thus be compared with the effective molecular size and sample viscosity that are measured from PFG-NMR diffusion experiments. The hydrodynamic radius Rh can be calculated from the translational diffusion coefficient Dtransof the particles through another Stokes relation according to Equation3, Dtrans=kT/6πηRhEquation 3 PFG-NMR diffusion measurement with the PG-SLED (pulse gradient-stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode) sequence enables us to obtain Dtrans, which is proportional to the decay rate d of the NMR signal attenuation as a function of gradient strength g (34Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), according to Equation 4,I(g)=Ioexp[−dg2]Equation 4 where Io is the NMR peak intensity in the absence of gradient pulses and g is the field strength of the bipolar gradient pulse pair. Changes in the solvent viscosity η in different sample environments can be monitored using the methanol signal as an internal standard, assuming that methanol does not interact with other solutes and thus that its hydrodynamic radiusRh is invariable in analogy to the use of dioxane for protein folding studies as described previously (34Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The ratio of the rate constants of methanol in different conditions gives the relative change in bulk solvent viscosity η. Knowing this, the relative hydrodynamic radii Rh of mersacidin with respect to methanol in different environments can thus be extracted. In practice, each diffusion data set consists of a series of 40 one-dimensional 1H spectra with 2.5% increments of the gradient strength from 2.5 to 100% collected at 750 MHz with a three-axis gradient probe (x axis for bipolar gradient pulse pair and y and z axis for residual signal crushing). Data processing was performed with Felix from Biosym Technologies (San Diego, CA), and Origin7.0 from OriginLab (North Hampton, MA) was used for non-linear fitting to obtain the translational diffusion coefficients Dtrans. All structure calculations were performed with the program CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using the ARIA setup and protocols (36Nilges M. Donoghue S.I. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Semiautomated NOE assignment was used to assist the spectral assignment (37Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This was done from a partially assigned NMRView peak list. The initially unassigned cross-peaks were defined as ambiguous distance restraints with a lower weighing factor. The calibration of the cross-peak intensities against distances was done automatically at the beginning of each iteration. The additional unambiguously assigned cross-peaks were interactively re-examined with NMRView, and the checked peak list was then used as the input for the next calculation in an iterative way until all cross-peaks were assigned. Each semiautomated assignment step with ARIA consisted of eight iterations with successive reduction of the violation tolerance and a final refinement in explicit solvent using default ARIA parameters unless otherwise stated. The Parallhdg5.3 force field with the PROLSQ parameters was used (38Linge J. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A.E.M. Bonvin A.M.J.J. Nilges M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The topologies of dehydroalanine (Dha), aminobutyric acid (d-Abu), 3-methyllanthionine, and the cyclized C terminus of the S-aminovinyl-methyl-cysteine (Tea) were constructed based on alanine, threonine, and cysteine and comparison of available data bases. Four thioether bridges were introduced. Nine backbone φ and four side chain χ1torsion angle restraints obtained from the stereospecific assignments of the methylene groups of the thioester-linked Ala-12 and Ala-18 and of Leu-14 and Glu-17 were used in the structure calculations. A torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol was performed, initially at 10,000 K (8000 steps), followed by a first cooling stage to 50 K (50 K/step); Cartesian space refinement was used for the second cooling stage (from 2000 to 1000 K in 16,000 steps) and the subsequent third cooling stage (from 1000 to 50 K in 4000 steps) followed by 200 steps of energy minimization. The slow cooling process at the second stage ensures a better convergence of the calculated structures. The 50 structures with the lowest restraint energy were further subjected to explicit solvent refinement (OPLS water and Me2SO models) as described previously (39Bonvin A.M.J.J. Houben K. Guenneugues M. Kaptein R. Boelens R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the best 20 were kept for clustering and structural analysis. A cluster is defined as a group of at least four structures with pairwise backbone (residue 3, 4, and 12–20) positional root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) lower than 0.3 Å. Structures were visualized and analyzed with MOLMOL (40Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). DynDom was used to identify conformational changes and to define domains and effective hinge regions of the structures obtained under the three different sample conditions (41Feenstra K.A. Hess B. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 786-798Crossref Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the three structure ensembles, MeOH/H2O, DPCbound, and lipid II, were deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1MQX, 1MQY, and 1MQZ, respectively. The assignment of the resonances of mersacidin in various sample environments was achieved by a standard multidimensional NMR protocol using the15N-labeled sample (21Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. 1st Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). A two-step15N-1H HSQC titration of perdeuterated DPC micelles followed by unlabeled lipid II was then used to investigate the interaction of mersacidin and lipid II. Chemical shifts are excellent probes for biomolecular interaction studies because of their sensitivity to the changes in the surrounding chemical environment. They are commonly used for the mapping of ligand binding sites in proteins (42Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and yet, as will be discussed later, the chemical shift perturbations upon ligand binding can also be governed by structural rearrangements. The first step (DPC micelles) was used as a control to monitor how mersacidin was influenced by the membrane-mimicking environment. Both sequential titration experiments revealed significant chemical shift perturbations in mersacidin (Fig.2). The addition of DPC micelles strongly affects the backbone amide protons of Gly-7, Abu-13, Abu-15, and Glu-17 in the 1H dimension (mainly upfield shifts) and most of the C-terminal part in the 15N dimension (Fig.3). Along the 15N dimension, a downfield shift occurs at Dha-16, which is flanked by progressively increasing, almost symmetric, upfield shifts. Subsequent addition of lipid II gives rise to large downfield shifts for the amide protons of Gly-7, Abu-13, and Glu-17 in the 1H dimension; a similar chemical shift perturbation profile is observed in the 15N dimension. The general direction of change is, however, inverted compared with the first DPC micelles titration. Both titration steps result in clearly localized effects. Unlike the strong binding affinity between nisin and lipid II, which results in slow exchange cross-peak patterns in similar titration experiments (18Hsu S.-T. Breukink E. de Kruijff B. Kaptein R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. van Nuland N.A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7670-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), mersacidin follows a fast exchange profile indicative of weaker binding under these conditions. The gradual changes in position can easily be followed during the course of both titration processes (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly the addition of DPC micelles seems to affect mersacidin more than its specific target, lipid II, does. The titration data suggest an interesting interconversion process. For Gly-7, Gly-8, Ala-12, Abu-13, and Glu-17, the 1H chemical shifts first move upfield and then conversely shift downfield. A similar behavior is monitored along the 15N dimension for most residues, e.g.Glu-17. Since chemical shifts are closely related to the surrounding chemical environment primarily defined by the three-dimensional structure, the direction and displacement of the cross-peaks suggest that the structure of mersacidin undergoes a substantial change upon addition of DPC micelles and is somehow restored close to its initial conformation, if not identical, upon the subsequent addition of lipid II. Yet this could also be an indication that mersacidin falls off the DPC micelles after addition of lipid II and is restored to a"
https://openalex.org/W2109009897,"The importance of a functional Krebs cycle for energy generation in the procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei was investigated under physiological conditions during logarithmic phase growth of a pleomorphic parasite strain. Wild type procyclic cells and mutants with targeted deletion of the gene coding for aconitase were derived by synchronous in vitrodifferentiation from wild type and mutant (Δaco::NEO/Δaco::HYG) bloodstream stage parasites, respectively, where aconitase is not expressed and is dispensable. No differences in intracellular levels of glycolytic and Krebs cycle intermediates were found in procyclic wild type and mutant cells, except for citrate that accumulated up to 90-fold in the mutants, confirming the absence of aconitase activity. Surprisingly, deletion of aconitase did not change differentiation nor the growth rate or the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio in those cells. Metabolic studies using radioactively labeled substrates and NMR analysis demonstrated that glucose and proline were not degraded via the Krebs cycle to CO2. Instead, glucose was degraded to acetate, succinate, and alanine, whereas proline was degraded to succinate. Importantly, there was absolutely no difference in the metabolic products released by wild type and aconitase knockout parasites, and both were for survival strictly dependent on respiration via the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Hence, although the Krebs cycle enzymes are present, procyclic T. brucei do not use Krebs cycle activity for energy generation, but the mitochondrial respiratory chain is essential for survival and growth. We therefore propose a revised model of the energy metabolism of procyclic T. brucei.

Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In the mammalian bloodstream, the long slender form ofT. brucei proliferates, until at the peak of the parasitaemia nonproliferative short stumpy form cells accumulate that are prepared to differentiate to insect stage (procyclic form) parasites. In vivo this takes place in the tsetse midgut shortly after the insect blood meal. In culture this differentiation process (also referred to as transformation) can be induced by a temperature shift and the addition of millimolar concentrations of citrate or cis-aconitate (2Brun R. Schönenberger M. Z. Parasitenk. 1981; 66: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and in fully differentiation-competent trypanosome strains (termed pleomorphic) transformation is very rapid and perfectly synchronous (3Ziegelbauer K. Quinten M. Schwarz H. Pearson T.W. Overath P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Rolin S. Paindavoine P. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hanocq F. Claes Y. Le Ray D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Differentiation of T. brucei is accompanied by several profound structural and biochemical changes, including the glucose metabolism. The long slender bloodstream form depends entirely on glycolysis for energy generation and excretes pyruvate as the major end product of carbohydrate metabolism (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 7Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev.

In the procyclic stage, the end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, is not excreted but further metabolized inside the mitochondrion. Pyruvate is first oxidatively decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA, which is supposed to be further degraded to carbon dioxide by the Krebs cycle. This presumed flux through the Krebs cycle is, however, only poorly supported by direct experimental data and is mainly based on the detected presence of all the enzyme activities involved (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 7Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev.

As a result of this incomplete data set, many published metabolic schemes of procyclic T. brucei do not represent main catabolic fluxes but rather present a survey of all possible pathways of carbohydrate breakdown, including a complete Krebs cycle (6Fairlamb A.H.

However, a large part of the acetyl-CoA is converted to acetate inside the mitochondrion. In trypanosomatids this acetate is formed by a mitochondrial acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT)1 and involves a succinate/succinyl-CoA cycle, thereby generating extra ATP (16Van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3036-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Succinate is also an end product of glucose degradation and is excreted by procyclic trypanosomes (17Cross G.A. Klein R.A. Linstead D.J. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that this succinate is predominantly produced inside the glycosomes (18Besteiro S. Biran M. Biteau N. Coustou V. Baltz T. Canioni P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38001-38012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast to bloodstream form T. brucei, procyclic form cells can also use amino acids, most notably proline, for the generation of energy (9Evans D.E. Brown R.C. J. Protozool. 1972; 19: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of the Krebs cycle to carbon fluxes in the energy metabolism of procyclic trypanosomes, we studied the degradation of glucose and proline by a combined genetic and biochemical approach that was stimulated by our analysis of a targeted deletion of the single aconitase gene of T. brucei (19Fast B. Kremp K. Boshart M. Steverding D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. Von Haesler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We noticed that procyclic trypanosomes devoid of any aconitase activity were viable and able to proliferate. To assess the Krebs cycle contribution to energy production in the normal procyclic form trypanosome, ideally a complete but conditional repression of a key enzyme would be most informative. Conditional repression of genes by RNA interference has become extremely popular but suffers from a variable degree of repression and often leakiness, complicating metabolic studies. Targeted gene deletion of a key enzyme, on the other side, may lead to selection of compensatory epigenetic changes. Here we have targeted the aconitase gene in the bloodstream stage of the parasite where the encoded enzyme is only marginally expressed and is dispensable for growth (19Fast B. Kremp K. Boshart M. Steverding D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. Von Haesler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To be able to induce rapid and synchronous differentiation to the procyclic stage, we knocked out aconitase in a pleomorphic T. brucei strain for which we recently developed a gene transfer and selection procedure (21Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, we have constructed isogenic strains of procyclic form trypanosomes with and without expression of aconitase activity. Our investigations showed that deletion of the aconitase gene had no effect on differentiation and growth in culture of procyclic T. brucei. Further analysis of the metabolism of glucose and proline by procyclic trypanosomes led us to conclude that under the conditions studied, these substrates were not degraded by Krebs cycle activity. In addition, no metabolic or growth differences could be observed between wild type and knockout strains, which confirmed that Krebs cycle activity is not used for the generation of energy in procyclic T. brucei cells. The pleomorphic strain AnTat1.1 of T. brucei brucei was used in this study (for references see Ref. 21Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Bloodstream form parasites were grown either on agarose plates (21Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Carruthers V.B. van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2537-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or in HMI9 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1.1% methylcellulose (Methocel®MC 3000–5500 mPa.s, Fluka) (23Vassella E. Kramer R. Turner C.M. Wankell M. Modes C. van den Bogaard M. Boshart M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were counted with a Neubauer hemocytometer (depth, 0.01 mm). In vitrodifferentiation to the procyclic stage (transformation) was initiated as described before (21Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Procyclic cultures were maintained in SDM-79 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (2Brun R. Schönenberger M. Z. Parasitenk. 1981; 66: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Growth was monitored with a CASY TTC cell analyzer (Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany). For disruption of the aconitase in the pleomorphic T. bruceistrain AnTat1.1, promoterless targeting constructs (pBΔaconeo and pBΔacohyg) described in detail by Fast et al. (19Fast B. Kremp K. Boshart M. Steverding D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Trypanosomes were isolated from the blood of irradiated Wistar rats 2.5 days after infection at 2–5 × 107 cells/ml of blood. Electroporation and selection was done as described by Vassella et al. (23Vassella E. Kramer R. Turner C.M. Wankell M. Modes C. van den Bogaard M. Boshart M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 buffy coat trypanosomes were transfected with 10 μg of SalI-MluI-linearized target construct using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator set at 1.2 kV, 25 microfarads, and 186 Ω. After the electroporation cells were transferred to 10 ml of prewarmed HMI9 medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cultures were spun down, and 8 ml of the supernatant were discarded. The cell pellets were resuspended in the remaining 2 ml of HMI9 and transferred to 50 ml of prewarmed methylcellulose medium and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The culture volume was adjusted to 200 ml of the same medium, and transfectants were selected with 0.8 μg ml−1 G418 or a combination of 0.8 μg ml−1 G418 and 0.8 μg ml−1 hygromycin B. During selection the cell density was strictly kept below 5 × 105 cells ml−1. Double-resistant clonal cell lines were generated by limiting dilution. Genomic DNA was isolated from transfectants as described previously (22Carruthers V.B. van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cross G.A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2537-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was performed following standard procedures (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of SacII-digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized in QuickHybTM (Stratagene) for 1 h at 68 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions with ACO-,NEO-, and HYG-specific probes (a 2435-bpPstI-StuI fragment, a 526-bpEagI-NcoI fragment, and a 425-bpSacII-NcoI fragment, respectively). The blots were washed twice under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 65 °C. The probes were random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the PrimeIT random labeling kit (Stratagene). Lysates for Western blot analysis were prepared, subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following standard procedures (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The blot was probed with an affinity-purified anti-TbACO rabbit serum (20Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. Von Haesler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 and 5% dried milk powder. The blot was reprobed with an antibody against the mitochondrial protein Hsp60 from Synechococcus sp.(StressGen) diluted 1:2000 in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 and 5% dried milk powder. The signals were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Krebs cycle enzyme activities in freshly differentiated (transformed) procyclic T. brucei have previously been reported to change significantly with time and culture conditions (10Durieux P.O. Schütz P. Brun R. Köhler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, all experiments and comparisons of wild type and aco::NEO/aco::HYGclones reported here are based on established cultures of comparable cell density and passage number after in vitrodifferentiation. Protein extracts for the determination of enzymatic activity were essentially prepared as described by Overath et al. (25Overath P. Chichos J. Haas C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). 1 × 109 cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mm, KH2PO4, pH 7.4) or trypanosome dilution buffer (5 mm KCl, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mmglucose, pH 7.7), resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmdl-isocitrate, and cracked by three cycles of freeze-thaw lysis. The lysate was homogenized by several passages through a 0.6-mm syringe and then diluted 1:2 with stock solutions of cysteine and sucrose (final concentrations, 10 and 250 mm, respectively). The extract was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant containing 1–5 mg/ml protein (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) was used for the determination of enzymatic activity. Part of the extract was treated 10 min at 4 °C with Fe2+ by adding Fe2+-loading buffer (0.5 mm MES, 0.5 mmFeNH4SO4, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5) prior to the measurement of aconitase activity. Aconitase activity was measured continuously with a spectrophotometer thermostated at 25 °C according to the UV method (27Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction buffer 50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4) was supplemented with 30 mmdl-isocitrate as substrate. The reaction was started with protein extract, and the increase in absorbance at 240 nm was followed for 6 min. The specific activity was defined as the formation of nmol product min−1 mg−1 protein using an absorption coefficient of 3.4 mm−1 cm−1(27Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity was determined by monitoring the initial rate of NAD+ reduction at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 150 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm cysteine, 0.2 mm coenzyme A, 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, 4 mm NAD+, and protein extract. The reaction was started by adding the protein extract and NAD+ simultaneously. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was determined by monitoring the rate of NADP+reduction at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1.4 mm MnSO4, 5 mmdl-isocitrate, 0.5 mmNADP+, and protein extract. The reaction was started by adding protein extract and NADP+ simultaneously. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was measured by monitoring the initial rate of NADH oxidation at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.2 mm NADH, and protein extract. The reaction was started by adding the protein extract and NADH simultaneously. Nonspecific NADH oxidase activity was not detected in the same assay and time period without NH4Cl and α-ketoglutarate, and hence correction was not required. Established procyclic form cells in mid-log growth phase were harvested and washed twice in trypanosome dilution buffer. The pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Metabolite contents were determined using a HPLC method employing anion-exchange columns (Dionex AS-11 and AG-11) and dual (conductivity and UV) detection (28Vogt A.M. Ackermann C. Noe T. Jensen D. Kubler W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the trypanosomes were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 60% acetonitril (v/v) using a Braun Dismembrator (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) cooled with liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the homogenate was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 10,000 ×g in a cooled Eppendorf centrifuge at 0 °C. From the supernatant, 30 μl were lyophilized using a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 300 ml of ice-cold water with a specific resistance of 18 mΩ or greater. After filtration through 0.22-μm syringe filters (Gelman Acrodisc), the analyte was injected into the HPLC system after appropriate dilution. The metabolite contents were normalized to total cellular protein content that was assessed from the redissolved pellet (in 90 °C NaOH) according to standard methods (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Incubations (5 × 106 cells/ml) were carried out for 17 h at 27 °C in sealed 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 5 ml of SDM-79 incubation medium. The incubations were performed after the addition of either 5 μCi of d-[6-14C]glucose (2.07 GBq/mmol) or 5 μCi of l-[U-14C]proline (9.47 GBq/mmol) (both Amersham Biosciences). This implies that all of the incubations were performed in complete SDM-79 medium containing both glucose and proline with only one of these two radioactively labeled at a time. Incubations were terminated by addition of 40 μl of 6 mHCL to lower the pH to 3.5. Preceding acidification, 0.1 ml of 1m NaHCO3 was added through the rubber stopper, and the flasks were placed on ice. Immediately after acidification, the incubation flasks were flushed with nitrogen for 90 min at 0 °C. In this way all carbon dioxide is removed, whereas acetate remains in the incubation medium. The carbon dioxide was trapped in a series of four scintillation vials, each filled with 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH and 15 ml of scintillation fluid (29Horemans A.M.C. Tielens A.G.M. Van den Bergh S.G. Parasitology. 1990; 102: 259-265Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in this fraction was counted in Tritisol modified according to the method described by Pande (30Pande S.V. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After removal of carbon dioxide, the acidified supernatant was separated from the cells by centrifugation (4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g) and neutralized by the addition of 40 μl of 6 m NaOH. Analysis of the labeled end products occurred by anion-exchange chromatography on a Dowex 1X8, 100–200 mesh column (Serva) (60 × 1.1 cm) in chloride form (31Tielens A.G.M. Van der Meer P. Van den Bergh S.G. Parasitology. 1981; 3: 205-214Google Scholar). The column was eluted successively with 200 ml of 5 mm HCl, 130 ml of 0.2 m NaCl, and 130 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. The fractions were collected and counted with 2 ml of Lumac LCS in a scintillation counter. All of the values were corrected for blank incubations. Labeled end products were identified by theirRf values. The identity of the major end products produced in the [14C]glucose incubations was checked by 13C NMR spectroscopy. For that purpose both wild type and aco::NEO/aco::HYGprocyclic trypanosomes were incubated in the same medium as described above, except now all of the glucose normally present in SDM-79 (10 mm) was replaced byd-[U-13C]glucose (10 mm) (Sigma).13C NMR spectra of the incubation media were measured using a GARP sequence (globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses) for 1H decoupling and a 2-s repetition time (32Tielens A.G.M. Horemans A.M.C. Dunnewijk R. Van der Meer P. Van den Bergh Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A total of 30,000 scans was acquired using a spectral window of 31250 Hz and 32,000 data points after a 90° pulse of 10 μs. Chemical shifts were measured with respect to C-1 of β-glucose at 96.6 ppm relative to tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. 13C NMR spectra of succinate were also simulated, using the computer program NMRSIM of the Aurelia software package of Bruker. Glucose was assayed enzymatically using a standard procedure (33Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Schmidt F. Stork H. Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1970: 1163-1165Google Scholar), and the protein level was determined with the Lowry method, using bovine serum albumin obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, defatted with active carbon, and dialyzed before use, as standard (34Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Our strategy to investigate the metabolic role of the Krebs cycle in insect stage T. brucei included targeted deletion of the single gene encoding aconitase (20Saas J. Ziegelbauer K. Von Haesler A. Fast B. Boshart M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2745-2755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which had been shown to be nonessential in the bloodstream stage of the parasite (19Fast B. Kremp K. Boshart M. Steverding D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induced differentiation of these aconitase-deficient lines into the procyclic stage indicated that, in contrast to our expectation, aconitase was dispensable for growth of procyclic trypanosomes (not shown). However, inefficient differentiation of the monomorphic parental line introduced a selection step and did not provide us with mutant procyclic long term cultures for biochemical analysis of this phenotype. Therefore, homozygous deletion of ACO was performed in bloodstream form T. brucei of the pleomorphic strain AnTat1.1 that can be triggered to differentiate to the procyclic form in vitro with high efficiency and fast kinetics. Locus-specific targeting vector integration and deletion of both alleles of ACO in three independent double drug-resistant lines are documented in Fig. 1(A and B). Cultures ofaco::NEO/aco::HYGclones and wild type AnTat1.1 were then subjected to a standardin vitro differentiation protocol (21Vassella E. Boshart M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletion of ACO did not at all change the synchrony and kinetics of differentiation, 2B. Fast and M. Boshart, unpublished observation. providing a strong argument against selection, and did not change the growth rate of the resulting procyclic populations (Fig.2). Absence of aconitase in these procyclic cultures was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig.1C) and activity measurements (TableI). Total aconitase activity was reproducibly below the sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay in whole cell extracts of several independentaco::NEO/aco::HYGclones (Table I and data not shown). In contrast, enzymatic assays for activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase did not reveal any significant difference between wild type procyclic trypanosomes and two independentaco::NEO/aco::HYGclones (Table I).Figure 2Growth of procyclic AnTat1.1 clones devoid of aconitase activity.

Proteoglycans are composed of core proteins and covalently linked glycosaminoglycan side chains. Proteoglycans are distributed at cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrices of most animal tissues. Heparan sulfate and heparin are uronic acid-containing sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains that are comprised of repeat disaccharide units consisting of alternating GlcNAc and GlcUA or iduronic acid. Heparan sulfates and heparin have been implicated in blood coagulation, cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue morphogenesis, and viral and bacterial infection (1Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of enzymes in heparan sulfate biosynthesis can have severe biological consequences in mammals (3Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Human hereditary multiple exostoses disorder, characterized by benign tumors of bony outgrowths, has been attributed to mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 of theEXT(exostosin) gene family that encode various enzymes in heparan biosynthesis (4Duncan G.A. McCormick G. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

EXT1 and EXT2 are bifunctional enzymes with β1,4-glucuronyltransferase and α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities. Known as heparan polymerases, EXT1 and EXT2 elongate the heparan sulfate chain by alternative additions of GlcUA and GlcNAc to the non-reducing ends. Although a better understanding of how these EXT enzymes function is critical for elucidating their roles in heparan biosynthesis, no protein structure from the EXT family of enzymes is available, and the reaction mechanisms still remains elusive. In addition to the EXT enzymes, the EXT family also includes so-called EXT-like enzymes EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3 (7Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

Purified recombinant EXTL2 displays activity for transfer of GlcNAc and GalNAc from the respective UDP-sugars to an acceptor analog, [glucuronic acid]β1–3[galactose]β1-O-naphthalenemethanol (GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol) (7Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because of the α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity, EXTL2 is suggested to act as an enzyme that can transfer GlcNAc to the common linker tetrasaccharide of a core protein (8Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the α1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity is speculated as an activity that could provide a way to terminate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis all together (9Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether EXTL2 is this termination enzyme. EXTL2, the smallest of the known EXT homologues, consists of 330 amino acid residues and shows extensive amino acid sequence homology to the C-terminal region of EXT1 and EXT2 that presumably constitutes the α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase domain. Thus, EXTL2 provides an excellent model for investigating the structure-based mechanism of the α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase reaction catalyzed by the EXT gene family. Here we have determined the ternary complex structure of mouse EXTL2 (mEXTL2) 1The abbreviations used are: mmouseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PEGpolyethylene glycolα3GTα-1,3 galactosyltransferase1The abbreviations used are: mmouseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PEGpolyethylene glycolα3GTα-1,3 galactosyltransferase with UDP and the acceptor substrate analog GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol, the binary complex structures with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, and the structure of the apo-enzyme. These structures reveal conserved residues within theEXT gene family that play a role in substrate binding and/or catalysis. A site-directed mutagenesis study was performed to provide functional evidence to support their roles in catalysis. EXTL2 catalyzes a transfer reaction in which the α-linkage of the C1-O1 bond in the donor UDP-sugar is retained in the reaction product. Two different mechanisms for the retaining transfer reaction have been proposed, a SN2-like double-displacement mechanism (10Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and a SNi-like reaction mechanism (11Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The SN2-like double-displacement mechanism would likely involve a direct nucleophilic attack on the UDP-sugar at the C1 atom of the sugar from the opposite side of the UDP moiety. This would invert the stereochemistry at the C1, releasing the UDP moiety, to form a covalent intermediate. The acceptor hydroxyl could then attack the C1 carbon in the same manner releasing the protein side chain inverting the stereochemistry at the C1 atom back to its original state to form the final product. The SNi-like mechanism would involve a dissociation of the UDP and attack on the transition state by the acceptor from the same side as the leaving UDP to maintain the stereochemistry at the C1 carbon. Our present mEXTL2 structures are consistent with the SNi-like reaction mechanism for the retaining glycosyltransferases. The ternary complex also suggests that the UDP leaving group may facilitate sugar transfer by deprotonating the acceptor substrate. These structures represent the first from theEXT gene family and therefore provide important new information for enzymes involved in heparan biosynthesis and provide additional insight into glycosyltransferases in general. mouse 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) polyethylene glycol α-1,3 galactosyltransferase mouse 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) polyethylene glycol α-1,3 galactosyltransferase The upstream primer 5′-CGCGGATCCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATACCAACTTACTCCCCAACATCAAAG and the downstream primer 3′-CCCTAGTCTAGATCACATTTTACTTTTATCGTT were used to amplify the coding region (T38-M330) of EXTL2 from mouse (liver) cDNA by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into the pMAL-2c vector using the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. The corresponding construct was used to transform Top10 cells followed by retransformation into BL21 (DE3) cells. To express the soluble protein, 100 μl of overnight cell stock was added to 1 liter of 2YT medium plus 200 μg/ml ampicillin in a 2-liter flask and placed on a shaker at 250 rpm at 37 °C for 14 h. 20 ml of culture was added to each of 20 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of 2YT plus 200 μg/ml ampicillin. These flasks were placed at 37 °C on a shaker set at 250 rpm. When the A600reached 0.8, the temperature was set to 23 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Flasks were allowed to shake overnight. Cells were pelleted at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then resuspended in the sonication buffer containing 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone (TLCK), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice and then spun down at 38,000 rpm for 30 min. The ∼300 ml of soluble faction was allowed to bind to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) in batch at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. Resin was spun down at 4 °C for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was poured off, and the resin was washed with 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at a volume ratio of 10:1 (buffer:resin). Resin was pelleted and washed a total of five times. Protein was then eluted from the resin with a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm maltose. Protein was concentrated and dialyzed overnight in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Because treatment with factor Xa did not cleave the fusion protein, subtilisin was used to digest the fusion protein at a 1 to 10,000 subtilisin to EXTL2 mass to mass ratio. This cleavage was performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2 at room temperature for 1 h followed by overnight cleavage at 4 °C. The cleavage resulted in producing EXTL2 fragments with molecular masses of ∼30 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein was then loaded on to a Ni2+-agarose column and eluted with a gradient elution of imidazole from 0.0 to 0.3m. The protein was eluted from the Ni2+-agarose with ∼45 mm imidazole, dialyzed into 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Selenomethionine-labeled protein was obtained by transforming the plasmid containing the fusion protein into B834 (DE3) cells. For expression, 1 ml of overnight culture was added to 1 liter of expression medium in a 2-liter flask containing 10 g of M9 minimal salts, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1.0% glucose, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg/ml thiamine, 0.5 g of all essential amino acids (with the exception of methionine), 7.5 mg of FeSO4, and 50 mg of selenomethionine. 50 ml of 2YT was added to the flask for the starter culture. This was allowed to shake at 37 °C at 250 rpm overnight. 200 ml of the starter culture was spun down at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The cells were washed with the expression medium (containing no 2YT) and spun down again. Then the cells were resuspended in 25 ml of expression medium, and 5 ml was added to each of 18 2-liter flasks, containing 1 liter of expression medium. These flasks were placed on a shaker at 37 °C and 250 rpm. When the A600 reached 0.6 the temperature was changed to 23 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Flasks were allowed to shake overnight. The expressed selenium-labeled protein was purified using the same protocol as the wild-type enzyme with the exception of an addition of 0.5–1 mm dithiothreitol present at all steps. For mammalian expression of mutated EXTL2 enzymes, each expression plasmid (6 mg) was transfected into COS-1 cells in a 100-mm plate using FuGENETM 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 ml of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and resuspended in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 20 mmMnCl2 and 171 mm the sodium salt of ATP. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop method by mixing 4 μl of the digested protein in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl with 4 μl of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 10–12% polyethylene glycol 3000 (PEG3000), and 200 mmMgCl2. These crystals diffract at 2.4-Å resolution and were suitable for structural studies. For data collection of the apoprotein, crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution containing 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 17% PEG3000, 200 mm MgCl2, and 12.5% ethylene glycol and mounted in a cryo-loop and flash-frozen on the goniometer in a stream of nitrogen gas cooled to −177 °C by a Molecular Structure Corp. X-stream device. Oscillation data for this and all subsequent crystals were collected using phi scans on a rotating anode RUH3R generator equipped with a RAXIS IV area detector and MSC confocal blue mirrors. Data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (13Boix E. Zhang Y. Swaminathan G.J. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled protein were obtained using the same protocol as the native crystals but with an addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol present in the protein solution. Crystals of the CH3HgCl and HgCl2 derivative data sets were obtained by soaking native crystals in the reservoir solution containing saturated CH3HgCl or HgCl2 for ∼15 min and then back-soaking into the cryo-solution and flash-frozen (Table I). The isomorphous difference data between the selenomethionine data set and the native data set were used to find 16 selenium sites (eight sites per monomer with two monomers in the asymmetric unit) with the real space heavy atom search protocol in the program CNS (14Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38432) Google Scholar). Phases produced from these data were then used to find six mercury sites in both the CH3HgCl and HgCl2 data sets. Using the isomorphous difference data from all three derivatives and anomalous difference data from the mercury derivatives initial phases were calculated to 2.9 Å. The phases were extended to 2.4 Å using the solvent-flipping and phase-extension options in the density modify protocol of CNS (14Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38432) Google Scholar). The original model of the apo-enzyme of mEXTL2 was built into electron density calculated from these phases using the program O (15Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16944) Google Scholar). The model was subsequently refined using iterative cycles of model building and refinement in CNS utilizing the minimization, torsion angle refinement, and individual B-factor refinement protocols at each step. When all of the protein density had been accounted for with model building, water molecules were added using the water_pick protocol in CNS. Criteria for water selection were based on a 2.5-ς cutoff in peak height of aFo − Fc density map and a hydrogen bond distance criteria between 2.3 and 3.5 Å to an oxygen or nitrogen in the protein model. Additional water molecules were added manually in the program O based on Fo −Fc density maps and the presence of hydrogen bonding partners. Additional cycles of refinement and model building were carried out to obtain the final model. The crystal used for the UDP plus GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol data set was obtained by soaking an apo-crystal for 20 min in a solution containing three parts of 11% PEG3000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 0.2 m MgCl2 to one part 12.5% monomethyl ether PEG2000, 9% PEG3000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 0.2 m MgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5.0 mm UDP, 2.5 mm MnCl2, and 10 mmGlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol. The crystal was then transferred in two steps into the final cryo-solution containing 12.5% monomethyl ether PEG2000, 9% PEG3000, 13% ethylene glycol, 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mMgCl2, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm UDP, 2.5 mm MnCl2, and 10 mmGlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol. The crystal was flash-frozen, and data were collected. For the UDP-GlcNAc data set, a crystal was soaked in three parts mother liquor to one part cryo-solution containing 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc for 20 min. The crystal was transferred in two additional steps into the cryo-solution containing 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc and flash-frozen, and data were collected. For the UDP-GalNAc data set, the same procedure was used as for the UDP-GlcNAc data set with the substitution of 20 mm UDP-GalNAc for 10 mmUDP-GlcNAc. For refinement of the data sets containing bound substrates and analogs, the apo-model was refined against the data in CNS using the same methods as for the apo-protein. Substrates and analogs were manually built into Fo −Fc density maps followed by additional rounds of refinement in CNS. Water molecules for the substrate structures were then added using the same criteria as for the apo-structure followed by additional rounds of model building and refinement. All data were always refined at the maximum resolution reported except for the UDP-GlcNAc structure, which was completely refined to 2.3 Å and then the data were extended to 2.1 Å for additional rounds of model building and refinement. The quality of the models was analyzed with the program Procheck (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran statistics of the model are as follows: apo (87% most favored region, 12.3% additional, 0.7% generous, and no disallowed), UDP plus acceptor (88.6% most favored, 11.2% additional, 0.2% generous, and no disallowed), UDP-GlcNAc (89.9% most favored, 11.2% additional, and no generous or disallowed), and UDP-GalNAc (87.4% most favored, 12.6% additional, and no generous or disallowed). A mouse EXTL2 cDNA fragment that lacks the first 53 N-terminal amino acids of the EXTL2 was amplified by PCR with the full-length cDNA template and oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGAGATCAAATCCCCGAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCACACAGCATGGAGAAGCCACTG-3′ for 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The 5′-primer contained an in-frame BamHI site, whereas the intrinsic BamHI site was located 41 bp downstream of the stop codon. A two-stage PCR mutagenesis method was used to construct EXTL2 mutants. Two separate PCR reactions were performed to generate two overlapping gene fragments using the full-length mouse EXTL2 cDNA as a template. In the first PCR, the sense 5′-primer described above and one of the antisense internal mutagenic primers listed below were used: N243A, 5′-GCGATGTCGTCACAGGCCTGCGTCTCATC-3′; D246A, 5′-CATAGCGATGGCGTCACAGTTCTGCGTCTC-3′; H289A, 5′-CTCTGCAGAAAGGCCTCCGCCCGGTGCC-3′; and R293A, 5′-CTTATTTATACAGTAGGATGCCTGCAGAAA-3′. In the second round of PCR, the respective sense internal mutagenic primer (complementary to the antisense internal mutagenic primer) and the antisense 3′-primer described above were used. These two PCR products were gel-purified and then used as a template for a third PCR reaction containing the sense 5′-primer and the antisense 3′-primer described above. This produced the full-length version of the gene with the mutation incorporated. All PCR reactions were carried out with KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO). Each final PCR fragment of the mutants, as well as the wild-type EXTL2, was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (17Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the mutants, as well as the wild-type EXTL2, to the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector. An NheI fragment containing each of the above fusion protein sequences was inserted into the XbaI site of the expression vector pEF-BOS (19Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined with a 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GlcNAc transferase activities using 0.1 μm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (39.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and GalNAc transferase activities using 0.1 μm UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7 Ci/mmol; Sigma) were tested as described below. The assay mixture (25 μl) for GlcNAc transferase and GalNAc transferase contained 25 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, a radioactive donor substrate, 1 mmGlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol (custom-synthesized by the Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg of recombinant EXTL2 protein. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Radiolabeled products were then separated from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc or UDP-[3H]GalNAc by passage of the reaction mixture through a Sep-Pak® Vac RC C18 cartridge (Waters), as described previously (18Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recovered labeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To determineKm of an acceptor substrate for GalNAc and GlcNAc transferase activities, increasing concentrations (0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mm) of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol were added to the reaction mixtures. Data were fitted by a s/v − splot to calculate Km value. To measure the activity of the mutants, the assay mixture contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads (enzyme source), 250 nmol of GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenemethanol (250 nmol), 250 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (8.21 × 105 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 171 mm the sodium salt of ATP in a total volume of 30 μl. Radiolabeled products were then separated from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc by passage of the reaction mixture through HPLC on a Nova-Pak® C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters), respectively. The recovered labeled products were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In addition, the specific activities of all mutants, along with wild-type EXTL2, were calculated based on the transferase activities and the amounts of the purified fusion enzymes that were quantified using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). EXTL2 is a type II Golgi membrane protein that contains a hydrophobic membrane binding domain at the N terminus, followed by a stem region that connects the membrane binding domain to the C-terminal catalytic domain. Protease digestion of the recombinant EXTL2 generated the catalytic domain with an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa on an SDS-gel electrophoresis (data not shown). This catalytic domain lacks, at most, 62 N-terminal residues based on the first residue with significant electron density. Using GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-O-naphthalenmethanol as an acceptor substrate and the method established previously (18Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we characterized the α1,4-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase activity of the catalytic domain. The domain increased the activity as a function of the acceptor concentration and reached a plateau at ∼3 mm concentration. As reported previously (7Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), this domain catalyzed both UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNA transferase activities. The specific activity (7.55 ± 0.71 nmol/mg EXTL2/h) of the UDP-GalNAc transfer reaction was more than 10-fold higher than that (0.62 ± 0.03 nmol/mg EXTL2/h) of the UDP-GlcNAc transfer reaction. On the other hand, the Km values for the acceptor substrate were similar between the two reactions: 320 and 560 μm when UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc were used as the donor substrates, respectively. These results indicated that the bacterially expressed 30-kDa recombinant domain retains the functional characteristics of EXTL2. The catalytic domain of mEXTL2 crystallized in this study is a globular domain consisting of residues Ala-63 to Lys-327. This domain can be divided into two subdomains, referred to as the UDP binding subdomain, comprised of residues Ala-63 to Val-150, and the acceptor binding subdomain, comprised of residues Thr-154 to Lys-327 (Fig. 1, A andB). These two subdomains are connected by the signature sequence motif for UDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases, the DXD motif (Asp-151-Asp-153). This motif interacts with"

In the present study we examine the mechanism by which one of these pathways, involving Snf1, regulates cellular aging. Snf1 is a heterotrimer composed of a catalytic α subunit (Snf1p) that phosphorylates target proteins at Ser/Thr residues, an activating γ subunit (Snf4p), and a β subunit (Sip1p, Sip2p, or Gal83). We previously showed that forced expression of Snf1p or loss of Sip2p, but not the other β subunits, causes accelerated aging, while removal of Snf4p extends life span (Ashrafi, K., Lin, S. S., Manchester, J. K., and Gordon, J. I. (2000) Genes Dev. 14, 1872–1885). We now demonstrate that in wild type cells, there is an age-associated shift in Sip2p from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, a prominent redistribution of Snf4p from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, a modest increase in nuclear Snf1p, and a concomitant increase in cellular Snf1 histone H3 kinase activity. Covalent attachment of myristate to the N-terminal Gly of Sip2p is essential for normal cellular life span. When plasma membrane association of Sip2p is abolished by a mutation that blocks its N-myristoylation, Snf4p is shifted to the nucleus. Rapidly aging sip2Δ cells have higher levels of histone H3 kinase activity than their generation-matched isogenic wild type counterparts. Increased Snf1 activity is associated with augmented recombination at rDNA loci, plus desilencing at sites affected by Snf1-catalyzed Ser10 phosphorylation of histone H3 (the INO1 promoter plus targets of the transcription factor Adr1p). The rapid-aging phenotype of sip2Δ cells is fully rescued by blocking recombination at rDNA loci with afob1Δ allele; rescue is not accompanied by amelioration of an age-associated shift toward gluconeogenesis and glucose storage. Together, these findings suggest that Sip2p acts as a negative regulator of nuclear Snf1 activity in young cells by sequestering its activating γ subunit at the plasma membrane and that loss of Sip2p from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in aging cells facilities Snf4p entry into the nucleus so that Snf1 can modify chromatin structure.

Mother yeast cells undergo replicative senescence, with different strains having characteristic mean and maximum life spans (1Muller I. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1971; 77: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Senescence is associated with a number of cellular and molecular phenotypes. Progressive sterility arises from the loss of silencing atHM loci (2Smeal T. Claus J. Kennedy B. Cole F. Guarente L. Cell. 1996; 84: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This loss of silencing is accompanied by a redistribution of Sir3p, a component of the Sir-silencing complex, fromHM loci and telomeres to the nucleolus (3Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L. Science. 1997; 277: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination at rDNA loci liberates an extrachromosomal rDNA circle (ERC)1 that contains an autonomously replicating sequence (4Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). With each round of cell division, replicated ERCs segregate to the mother rather than to daughter, leading to an exponential increase in cellular ERC concentrations over successive generations. ERC formation is thought to be a mediator as well as a marker of aging. Exponential increases in ERCs likely leads to titration of critical DNA repair/replication and transcription factors (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Fob1p specifically acts at the rDNA locus, where it supports opening of the replication bubble (6Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and binds to HOT1 sites, thereby promoting homologous recombination. fob1Δ alleles block rDNA formation and extend life span ≥20% beyond wild type (wt) (4Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Mutations, such as sir2Δ, that reduce rDNA silencing are associated with increased rates of recombination and accelerated aging (7Smith J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 8Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The importance of the regulation of silencing in aging is also emphasized by the findings that Sir2p is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (9Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar) and that NAD+ production leads to Sir2p-dependent life span extension (10Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Cohen H. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To catalyze deacetylation, Sir2p converts NAD+ to nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (11Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1357-1361Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 12Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Yeast grown on medium containing nicotinamide, a noncompetitive Sir2p inhibitor, display Sir2p-dependent rDNA desilencing and a shortened life span (13Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The effects of NAD+ on Sir2p provide a potential link between aging and cellular glucose/energy metabolism. They also raise the question of how aging affects upstream elements in glucose-sensing pathways and whether such pathways affect replicative life span. S. cerevisiae has evolved elaborate and elegant mechanisms for sensing environmental glucose, its principal nutrient source. A major glucose-sensing pathway involves Snf1, the homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that is involved in regulating cellular stress responses (14Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Snf1 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of α, β, and γ subunits (15Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4936-4943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex contains one of three β subunits, Sip1p, Sip2p, or Gal83p, that binds to the catalytic α subunit, Snf1p (a serine/threonine kinase) (17Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The γ subunit, Snf4p (18Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), binds to an autoinhibitory domain of Snf1p, releasing its catalytic domain. Phosphorylation of Thr210in the Snf1p C-terminal activation loop also promotes kinase activity (19McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), although the Snf1p kinase kinase has yet to be identified. The Snf1 complex responds to glucose starvation by catalyzing phosphorylation of a number of target proteins, including transcriptional regulators of genes involved in alternative carbon source utilization, gluconeogenesis, and respiration (20Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For example, when glucose is limiting, Mig1p is hyperphosphorylated by Snf1p causing it to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and derepress gene expression (21DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have reported that forced expression of SNF1, or loss of Sip2p (sip2Δ), produces an accelerated aging phenotype (i.e. a shortened replicative life span accompanied by progressive sterility, redistribution of Sir3p from telomeres and HM loci to the nucleolus, and increased ERC accumulation) (22Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of Sip2p on aging is unique among Snf1 β-subunits:gal83Δ has no effect on life span and sip1Δproduces a modest (<20%) reduction in life span but without the other manifestations of accelerated aging. Loss of the γ subunit (snf4Δ) produces a 20% increase in life span (22Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results implied that increased Snf1 activity promotes rapid aging and that Sip2p functions to repress Snf1p activity. Two additional observations supported this hypothesis: (i) Mig1p undergoes progressive redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as wt cells and sip2Δ cells age, and (ii) the rapid-aging phenotype produced by sip2Δ is completely rescued bysnf4Δ (22Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). However, our studies indicated that the effects of Snf1 activation on life span must extend beyond its phosphorylation of Mig1p since mig1Δ cells did not undergo rapid aging (22Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Follow-up DNA microarray analysis revealed that a number of Mig1p-repressed genes were derepressed in generation 7–8 wt and sip2Δ cells compared with their generation 0–1 counterparts (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The analysis also identified a number of other genes with age-associated changes in their expression that are not regulated by Mig1p but are involved in various aspects of cellular energy metabolism. Direct biochemical analysis of cellular metabolism established that aging in wt cells is accompanied by a shift away from glycolysis and toward gluconeogenesis and energy storage (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This shift is deferred in snf4Δ cells and accelerated in isogenic sip2Δ strains leading to a proposal that the shift toward glucose and energy storage may be a mediator as well as a marker of aging (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Studies of the promoter region of INO1 (inositol-1-phosphate synthase) showed that Snf1 phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser10, which facilitates acetylation at Lys14by Gcn5p (histone acetyltransferase) (24Lo W.S. Duggan L. Tolga N.C. Emre Belotserkovskya R. Lane W.S. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These findings in young cells raise the possibility that Snf1 could promote aging by modifying chromatin structure at specific genomic loci. Therefore, in the current study, we have explored the mechanisms by which sip2Δoperates through Snf1 to regulate aging and chromatin structure. We show that covalent addition of myristate, a 14 carbon-saturated fatty acid, to the N-terminal Gly residue of Sip2p is essential for its localization to the plasma membrane and its contribution to a normal generational life span. As yeast cells age, Snf4p is redistributed from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. This redistribution, which is promoted by sip2Δ, is accompanied by increased cellular Snf1p histone H3 kinase activity, desilencing, and increased recombination at rDNA loci with increased ERC formation. The rapid-aging phenotype of sip2Δ cells is completely rescued by removing Fob1p, an essential mediator of ERC formation. Together, our results suggest that the glucose-sensing Snf1 pathway regulates aging by affecting chromatin structure and genomic stability.

Austriaco Jr., N.R. Zhang J. Guarente L. Cell. 1995; 80: 485-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) were used to define the number of divisions that individual virgin mother yeast cells undergo on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) agar plates at 24 °C (n = ≥40 mothers/genotype/experiment; n = two to three independent experiments/strain). Wt cells were used as reference controls in each experiment. The statistical significance of observed differences in life spans was evaluated using the nonparametric Wilcoxen signed rank test. When the surface proteins of a mother yeast cell are labeled with biotin, the daughter does not inherit the biotinylated proteins because its surface is generated de novo at the budding site (2Smeal T. Claus J. Kennedy B. Cole F. Guarente L. Cell. 1996; 84: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This allows mothers to be isolated from their progeny by streptavidin-magnetic bead sorting. The protocol used to obtain sorted populations of generation 0–1 and generation 7–8 or 9–10 cells is described in Ref. 2Smeal T. Claus J. Kennedy B. Cole F. Guarente L. Cell. 1996; 84: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar. Note that generation 0–1 refers to the population of cells that remains after old cells are removed by sorting; on average, 50% of this population will be composed of newly formed daughters, while 25% are mothers that have undergone a single cell division. Isogenic wt and sip2Δ cells were transformed with one of the following four CEN plasmids: pOV84 (Snf1p-green fluorescent protein (GFP fusion)), pOV76 (Snf4p-GFP), pRT9 (Sip2p-GFP) (27Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), (gifts from Marian Carlson, Columbia Univ.), or pBB507 (Sip2p (Gly1 → Ala)-GFP). Generation 0–1 and 7–8 cells were recovered by magnetic bead sorting from cultures grown in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose, suspended in a solution of 8 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 4 mmMgSO4, 26 mm ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose, incubated for 5 min at 24 °C, washed twice in the same solution, and then examined under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (n = two to three independent experiments). Snf1p contains an N-terminal domain with 13 histidine residues (His18–His30), facilitating its purification from cell lysates by Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography (20Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Generation 0–1 and 7–8 isogenic wt and sip2Δ cells (2–5 × 107; defined by hemocytometer counts) were recovered from a mid-log phase YPD culture by magnetic bead sorting, frozen in liquid N2, freeze-dried, and then incubated for 5 min at 1 °C in 1 ml of extraction buffer (20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 50 mm potassium fluoride). The resulting cell lysate was added directly to 1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer A (0.3m NaCl, 75 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 50 mm potassium fluoride). The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with buffer A (three cycles, 5 ml/cycle) and poured into a column, and Snf1 activity was eluted with 1 ml of buffer A supplemented with 50 mmimidazole. Eluted proteins were concentrated to 0.1–0.2 μg/ml (Centricon 30 filter column). The scheme for measuring histone H3 kinase activity in the 50-mm imidazole fraction is outlined in Fig. 1A. A 0.5-μl aliquot of the 50-mm imidazole-eluted fraction (containing 50–100 ng of protein) was added to 0.5 μl of kinase reagent (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.7, 0.04% bovine serum albumin, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mmpotassium fluoride, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), 0.5 mm ATP, 40 μg/ml rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (specific activity = 200 units/mg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) containing 0.5 mm of a previously published histone H3 peptide substrate for Snf1p (24Lo W.S. Duggan L. Tolga N.C. Emre Belotserkovskya R. Lane W.S. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1142-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLASKAARC; Biomolecules Midwest, Waterloo, IL). The 1-μl mixture was incubated for 60 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 μl of 0.2m HCl (10 min, 20 °C), and a second reaction initiated by adding 0.5 μl of a solution containing 200 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 80 mm NaOH, 0.08% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 8 μg/ml beef heart lactate dehydrogenase (specific activity = 500 units/mg; Sigma). The mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min at 20 °C. 0.5 μl of 0.4 m HCl was then introduced to destroy any excess NADH. To detect the NAD+ product generated from the Snf1p histone H3 kinase reaction (Fig. 1A), the product had to be amplified through a series of coupled reactions (for details of this well established analytic method, see Refs. 23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and28Passoneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Five thousand cycles of amplification were achieved by adding 0.5 μl of the reaction mixture to 0.1 ml of NAD cycling reagent (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm oxaloacetic acid, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 m ethanol, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 12.5 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase (specific activity = 300 units/mg; Sigma), 1.2 μg/ml malic dehydrogenase (specific activity = 3000 units/mg; Sigma)) and incubating the solution for 60 min at 24 °C. The reaction was terminated (100 °C; 5 min), cooled to room temperature, and 1 ml of malate indicator reagent (50 mm amino-methylpropanol (pH 9.9), 5 mml-glutamate (pH 9.9), 0.2 mm NAD+, 5 μg/ml malic dehydrogenase (3000 units/mg; Sigma), and 2 μg/ml glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (200 units/mg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) was added to convert the cycled product to NADH (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several types of reference standards and controls were run in parallel with the experimental reaction. NAD+ standards were always added at the cycling step into cycling reagent alone. Known amounts of malate was included as another reference control. A minus peptide reaction, and a reaction containing a synthetic phosphorylated histone H3 peptide (1ARTKQTARKpSTGGKAPRKQLASKAARC; Biomolecules Midwest) were used to confirm Ser10-specific phosphorylation. (Note that we were unable to detect Snf1p-catalyzed phosphorylation of the H3 peptide using unfractionated whole cell lysates due to the high background signal, as defined with the histone H3 peptide and its phospho-Ser10 derivative). DNA was prepared from sorted generation 0–1 and 7–8 cells according to Sinclair and Guarente (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) with one exception: no zymolyase was used in the first step; instead, 0.5 ml of sorbitol solution (0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA) was added to freeze-dried cell pellets. Purified DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through 0.7% agarose containing TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5). Following capillary transfer to GeneScreen Plus (Invitrogen), blots were probed with a 32P-labeled, 2.8-kBEcoRI fragment containing rDNA sequences from pNL47 (5Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Assays for recombination and silencing used PSY316a strains containing ADE2integrated into RDN1 or telomeric loci (Table I). To measure recombination rates, cells with a 2μ plasmid containingSNF1 under the control of its own promoter (21DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), or the empty YEp24 vector, were spread onto YPD/agar plates and incubated for 30 °C for 3 days. Recombination frequency was defined as the number of half-sectored red/white colonies divided by the total number of colonies (n = >104 colony scored/strain; n = four independent experiments). To measure silencing, cells were grown on synthetic complete medium. Individual colonies were picked and transferred to 1 ml of PBS. Cells were serially diluted in PBS and plated onto synthetic medium minus adenine. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 30 °C, and the number of viable colonies scored per dilution. Levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glycogen, NAD+, ATP, and AMP were assayed in young and old isogenic wt, sip2Δ,fob1Δ, and sip2Δ/fob1Δ cells using pyridine nucleotide-based enzyme-cycling methods. These previously described, sensitive methods permit analysis of enzymes and metabolites in a single sample of 106 sorted cells (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNAs were prepared from sorted generation 0–1 and 7–8 wt and sip2Δ cells (5 × 107 cells/sort;n = three independent sorts from separate cultures). Equivalent amounts of RNA from generation-matched cells from each sort of a given strain were pooled. Two cRNA targets were independently prepared from each RNA pool, and each cRNA used to interrogate a high density oligonucleotide-based Ye98 GeneChip (23Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons of expression levels in old versus young cells were performed for both strains using proprietary GeneChip software (Affymetrix). We began our analysis of the mechanisms by which Snf1 affects aging by characterizing the intracellular distributions of its Snf1p α subunit, Sip2p β subunit, and Snf4p γ subunit in generation 0–1 and 9–10 wt cells that had been grown in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose. Snf1p, Snf4p, and Sip2p with C-terminal GFP reporters were all expressed from low copy CEN plasmids under the control of their own promoters. Previous studies have shown that each of these constructs fully rescues the growth phenotypes produced by the null alleles of the corresponding gene in log phase cells (27Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This rescue suggests that the GFP fusions accurately represent the trafficking patterns of the wild type proteins. The majority of Snf1p-GFP is present in the cytoplasm of young (generation 0–1) cells, with a small fraction appearing in the nucleus. By generation 9–10, there is a modest shift in the protein to the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Sip2p-GFP is largely associated with the plasma membrane in young cells. As cells age, there is increased representation in the cytoplasm of a subset of cells (Fig. 2B). Like Sip2p-GFP, Snf4p-GFP is plasma membrane-bound in young cells, although there is also cytoplasmic localization. With age, Snf4p-GFP shifts away from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2C). Our previous in vitro studies had established that Sip2p is substrate for myristoyl-CoA:proteinN-myristoyltransferase (Nmt1p) (30Ashrafi K. Farazi T.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25864-25874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nmt1p catalyzes the transfer of tetradecanoate (myristate; C14:0) from CoA to the N-terminal Gly1 residues of ∼70 yeast proteins (30Ashrafi K. Farazi T.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25864-25874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This modification occurs co-translationally and appears to be irreversible.N-Myristoylation is known to promote protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions that typically involve components of signal transduction cascades (e.g. kinases, kinase substrates, protein phosphatases, and α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins; reviewed in Ref. 31Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We examined the contribution of N-myristoylation to the plasma membrane targeting of Sip2p. Substituting the Gly1of Nmt1p substrates with Ala is sufficient to completely block theirN-myristoylation (31Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated Gly1 of Sip2-GFP to Ala, yielding Sip2G1A-GFP.

Thus, we explored roles for P2Y and P2X receptors in stably increasing [Ca2+]i in human CF (IB3-1) and non-CF (16HBE14o−) airway epithelial cells. Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured by fluorospectrometry using the fluorescent dye Fura-2/AM. Expression of P2X receptor (P2XR) subtypes was assessed by immunoblotting and biotinylation. In IB3-1 cells, ATP and other P2Y agonists caused only a transient increase in [Ca2+]i derived from intracellular stores in a Na+-rich environment. In contrast, ATP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i that had transient and sustained components in a Na+-free medium; the sustained plateau was potentiated by zinc or increasing extracellular pH. Benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP, a P2XR-selective agonist, increased [Ca2+]i only in Na+-free medium, suggesting competition between Na+ and Ca2+through P2XRs. Biochemical evidence showed that the P2X4receptor is the major subtype shared by these airway epithelial cells. A role for store-operated Ca2+ channels, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, or Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in the ATP-induced sustained Ca2+ signal was ruled out. In conclusion, these data show that epithelial P2X4 receptors serve as ATP-gated calcium entry channels that induce a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. In airway epithelia, a P2XR-mediated Ca2+ signal may have therapeutic benefit for CF. Purinergic receptor stimulation has potential therapeutic effects for cystic fibrosis (CF).

Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar). Originally, CFTR was thought to function exclusively as a low conductance Cl− channel (2Gregory R.J. Cheng S.H. Rich D.P.

More recently, it has become clear that CFTR also regulates a series of other transporters and ion channels, such as the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, the Na+:HCO3− cotransporter, epithelial Na+ channels, K+ channels, and aquaporin water channels (4Schreiber R. Greger R. Nitschke R. Kunzelmann K. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol.

Although the exact mechanisms of the regulation of these proteins by CFTR are not yet fully understood, it is clear that impaired Cl− transport is shared as a key disease phenotype by CF epithelia from all affected tissues and that this pathway is lost in CF. Therefore, activation of a cAMP-independent Cl− secretory pathway through exploitation of a naturally expressed epithelial protein could be of interest for CF therapy. In certain cases, stimulation of Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels can correct the impaired HCO3− secretion in CF cells (6Zsembery Á. Strazzabosco M. Graf J.

Once ATP is released into the extracellular space, it can bind to purinoceptors regulating a variety of functions in different epithelia (13Schwiebert L.M. Rice W.C. Kudlow B.A. Taylor A.L.

In fact, earlier studies have proposed the use of UTP and non-hydrolyzable UTP analogs as therapeutic agonists targeted to the P2Y2 receptors in the treatment of CF lung disease (23Knowles M.R. Olivier K. Noone P. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: S65-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bennett W.D. Olivier K.N. Zeman K.L. Hohneker K.W. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 1796-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Purinoceptors are divided into two classes: P1 or adenosine receptors, and P2, which recognize primarily extracellular ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP. The P2 receptors are further subdivided into two subclasses. P2X receptors are extracellular ATP-gated calcium-permeable non-selective cation channels that are modulated by extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+, H+, and metal ions such as Zn2+ and/or Cu2+ (25North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). P2Y receptors couple to heterotrimeric G proteins and phospholipases (primarily phospholipase Cβ) to raise intracellular free calcium concentration (26Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). In CF epithelial cells from multiple tissues, expression of P2X and P2Y receptors appears unaffected, offering the possibility to increase [Ca2+]i through targeting a naturally expressed receptor in the apical or basolateral membrane domains (27Taylor A.L. Schwiebert L.M. Smith J.J. King C. Jones J.R. Sorscher E.J. Schwiebert E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in different CF epithelial cell models, the desensitization of P2Y receptors and the transient nature of the Ca2+ response upon chronic and repeated delivery of a P2Y-specific agonist have made it difficult to generate stable stimuli for ion secretion (7Zsembery Á. Jessner W. Sitter G. Spirli C. Strazzabosco M. Graf J. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Warth R. Greger R. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 3: 2-16Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we used both CF (IB3-1) (30Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 4: L313-L319Google Scholar) and non-CF (16HBE14o−) (31Gruenert D.C. Basbaum C.B. Widdicombe J.H. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) human airway epithelial cell models, to dissect out P2X-specific and P2Y-specific mechanisms of triggering an increase in [Ca2+]i. We characterized a broad range of P2Y-selective, P2X-selective, and non-discriminant P2Y and P2X agonists under different chemical and ionic conditions to explore possible strategies to elicit an increase in [Ca2+]i that is sustained and prolonged. Results described herein, using Fura-2/AM-based imaging, show that activation of P2Y and P2X receptors increases [Ca2+]i by completely distinct mechanisms. P2Y receptors elicit a transient increase in [Ca2+]i derived from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, whereas P2X receptors trigger a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i, allowing Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. In addition, biochemical evidence shows that the P2X4 receptor is the major epithelial subtype present in both cell lines. Thus, we conclude that epithelial P2X receptors function as ATP-gated Ca2+entry channels in the plasma membrane and have profound potential as a target for CF pharmacotherapy. IB3-1 cells derive from airway epithelia of a CF patient carrying two different mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common trafficking mutation (ΔPhe-508) and a premature stop codon mutation (W1282X) (30Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 4: L313-L319Google Scholar). 16HBE14o− cells are non-CF or normal airway epithelial cells, which express CFTR at the plasma membrane. The cells were grown on Vitrogen 100-coated tissue-culture flasks in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. IB3-1 cells were cultured in LHC-8 (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1× l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1.25 μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen). 16HBE14o− cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. When cells reached confluency, they were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. The cells were then suspended using trypsin/EDTA solution and plated on diluted Vitrogen-coated (collagen types I and IV diluted 1:15 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) glass coverslips. For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were used 48–72 h after plating. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured with dual excitation wavelength fluorescence microscopy (Deltascan, Photon Technologies, Princeton, NJ) after cells were loaded with the permeant form of the fluorescence dye Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM; Teflabs, Austin, TX). Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at an emission wavelength of 510 nm in response to the excitation wavelength of 340 and 380 nm, alternated at a rate of 50 Hz by a computer-controlled chopper assembly. Ratios (340/380 nm) were calculated at a rate of 5 points/s using PTI software. Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 5 μm Fura-2/AM and 1 mg/ml Pluronic F-127 dissolved in Me2SO for 120 min to allow loading of the dye into the cells. After loading, coverslips were rinsed at least for 10 min in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline to remove extracellular Fura-2/AM and the surfactant and were positioned in the cuvette at a 45° angle from the excitation light. Two glass capillary tubes were inserted into the top of the cuvette out of the patch of the excitation light. One tube was extended to the bottom of the cuvette and connected by way of polyethylene tubing to an infusion pump. The other capillary tube was positioned at the top of the cuvette and served to remove fluid from the cuvette. The volume of the cuvette was ∼1.5 ml, and the flow rate was ∼5 ml/min. It is important to note that switch in perfusion solutions is removed in time and space for the cuvette, such that a 10–15-s time lag exists before agonist is exposed to the cells. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence intensities at both wavelengths were assessed, and only those preparations in which there were >200,000 counts/s for both wavelengths were used for experiments. At the beginning of each experiment, cells were perfused with solution A (see below), and the fluorescence ratio was monitored for at least for 100 s to establish a stable base-line value. Agonists and antagonists were then added to the appropriate solutions (see later). The 340/380 nm ratios (R) were converted into [Ca2+]i values using the equations of Grynkiewicz et al. (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as follows: [Ca2+]i= Kd × ((R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R)) × (Sf380/Sb380) where Kd is the dissociation constant of Fura-2 for Ca2+, Rmax and Rmin are R values under saturating and Ca2+-free conditions, respectively, and Sf380 and Sb380 are the fluorescent signals (S) emitted by Ca2+-free (f) and Ca2+-bound (b) forms of Fura-2 at a wavelength of 380 nm. In situ cell calibrations were accomplished after the cells were permeabilized with ionomycin (2 μm) under Ca2+-free (10 mm EGTA) and saturating Ca2+ (3 mm CaCl2) conditions. TheKd was assumed to be 224 nm (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded and washed as described for intracellular [Ca2+] measurement. Fluorescence signal was measured at 359 nm (isosbestic wavelength) in the presence of MnCl2 (500 μm) to detect Ca2+-independent changes in Fura-2 fluorescence (33Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1522-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 0.5 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma) adjusted to pH 7.2–7.4. Twenty micrograms of protein were run per lane and separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA). Immunoblotting was performed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to P2X4 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) at a dilution of 1:500. P2X1, P2X2, and P2X7 antibodies were also obtained from Alomone Laboratories and were tested in a similar manner. Reactivity was detected by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:3,000 dilution, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to visualize the secondary antibody. Cells were seeded on Vitrogen-coated (collagen types I and IV diluted 1:15 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) 12-mm filters and grown as polarized monolayers with a transepithelial resistance that exceeded 400 ohms/cm2. Cells were placed on ice and washed 3 times with cold PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mmMgCl2. Cells were then incubated in 1.0 mg/ml poly(ethylene)oxid maleimide (Pierce) or sulfo-NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) in cold supplemented PBS for 25 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 4 times with cold supplemented PBS, and the biotin was quenched with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were then washed 3 times with cold supplemented PBS. Alternatively, cells could be biotinylated with biocytin hydrazide. Filters were first incubated in 300 μl of a stock solution containing 30 mm NaIO4 and 600 μl of a stock solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 5.5, for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Filters were washed and subsequently incubated with 1.0 mg/ml biocytin hydrazide (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were collected as described above in immunoblotting procedures. Immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were added to the lysates at a 1:10 dilution and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and incubated in sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The immunoblotting procedure then continued as described above. Buffers for [Ca2+]imeasurement contained (mmol/liter) the following: for solution A: NaCl 140, KCl 3, KH2PO4 1.3, Na2HPO4 8, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2; for solution B: NaCl 140, KCl 3, KH2PO4 1.3, Na2HPO4 8, MgCl2 1, Na-EGTA 1; for solution C: NMDG-Cl 140, KCl 4.5, Hepes 10, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2; and for solution D: NMDG-Cl 100, KCl 40, Hepes 10, MgCl2 1, CaCl22. The solutions are at pH 7.3 unless indicated otherwise. In Fura-2 quenching experiments MnCl2 (500 μm) was added to Ca2+- and EGTA-free solutions. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. An unpaired Student's t test was used to compare the data in different experimental groups. Results were considered significant ifp < 0.05. For original Fura-2 traces shown in the figures, data are graphed with calibrated cytosolic free calcium on they axis, because data from an individual preparation of cells was accumulated for all of the experiments in that figure where a calibration was also performed. Because not all data were generated from cells of the same passage or where a calibration was not performed for every preparation, the data in tables are shown as ratiometric data. To test for the presence of purinergic receptors in IB3-1 cells, we measured the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration after stimulation with different agonists to both P2Y and P2X receptors in physiologic bath solution (solution A) containing Na+. Superfusion of cells with solution containing ATP (100 μm) caused a rapid increase in the ratio (340/380 nm) of Fura-2 fluorescence (rbasal = 0.89 ± 0.09 torpeak = 1.19 ± 0.13; n = 15). However, the response was transient, and the [Ca2+]i returned close to basal value within 200 s after stimulation, even in the continuous presence of agonist (r = 0.92 ± 0.09; n = 15) (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when cells were exposed to ATP for the second time, only a small and even more transient change was detected in Fura-2 fluorescence (Fig.1A). Administration of 10 μm ATP caused a comparable but smaller change in [Ca2+]i (TableI). The effect of ATP was completely inhibited by the application of suramin (100 μm) (TableI). ADP, 2MeSATP (100 μm each), and ADPβS (10 and 100 μm) also caused an increase in cytosolic Ca2+concentration, showing similar characteristics described for ATP (Fig.1, B–D, and Table I). Because 2MeSATP and ADPβS increased [Ca2+]i in a similar manner to ATP and ADP, these data argue strongly for activation of P2Y1 receptors over other P2Y subtypes. In contrast, neither UTP (100 μm) (Fig. 1A) nor UDP (100 μm) had any effect on Ca2+ concentration (Table I). To explore whether degradation of ATP or ADP plays role in elevation of [Ca2+]i, we tested the effects of adenosine (100 μm). Because adenosine did not increase [Ca2+]i, we did not pursue the participation of P1 receptors in increasing [Ca2+]i (Table I).Table IMaximum changes in Fura-2 fluorescence in IB3-1 cells in Na+-containing mediumΔratio%nATP (100 μm)0.30 ± 0.1110015ATP (10 μm)0.20 ± 0.10674ATP (100 μm) + suramin (100 μm)0.04 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05 relative to ATP (100 μm).134ATP (100 μm) + Ca2+-free media0.18 ± 0.031-ap < 0.05 relative to ATP (100 μm).605ADP (100 μm)0.38 ± 0.171278ADP (100 μm) + Ca2+-free media0.16 ± 0.051-bp < 0.05 relative to ADP (100 μm).424ADPβS (100 μm)0.37 ± 0.061237ADPβS (10 μm)0.28 ± 0.079332MeSATP (100 μm)0.24 ± 0.06803ATP (100 μm) + ZnCl2 (20 μm)0.25 ± 0.07834ATP (100 μm) at pHe = 7.90.38 ± 0.181272ATP (100 μm) at pHe = 6.40.22 ± 0.02732UTP (100 μm)No increase06UDP (100 μm)No increase03Adenosine (100 μm)No increase04BzBzATP (100 μm)No increase03α,β-MeATP (100 μm)No increase03Δratios (340/380 nm) are maximum changes in Fura-2 fluorescence in response to purinergic agonists versus basal fluorescence.

Activation of P2Y1 receptors leads to G protein-coupled phospholipase C- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent release of Ca2+from intracellular stores. As such, P2Y agonists should increase cytosolic Ca2+ even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Therefore, we repeated the experiments with ATP (100 μm) (Fig. 2A) and ADP (100 μm) superfusing IB3-1 cells with solutions containing EGTA (1 mm) instead of CaCl2(solution B). Similar to control conditions, both agonists increased [Ca2+]i transiently, indicating that their effects, at least partially, were independent from extracellular Ca2+ (Table I). Nonetheless, the absence of extracellular Ca2+ reduced the agonist-induced peak increase in [Ca2+]i (Table I). Again, under these conditions, the Ca2+ transients decayed fully back to base line within 200 s. Interestingly, these data did suggest that, besides P2Y1 receptor activation, purinergic agonists may also trigger Ca2+ influx from extracellular stores, which contributes to the peak increase in [Ca2+]i. Nevertheless, under these ionic conditions, Ca2+ influx was not sufficient to support a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, the goal of this study. Experiments described below lend clarification to these early data. Multiple subtypes of P2X receptors have already been described in human, rabbit, and rodent airway epithelial cells (27Taylor A.L.

Nature. 1999; 400: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that the higher peak in [Ca2+]i in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and the loss of the full response in Ca2+-free extracellular solution could be explained by the concomitant activation of P2X receptors activated by ATP. To test this hypothesis, we superfused IB3-1 cells with “solution A” containing either α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-MeATP, 100 μm) or benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP (BzBzATP, 100 μm) (Fig.3A), selective agonists for different P2X receptor subtypes. Under these conditions, P2X-selective purinergic agonists failed to change [Ca2+]i(Table I). However, we were aware of the fact that α,β-MeATP and BzBzATP, although potent agonists at P2X1, P2X3, and P2X7 receptors, have little or no effect at other P2XR subtypes. Thus, we hypothesized that changing the ionic composition of the superfusion medium might reveal activation of a Ca2+ entry mechanism by these agonists (see below). Despite the negative data above with regard to P2X-selective agonists, we maintained the hypothesis that P2X receptors were involved in the full Ca2+ response induced by ATP in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Rationale for this hypothesis is given by the fact that, in human and mouse lymphocytes, Na+ might compete with Ca2+ for entry through P2X receptors from extracellular stores (36Wiley J.S. Dubyak G.R. Blood. 1989; 73: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pizzo P. Zanovello P. Bronte V. Di Virgilio F. Biochem.

Blood. 1996; 87: 682-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as other families of Ca2+ entry channels like the transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) or the store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) (39Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Arnon A. Hamlyn J.M. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C163-C173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that extracellular Na+ might suppress the Ca2+ permeability of P2X receptor channels in IB3-1 cells. To verify this hypothesis, we substituted extracellular Na+ by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) (solution C) and tested the effects of a non-discriminant P2Y and P2X agonist (ATP), P2X-specific agonists (BzBzATP and α,β-MeATP), and a P2Y1-specific agonist (ADPβS). As shown in Fig.2B (and in Fig. 5B and Fig. 7, A and B), substitution of extracellular Na+ by NMDG itself caused a small but sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (rbasal = 0.89 ± 0.04 to rNMDG = 0.94 ± 0.04;n = 31; p < 0.05) which was completely absent when extracellular Ca2+ was also omitted from the superfusion medium. These observations suggest the presence of a mechanism that allows sustained Ca2+ entry, even in non-stimulated cells.Figure 7Representative traces showing the duration of the sustained plateau in [Ca2+]i in IB3-1 CFcells induced by ATP under Na+-free conditions (pH 7.9) (A) and the reversibility, long lived, and reproducible nature of the sustained plateau induced by ATP and mediated by P2X4 (B). Each trace for each protocol is typical of 3 such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Following removal of extracellular Na+ and changes in [Ca2+]i, we applied ATP (100 μm). Under these conditions, ATP induced a further increase in [Ca2+]i displaying a biphasic Ca2+response consisting of an initial transient peak and a sustained component (Fig.2B and Tables II andIII). In addition, as shown in Fig.2B, a second application of ATP elicited a smaller increase in the [Ca2+]i peak; however, the sustained Ca2+ plateau was comparable with that observed after the first stimulation by ATP. When [Ca2+]i reached a stable value after withdrawal of extracellular Na+, we also added either BzBzATP (100 μm) (Fig. 3B) or α,β-MeATP (100 μm). BzBzATP, but not α,β-MeATP, induced a small increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.3B and Tables II and III). This increase was completely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating a role for P2X receptors in Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3Band Table II). In Na+-free media, P2Y1-specific agonist, ADPβS (100 μm), augmented the peak increase in [Ca2+]i (Table II) but failed to elicit a sustained Ca2+ plateau (Table III). Taken together, these data argue for a role for P2X receptors as Ca2+ entry channels in IB3-1 cells.Table IIMaximum changes in Fura-2 fluorescence in IB3-1 cells in Na+-free mediumΔratio%nATP (100 μm)0.82 ± 0.242-ap < 0.05 relative to ATP (100 μm) in sodium-containing medium (see Table I).10011ATP (100 μm) + Ca2+-free media0.25 ± 0.142-bp < 0.05 relative to ATP (100 μm) alone.314ATP (1"

Its degradation is greatly accelerated by association with the polyamine-induced regulatory protein antizyme 1 (AZ1). Mouse ODC (mODC) that is expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also rapidly degraded by the proteasome of that organism. We have now carried outin vivo and in vitro studies to determine whether S. cerevisiae proteasomes recognize mODC degradation signals. Mutations of mODC that stabilized the protein in animal cells also did so in the fungus. Moreover, the mODC degradation signal was able to destabilize a GFP or Ura3 reporter in GFP-mODC and Ura3-mODC fusion proteins. Co-expression of AZ1 accelerated mODC degradation 2–3-fold in yeast cells. The degradation of both mODC and the endogenous yeast ODC (yODC) was unaffected in S. cerevisiae mutants with various defects in ubiquitin metabolism, and ubiquitinylated forms of mODC were not detected in yeast cells. In addition, recombinant mODC was degraded in an ATP-dependent manner by affinity-purified yeast 26 S proteasomes in the absence of ubiquitin. Degradation by purified yeast proteasomes was sensitive to mutations that stabilized mODC in vivo, but was not accelerated by recombinant AZ1. These studies demonstrate that cell constituents required for mODC degradation are conserved between animals and fungi, and that both mammalian and fungal ODC are subject to proteasome-mediated proteolysis by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms.

It is a multisubunit, ATP-dependent, protease composed of at least two subcomplexes: a barrel-shaped 20 S core particle that sequesters the proteolytic active sites from the intracellular environment, and a 19 S regulatory particle that contains activities required for recognition, unfolding, and translocation of substrates to the interior of the core particle (1Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Google Scholar). Its substrate proteins include major regulators of cell growth and differentiation, and also proteins that fail to fold into a native conformation. The proteasome needs therefore to recognize appropriate substrates accurately to support proper timing of cellular events and to eliminate proteins that have failed to follow normal folding pathways. Many of these short-lived proteins are targeted to the proteasome by the conjugation of ubiquitin, an evolutionarily conserved 76-amino acid globular protein (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). The efficient recognition of ubiquitinylated substrates by the proteasome requires, minimally, the formation of a tetraubiquitin chain on the substrate protein (3Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar). The polyubiquitin signal is in turn recognized by a receptor site that includes the Rpt5/S6′ ATPase subunit of the regulatory particle (4Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Additionally, the proteasome has the capacity to recognize a class of substrates that do not require ubiquitin modification for their regulated degradation (5Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 341-344Google Scholar). These include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC),1 which catalyzes the initial step in polyamine biosynthesis. In most eukaryotic cells, ODC is subject to regulation by spermidine and spermine, the end products of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. These act not through allosteric feedback regulation, the usual mechanism, but by changing the abundance of the ODC protein (6Davis R.H. Morris D.R. Coffino P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 280-290Google Scholar). This form of feedback regulation is accomplished by an autoregulatory circuit composed of ODC, polyamines, and the regulatory protein antizyme 1 (AZ1) (7Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Google Scholar). Excess polyamines induce a +1 translational frameshift of the AZ1 mRNA that is required to align a short upstream open reading frame (ORF) with a downstream ORF encoding the functional protein (8Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S.I. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Google Scholar). AZ1 binds the ODC monomer, dissociating the enzymatically active ODC homodimer and thereby inhibiting its activity (9Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Google Scholar). AZ1 binding exposes a COOH-terminal degradation signal in the ODC protein that leads to an increased rate of degradation of ODC by the proteasome (10Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Google Scholar). The AZ1-dependent degradation of ODC by the proteasome is remarkable in that it occurs in mammalian cells independently of the ubiquitinylation of ODC. Both in vivodata (11Glass J.R. Gerner E.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 351-357Google Scholar, 12Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. Eur. J.

Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Google Scholar) support this conclusion. The ODC-AZ regulatory circuit has been best characterized in mammalian cells, but functional AZ homologs have also been described in a number of other organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (15Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Google Scholar), the fly Drosophila melanogaster (16Ivanov I.P. Simin K. Letsou A. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1553-1561Google Scholar), several filamentous fungi, and the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (15Ivanov I.P. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1907-1917Google Scholar, 17Chattopadhyay M.K. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21235-21241Google Scholar). However, no AZ homolog is evident in the genome sequence of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (18Zhu C. Karplus K. Grate L. Coffino P. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). In this organism, polyamine regulation of ODC resembles that of mammalian cells in that excess polyamines increase the rate of ODC degradation (19Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Google Scholar). Polyamine regulation in S. cerevisiae also involves de novoprotein synthesis (20Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Google Scholar), a requirement of an AZ-like regulatory mechanism, but not of polyubiquitinylation. Both yeast and mouse ODC are rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome in S. cerevisiae(19Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Google Scholar, 21Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Google Scholar). Proteasome structure is highly conserved between mammals and fungi, and so too is the general use of ubiquitin modification as a marker for recognition of substrates. We ask here whether, and to what extent, mammalian and yeast proteasomes also share the capacity to recognize and respond to the structural hallmarks that are used in mammalian cells for the constitutive and regulated degradation of ODC. We show here that for both yeast and mouse ODC, degradation in yeast cells does not depend on ubiquitin. We found that recognition of mouse ODC requires similar structural and functional elements, regardless of the source of the proteasome, implying that ubiquitin-independent substrates, like those that depend on ubiquitin, must utilize a conserved discriminatory capacity of the proteasome. Yeast strains were maintained and manipulated using standard protocols (22Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). For analysis of FLAGmODC and yODCFLAG turnover (reported in Figs. 1, 3, and 4), the appropriate expression vectors were transformed into strain Y13 (MATα his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 spe1Δ::HisGspe2Δ::LEU2), a polyamine auxotroph (19Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Google Scholar). Growth in defined medium of polyamine auxotrophic strains was maintained by addition of 0.1 ॖm spermidine, a concentration insufficient for repression of endogenous yODC; the level of spermidine in the medium was increased to 1 mm to induce repression of yODC. Vectors for the expression of GFP or Ura3 fusion proteins (Fig. 2) were transformed into strain MHY501 (MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112 lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52) (23Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S.

The resulting TRP1-marked CEN/ARSvector was designated p414SPE1. The COOH-terminal FLAG-tagged yODC ORF was cloned as a BamHI-XhoI PCR product into p414SPE1 to create p414SPE1-yODCF. To generate COOH-terminal truncations of mODC, the mODC ORF was amplified using a common sense primer complementary to the NH2 terminus of mODC (including the FLAG epitope tag and flanking restriction sites) and antisense primers that introduce stop codons at Phe425(mODCΔ425–461) or Ala457 (mODCΔ457–461). The AZ1ΔT ORF was cloned from pGEM4Z/ΔT (8Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S.I. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Google Scholar) as aHindIII-EcoRI fragment into similarly digestedURA3-marked Mumberg vectors. GFP-mODC fusions were constructed by splice overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) using a pGFPuv vector (BD Sciences Clontech) as a template. A PCR fragment containing the COOH-terminal half of the GFP ORF was generated by a sense primer overlapping the XhoI site within the GFPuv coding region, and an antisense primer complementary to the COOH terminus of GFPuv and amino acids 425–461 of mODC. A second PCR fragment was generated by amplification of the COOH terminus of the mODC or mODCC441Acoding region using a sense primer complementary to the antisense primer used to generate the GFP fragment and an antisense primer that appended an EcoRI site following the stop codon of the mODC ORF. Following SOE-PCR, the resulting DNA fragments were digested withXhoI and EcoRI, and ligated into a similarly digested pGFPuv vector from which the fragment containing the COOH terminus of GFPuv had been removed. The ORFs encoding GFPuv and GFP-mODC fusion proteins were subcloned from the pGFPuv-based vectors into yeast expression vectors as XbaI-EcoRI fragments. Ura3-mODC fusions were constructed similarly to the GFP-mODC fusions by SOE-PCR. The coding region of URA3 was amplified from the pRS306 vector (34Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) using a sense primer that appended an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope tag and a flankingBamHI site, and an antisense primer complementary to the COOH terminus of Ura3 and amino acids 425–461 of mODC. A DNA fragment containing the COOH terminus of mODC was generated using a sense primer complementary to the antisense primer used to amplify theURA3 coding region and an antisense primer that appended anEcoRI site following the stop codon of the mODC ORF. Following SOE-PCR, the DNA fragment encoding Ura3-mODC was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into similarly digested yeast expression vectors. Pulse-chase analysis was carried out similarly to the protocol described by Suzuki and Varshavsky (35Suzuki T. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6017-6026Google Scholar). 10-ml cultures of yeast transformants were grown to midexponential growth phase (A600 0.5–1). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3 min, 2000 × g), and washed twice in 1 ml of SD medium lacking methionine (SD −Met). The cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of SD −Met and labeled for 5 min at 30 °C with 200 ॖCi of a l-[35S]methionine andl-cysteine mixture (Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To terminate incorporation of radiolabel and initiate a chase, cells were collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of SD medium containing 10 mm methionine, 1 mmcysteine, and 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide. Incubation was continued at 30 °C. At each time point 100 ॖl of cells were removed and transferred to a 2-ml screw-top microcentrifuge tube containing 700 ॖl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 500 ॖl of 0.5-mm glass beads. Cells were lysed by 4 pulses of 30 s duration in a Mini-beadbeater (Biospec Products), with cooling on ice between pulses. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C), and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined. The volumes of lysates were adjusted to contain equivalent amounts of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity for immunoprecipitations. For immunoprecipitations of FLAG-tagged proteins, normalized volumes of lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 ॖl of a 507 slurry of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations of Leu-ॆ-galactosidase or GFP were carried out by incubation of lysates with 1 ॖl of anti-ॆ-galactosidase antibody (Promega) or anti-GFP antibody (BD Sciences Clontech) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 ॖl of a 507 slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and a further 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by brief centrifugation (2000 ×g, 20 s), and washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.17 SDS. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 107 (FLAGmODC, yODCFLAG,FLAGUra3 fusions, or GFP fusions) or 7.57 (ॆ-galactosidase) polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). For immunoblot analysis 5-ml cultures of yeast cells were grown to midexponential growth phase in SD medium lacking the appropriate nutritional supplements. Cells were collected by centrifugation (3 min, 2000 × g), and washed in 5 ml of water, followed by resuspension in 200 ॖl of phosphate-buffered saline + 17 Triton X-100. The cell suspension was added to 200 ॖl of glass beads and lysed by 3 pulses of 20 s duration in a Mini-beadbeater with intermittent cooling on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and volumes of lysates containing 20 ॖg of total protein were fractionated by SDS-107 PAGE. Fractioned proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and developed using the Amersham ECL detection kit and protocol. Filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline + 17 Triton X-100 (TBS-T) including 57 powdered low-fat milk and 57 bovine serum albumin, and washed 3 times for 5 min with TBS-T. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, 1:2000 dilution) and sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Amersham Biosciences, 1:15,000 dilution). For detection of ubiquitin conjugates, cells were grown and harvested as described above, but lysis and immunoprecipitations were carried out in buffers containing 50 mmN-ethylmaleimide. Hemagglutinin-ubiquitin conjugates were detected, following fractionation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, by incubation with anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution). Proteasomes were affinity purified from RJD1144 cells as described (28Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Google Scholar). Normally, this purification protocol involves separating tagged proteasome complexes from extracts using anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads followed by elution of the complexes with FLAG peptide. We have found that the FLAG peptide causes activation of the normally gated 20 S core particle that results in a reproducible ATP-independent degradation of mODC. 2M. A. Hoyt and P. Coffino, unpublished results. To avoid exposure to the FLAG peptide, we used proteasome complexes still associated with the antibody-agarose, a form active for ATP-dependent proteolysis of mODC. Briefly, cells were grown to early stationary phase (A600 2–2.5) in 2 liters of SD medium and harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 20 min). The cells were pooled and washed in 100 ml of ice-cold water. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 107 glycerol) containing 5 mm ATP and drop frozen in liquid N2 in a mortar resting in a bed of dry ice. The cells were ground with a pestle for 30 min with periodic additions of liquid N2 to keep the material frozen. The ground cells were thawed and most cell debris was removed from the lysate by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 10 min), followed by a second centrifugation (30,000 × g, 20 min) to remove remaining debris. 10 ml of the cleared lysate (∼200 ॖg of protein) was incubated with 300 ॖl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 90 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min), transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and washed with 10 ml of buffer A containing 2 mm ATP and 0.27 Triton X-100, followed by 2 washes with 1 ml of buffer A with 2 mm ATP. The proteasome-agarose beads were resuspended in an equal volume of buffer A with 2 mm ATP and used for degradation assays. Total protein bound to the anti-FLAG agarose was estimated by elution in 1m NaCl followed by protein determination of the resulting eluate. The degradation of mODC by purified proteasomes was followed by a released radiolabel assay. Recombinant radiolabeled mODC was produced in Escherichia coli as described elsewhere. 3M. Zhang, C. M. Pickart, and P. Coffino, EMBO J., in press. Degradation assays were performed in 20-ॖl reaction volumes at 37 °C and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm KCl, 107 glycerol, an ATP regenerating system (2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1.6 mg/ml creatine kinase), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and proteasomes. Reactions were initiated by addition of substrate and quenched by addition of 140 ॖl of 207 (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min) at 4 °C, and 150 ॖl of the supernatant was removed and released counts were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Percentage degradation of radiolabeled mODC was determined as the released counts/min minus background counts/min divided by total input counts/min. Total input counts were determined by substituting water for trichloroacetic acid in the reactions. Background counts/min were determined in reactions that excluded proteasomes, and were typically ∼17 of total input counts. The fluorescence of GFPuv and GFP-mODC proteins in yeast transformants was measured in arbitrary units with a TD-700 laboratory fluorometer (Turner Designs) using a 394-nm excitation filter and a 510-nm emission filter. Fluorescence measurements were made in cultures at exponential growth phase (A600 0.5–1), and background autofluorescence was measured in an empty vector transformant and subtracted from raw fluorescence measurements. To facilitate studies of mODC degradation in S. cerevisiae, we appended a single copy of the FLAG epitope tag to the NH2 terminus of mouse ODC (FLAGmODC). The tagged mODC was expressed from yeast centromeric expression vectors (33Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar) in a spe1Δspe2Δ mutant. This mutant lacks enzymes that catalyze key steps in polyamine biosynthesis inS. cerevisiae, and cannot accumulate spermidine, the effector of polyamine regulation in this organism. Polyamine pools are thus accessible to experimental control in this genetic background. Mouse ODC expressed in yeast cells is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (21Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Google Scholar). We compared, in yeast transformants, the degradation of FLAG-tagged wild type mODC expressed from either the yeastADH promoter or the stronger GPD promoter. We found that wild type FLAGmODC expressed from theADH promoter was easily detectable by immunoblotting (Fig.1A) and rapidly degraded inspe1Δspe2Δ cells with a half-life of ∼10 min, as measured by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 1B). The expression of FLAGmODC protein from a vector containing the more active GPD promoter led to a 3-fold stabilization ofFLAGmODC in those transformants (half-life = ∼30 min, Fig. 1B), suggesting that overexpression interferes with normal degradation of mODC as it does with turnover of endogenous yODC (19Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Google Scholar, 36Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Google Scholar, 37Gupta R. Hamasaki-Katagiri N. White Tabor C. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10620-10623Google Scholar). We used vectors containing the ADH promoter to compare turnover of wild type and mutant forms of mODC in yeast cells. The"

Triiodothyronine (T3), the bioactive form of thyroid hormone, triggers a unique form of hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes that accompanies the selective activation or suppression of specific gene targets. In this study, we show that the BNP gene is a target of T3 action. BNP secretion was increased 6-fold, BNP mRNA levels 3-fold, and BNP promoter activity 3–5-fold following T3 treatment. This was accompanied by an increase in myocyte size, sarcomeric organization, and protein synthesis. Of note, several of the responses to T3 synergized with those to the conventional hypertrophic agonist endothelin. The response to the liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) was mediated by an unusual thyroid hormone response element located between −1000 and −987 relative to the transcription start site. Both TR homodimers and TR·retinoid X receptor heterodimers associated with this element in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Protein fragments harboring the LXXLL motifs of the coactivators GRIP1 and SRC1 or TRAP220 interacted predominantly with the TR·retinoid X receptor heterodimeric pair in a ligand-dependent fashion. Both TR homodimers and heterodimers in the unliganded state selectively associated with glutathione S-transferase-nuclear receptor corepressor fragments harboring one of three receptor interaction domains containing the sequence (I/L)XX(I/V)I. These interactions were dissociated following the addition of T3.

T3-dependent effects appear to be unique from those associated with so-called pathological hypertrophy (e.g. that due to hemodynamic overload in vivo) in that T3 treatment of the pathologically hypertrophied myocardium produces a shift in the gene expression profile away from that which is typically identified with pathological hypertrophy alone (18Chang K.C. Figueredo V.M. Schreur J.H. Kariya K. Weiner M.W. Simpson P.C. Camacho S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1742-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and toward a profile more closely resembling the physiological hypertrophy associated with exercise training (3Kinugawa K.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone that is linked closely with hypertrophy both in animal models (19Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Itoh H. Suga S. Komatsu Y. Kishimoto I. Nishino K. Yoshimasa T. Nakao K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and humans (20Mukoyama M. Nakao K. Saito Y. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Suga S. Shirakami G. Jougasaki M.

Ikeda M. Kurihara N. Nishizawa Y. Morii H. Takeda T. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1059-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence to indicate that this is accompanied by changes in BNP gene expression in the cardiac myocyte, nor have these changes been linked to the hypertrophic phenotype. Thyroid hormone exerts its effects in target cells through interaction with high affinity nuclear receptors present in chromatin (23Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These receptors associate with cognate DNA recognition elements, termed thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), as monomeric, homodimeric, or heterodimeric (typically partnered with the related retinoid X receptor (RXR)) complexes. These, in turn, interact with coregulatory nuclear proteins that promote enhanced (coactivators) or reduced (corepressors) transcriptional activity. The p160 family of coactivators (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein (GRIP1/TIF2/NCoA-2), the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC1/NCoA-1), and the coactivator for the nuclear hormone receptor (ACTR/pCIP/Rac3/AIB1/TRAM-1)) associate with the liganded TR and promote assembly with additional regulatory proteins (e.g.CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein and p300) harboring histone acetyltransferase activity that is capable of modifying chromatin structure in a manner that leads to increased gene transcription (24Jenkins B.D. Pullen C.B. Darimont B.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 122-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The TR has also been shown to interact with a second class of coactivators collectively termed the TRAP (TR-associated protein)-DRIP (vitamin Dreceptor-interactingprotein) complex (25Ito M. Roeder R.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This complex is capable of promoting receptor-dependent transcription on naked DNA, presumably by fostering contacts with the core transcriptional apparatus (26Ito M. Yuan C.X. Okano H.J.

In this study, we have identified the BNP gene as a target of thyroid hormone action in the myocardial cell. Interaction of the liganded TR with the BNP gene promoter takes place largely through a single TRE located ∼1 kb upstream from the start site of transcription. This interaction provides the substrate for assembly of various coactivator and corepressor complexes that control transcription of this gene.

Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6472-6479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% enriched calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin for 24 h. Cells were changed to serum-free medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin prior to initiation of each experiment. The culture medium of each well was collected after 24 h of treatment and centrifuged to remove cellular debris; the supernatant was taken for assay. Radioimmunoassay was performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) using rabbit antiserum specific for rat BNP-45 and 125I-labeled rat BNP-45. Protein synthesis was assessed by measuring [3H]leucine incorporation into cultured ventricular myocytes. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24 h and then changed to serum-free medium and subjected to treatment for 48 h. Cells were pulsed with [3H]leucine in leucine-free medium for the final 4 h of the treatment period, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracted with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell residues were rinsed in 95% ethanol, solubilized in 0.25 n NaOH for 2 h, and neutralized with 2.5 mm HCl plus 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter and normalized to cell number. Total RNA was isolated from cultured ventricular myocytes using RNAzol (LPS Industries Inc., Moonachie, NJ). Fifteen μg of RNA was size-fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized simultaneously with 32P-labeled 640-bp rat BNP cDNA and32P-labeled 1.3-kilobase pair glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. The membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film. Autoradiographic signals were scanned and quantified by NIH Image. Normalized data are presented as the ratio of BNP to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels in individual samples. The construction of −1595hBNP-luciferase has been described previously (32LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been described previously, as have expression vectors encoding the GST-NCoR-His fusion proteins of the three NCoR receptor interaction domains (RIDs) (37Marimuthu A. Feng W. Tagami T. Nguyen H. Jameson J.L. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The latter included RID1 (NCoR residues 2231–2321), RID2 (residues 2034–2114), and RID3 (residues 1888–2031). GST-GRIP1 (amino acids 618–770) was amplified by standard PCR methodology from pSG5-GRIP1 using synthetic primers incorporating EcoRI and SalI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the coding sequence, respectively. Amplified DNA was restricted with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-mutant GRIP1 (mGRIP1) expression vector was constructed in a similar fashion, except that pSG5-mGRIP1 was used as a template. mGRIP1 contains double alanine substitutions of two leucines (LXXLL → LXXAA) in nuclear receptor boxes 2 (residues 685–701) and 3 (residues 740–756) (36Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter are required for TR binding to GRIP1. GST-TRAP220 has been reported previously by Yuan et al.(38Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). GST-SRC1 was constructed by linking residues 632–752 of SRC1 to six His residues at the carboxyl terminus of the fragment. AnNdeI site was then added to the amino terminus and aSalI site to the carboxyl terminus of the chimeric fragment using conventional PCR methodology. The resultant fragment was cloned between the NdeI and SalI sites of pGEX-5X. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The sequence of the TRE mutagenic primer (sense strand) was as follows (mutagenized bases are identified by lowercase letters): 5′-CGATCTCCTtAtCaCGcGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′. Freshly prepared ventricular myocytes were transiently transfected with the indicated reporters (6 μg/1.5 × 107 cells) and expression vectors (see figure legends for DNA concentrations) by electroporation (Gene-Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 280 mV and 250 microfarads. DNA content in individual cultures was normalized with pUC18. Cells were plated (1.25 × 106/well) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/H-21 containing 10% enriched calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then changed to serum-free medium overnight prior to treatment. Cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Cell lysates were processed for the luciferase assay as described (32LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit (Promega). Luciferase levels were normalized for concentrations of soluble protein in the extracts. To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated with three to five independent cell preparations. Ventricular myocytes were cultured in four-chamber slides for 24 h and then changed to serum-free medium and subjected to treatment for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, followed by PBS containing 0.2% Triton for 2 min. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 μg/ml normal horse IgG and incubated with mouse anti-rat sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (EA-53, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 30 min. After three consecutive washes, cells were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Linear dimensions and surface areas of individual cells were calculated using semiautomatic computer-assisted planimetry from two-dimensional images. GST fusion expression vectors were transformed into the BL21 strain of E. coli (Stratagene), expanded in suspension culture, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted; sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20; and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g. The supernatant was decanted, added to 300 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was transferred to a 10-ml Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm glutathione, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to the column, and the elute was collected in 200-μl fractions. Protein concentration was measured using Coomassie reagent. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. GST fusion protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C prior to use. Oligonucleotides encoding wild-type and mutant TREs (both sense strand) were as follows (TRE-like sequence is underlined, and mutagenized bases are identified by lowercase letters): wild type, 5′-CGATCTCCTGACCTCGTGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′; and mutant, 5′-CGATCTCCTtAtCaCGcGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′. Oligonucleotides used for scanning mutagenesis were as follows: wild type, 5′-CGATCTCCTTGACCTCGTGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′; M1, 5′-CGATCTCCTTaAaaTCGTGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′; M2, 5′-CGATCTCCTTGACCTCGTaATaaGACCGCCTCG-3′; M3, 5′-CGATCTCCTTGACCTCGTGATCCataaGCCTCG-3′; M4, 5′-CGATCTCCTTGACCTCGTGATCCGACCaaaTCG-3′; and M5, 5′-CGATaTaaTTGACCTCGTGATCCGACCGCCTCG-3′. hTRβ or hRXRα was synthesized in vitro using the TnT T7 Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μl of each in vitrotranslated protein was incubated with purified32P-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide in binding reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, a 10–50-fold molar excess of unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction. For cofactor assembly experiments, varying amounts of GST-GRIP1, GST-SRC1, GST-TRAP220, or GST-NCoR RID1–3 fragments were added to the binding reaction in the absence or presence of 10 nmT3. For immunoperturbation experiments, 1 μg of polyclonal antibody directed against TRβ or RXRα was included in the reaction. All samples were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film to generate autoradiographs. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls test to assess significance. We began by examining the ability of T3 to increase expression of the BNP gene in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, exposure to T3 for 48 h resulted in a >6-fold increment in release of BNP immunoreactivity from cultured myocytes. This was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in steady-state BNP mRNA transcript levels (Fig. 1B). For reference, endothelin (ET), a well documented activator of BNP gene expression (39Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14612-14619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40Liang F. Lu S. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 188-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hypertrophy (41Ito H. Hirata Y. Adachi S. Tanaka M. Tsujino M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 92: 398-403Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar) in this in vitro model, effected an almost 8-fold increase in BNP mRNA levels; however, the combination of ET plus T3 resulted in an increase in transcript levels (∼20-fold) that was clearly greater than additive, implying a synergistic interaction between these two agonists. T3effected a modest increase (2–3-fold in this experiment) in BNP promoter activity, whereas ET increased activity by ∼10-fold (Fig.1C). Once again, ET plus T3 synergistically increased promoter activity by >60-fold. Given the known ability of both T3 and ET to promote distinct forms of hypertrophy of myocardial cells in vitro(2Deng X.F. Rokosh D.G. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Ito H. Hirata Y. Adachi S. Tanaka M. Tsujino M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 92: 398-403Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and in vivo (4Basset A. Blanc J. Messas E. Hagege A. Elghozi J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 37: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Ito H. Hiroe M. Hirata Y. Fujisaki H. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Ohta Y. Marumo F. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2198-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of these agents on conventional markers of hypertrophy in the cultured myocyte model. As shown in Fig.2A, T3 and ET stimulated protein synthesis, assessed as [3H]leucine incorporation, by ∼2.5- and 4-fold, respectively. The combination of both agents was roughly additive, with a net induction of ∼7-fold. Morphologically, both T3 and ET increased cell size and sarcomeric organization in these cultured myocytes (Fig.2B). The effect was somewhat more pronounced with ETversus T3. Calculation of linear dimensions of cells cultured under each of these conditions showed that ET increased both the length and width of the individual myocytes, whereas T3 preferentially affected the length (Fig. 2C). Myocyte surface area was increased by both agents. In each instance, the combination of both agents led to an increase in cell dimensions and enhanced sarcomeric definition to a level that surpassed that with either agent alone, supporting the protein synthesis data described above. T3 effected a dose-dependent increment in BNP promoter activity that peaked at 10−8m, with a maximal induction of 5–6-fold (Fig.3A). Amplification of the response was seen following cotransfection with either hTRα or hTRβ (Fig. 3B). Both TRα and TRβ are known to be expressed endogenously in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (3Kinugawa K. Yonekura K. Ribeiro R.C. Eto Y. Aoyagi T. Baxter J.D. Camacho S.A. Bristow M.R. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Maximal induction with TRβ was ∼7.5-fold in this series of studies, whereas that with TRα was in the range of 4-fold. As noted above, the liganded TR is thought to exert most of its transcriptional effects through association with its cognate TRE. This leads to subsequent association with one of several coactivators that, in turn, promote downstream events (histone acetylation, complex assembly on the promoter, etc.), resulting in increased transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of T3 to the cultures resulted in a 3-fold increment in BNP-luciferase activity, which was increased to 5-fold following cotransfection with the hTRβ expression vector and to 9-fold following cotransfection with both hTRβ and the heterodimeric partner RXR. Little or no suppression of basal activity by unliganded TRs was observed, suggesting that the majority of the T3effect that was observed corresponded to positive enhancement of promoter activity rather than relief of basal repression. Of note, cotransfection of the coactivator molecule GRIP1 together with TRβ and RXR resulted in a significant increase in basal promoter activity (this was dependent on the concentration of GRIP1 expression vector added to the cells), which increased even further following the addition of T3. The relative induction (i.e.-fold induction) seen following GRIP1 cotransfection was lower than that seen in cells transfected with TRβ alone or TRβ·RXR, reflecting the elevation in basal promoter activity; however, the absolute magnitude of the inductions was clearly greater in those cultures cotransfected with GRIP1. The elevation in basal promoter activity likely reflects the ability of the p160 coactivators to amplify the activity of other non-ligand-dependent transcription factors (43Rogatsky I. Zarember K.A. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6071-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that may control the activity of this promoter. Next, we attempted to identify the location of the TRE responsible for trafficking the liganded TR signal on the BNP gene promoter. Careful scrutiny of the known sequence for candidate sites revealed a potential TRE at −1000 that showed a high degree of homology to the consensus TRE (Fig. 5A) (44Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Our initial impression was that the TRE was arrayed as two direct repeats in reverse orientation. The 5′-repeat is a complete match to the consensus half-site (TGACCT; AGGTCA on the"

It was suggested that they act by pumping their respective substrate into the lumen of the vacuole depending on the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase. Using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation we found that an hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Tpo1p as well as its HA-tagged Tpo2p–4p homologues co-localize with plasma membrane markers. Because the HA-tagged Tpo1p carrier protein proved to be functional in conferring resistance to polyamines in TPO1 knockouts, a function of Tpo1p in transport of polyamines across the plasma membrane seemed to be likely. The polyamine transport activity of wild type cells was compared with the respective activity of a TPO1 knockout strain. The results obtained strongly suggest that Tpo1p is a plasma membrane-bound exporter, involved in the detoxification of excess spermidine in yeast. When studying polyamine transport of wild type cells, we furthermore found that S. cerevisiae is excreting putrescine during the fermentative growth phase.

Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). Because these compounds are toxic in higher concentrations, their intracellular content is tightly regulated by controlling biosynthesis and degradation and also by transport into intracellular storage compartments or out of the cell. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are found. All three compounds are actively transported into the vacuole by a substrate/nH+antiport mechanism (2Kakinuma Y. Masuda N. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Four transport proteins, Tpo1p–Tpo4p, have been postulated to be responsible for the polyamine transport capability of the yeast vacuolar membrane (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). According to their protein sequences, these four proteins are all members of a family of multidrug resistance transporters within the major facilitator superfamily. Tpo1p was identified by its sequence similarity to theBacillus subtilis multidrug transporter Blt, which is involved in spermidine excretion (5Woolridge D.P. Vazquez-Laslop N. Markham P.N. Chevalier M.S. Gerner E.W. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8864-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The other transporters of this group were found on the basis of sequence similarity to Tpo1p (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The function of all Tpo proteins was deduced from the phenotype of mutant strains. Their overexpression led to an increased tolerance for polyamines added to the growth medium, whereas a respective deletion rendered the cells more sensitive to polyamines. Evidence for their participation in vacuolar polyamine uptake, however, was largely indirect. In the course of a project to identify new vacuolar transporters belonging to the class of secondary carriers, we were looking for a well characterized carrier of this type in the yeast vacuolar membrane to use as a control for localization assays. We chose Tpo1p because of its sequence similarity to the transport proteins we were interested in, in particular to Ycr023p. In an analysis of their subcellular distribution, however, we found that all Tpo transporters are actually localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. This observation encouraged us to perform a detailed study on Tpo1p function. The results obtained suggest that at least Tpo1p participates in polyamine export out of the cell. The haploid S. cerevisiaestrain 23344c (MATα ura3) was used as genetic background for all of the experiments. This strain is isogenic with Σ1278b (6Béchet J. Greenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Bruno André (Brussels, Belgium). The cells were grown aerobically at 30 °C. Preparation of yeast-rich (YPD) and synthetic complete minimal media followed standard recipes (7Dohmen R.J. Stappen R. McGrath J.P. Forrova H. Kolarov J. Goffeau A. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18099-18109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Growth assays on solid media were performed using a modified citrate-buffered yeast minimal medium (8Jacobs P. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) in which the Mg2+ content was limited to 50 μm to enhance polyamine sensitivity (9Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For polyamine export experiments and for the preparation of vacuolar vesicles, a modified CBS medium described by Verduyn et al. (10Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) was used, containing 20 g/liter glucose and 5 g/liter NH4SO4. Uracil auxotrophic strains were grown in the presence of 20 mg/liter uracil. The CBS medium was buffered with either 1% succinic acid adjusted to pH 5.8 with NaOH or 50 mm potassium phthalate at pH 5.5 Replacement of the TPO1 gene by lacZ was done via PCR-based gene targeting using the gene disruption cassette encoded by plasmid pUG6lacZ (11Boles E. de Jong-Gubbels P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2875-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid contains the lacZ gene from Escherichia coli, followed by the dominant kanMX marker, and is a derivative of pUG6 described by Güldener et al. (12Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used for the amplification of the disruption cassette were 5′-TTTTTTTTAGTCAAAGAAGCAAGAGAAAACTAGACAGAGACAATGTTCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC and 5′-AAAAATGCAAATATAGAAAGAGCATGATTTCTGCTTTTCTTTTTCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG. Genomic HA1 tagging of the four TPO genes and of the open reading frame YCR023c was performed by using the plasmid pUG6-HA (13Buziol S. Becker J. Baumeister A. Jung S. Mauch K. Reuss M. Boles E. FEMS Yeast Res. 2002; 2: 283-291PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes three tandem repeats of a HA epitope followed by kanMX. Via PCR a DNA molecule was generated, consisting of a 3xHA-kanMX marker cassette flanked by short regions homologous to the end of the respective gene. The PCR primers used for this purpose consisted of 45 nucleotides corresponding to the genomic sequence ultimately upstream and downstream, respectively, of the stop codon of the gene to be tagged, followed by 20 nucleotides homologous to the pUG6-HA plasmid to amplify the epitope and the kanMX marker. After transformation of the 1.7-kb PCR product into strain 23344c and selection for resistance to G418 (200 mg/l) on YPD agar plates, the stop codon of the respective gene was usually replaced by3xHA-kanMX through homologous recombination. All of the gene modifications were verified by diagnostic PCR.

It is a derivative of pDR195 (14Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which in turn was generated from YEplac195 (15Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains a copy of the PMA1 promoter and the terminator region of the ADH1 gene. The TPO1gene was amplified via PCR using genomic DNA of strain 23344c as template and cloned between promoter and terminator using anXmaI and an XhoI site. The PCR primers forTPO1 were 5′-GCGTCCCCGGGATGTCGGATCATTCTCCCATT and 5′-GCGTCCTCGAGTTAAGCGGCGTAAGCATACTT. The underlined sequences indicate the XmaI and XhoI sites, respectively. The TPO1–3xHA fusion gene was amplified via PCR with genomic DNA from strain RK 25 as template using the same 5′ primer as for the amplification of the unmodified TPO1. The sequence of the 3′ primer was GCGTCCTCGAGTTAGGCGGCGTAGTCAGGAAC, with the XhoI site underlined. The PCR fragment was inserted into pDR199 by using theXmaI and the XhoI site between PMA1promoter and ADH1 terminator. Accuracy of the constructs was verified by sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into yeast according to Gietz et al. (16Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of triple HA-tagged proteins was determined following the protocol of Sorin et al. (17Sorin A. Rosas G. Rajini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 600 ml of YPD medium to A600 of 2–3. NaN3 (10 mm) was added prior to harvesting, and the culture was chilled on ice. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by adding lysing enzymes (Sigma) in a concentration of 1 mg/ml in S/K buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5) and incubating for 45 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were suspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (0.3 msorbitol, 20 mm triethanolamine acetate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with a commercially available protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized by 30 strokes of a Wheaton A Dounce homogenizer. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation (800 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was layered on top of a noncontinuous gradient ranging from 18 to 54% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA (10 steps of 4% difference each). The gradients were centrifuged for 2 h at 40,000 rpm (4 °C) in a Beckmann SW41 Ti rotor and fractionated manually from top to bottom (12 fractions of 1 ml each). Isolated fractions were diluted (1:5) in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and the membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C). The resulting pellets were incubated on ice (30 min) in 400 μl of Tris buffer (see above) containing 5 murea. They were again centrifuged (17,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C) and finally resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer system. For immunodetection a monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a monoclonal anti-Vph1p (kindly provided by Patricia M. Kane, Syracuse, NY), and a polyclonal anti-Pma1p (kindly provided by Bruno André, Brussels, Belgium) were used as first antibody. The respective secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Invitrogen) was used for visualization. The cells were grown overnight in synthetic complete minimal medium, harvested atA600 = 1.0, washed twice in the same volume of 20 mm Na/Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mmglucose and resuspended at A600 = 1.0 in the same buffer. Transport assays were done at 30 °C and started by adding [14C]spermine to a final concentration of 20 or 100 μm. 100-μl aliquots were filtered at defined time points through nitrocellulose filters that were preincubated in 100 mm LiCl containing 1 mm spermine. The radioactivity trapped on the filters was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The preparation of vacuolar vesicles was done following a slightly modified protocol of Ohsumi and Anraku (18Ohsumi Y Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in CBS medium buffered with 50 mmpotassium phthalate, pH 5.5, and supplemented with 10 mmputrescine and 1 mm of each spermidine and spermine to anA600 of 2–3. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-sulfate, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol to yield a concentration of 0.5 g of cell fresh weight/ml. The cells were shaken for 10 min at 30 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended to 0.15 g of cell fresh weight/ml in SOB (1.2 m sorbitol, 5 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9). The spheroplasts were generated by incubation with lysing enzymes (Sigma) (1 mg/5 × 108 cells) for 30 min at 30 °C. The spheroplasts were washed twice in SOB and resuspended in buffer A (12% Ficoll, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 100 μmMgCl2), protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and the suspension was homogenized by seven strokes of a Wheaton A Dounce homogenizer. The resulting suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube, overlaid with half the volume of buffer A, and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 1 h and 15 min. The white floating layer that appeared after centrifugation was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube, adjusted with buffer A (see above) to 6 ml, and overlaid with 6 ml of buffer B (8% Ficoll, 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 100 μmMgCl2). After further centrifugation (60,000 ×g for 1 h and 15 min), vacuolar vesicles formed a white layer on top of the solution. They were aspirated, suspended in 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.9, 100 mm KCl, 20 μm MgCl2, frozen under liquid nitrogen, and stored for further use at −80 °C. The enzyme assays were done according to Roberts et al. (19Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine transport measurements were performed according to Sato et al. (20Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and spermine import was determined after Kakinuma et al.(2Kakinuma Y. Masuda N. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cells were grown overnight in succinate-buffered CBS medium in the presence of 10 mm spermidine and harvested atA600 = 1.3–1.5 by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed three times in medium without polyamines but containing only 1 g/liter NH4SO4 and finally resuspended in the same medium. The cell suspension was incubated at 30 °C with agitation, and aliquots were taken at defined time points. To analyze spermidine efflux, the cells were immediately separated from the medium by centrifugation (11,000 × g for 3 min), and released spermidine was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography according to Price et al. (21Price N.P.J. Firmin J.L. Gray D.O. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 598: 51-57Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Extraction of total polyamines was performed according to Tomitori et al.(4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were incubated in 10% trichloroacetic acid at 65 °C for 1 h. Derivatization and quantification by high performance liquid chromatography were done as described above. In the course of an approach to identify new vacuolar transporters, we determined the subcellular localization of various putative transport proteins that have been fused C-terminally to a triple HA epitope tag. A version of Tpo1p with the same tag was generated as bona fide control, because we considered it to be an established vacuolar transporter (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of membrane preparations isolated from yeast cells carrying the respective fusion construct as the only gene copy. Defined fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Although the 3xHA-tagged version of Ycr023p co-localized with the 100-kDa subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (Vph1p), the Tpo1p-3xHA fusion co-localized with the plasma membrane ATPase (Pma1p), thus raising the question of whether tagging of Tpo1p leads to mislocalization, although the HA tag is not known to direct proteins to the plasma membrane. To get further evidence we tested the functionality of the HA fusion of Tpo1p. Disruption of TPO1 leads to increased polyamine sensitivity of the mutant cells, when grown under Mg2+-limiting conditions (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This phenotype should be rescued by expression of the HA-modified version of the transporter if this fusion is functional. We thus transformed a plasmid encoded version of TPO1–3xHA into a strain in which TPO1had been replaced by a lacZ-kanMX deletion cassette. The fused gene on the plasmid was expressed under the control of thePMA1 promoter. The resulting yeast cells were tested for spermidine sensitivity in comparison with the wild type and thetpo1::lacZ strain, each transformed with the empty vector (Fig. 2). We found that synthesis of the HA-tagged Tpo1p leads to markedly increased spermidine tolerance. Because the functionality of the HA fusion of Tpo1p could be demonstrated, we tried to get further evidence for the Tpo1 protein being located in the plasma membrane, where it should contribute to polyamine transport. Because the localization of Tpo1p in the plasma membrane was contradictory to the proposed function in vacuolar polyamine transport, we tested first whether polyamine import into cells is influenced by TPO1 deletion. An earlier report had indicated that a TPO1 deletion strain shows spermine import rates similar to wild type cells (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas a decreased import rate inTPO1 deletions was reported later (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We found, however, no difference in spermine uptake activity between thetpo1::lacZ strain and wild type using 100 μm (Fig. 3) or 20 μm spermine (not shown), suggesting that Tpo1p is not involved in polyamine import of yeast cells and/or that Tpo2p-Tpo4 may complement the knockout of Tpo1p. In view of several reports describing Tpo1p as vacuolar polyamine importer, we tried to account for an impairment in vacuolar polyamine uptake after TPO1deletion. Consequently, we prepared vacuolar vesicles from wild type cells and tpo1::lacZ mutants, respectively, grown in the presence of 10 mm putrescine, 1 mm spermidine, and 1 mm spermine. Polyamines were added to the growth medium because a stimulatory impact of externally added polyamines on TPO1 expression had been reported recently (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The polyamine concentrations employed led to a markedly increased intracellular polyamine level (about 4-fold in the case of putrescine and spermine, and about 2-fold for spermidine), which should be high enough to enhance the expression ofTPO1. We optimized the protocol for the isolation of vacuolar vesicles, which led to preparations of high purity (TableII). The ATPase activity of the vesicle preparation was completely inhibited by the addition of the V-ATPase-specific inhibitor concanamycin A (not shown), proving that significant contaminations of plasma membrane and mitochondria were virtually absent. The vesicles were used to determine the uptake of amino acids (20Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spermine (2Kakinuma Y. Masuda N. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because phenylalanine uptake measurements in particular were highly reproducible in isolated vacuolar vesicles, we used this carrier activity to normalize the spermine uptake rate and thus to eliminate possible variations caused by the vesicle preparation, a strategy that was not employed in the original report of Tomitori et al. (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who reported a slightly decreased import activity for vacuolar vesicles prepared from a TPO1 deletion strain compared with wild type. But this correction might be crucial, because we found that although the absolute values varied slightly for each preparation, the relative uptake rates measured were essentially the same for the two strains (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the maximal amount of accumulated spermine was very similar for the two vesicular preparations when normalized to the maximum of accumulated phenylalanine. We thus conclude that the TPO1 deletion had no effect on spermine import into vacuolar vesicles.Table IIPurity of vacuolar vesiclesMarker enzymeEnrichmentYield%Vacuolar markers Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B47-fold10 α-Mannosidase45-fold10Marker enzymes of contaminating fractions Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A (Golgi)11-fold2.3 Cytochromec oxidase (mitochondria)3-fold0.7 Open table in a new tab The absence of theTPO1 gene causes increased polyamine sensitivity, indicating a function for Tpo1p in the detoxification of polyamines (Fig. 2 and Ref. 3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Detoxification in general can be mediated either by transport into the vacuole or out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The results presented so far favor the latter possibility. Thus, we analyzed the putative polyamine efflux mediated by Tpo1p. Because little is known about polyamine export in budding yeast, we investigated first whether polyamines might be released into the medium during growth, as has been reported for other microorganisms (22Schiller D. Kruse D. Kneifel H. Kramer R. Burkovski A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6247-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Davis R.H. Ristow J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Wild type and tpo1::lacZ cells were grown from A600 = 0.5 to stationary phase in succinate-buffered CBS medium. Putrescine and spermidine excreted into the medium were quantified. Spermine could not be determined as a contaminant in the synthetic growth medium and interfered with the quantitative HPLC analysis. We found that wild type and mutant cells in fact excrete putrescine but not spermidine until they reach the diauxic shift (Fig. 5) after ∼24 h. The putrescine release of the two strains was indistinguishable, suggesting that Tpo1p is not involved in this process. Although spermidine is the most abundant polyamine in yeast cells (Ref. 9Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; see also Fig.6B), we did not observe release of this solute under normal growth conditions. To challenge yeast cells for spermidine export, we increased the intracellular spermidine content by growing cells in the presence of this compound. The cells were cultured in the presence of 10 mm spermidine in succinate-buffered CBS medium under nonlimiting Mg2+-conditions, where both wild type and mutants are more tolerant to polyamine stress, and the spermidine concentrations applied are thus not toxic for both strains. During the incubation the total intracellular spermidine content of yeast cells in the logarithmic growth phase increased significantly from about 8 to 25 nmol/mg cell dry mass (Fig. 6B). After washing and resuspending in polyamine-free medium, the accumulated spermidine was released. We found a significant difference between wild type and tpo1deletion mutant under these conditions. Spermidine efflux of thetpo1::lacZ cells was significantly decreased as compared with the wild type (Fig. 6A). The observed difference in efflux rates was not due to a different preloading of cells with spermidine, as can be seen in Fig. 6B. To provide a solid basis for the observed difference in polyamine excretion, the initial efflux rates of 15 independent cultures of wild type and mutant cells, respectively, were determined. It could be shown that the spermidine efflux rate of the TPO1 deletion strain drops to 49 ± 28% of wild type rates (Fig. 6C). These experiments indicate a function of Tpo1p in spermidine detoxification. Preloading yeast cells with putrescine unfortunately led to widely varying results; however, in a series of experiments we did not observe a statistically significant difference between the wild type and theTPO1 deletion strain in terms of putrescine efflux activity (not shown). If the observed impairment of spermidine efflux was indeed a consequence of the TPO1 deletion, the introduction of plasmid-borne Tpo1p should lead to an increase of the spermidine export rate. Therefore, we constructed a plasmid expressing TPO1 under control of thePMA1 promoter and transformed this construct into thetpo1::lacZ strain. Expression of the plasmid encoded gene was controlled by analyzing polyamine sensitivity of the resulting yeast, which was in fact highly decreased (not shown). The initial spermidine export rates of this strain were determined and gave values in the same range as observed for the wild type (Fig.6C). When the tpo1::lacZstrain was transformed with the empty vector, the export rates were in the same range as observed for the TPO1 deletion without any plasmid (not shown). The initially accumulated spermidine concentration was unchanged in both experiments. Because TPO1 was found to complement the described phenotype, we consider Tpo1p to be a plasma membrane-bound exporter involved in spermidine export. The fact that Tpo1p was localized in the plasma membrane raises the question on the location of the other described polyamine transporters in S. cerevisiae, i.e. whether Tpo2p, Tpo3p, and Tpo4p are located in the plasma membrane as well (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore generated three strains bearing 3xHA-tagged versions of TPO2, TPO3, and TPO4, respectively, as the only gene copy. Using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, we fractionated membrane preparations of these strains and found that all of the TPO gene products localize in the same fraction, which was identified as plasma membrane fraction before (Fig. 7; compare Fig. 1). An involvement of the three yeast polyamine transporters in transport of these solutes across the plasma membrane seems to be likely and will be analyzed in the future. The expression and subsequent detection of epitope-tagged proteins has turned out to be a powerful method in unraveling the subcellular localization of proteins. By applying this approach we found that a triple HA-tagged version of Ycr023p co-localized with the vacuolar ATPase, using sucrose gradient centrifugation as the analytical method. Ycr023p is a member of the multidrug resistance family and most probably functions in the detoxification of hazardous compounds into the vacuolar lumen. It has been shown that its deletion confers resistance to allylglycine (25Bianchi M.M. Sartori G. Vandenbol M. Kaniak A. Ucceletti D. Mazzoni C. Di Rago J.-P. Carignani G. Slonimski P.R. Frontali L. Yeast. 1999; 15: 513-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, triple HA-tagged versions of all four polyamine transporters, Tpo1p-4p, that have been described in S. cerevisiae so far co-localized with the plasma membrane ATPase. Despite the fact that tags in general might cause mislocalization of proteins, we decided to carefully re-evaluate whether these transporters were in fact plasma membrane bound and thus not involved in vacuolar transport of polyamines as had been described before (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Direct localization studies of these proteins had not been performed so far; their intracellular localization had been deduced indirectly from physiological experiments with Tpo1p being the best studied protein of this group (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We provide experimental evidence for a role of Tpo1p in transport across the plasma membrane, which is based on the observations that the HA-tagged protein is functional and that aTPO1 knockout is not impaired in uptake of polyamines into vacuolar vesicles. The observation of Tomitori et al. (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that vesicles prepared from TPO1-overexpressing strains show an increased spermine import activity is most probably due to mislocalization of the overproduced protein. In this study we could show that a strain deleted in TPO1 shows a significant defect in spermidine secretion under conditions in which the cells are challenged by incubation in medium containing high levels of polyamines. We thus conclude that Tpo1p is a plasma membrane-embedded carrier protein. The arguments that Tpo2p, Tpo3p, and Tpo4p have the same subcellular location are so far exclusively based on results of sucrose gradient fractionation and need further experimental proof. Export of polyamines, especially of putrescine as the key metabolite in polyamine biosynthesis, had been described for some prokaryotic (22Schiller D. Kruse D. Kneifel H. Kramer R. Burkovski A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6247-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic organisms (23Davis R.H. Ristow J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as well as for cultured mammalian cells (26Tjandrawinata R.R. Hawel III, L. Byus C.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3039-3052PubMed Google Scholar). The biological significance of this process is most probably related to the fact that although polyamines are pivotal for many physiological processes, they are toxic when present in high levels, so that cells had to develop mechanisms for controlling the intracellular pools (27Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of biosynthesis is certainly a possibility to control nontoxic levels (28Coffino P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), excretion provides an additional rationale. Taking into account that re-uptake is guaranteed by the presence of importer systems, a possible loss of precursors can be avoided. Putrescine export had not been studied in detail inS. cerevisiae before. When trying to establish a function of Tpo1p in polyamine export, we therefore asked whether yeast had developed mechanisms for putrescine homoeostasis similar to other microorganisms and whether Tpo1p might be involved in that process. Although we were able to detect significant putrescine export which, interestingly, was restricted to the fermentative growth phase, Tpo1p is obviously not involved in this process to a significant extent, because wild type and the TPO1 disruption strain had equal export activity. We cannot rule out, however, that redundant transporters may adjust their putrescine export activities in the deletion strain to compensate for the missing TPO1function. When cells are stressed under conditions of growth in the presence of high levels of polyamines, a detoxification mechanism has to exist to overcome toxic intracellular levels that may arise because of the presence of polyamine importers. This could in principle be achieved by regulating the uptake activity and/or the activity of exporters for these solutes. We therefore preloaded yeast cells with polyamines and followed the efflux after transfer of cells into polyamine-free medium. Tpo1p was shown not to contribute significantly to putrescine tolerance (3Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); thus we concentrated on the analysis of spermidine export, which was in fact affected by TPO1 deletion. The decrease in excretion activity was significant and could be reverted by introducing a plasmid-encoded copy of TPO1, proving that the phenotype observed was a direct consequence of the missing TPO1 gene. The rescued strain showed spermidine export rates comparable with the wild type (Fig. 6C), which was also the reason for the polyamine tolerance that we found when testing the functionality of theTPO1–3xHA construct (Fig. 2). In the latter experiment we even observed an increased tolerance of thetpo1::lacZ strain containingTPO1–3xHA on a plasmid, compared with wild type, which was most probably due to the experimental conditions applied. Spermidine tolerance was assayed under magnesium limitation, a condition that leads to enhanced polyamine uptake (9Maruyama T. Masuda N. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), thus generating higher intracellular levels than the 4-fold increase we observed when challenging the cells for export measurements. Furthermore, it has been shown that polyamine stress in combination with Mg2+limitation leads to increased TPO1 mRNA abundance, even in aTPO1-overexpressing strain (4Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Asakawa T. Kakinuma Y. Michael A.J. Igarashi K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This might explain the overcompensation of spermidine sensitivity observed with the plate assay in contrast to our observation in the spermidine export measurements, which were performed under Mg2+ excess. Unfortunately, we were not able to provide appropriate growth medium completely devoid of a contaminant, which interfered with spermine analysis by HPLC. The contribution of Tpo1p in spermine export thus remains an unsettled question. The data presented so far favor a function of Tpo1p in detoxification of high intracellular polyamine levels. This observation is interesting in the context of other recent publications on the properties of Tpo1p. This transporter has been reported to confer resistance to a variety of structurally nonrelated toxic compounds like quinidine and cycloheximide (24do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), mycophenolic acid (29Desmoucelles C. Pinson B. Saint-Marc C. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol.

Furthermore, TPO1 was recently shown to be a target for the regulators Pdr1p (24do Valle Matta M.A. Jonniaux J.L. Balzi E. Goffeau A. van den Hazel B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Pdr3p (30Teixeira M.C. Sa-Correia I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), both of which mediate multidrug resistance. This further emphasizes the concept that the primary function of Tpo1p in S. cerevisiae is the detoxification of hazardous compounds, which includes excess spermidine.

Superimposition of the substrate complex of a related protein, dihydrolipoyl trans-acetylase, reveals that both substrates localize to the active site tunnel of human carnitine acetyltransferase, suggesting the location of the ligand binding sites for carnitine and coenzyme A. Most significantly, this structure provides critical insights into the molecular basis for fatty acyl chain transfer and a possible common mechanism among a wide range of acyltransferases utilizing a catalytic dyad. acyl coenzyme A human peroxisomal carnitineO-acetyltransferase carnitine palmitoyltransferase mitochondrial liver isoform of CPT I mitochondrial muscle isoform of CPT I root mean square peroxisomal carnitine O-octanoyltransferase helix strand multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion ornithine decarboxylase In eukaryotic cells, the carnitine system plays a vital role in fatty acid β-oxidation and maintenance of acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA)1 pools (1Ramsay R.R.

The important physiological functions of carnitine are made possible by the presence of carnitine/acylcarnitine transporters on cellular membranes and a group of enzymes, the carnitine acyltransferases, which catalyze the reversible transfer of acyl groups between CoA and carnitine (1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Ramsay R.R. Arduini A. Arch. Biochem.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 4Ramsay R.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Corti O. Finocchiaro G. Rossi E. Zuffardi O. DiDonato S. Genomics. 1994; 23: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Carnitine acetyltransferase has a substrate preference for short chain acyl-CoAs and is found in the mitochondrial matrix, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the peroxisome. Carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) is predominantly localized in peroxisomes with a substrate preference for medium length acyl-CoAs. Carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT) are found both in the outer mitochondrial membrane (CPT I) and the mitochondrial matrix (CPT II) with a substrate preference for long chain acyl-CoAs.Arguably, the most critical member is CPT I, which is responsible for facilitating the transfer of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. There are two different types of CPT I in mammalian tissues (1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a liver (L-CPT I) and a muscle isoform (M-CPT I). Both isoforms of CPT I are inhibited by malonyl-CoA, which is the committed intermediate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. However, each isoform displays a different sensitivity to this metabolite. Malonyl-CoA inhibition regulates and balances β-oxidation and the biosynthesis of fatty acids, depending on the metabolic needs of the cell. Interestingly, CPT I has an extended N terminus, which contains two trans-membrane domains, that is not found in the other carnitine acyltransferases and appears to be important not only in anchoring the enzyme in the outer mitochondrial membrane but also in modulating sensitivity of the CPT I isoforms to malonyl-CoA (1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The important metabolic roles of CPT I make it a potential drug target for diabetes, coronary heart disease, and other disorders involving abnormal fatty acid metabolism (6Finocchiaro G. Taroni F.

Here we report the x-ray crystal structure of human peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferase (hpCAT), which represents the first structure for the carnitine acyltransferase family (TableI). To gain more insight into the function of hpCAT, we have also modeled the binding sites of carnitine and CoA using the superimposition of the ternary substrate complex of a structurally and functionally related protein, dihydrolipoyl trans-acetylase (E2p). The results from this work correlate well with previous experimental data and provide further information regarding the catalytic mechanism of hpCAT and ligand binding sites.Table ICrystallographic data, phasing, and refinement statistics of human peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferaseData setWavelengthReflections (unique)CompletenessRsym(%)1-aRsym = ΣhldΣi‖Ii(hkl) −i(hkl)‖/ΣhklΣiIt(hkl), where i(hkl) is the average intensity over symmetry equivalent reflections.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSThe overall structure of hpCAT reveals a monomeric protein with dimensions of ∼75 × 45 × 45 Å (Fig.1). The tertiary structure consists of 17 helices (H1–H17) and 14 strands (S1–S14), which are arranged into two equally sized α/β domains, I (residues 87–385) and II (residues 9–86 and 386–599) (Fig. 2). The domains are tightly associated with each other by interconnecting loops and helices that form a central tunnel of ∼10-Å diameter that transverses through the molecule. This tunnel defines a solvent-accessible surface in the center of the protein, which constitutes the putative active site for the enzyme. Seventy-six amino acids accounting for 3400 Å2 (15% of the total surface area) are buried at the interface between domains I and II (Fig.1).The hpCAT structure is composed of 39% helix (H1–H17), 13% β-strand (S1–S14), and 48% loops and turns. The most noticeable common feature in domains I and II is an “open-faced” core five-stranded-mixed β-sheet consisting of three centrally located parallel β-strands flanked on either side by an anti-parallel β-strand that adopt characteristic left-handed twists. In domain I, this motif is defined by strands S5, S4, S6, S7, and S8, and in domain II, this motif is defined by strands S14, S13, S11, S9, and S10. The β-sheet of domain I has a sixth strand, S1, that runs anti-parallel to strand S8. Domain II provides an additional seventh strand, S12 (looped out between strands S11 and S13 of its five-stranded β-sheet), to the domain I β-sheet that is adjacent and anti-parallel to strand S1. Therefore, strands S1 and S12 create an interface between the two domains (Fig. 2).The N-terminal region of domain II is comprised of four α-helices (H1–H4). Helices H1 and H2 form an anti-parallel bundle that leads to an extended structure made up of helices H3 and H4 that cross over to domain I and contribute part of the floor and front surface of the active site tunnel. Domain I is defined from residues 87 to 385. Residues 306–320 constitute an anti-parallel pair of strands (S7 and S8) linked by a type II turn, which forms the rostra lining on the left side of the active site. An active site histidine (residue 322) is located on a turn at the end of strand S8 and is positioned in the center of the active site tunnel. This turn (residues 321–326) leads to helix H10 that lines the active site tunnel, which is followed by a loop (located behind the β-sheet in domain I) that forms the upper lip of an extended surface groove. Helix H11 is next lying on the front portion of the β-sheet of domain I. A final extended loop after H11 crosses into domain II. This loop leads into helix H12 that runs parallel with the β-sheet motif of domain II. β-Strands S11–S14 form an intricate hydrogen-bonding network with each other to facilitate the “flipping out” of strand S12 to align it with strand S1 in domain I. Four helices, H13-H16, between strands S10 and S11 create a supporting scaffold that positions the domain II β-sheet open face toward the active site and constitutes the top and right lining of the tunnel. Domain II terminates with helix H17 that also supports the β-sheet (Figs. 1 and 2).The structural arrangement of hpCAT appears to be unique for an acyltransferase, although similar structural elements to portions of domains I and II have been observed in some oligomeric enzymes that catalyze similar group-transfer reactions (Fig.3). The secondary structural elements, helices H5, H6, and H10 and strands S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8 of domain I, share structural similarity to the catalytic domain of dihydrolipoyl trans-acetylase (E2p) (116 Cα atoms structurally align with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.0 Å) (Protein Data Bank code 1EAB) (for review see Ref. 24Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Science. 1992; 255: 1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In domain II, helices H12, H13, and H17 and strands S11, S13, and S14 are structurally similar to portions of ornithine decarboxylase (ORD) (55 Cα atoms structurally align with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.1 Å) (Protein Data Bank code 1ORD) (for review see Ref. 25Momany C. Ernst S. Ghosh R. Chang N.L. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In addition to structural features, E2p also displays functional similarity to hpCAT. E2p is a component of the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and is responsible for the transfer of acetyl groups between lipoamide and CoA. The catalytically active form of E2p is a trimer with the active site located in the subunit interface. This interaction forms an active site channel for CoA and acetyl lipoamide to bind and is the location of His610, which serves as a general base for catalysis in E2p (24Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Science. 1992; 255: 1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A number of studies have also suggested that the carnitine acyltransferases utilize a histidine as a general base for catalysis (1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Based on their structural and functional similarity, the ternary complex of E2p with both substrates (lipoamide and CoA) was superimposed onto domain I of the hpCAT structure (see “Experimental Procedures”). The overlay of these two structures results in the direct superimposition of the catalytic residue His610 of E2p (23Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) onto His322 of hpCAT, which is completely conserved (Fig.4) and has been previously identified as essential for enzymatic activity in other carnitine acyltransferases (1Ramsay R.R.

In hpCAT, this histidine residue is located on a turn at the end of strand S8 and is positioned in the center of the active site tunnel (Fig. 6).Figure 4Sequence alignment of all human carnitine acyltransferases.

Additionally, the superimposition of the ternary complex of E2p places lipoamide and CoA into the active site tunnel of hpCAT. The putative location of the separate binding sites for carnitine (Fig. 7A) and acetyl-CoA (Fig.7B) were then identified by modeling their positions based on the locations of lipoamide and CoA using the superimposition of the E2p complex onto hpCAT. The orientation of the binding pockets allows each substrate to approach the active site tunnel from opposite sides independently, which is consistent with the rapid equilibrium random order kinetics proposed for this enzyme (30Chase J.F. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Figure 7The active site of human peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferase and putative binding sites of carnitine (A) and CoA (B).

There is a 21–31% identity at the amino acid level among the different human carnitine acyltransferases (1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). COT shares the highest homology with hpCAT followed by CPT II and CPT I. Of note are two consensus sequences that have been defined for these acyltransferases (23Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). These are Prosite PS00439 (residues 14–28 in hpCAT) and PS00440 (residues 299–327 in hpCAT), which form characteristic supersecondary structural motifs of an extended proline rich region in helix H1 of domain II and strands S7 and S8 of domain I, respectively (Fig.5). Previously, PS00439 was believed to be important for carnitine binding (6Finocchiaro G. Taroni F. Rocchi M. Martin A.L. Colombo I. Tarelli G.T. DiDonato S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); however, our structure shows that this is not the case and instead plays a structural role. On the other hand, PS00440 is located in the center of the catalytic tunnel and contains the active site histidine. The regions of highest homology are clustered in domain II, implying potential locations of common structural and/or functional significance such as the binding sites for shared substrates. On the contrary, domain I is more divergent and may contain structural differences for recognition of variable length acyl-CoAs and the physiological regulator malonyl-CoA.Figure 5Functional residues of carnitine acyltransferases. Coil diagram highlights the locations of the two consensus sequences for the carnitine acyltransferases gene family. Prosites PS00439 (residues 14–28, yellow) and PS00440 (residues 299–327, red) are represented by colored coils. Residues known to be associated with carnitine binding and CoA binding are indicated by solid colored circles in blueand orange. Residues essential for the activity of the acyltransferases are shown in green (as in Fig. 3). His322 is shown in the center of the catalytic tunnel active site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Active Site Tunnel and Catalytic HistidineThe side chain of His322 of hpCAT adopts an unusual conformation (χ1 = −140°; χ2 = −39°) to form an intraresidue hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) between the imidazole nitrogen N1 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen. In E2p as well as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which also catalyzes an acyl group transfer, a similar conformation of the active site histidine has been observed and may represent a conserved structural feature that facilitates catalysis (23Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 26Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C.E. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This unusual angle most probably allows positioning of the imidazole N3 to align with carnitine, enabling the extraction of a proton from its primary alcohol. This is consistent with the finding that the reaction of carnitine acetyltransferase with bromoacetylcarnitine only produces labeled N3 carboxymethyl histidine (27Chase J.F. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1970; 116: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, the histidine at this position is highly conserved among this enzyme family, and the removal of the corresponding homologous residues, His473, His372, and His327 in rat CPT I, CPT II, and COT, respectively (Fig.4), has been shown to inactivate these enzymes completely (28Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When His322 was changed to an alanine, a serine, or a glutamine, the mutant forms of hpCAT were completely inactive, supporting its catalytic role. 2Y. Gu, T. Kukar, and D. Wu, unpublished observations. Catalytic DyadThe modeling of carnitine into the active site reveals a number of residues that may be involved in binding and catalysis. Most importantly, the N3 nitrogen of the catalytic His322 is positioned such that it can form a hydrogen bond and abstract a proton from the β-hydroxyl of carnitine. In addition, a functionally conserved glutamate, Glu326, interacts with His322 and appears to be critical for catalysis (Fig.7A). Carbonyl oxygen 1 (O1) of Glu326 is positioned 4.03 Å from the N3 nitrogen of His322, whereas O2 forms a salt bridge with Arg443 (2.78 Å). This interaction probably further potentiates the activity of His322 and also stabilizes the positive charge that would develop after substrate deprotonation. In almost all of the other members of the family, an aspartate is found at this position, which could functionally substitute for glutamate. In rat CPT II, substituting Asp376, which is homologous to Glu326 in hpCAT, to an alanine produced a completely inactive protein, illustrating the important role of this negative charge in catalysis (28Brown N.F. Anderson R.C. Caplan S.L. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19157-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar interactions have been observed in other enzyme active sites that utilize a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad including a variety of proteases and lipases as well as acetylcholine esterase (31Polgar L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Thus, hpCAT as well as the other carnitine acyltransferases appear to utilize a His-Glu/Asp catalytic dyad to carry out catalysis.Proposed Binding Sites for Carnitine and CoASeveral conserved residues in carnitine acyltransferases, in particular, Tyr431 and Thr444 of hpCAT, lie within hydrogen-bonding distance of the O1 and O2 of carnitine and appear to interact directly with the carnitine carboxylate group (Fig.7A). Previously, it has been speculated that a positively charged amino acid forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of carnitine in the active site. In bovine COT, the mutation of a conserved arginine to asparagine decreased the binding of carnitine with a greater than 1650-fold increase in the apparentKm(carnitine) (33Cronin C.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In hpCAT, the equivalent residue, Arg497, may fulfill this role by forming an electrostatic interaction with carnitine because it is ∼5 Å away. Other naturally occurring and site-directed mutations have been shown to affect carnitine binding (Figs. 4 and 5) (for review see Ref. 1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).The modeled binding site of CoA (Figs. 6and 7B) reveals that the adenine ring binds to the outer portion of the catalytic tunnel with the pantothenic arm extending into the active site. The reactive sulfur group is positioned for catalysis close to both His322 and the β-hydroxyl of carnitine. Some highly conserved residues cluster around this site and may be involved in CoA binding. The positive charge of Lys398 probably interacts with a negatively charged phosphate group, whereas Leu142 may bind CoA through hydrophobic interactions with the methyl groups of the pantothenic arm. Ser407 and Asp487 are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the modeled position of CoA and thus may contribute to CoA binding. Additional residues that have been shown to be associated with CoA binding and enzymatic activity in hpCAT and other members of the carnitine acyltransferases cluster in the vicinity of the active site as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 (for review see Ref.1Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. Van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Transition State StabilizationThe structure of hpCAT also allows the identification of another critical class of active site residues, those that contribute to the stabilization of the putative transition state intermediate. In chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which appears to utilize a similar mechanism as hpCAT for acyl transfer, a serine and a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to a threonine stabilize the transition state (34Shaw W.V. Leslie A.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1991; 20: 363-386Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a Ser-Thr-Ser motif, which corresponds to Ser531, Thr532, and Ser533 in hpCAT, is completely conserved in this family (Fig. 4). Substitution of the first serine and threonine to an alanine in bovine COT increased the Km toward carnitine by factors of 15 and 80 without significantly changingkcat (35Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The replacement of the last serine did not affect the Km for carnitine but reducedkcat by a factor of 10. This finding suggests that the first serine and threonine are involved in carnitine binding, whereas the last serine contributes to transition state stabilization. In the structure of hpCAT, all three of these residues are in the active site close to the modeled position of carnitine. Ser531 approaches the quaternary amine group and Thr532 is near the carboxylate moiety. When a putative transition state analog of carnitine and CoA is modeled into the active site, Ser533 is in the proper orientation to interact with the oxyanion of this intermediate, supporting the role of Ser533 in transition state stabilization, although other residues may also be involved.Comparison to Other Carnitine AcyltransferasesDetermination of the structure of hpCAT also provides a more realistic model for the study of other members of the acyltransferase family.

https://openalex.org/W1971350641,"The chaperone activity of native α-crystallins toward βLOW- and various γ-crystallins at the onset of their denaturation, 60 and 66 °C, respectively, was studied at high and low crystallin concentrations using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and fluorescence energy transfer (FRET). The crystallins were from calf lenses except for one recombinant human γS. SAXS data demonstrated an irreversible doubling in molecular weight and a corresponding increase in size of α-crystallins at temperatures above 60 °C. Further increase is observed at 66 °C. More subtle conformational changes accompanied the increase in size as shown by changes in environments around tryptophan and cysteine residues. These α-crystallin temperature-induced modifications were found necessary to allow for the association with βLOW- and γ-crystallins to occur. FRET experiments using IAEDANS (iodoacetylaminoethylaminonaphthalene sulfonic acid)- and IAF (iodoacetamidofluorescein)-labeled subunits showed that the heat-modified α-crystallins retained their ability to exchange subunits and that, at 37 °C, the rate of exchange was increased depending upon the temperature of incubation, 60 or 66 °C. Association with βLOW- (60 °C) or various γ-crystallins (66 °C) resulted at 37 °C in decreased subunit exchange in proportion to bound ligands. Therefore, βLOW- and γ-crystallins were compared for their capacity to associate with α-crystallins and inhibit subunit exchange. Quite unexpectedly for a highly conserved protein family, differences were observed between the individual γ-crystallin family members. The strongest effect was observed for γS, followed by hγSrec, γE, γA-F, γD, γB. Moreover, fluorescence properties of α-crystallins in the presence of bound βLOW-and γ-crystallins indicated that the formation of βLOW/α- or γ/α-crystallin complexes involved various binding sites. The changes in subunit exchange associated with the chaperone properties of α-crystallins toward the other lens crystallins demonstrate the dynamic character of the heat-activated α-crystallin structure.

The small heat shock proteins usually associate into high molecular weight monodisperse or polydisperse oligomers, able to protect against stress through the binding of a variety of partially unfolded substrates. α-Crystallin was demonstrated by Horwitz in 1992 (3Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar) to also exhibit chaperone properties in vitro. It is able to bind β- and γ-crystallins at the onset of their thermal denaturation, thus preventing further denaturation and aggregation, yet not refolding. Following this pioneering work, the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin has been the subject of numerous studies and functional models have been suggested (4Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol.

Essentially, hydrophobic patches on the surface, either present in the native state or revealed after structural modifications, would associate with a variety of partially denatured substrates from insulin or α-lactalbumin to the other lens proteins, in a substrate-dependent manner. Moreover, the dynamic character of the α-crystallin quaternary structure with the occurrence of temperature dependent subunit exchange was demonstrated and analyzed (31Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J.

Yet, only a few chaperone studies with β- and γ-crystallins as substrates have been performed (4Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol.

It is therefore the aim of this paper to further investigate these points. This study was performed with native calf crystallins and one human recombinant γS (hγSrec). Some of our preliminary experiments and recently published data (42Burgio M.R. Kim C.J. Dow C.C. Koretz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar, 44Abgar S. Vanhoudt J. Aerts T.

Therefore, the temperature-induced structural changes in α-crystallin were analyzed in relation to its subunit exchange properties. Possible differences in α-crystallin behavior toward different lens proteins as substrates were evaluated by FRET using IAEDANS- and IAF-labeled subunits. The rates of α-crystallin subunit exchange were compared depending on bound βγ-crystallins. 5-(Iodoacetamido)fluorescein (5-IAF), 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS), tris-(2-cyanoethyl)phosphine, and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, hydrochloride were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of analytical grade from Sigma. The α-, β-, and γ-crystallins were prepared from young calf lenses as described before (45Vérétout F. Delaye M. Tardieu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 46Vérétout F. Tardieu A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1989; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortex was separated from the nucleus by a gentle stirring of the lens in 150 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (22 mm Na2HPO4, 28 mm KH2PO4, 200 mm KCl, 1.3 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaN3, 3 mm dithiothreitol) for 15–30 min at 6 °C. The α-, βLOW-, and cortical γ- (γC) crystallins were prepared from the clear supernatant fraction of the cortical extracts by gel filtration, using a Amersham Biosciences FPLC system and a Superdex S-200 PG column. The nuclear γ-crystallins (γN) were purified in the same way from the nuclear extracts. The individual γ-crystallins were further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR 10/10 column. Crystallin concentrations were calculated using molar extinction coefficient of 0.85 cm2mg−1 for α-crystallin, 2.3 cm2mg−1 for βLOW-, 1.85 cm2mg−1 for γS-, 2.05 cm2 mg−1 for γE-, 2.1 cm2 mg−1 for γd-, 2.02 cm2 mg−1 for γB-, and 2.0 cm2 mg−1 for γA-F-crystallin (that elute together). The recombinant human γS (hγSrec) was prepared as described previously (47Skouri-Panet F. Bonnete F. Prat K. Bateman O.A. Lubsen N.H. Tardieu A. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 89: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In short, the coding sequence was amplified from a human lens cDNA library and cloned NdeI/BamHI in the pET3a vector. The expression construct was introduced into the BL21(DE3) pLysS bacterial strain, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The protein was extracted from cells using standard procedure and purified by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S200 HR column. The purity of the recombinant protein was checked by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 360 nm as a function of time. Measurements were made every minute during half an hour with a UV/VIS LambdaBio spectrophotometer. The concentration of α-crystallin remained at 20 mg/ml and βγ-crystallins were added at different w/w ratios. The temperature inside the cuvette was thermostated with a Ministat water bath and was verified prior to data collection using a Checktemp 1 microthermocouple thermometer. The soluble fractions were examined by gel filtration through a Sephacryl S200 HR column, using a Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. Samples were prepared by mixing proteins v/v with the buffer A (125 mmTris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiling (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE fractionation was performed on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillarity in the buffer B (10 mmTris pH8.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mg/l dithiothreitol) and immunoreactions were carried out as described in the immunoblotting kit manual (Anti-rabbit IgG, Alkaline Phosphatase; Calbiochem) with anti-γ-crystallin polyclonal antibodies at dilution 1:500. The intensity scattered by one particle as a function of the scattering vector s(where s = 2sinθ/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle), usually called the particle form factor, is the Fourier transform of the spherically averaged autocorrelation function of the electron density contrast associated with the particle. When the solution is ideal, i.e. in the absence of interactions, the total scattered intensity, I(s), is the sum of the scattering of the individual particles, and the scattering near the origin can be written (49Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar): I(s) = exp[−4/3π2Rg2s2]; therefore, “Guinier plots,” i.e. plots of logI(s) versus s2, provide us with the extrapolated intensity at the origin,I(0), which is proportional to the molecular weight and with the radius of gyration, Rg, which is a function of the particle size. The experiments were carried out using the small angle instrument D24 using the synchrotron radiation emitted by the storage ring DCI at the Laboratory for Synchrotron Radiation, L.U.R.E. (Orsay, France). Data were collected using a linear position-sensitive detector with a delay line readout. Thes-increment per channel was 0.000146 Å−1, and the average recorded s range was 0.2 × 10−2 < s < 4 × 10−2Å−1. The wavelength of the x-rays was 1.488 Å (K-edge of nickel). The solution experiments were performed with a specially designed quartz cell operated under vacuum (50Dubuisson J.M. Descamps T. Vachette P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 49-54Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that could be filled and rinsed in situ. The intensity curves,I(c,s), were subtracted for background and, within each series, scaled on the same relative value with a normalization for concentration. No scaling was done between series. The labeling reaction was carried out at a final protein concentration of about 1 mg/ml in 150 mm phosphate buffer, 10 mmEDTA, pH 6.8, following the same protocol for both probes. Prior to labeling, a 10-fold molar excess of each reducing agents tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine were added to assure the reduction of disulfide bonds. Each probe was solubilized in methanol, and a small aliquot was added for a final ratio of 20 mol of probe/mol of protein. The reaction then proceeded for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The labeling was terminated by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of mercaptoethanol. A vacuum concentrator unit with 100,000 and 10,000 cut-off membranes were used to remove any unconjugated probe until no fluorescence could be detected in the eluate for α- and γ-crystallin, respectively. The molar ratio of attached probe was calculated from the absorbance spectrum of the labeled protein and that of a free probe. Typically, all Cys residues in α-crystallin could be labeled with either probe. For γ-crystallin two residues per molecule could be modified with IAEDANS. Fluorescence measurements were made with SPF-25 spectrofluorometer using quartz cuvettes with a 10-mm path length. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5-nm bandwidth. Data were corrected for the contribution of solvents. For temperature dependence studies, the cells were thermostated with a Ministat water bath. The temperature was verified within each cuvette prior to data collection using a Checktemp 1 microthermocouple thermometer. All samples were in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, unless specified. Microcuvettes with stopper were used for incubation at high temperatures to avoid evaporation. Experiments on subunit exchange of α-crystallin were based on the protocol of Bova et al.(31Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Two populations of α-crystallin labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS (donor) or 5-IAF (acceptor) were heated at 60 or 66 °C for 30 min, either alone or in the presence of other crystallins, and all samples were returned to room temperature afterward. The rate of subunit exchange was evaluated from energy transfer data. Donor and acceptor labeled α-crystallins were mixed at 37 °C, and the degree of energy transfer was estimated over time by following the decrease in the intensity of the donor emission. Wavelengths of excitation and emission were 335 and 460 nm. The rate was calculated from the equationF(t)/F(0) = A +Be−kt, where k is defined as the transfer rate constant, andF(t)/F(0) corresponds to the emission intensity ratio at time = t and 0, respectively (34Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The efficiency of energy transfer (E) at different time points was calculated from the relationship to the intensity of the donor fluorescence in the absence (Fa) and presence (Fd) of the acceptor: E= 1 − (Fd/Fa). Two populations of α-crystallins were labeled covalently at the cysteine residues with either IAEDANS or IAF. IAEDANS and IAF are fluorescent probes that have been well characterized over the past years (51Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar, 52Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). They are of relatively small size and are not known to induce conformational changes upon binding to proteins. Molar extinction coefficients of 5700 (IAEDANS), 75,000 (IAF), and 0.8 (α-crystallin, 1 mg/ml) were used to estimate the molar ratio of the covalently attached probe. Calf α-crystallin oligomers consist of αA (2/3) and αB subunits (1/3). αB has no cysteine residues but all cysteine residues at a single site at Cys-131 (beginning of strand β8 according to (1Kim R. Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9129-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) on αA subunit could be labeled. The integrity of labeled α-crystallin in our experiments was confirmed by unchanged tryptophan fluorescence and accessibility to acrylamide (results not shown). Labeling of γS (molar extinction coefficient, 1.85) with IAEDANS resulted in the addition of two fluorophore molecules per one γS, i.e. some of the five Cys residues could be modified. IAEDANS are preferentially reactive with cysteine residues in hydrophobic environment, and the labeling is in agreement with common structural features of γ-crystallin. The method that we have been using for a long time to purify α-crystallin from cortical extracts of calf lenses reproducibly provided us with oligomers that we characterized by SAXS to be made up of about 40–45 subunits, with a radius of gyration of about 62 Å and an external diameter of 170Å (45Vérétout F. Delaye M. Tardieu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 53Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These values are in agreement with the molecular weight values usually reported in the literature and with recent electron microscopy (EM) observations (43Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, α-crystallin quaternary structure is known for a long time to be sensitive to environmental conditions (53Tardieu A. Laporte D. Licinio P. Krop B. Delaye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, our preliminary investigations and recently published studies (42Burgio M.R. Kim C.J. Dow C.C. Koretz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that, at the high temperatures required for the chaperone effect of α-crystallin toward other lens proteins to take place (60 °C for the β- and 66 °C for the γ-crystallin), the α-crystallin quaternary structure undergoes a major, irreversible, conformational change. We therefore used SAXS to further investigate the point. Purified fractions of α-crystallin were incubated at 60 or 66 °C for various periods of time, and at different protein concentrations, from 5 to 20 mg/ml. The samples were then cooled either to room temperature or to 4 °C, controlled by gel filtration, and analyzed by SAXS. Typical results are shown in Fig.1. The gel filtration profile in Fig.1a obtained after 1 h of incubation at 60 °C indicates that all the native α-crystallins have been transformed into higher molecular weight particles, since they elute in the void volume. SAXS experiments performed at 60 °C (Fig. 1b) provided us with quantitative values. The conformational change is achieved within about 10 min, and no reversibility whatsoever is observed upon return to room temperature (not shown). The 60 °C molecular weight is about twice the native one. The shape of the scattering curve also indicates that the α-crystallin size has increased. The increase in both size and molecular weight is even more pronounced after incubation at 66 °C (Fig. 1b). The radii of gyration of native and of 60 and 66 °C incubated samples were, respectively, 61.4, 82.3, and 98 Å. These observations are in agreement with the EM data that show much bigger particles after incubation at high temperatures (43Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar). The shape of the SAXS intensity curves at low angles, however, is not consistent with the presence in our experimental conditions of chain-like structures, as seen by EM (43Burgio M.R. Bennett P.M. Koretz J.F. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 228-233PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments performed with different incubation times (not shown) indicate that the high temperature quaternary structure remains stable for at least 1 h. Yet, the molecular weight and size may continue to grow, albeit slowly, with prolonged incubation time, e.g.overnight incubation at 66 °C usually leads to whitish precipitates. The effect of temperature on lens crystallins was also evaluated by steady state fluorescence techniques. The decrease in the quantum yield of tryptophan fluorescence with increase in temperature was observed for all crystallins studied (Fig.2). Yet, the overall decrease did not reach the maximum possible for free tryptophan in solution (Fig.2g). Together with the fact that the maxima of Trp fluorescence were only slightly red shifted, this indicates that all crystallins essentially retain their tertiary structure at temperatures up to 66 °C. The result is in agreement with infrared spectroscopy studies, which show that secondary structures are essentially preserved (39Das K.P. Choo-Smith L.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33209-33212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On return to ambient temperatures, however, the changes were not totally reversible reflecting different stability of the lens proteins (Fig. 2). α-Crystallin displayed an increase in quantum yield, with the maximum of emission returning to 333 nm (Fig. 2a). βLOW-Crystallin displayed a larger increase in quantum yield, and the red shift in maximum of emission was not reversible (Fig. 2b), whereas γ-crystallin exhibited good reversibility in Trp emission (Fig. 2, c and d). All experiments using fluorescence techniques were conducted at concentrations below 0.05 mg/ml, and in contrast to the high protein concentration observations, no insoluble precipitated βLOW- or γ-crystallin could be detected after incubation at 60 or 66 °C for up to 30 min. However the appearance of a Rayleigh peak at 55 °C for βLOW-crystallin and at 66 °C for γ-crystallin was an indication of light scattering by larger, soluble, protein aggregates (Fig. 2). Such a difference in the onset of the Rayleigh peak reflects differential responses to heat stress among γ- and βLOW-crystallins. A Rayleigh peak is also observed with α-crystallin at the onset of the conformational change at 60 °C. Moreover, changes in extrinsic fluorescence of labeled α-crystallin cysteine residues are illustrated by emission spectra of α-IAEDANS and α-IAF at 37 °C, before and after incubation at 66 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2,e and f). As can be seen from Fig. 2f, the incubat"

In plants, different isoforms of the NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) are involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways. The C4-specific NADP-ME has evolved from C3-type malic enzymes to represent a unique and specialized form of NADP-ME as indicated by its particular kinetic and regulatory properties. In the present study, the mature C4-specific NADP-ME of maize was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme has essentially the same physicochemical properties andKm for the substrates as those of the naturally occurring NADP-ME previously characterized. However, thekcat was almost 7-fold higher, which may suggest that the previously purified enzyme from maize leaves was partially inactive.

They are widely distributed in nature, being found in bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. In eukaryotic organisms, different ME isoforms are found in the cytosol, mitochondria, or chloroplasts. As the products of the ME reaction can support diverse biological processes, the enzyme is involved in a great number of metabolic pathways depending on the tissue and subcellular localization. Most ME can use only NAD or NADP as essential cofactors. Thus, they are classified as NAD (EC 1.1.1.38or EC 1.1.1.39, depending on the ability to decarboxylate oxaloacetate)- or NADP (EC 1.1.1.40)-dependent malic enzymes. malic enzyme 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid intrinsic fluorescence In plants, different isoforms of the NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME) are involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways (1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 290: 1-6Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic C4 NADP-ME, which is involved in the CO2 concentrating mechanism that increases the photosynthetic yield of NADP-ME C4 plants, is compartmentalized in bundle sheath chloroplasts. In NADP-ME C4 plants, these organelles show a gradation of structure from chloroplasts with rudimentary grana (in maize and crabgrass) to completely agranal (in sugarcane and sorghum) (2Edwards G.E. Walker D.A. C3, C4: Mechanism and Cellular Environmental Regulation of Photosynthesis. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford1983Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that the high level activity of the C4 NADP-ME could strongly affect the development of the bundle sheath chloroplasts, as transgenic rice expressing the C4 maize NADP-ME also showed an aberrant structure (3Takeuchi Y. Akagi H. Kasamura N. Osumi M. Honda H. Planta (Heidelberg). 2000; 211: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The C4-specific NADP-ME represents a unique and specialized form of ME as indicated by its particular kinetic and regulatory properties (1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 290: 1-6Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Edwards G.E. Andreo C.S. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As other C4-specific enzymes, NADP-ME pre-existing genes of the C3-type were probably recruited for operating in the C4 pathway after acquiring diverse regulatory elements and unique kinetic and regulatory properties (1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 290: 1-6Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar,5Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Nevertheless, all plant NADP-MEs are highly homologous and share several conservative sites (from I to V; see Ref. 1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 290: 1-6Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of these sites (site II and V) present the typical signature motif GXGXXG, which is diagnostic, along with other characteristics, also shared by these sites, of a dinucleotide-binding fold (8Rossman M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.I. Banaszak L.J. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar, 9Bellamacina C.R.

The structures revealed that malic enzymes belong to a new class of oxidative decarboxylases (10Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid residue sequences of the human mitochondrial NAD(P)-ME, the pigeon cytosolic NADP-ME, and the maize chloroplastic C4 NADP-ME are highly conserved (between 44 and 50% identity), there are several kinetic differences among them. For example, human NADP-ME shows dual specificity for NAD and NADP, cooperativity in the binding of malate and regulation of activity by fumarate and ATP; pigeon NADP-ME tetramer presents half-of-the-sites reactivity; and maize NADP-ME is inhibited by malate only at acidic pH. In the present work, the C4-specific NADP-ME from maize was expressed in Escherichia coli as a functional protein. The recombinant mature enzyme shows almost all the expected physicochemical and kinetic properties of the natural enzyme, and was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis of residues near or at conserved site II or V of plant NADP-MEs (1Drincovich M.F. Casati P. Andreo C.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 290: 1-6Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The kinetic and structural properties of the mutated proteins in relation of a predicted three-dimensional model based on the crystal structure obtained for the human and pigeon NAD(P)-ME were analyzed. The data presented here represent the first prokaryotic expression of a plant NADP-ME and reveals valuable insight into the structure of the active site. A random primed partial cDNA of maize C4 NADP-ME (1.3 kb from the 3′-terminal cDNA provided by T. Nelson, Yale University) was used as hybridization probe to screen a λ-ZAP (Stratagene) cDNA library from maize leaves, using the procedures described in Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones with the estimated complete length of NADP-ME (∼2 kilobase pairs) were identified by KpnI digestion of the purified DNA from the positive phages by Southern blot (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The corresponding plasmids (pBluescript SK) were excised from the selected phages using the helper phage ExAssist and E. coliXLOLR strain (Stratagene). The insert of one of the plasmids (pBS-ME) selected by restriction enzyme analysis was completely sequenced (DNA Sequencing Facility of Maine University) and corresponded to the complete cDNA of the C4 NADP-ME from maize (Ref. 14Rothermel B.A. Nelson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19587-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, GenBankTM accession number J05130). To make a plasmid construction for expressing the mature C4NADP-ME protein, oligonucleotides primers (5EM, 5′-CATGCCATGGCGATGGTCTCCAACG-3′ and 3EM, 5′-ACGCTCGAGGCACTACCGGTAGTTGCG-3′) containing the first codon of the mature maize C4 NADP-ME after transit peptide cleavage (predicted by ChloroP V1.1 Prediction Program and according to Ref. 14Rothermel B.A. Nelson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19587-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the stop codon, respectively, were used to perform a PCR using pBS-ME as template. The primers also introduced unique NcoI and XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ of the NADP-ME insert to easily subclone the PCR fragment into the pET32 expression vector (Novagen). The construction obtained was designed in such a way that, after enterokinase digestion of the recombinant quimeric protein, only three extra amino acids are introduced at the NH2 terminus of the mature C4 NADP-ME. The insert in the expressed vector obtained (pET32-ME) was sequenced to be sure that no errors were introduced because of PCR and subcloning procedures. The pBS-ME plasmid was studied regarding the complementation of an E. coli mutant lacking NAD(P)-ME and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity (JM1321 strain, Ref. 16Hansen E.J. Juni E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this way, EJ1321, EJ1321(pBS), and JM1321(pBS-ME) (not transformed and transformed with pBS or pBS-ME, respectively) were grown on minimum media (SPI: 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 80 mm K2HPO4, 44 mmKH2PO4, and 3 mm sodium citrate) supplemented or not with 0.4% l-malate or 0.4% glucose in the presence of 25 μg/ml streptomycin to study the ability of the bacteria to grow with C4 acids as the sole carbon source. The presence of colonies and the absorbance at 600 nm was measured in liquid media after 24–36 h of incubation at 37 °C as criteria of growth. In the pET32-ME expression vector, the mature C4 NADP-ME was connected in-frame with the His tag to facilitate purification of the expressed fusion protein by a nickel-containing His-Bind column (Novagen). The BL21(DE3) E. coli strain transformed with pET32-ME was grown on LB medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the culture reached anA600 of 0.6. The inductor lactose (2% w/v) was added and the bacteria were cultured for a further 16 h at 30 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 4,000 × g; resuspended in buffer A (0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing 5 mmimidazole, 0,01 μg/μl leupeptin, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; sonicated and centrifuged for 10 min at 7,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was used for protein purification onto a nickel-NTA column according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Novagen), but using 200 mm imidazole for elution. The enzyme was then concentrated on Centricon YM-30 (Amicon) and desalted according to Penefsky (17Penefsky H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Purified fusion NADP-ME protein was then incubated with enterokinase (1:100) in buffer B at 10 °C for 2 h to remove the NH2 terminus codified by the expression vector. The protein was further purified using an affinity Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad) followed by a second nickel-NTA column. The purified enzyme was stored at −80 °C in buffer B (with 50% glycerol) for further studies. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Sedmak and Grossberg (18Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Site-directed mutagenesis of maize mature NADP-ME was carried out according to the procedures described by Mikaelian and Sergeant (19Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides primers that introduced mutations in the wild-type protein were as follows: Gsite2V, 5′-TTGGTACTTGTAGATTTGGTTTGTCAG-3′; Gsite5V, 5′-AGTTACAGCCTCCACAGCAACAAGGAA-3′; A392G, 5′-AGAGCAATAAGTTCTCCAATACCAGT-3′; A387G, 5′-TCCACCCTCCCCAGCACC-3′; R237L, 5′-ACTGATGGTGAGCTAATCTTGGGA-3′; in which the mutation positions are highlighted and underlined in the oligonucleotide sequence. The PCR was carried out using a mixture of Taq andPfu polymerases (10:1) to reduce possible mistakes introduced by Taq polymerase. The fragments containing the mutations were subcloned from the PCR products to the pET32-ME, replacing the wild-type sequence. The introduced sequences in the mutated plasmids were sequenced to verify the introduction of the corresponding mutations and that no errors were added because of PCR and subcloning procedures. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as previously indicated for the wild-type NADP-ME, except that the Affi-Gel blue column was omitted in some cases because of the lack or low binding of the mutated enzymes. NADP-ME activity was determined as described by Maurino et al. (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies were performed by varying the concentration of one of the substrates around its Km while keeping the other substrate concentrations at saturating levels. All kinetic parameters were calculated at least by triplicate determinations and adjusted to nonlineal regression. Free concentrations of all substrates were calculated according to Grover et al. (20Grover S.D. Canellas P.F. Wedding R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The optimal pH of the recombinant NADP-ME reaction was determined using different buffers for various pH ranges: 50 mm Mes (pH 5.5–6.5), 50 mm Tricine-Mops (pH 7.0–7.5), and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5–8.5). Malic enzyme activity in the presence of NAD was measured in a reaction mixture to keep free Mg2+concentration constant as the NAD level increased (as described in Ref.21Ashton A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this case, the reaction medium contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm Mg Cl2, and 4 mml-malate. Initial activity was measured at different NAD concentrations by adding a mixture of NAD:MgCl2 (1:0.34) solution adjusted to pH 7.0 to the assay mixture. This care was not taken for NADP because low concentrations of NADP were required to saturate the NADP-ME activity. SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting according to Burnette (23Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-maize NADP-ME antibodies were used for detection (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were located by linking to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Native IEF was performed in 5% (w/w) polyacrylamide gels. NADP-ME was localized by activity staining as described by Maurino et al. (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). Isoelectric points (pI) of the reactive bands were calculated using the Pharmacia broad pI calibration kit. Protein crude extracts from maize were prepared as described by Maurino et al. (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the recombinant native NADP-ME protein was evaluated by gel-filtration chromatography on a high performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Associates) with a BioSep-SEC-S300 column (335 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex). The column was equilibrated with 25 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.0 or 8.0 and 10% (v/v) glycerol and calibrated using molecular mass standards. The sample and the standards were applied separately in a final volume of 50 μl at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. CD spectra were made with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1.0-cm path length cell and averaging five repetitive scans between 250 and 200 nm. Typically, 50 μg of the wild-type or mutated NADP-ME in buffer Phosphate (20 mmNaPi, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) were used for each assay. Mean residue ellipticity (φ) was obtained by the equation, [φ]=φMMRW10dc(Eq. 1) in which 111.42 was used as MMRW (the mean amino acid residue weight), d is the cell path in cm, and c is the concentration of the protein in mg/ml. Intrinsic fluorescence (IF) spectra of the recombinant wild-type and mutated NADP-MEs were analyzed with a PerkinElmer 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer thermostated at 20 °C, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and slit widths of 5 nm. Typically, 5 μg of the wild-type or mutated NADP-ME in buffer Phosphate were used for each assay. All spectra were corrected for the buffer absorption and the Raman spectra of water. NADP, l-malate, Tris, enterokinase, bovine serum albumin, and reagents for Western blot assays were purchased from Sigma. DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega(Madison, WI). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The plasmid pBS-ME obtained after screening a cDNA library from maize leaves with a partial cDNA of the C4 NADP-ME was studied to determine whether it was able to express NADP-ME fusion protein in E. coli DH5α strain. In this way, total protein extracts obtained from saturated cultures of DH5α E. coli transformed with pBS-ME were analyzed by Western blot using anti-maize NADP-ME-purified antibodies (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained (Fig.1A) indicated the presence of an immunoreactive band of 69 kDa present only in E. colitransformed with pBS-ME. This band was found in extracts induced or not with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fig.1A), which may be because of the high copy number of this plasmid. The molecular mass of this immunoreactive band corresponded to the expected mass of the fusion protein as follows: mature NADP-ME (62 kDa) plus the NADP-ME transit peptide and a sequence codified by the vector. In all the samples analyzed, a second immunoreactive band of 60 kDa was also observed (Fig. 1A), which may correspond to an endogenous NADP-ME form of E. coli (24Spina J. Bright H. Robinson J. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3794-3801Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To analyze if the fusion NADP-ME immunoreactive protein was expressed as an active enzyme, NADP-ME activity was measured in soluble protein extracts from overnight DH5α E. coli cultures transformed with pBS-ME. In this case, DH5α E. colitransformed with pBS-ME presented more than 10 times more NADP-ME activity than DH5α E. coli not transformed with the plasmid (typically 2.9 versus 0.22 IU/mg of the untransformed strain). The induction of the transformed bacteria with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside resulted in less NADP-ME activity measurements (typically nearly 1 IU/mg), which may indicate that overexpression of this fusion protein of NADP-ME may be detrimental to the bacteria. EJ1321 is a triple mutant of E. coli that lacks NAD and NADP-malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities (16Hansen E.J. Juni E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this way, it is unable to grow in minimal medium with malate as the sole carbon source, because it cannot convert C4acids into C3 compounds. To check if transforming this strain with pBS-ME restored growth on malate, EJ1321, EJ1321(pBS), and EJ1321(pBS-ME) were grown on minimal medium supplemented with malate or glucose as the sole carbon source. In the presence of glucose, both EJ1321 and EJ1321(pBS-ME) were able to grow, as liquid overnight cultures of these bacteria typically presentedA600 of 0.5–0.6. Nevertheless, in the presence of malate, EJ1321(pBS-ME) was able to grow but EJ1321 and EJ1321(pBS) were not, as overnight cultures of these bacteria in the presence of malate presented typically A600 of 0.2–0.3 for EJ1321(pBS-ME) and 0.01–0.02 for the others. Growth on solid media supplemented with glucose or malate indicated the same result: the presence of the plasmid pBS-ME restored the growth in malate for theE. coli mutant EJ1321. After removing the region encoding for chloroplastic transit peptide of the NADP-ME in pBS-ME, the sequence codifying the mature NADP-ME was cloned in-frame in the pET-32 expression vector. The E. coli BL21 strain transformed with pET32-ME was able to overexpress a protein of 79 kDa after induction with lactose (Fig. 1B). The protein was found in both soluble and insoluble fractions of BL21(pET32-ME) protein extracts and reacted with anti-maize NADP-ME-purified antibodies (Fig.1C). The calculated molecular mass of the expressed protein corresponded to the expected molecular mass of the fusion protein as follows: mature maize NADP-ME (62 kDa) plus 17 kDa was codified by the expression vector. The 79-kDa fusion protein obtained was purified by an His-Bind affinity column (Fig. 2A). After enterokinase digestion of this protein, a 62-kDa protein was obtained (Fig. 2A). This molecular mass corresponds to the molecular mass of the mature NADP-ME from maize leaves (14Rothermel B.A. Nelson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19587-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maurino V.G.

Moreover, Western blot analysis of this protein in comparison with protein crude extracts from maize leaves, indicates the presence of immunoreactive bands with identical molecular mass (Fig. 2B). As indicated, the pET32-ME vector was designed in such a way that after enterokinase digestion of the fusion recombinant protein, the enzyme obtained starts with three amino acid residues codified by the expression vector (Ala-Met-Ala) followed by the amino acid residues of the mature C4 NADP-ME from maize leaves (Met-Val-Ser-). The yield of the purified recombinant NADP-ME was ∼1 mg of soluble protein per 100 ml of liquid culture media. To verify if the purified recombinant NADP-ME obtained was identical to the enzyme present in maize leaves, different properties of the enzyme were studied. Native IEF revealed for NADP-ME activity indicated the presence of a band with an isoelectric point of 6.7 for the recombinant NADP-ME (Fig. 2C). Protein crude extracts from maize leaves presented a band with the same native isoelectric point (Fig. 2C). The recombinant NADP-ME before enterokinase digestion presented a more basic active band, probably because of the amino-terminal fusion fragment (Fig. 2C). The recombinant NADP-ME obtained was also able to assemble into a tetrameric form at pH 8.0, as a molecular mass of 226 kDa was calculated by gel filtration chromatography (not shown). At pH 7.0, the enzyme eluted in two peaks, one of 216 kDa and a minor peak of 110 kDa (not shown), which may correspond to the dimeric form of the C4 maize NADP-ME as previously demonstrated for the purified enzyme from maize leaves at this pH (26Spampinato C.P. Casati P. Andreo C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Analysis of the secondary structure of the recombinant NADP-ME by CD spectrum showed a peak at 210 nm (Fig.3A). The IF emission spectrum of the recombinant NADP-ME excited at 295 nm showed a maximum at 336 nm (Fig. 3B). The purified NADP-ME from maize leaves presented an essentially identical IF spectrum (27Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 1287-1297PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic parameters of the recombinant NADP-ME were measured and compared with the previously published data obtained for the purified enzyme from maize leaves (TableI). Although the Kmvalues obtained for NADP and malate (as well as for Mg2+, not shown) were in the same order of magnitude as those previously obtained, the kcat of the recombinant enzyme was more than six times higher than the value previously reported for the NADP-ME purified from maize leaves (Table I). The recombinant enzyme also presented an optimum pH for activity of 8.0 and was inhibited by high concentrations of malate at pH 7.0, with Km andKi values of 0.084 and 4.7 mm, respectively. Similar values were previously measured for the purified enzyme from maize leaves (15Maurino V.G. Drincovich M.F. Andreo C.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

In this case, the enzyme presented more activity at pH 7.0 than at 8.0. Using the structure of the human mitochondrial NAD-ME and the pigeon cytosolic NADP-ME as templates (1QR6 and 1GQ2, respectively, Protein Data Bank), a three-dimensional model of the maize C4 NADP-ME was predicted by the protein structure homology-modeling server (SWISS-MODEL). Part of the predicted model, showing conserved sites II and V of plant NADP-MEs, both of which present the typical dinucleotide-binding signature motif GXGXXG, is shown in Fig.4A. Sites with essentially the same motif are also found in the human NAD-ME and the pigeon NADP-ME. The predicted secondary structure shows that site V (which includes residues 383GAGEAG388 of the maize NADP-ME) adopts a Rossman βαβ-fold, as previously indicated for residues311GAGEAA316 of the human mitochondrial NAD-ME in domain C (10Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure. 1999; 7: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, contrary to expectations from the sequence analysis of site II (which includes residues240GLGDLG245 of the maize NADP-ME), this motif is not involved in a typical Rossman βαβ-fold (Fig.4A).

The 12/15-lipoxygenase expressed in macrophages is capable of oxygenating linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol in the LDL particle, and thus this enzyme is presumed to initiate LDL oxidation. We recently reported that LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) was required for the enzyme-mediated LDL oxidation by macrophages and suggested the selective uptake of cholesterol ester from LDL to the plasma membrane (Xu, W., Takahashi, Y., Sakashita, T., Iwasaki, T., Hattori, H., and Yoshimoto. T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36454–36459). To elucidate precise mechanisms of lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation, we investigated the intracellular localization of 12/15-lipoxygenase. The 12/15-lipoxygenase was predominantly detected in cytosol of resting peritoneal macrophages and of macrophage-like J774A.1 cells permanently transfected with the cDNA for the enzyme. When the cells were treated with LDL and subjected to subcellular fractionation, the 12/15-lipoxygenase was detected in the membranes with a concomitant decrease in cytosol as shown by Western blot analysis. The levels of the enzyme associated with the membrane reached maximum in 15 min after LDL addition and then decreased. However, the enzymatic activity of 12/15-lipoxygenase in the membrane fraction was very weak even after LDL treatment. This fact supports the suicide inactivation of the enzyme by the oxygenation of cholesterol ester transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane. Immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against 12/15-lipoxygenase revealed that the plasma membrane was the major site of the enzyme translocation by the LDL treatment. LDL-dependent 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation was inhibited by a blocking antibody against LRP. Furthermore, an enzyme translocation inhibitor, L655238, inhibited the LDL oxidation caused by the 12/15-lipoxygenase. We propose that cholesterol ester selectively transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane via LRP is oxygenated by 12/15-lipoxygenase translocated to this membrane.

The enzyme consists of leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase found in rats, mice, cows, and pigs, and reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase (15-lipoxygenase-1) expressed in humans and rabbits, oxygenating the position 12 and 15 of arachidonic acid, respectively (5Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The notable feature of the 12/15-lipoxygenase is that the enzyme directly oxygenates not only free fatty acids but also complex substrates such as phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and the cholesterol ester present in the low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 particle (1Takahashi Y.

Oxidation of LDL is the first key step for the development of atherosclerosis (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 7Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar), and the roles of the 12/15-lipoxygenase in the process of LDL oxidation and the progress of atherogenesis have been extensively investigated. Recent study using 12/15-lipoxygenase-knockout mice (8Cyrus T. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Tangirala R. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Funk C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and the study using 12/15-lipoxygenase-transgenic mice (9Harats D. Shaish A. George J. Mulkins M. Kurihara H. Levkovitz H. Sigal E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2100-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) established that the enzyme was involved in the development of atherosclerosis, although contrary results were obtained using 12/15-lipoxygenase-transgenic rabbits (10Shen J. Kuhn H. Petho-Schramm A. Chan L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,11Funk C.D. Cyrus T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Using a macrophage-like cell line J774A.1, which did not have endogenous 12/15-lipoxygenase activity, we permanently transfected the cells with the 12/15-lipoxyganase cDNA and demonstrated that 12/15-lipoxygenase expressed in normal macrophages at a high level was required for LDL oxidation (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of extracellular LDL oxidation by intracellular 12/15-lipoxygenase has not been established. Recently, we revealed that the lipoxygenase-mediated LDL oxidation by macrophages required the binding of LDL to LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) but not to the LDL receptor, both of which are expressed on the surface of J774A.1 cells and are capable of binding native LDL (13Xu W. Takahashi Y. Sakashita T. Iwasaki T. Hattori H. Yoshimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36454-36459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The LDL is processed by the LDL receptor via receptor-mediated endocytosis in which cholesterol ester in the LDL particle is delivered to lysosomes where it is degraded (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of LDL to LRP has been demonstrated to selectively take up the cholesterol ester from LDL in the plasma membrane without endocytosis and degradation of the LDL particle (14Swarnakar S. Beers J. Strickland D.K. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For the efficient enzymatic oxygenation of the cholesterol ester transferred to the plasma membrane via LRP, the 12/15-lipoxygenase itself should also be localized in the plasma membrane or its neighborhood. However, the 12/15-lipoxygenase is predominantly present in cytoplasm and not in the membranes in various cells (15Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell. Signal. 1995; 12: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent study has shown that the translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the plasma membrane was observed in macrophages when incubated with apoptotic cells (16Miller Y.I. Chang M.K. Funk C.D. Feramisco J.R. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19431-19439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the binding of LDL to LRP expressed in normal macrophages and 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing macrophage-like J774A.1 cells translocates the enzyme from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The translocation is necessary for the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. This study reveals a novel function of LRP in the development of atherosclerosis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Nissui (Tokyo, Japan), fetal bovine serum from JRH biosciences (Lenexa, KS), lipoprotein-deficient serum from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), and 2-thiobarbituric acid and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane(bismalondialdehyde) from Wako (Osaka, Japan), [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2.1 GBq/mmol) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences(Bucks, UK), biotinylated and peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG from Vector (Burlingame, CA), L655238 from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), silica gel thin-layer plates from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from Millipore (Bedford, MA), Lab-Tek chamber slide from Nalge Nunc International (Naperville, IL), swine serum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin from Dakopatts (Carpenteria, CA), and Glicidether 100 from Selva Feinbiochemica (Heidelberg, Germany). An antiserum against 12/15-lipoxygenase was raised using purified recombinant rat pineal 12-lipoxygenase as an antigen as described previously (17Kawajiri H. Qiao N. Zhuang D.M. Yoshimoto T. Hagiya H. Yamamoto S. Sei H. Morita Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An anti-LDL receptor antibody was raised as described and purified to IgG using protein A-Sepharose (13Xu W. Takahashi Y. Sakashita T. Iwasaki T. Hattori H. Yoshimoto T. J. Biol.

Human LDL was prepared from healthy volunteers and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 24 h before each experiment as described previously (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T.

Saeki of Shiga University of Medical Science. An expression vector, pEF-BOS having a elongation factor-1α promoter (18Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. S. Nagata of Osaka University. An anti-LRP antibody (19Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L.

J774A.1 cells permanently transfected with the pEF-BOS vector carrying porcine leukocyte 12/15-lipoxygenase cDNA and mock-transfected cells were establish as describe previously (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and subcultured every 2–3 days using a standard trypsin protocol. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were collected from C57BL/6 mice as described previously (20Zhuang D. Kawajiri H. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) except that thioglycollate was not injected before harvesting the cells. The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes in DMEM with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48 h, then LDL at 400 μg/ml was added to the medium. After incubation at 37 °C for various periods, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA. The cells were sonicated twice on ice, each for 5 s, at 20 kHz by a Branson sonifier model 250 (Danbury, CT), followed by ultracentrifugation at 265,000 ×g at 4 °C for 2 h. The supernatant was referred to as cytosol, and the pellet resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA was referred to as “membranes.” 12/15-Lipoxygenase activity was determined as described previously (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cytosol and the membranes were incubated in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 and 25 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (1.85 kBq). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min with constant mixing and quenched by the addition of 1 ml of an ice-cold mixture of diethyl ether/methanol/1 m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v). The ether layer was spotted onto a silica gel thin layer plate, and the plate was developed at 4 °C for 60 min with a solvent system of diethyl ether/petroleum ether/acetic acid (85:15:0.1, v/v). The radioactive products on the plate were detected and quantified by a Fujix BAS 1000 imaging analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The proteins in the cytosol and membranes were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by blocking with 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH7.4 containing 136 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The washed membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-12/15-lipoxygenase antibody at 1:1000 dilution. 12/15-Lipoxygenase band was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's instruction. The density of 12/15-lipoxygenase band was quantified by National Institutes of Health Image 1.60 analysis software (Bethesda, MD). The intensity of the 12/15-lipoxygenase band increased linearly with the amount of the enzyme loaded onto the gel. The 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells (2 × 105) were preincubated for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% of lipoprotein-deficient serum followed by the addition of a translocation inhibitor, L655238, at various concentrations. After 1 h the cells were incubated with 400 μg/ml LDL in 100 μl of DMEM containing the serum in the presence of L655238 for 12 h, and the culture medium was subjected to TBARS assay as described previously (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The light- and electron-microscopic immunohistochemical procedures were performed as described (22Yamamoto M. Fan L. Wakayama T. Amano O. Iseki S. Anat. Rec. 2001; 262: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 12/15-Lipoxygenase-expressing cells and mouse resident macrophages collected from the peritoneal cavity were cultured for 48 h in the medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum in Lab-Tek chamber slide. The cells were then treated with LDL for 15 min followed by fixation in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. For light microscope observation, the slides were first permeabilized by incubating with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 for 1 h, treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min, and then incubated with 5% normal swine serum for 30 min. Subsequently, the slides were incubated at room temperature overnight with an anti-12/15-lipoxygenase antiserum. For the negative control, the antibody was replaced with preimmune rabbit serum. The sites of immunoreaction were then visualized by incubating the slides successively with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG diluted at 1:200 for 1 h, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted at 1:300 for 1 h, and with 0.01% 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in the presence of 0.02% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 for 10–30 min. For electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry, the immunostained slides were postfixed with 0.5% OsO4 for 20 min. After block-staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 min, the slides were dehydrated in graded ethanol series and embedded in an epoxy resin based on Glicidether 100. Ultrathin sections were prepared and subjected to observation with a Hitachi H-700 electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). 12/15-Lipoxygenase is predominantly localized in cytosol but not in the membranes (15Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell. Signal. 1995; 12: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in macrophage-like J774A.1 cells overexpressing 12/15-lipoxygenase and resident peritoneal macrophages by Western blot as shown in Fig.1A. To investigate whether the subcellular localization of the 12/15-lipoxygenase is changed by LDL treatment, the enzyme-expressing cells or peritoneal macrophages were treated with LDL for various periods, and the cytosol and membranes were subjected to Western blot analysis. Fig. 1A shows that the band of 12/15-lipoxygenase at 75 kDa was detected not only in the cytosol but also in the membranes with a concomitant decrease of the enzyme level in the cytosol. Association of the enzyme to the membranes reached maximum at 15 min after LDL addition and then decreased. After 30 min the enzyme was no longer present in the membranes. Densitometric analysis revealed the increase in 12/15-lipoxygenase protein of the membranes after the LDL treatment for 5 and 15 min by 23- and 33-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B). The enzyme protein was increased by 14-fold in the membranes of macrophages by the treatment with LDL for 15 min. After 15-min treatment by LDL, the enzyme protein in the cytosol was decreased by 38 and 47% in 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells and in macrophages, respectively. The results indicated that 12/15-lipoxygenase was transferred from cytosol to membranes by the LDL treatment in the resident macrophages as well as 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing J774A.1 cells. We measured the enzyme activity in the cytosol and membranes in 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells. As shown in Fig.2, the specific activity of the enzyme in the cytosol was decreased by 41% by the treatment with LDL for 15 min as compared with non-treated cells. The result was in good agreement with that from Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). The level of the increase of the enzyme activity in the membranes was significantly lower after LDL treatment. It is shown that cholesterol ester is selectively transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane via LRP in Y1 murine adrenocortical cells (14Swarnakar S. Beers J. Strickland D.K. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in our 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells 2W. Xu, Y. Takahashi, T. Murakami, T. Iwasaki, H. Hattori, and T. Yoshimoto, manuscript in preparation. and that linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol in the LDL particle is regio- and stereospecifically oxygenated by the 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the above observations strongly support our contention that the 12/15-lipoxygenase associated with the membranes oxygenates cholesterol ester transferred to the membrane, because self-catalyzed inactivation of the 12/15-lipoxygenase, which should be observed in the enzyme reaction with cholesterol ester in the membrane, is known to occur (23Belkner J. Stender H. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23225-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This would explain the much lower enzyme activity in membranes. The results indicate that LDL brings about translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase from cytosol to membranes where the oxidation of cholesterol ester from LDL takes place. We previously reported the essential requirement of LRP for the cell-mediated oxidation of LDL in macrophages (13Xu W. Takahashi Y. Sakashita T. Iwasaki T. Hattori H. Yoshimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36454-36459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To examine whether the LRP is also involved in the translocation of the enzyme, we employed an anti-LRP antibody that blocked the binding of LDL to LRP (19Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The 12/15-lipoxygenase expressing cells and mouse resident peritoneal macrophages were preincubated in the presence of an anti-LDL receptor antibody or an anti-LRP antibody for 2 h. After 15-min incubation with LDL, the cytosol and membranes were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and C), the 12/15-lipoxygenase band in the membranes of the cells preincubated with an anti-LRP antibody was faint after LDL treatment as compared with that from the control. Consistent with this observation, the density of the 12/15-lipoxygenase band in the cytosol of the cells preincubated with an anti-LRP antibody was not significantly different from that of the cells that were not treated with LDL. Preincubation with an anti-LDL receptor antibody did not significantly affect the enzyme translocation by the LDL treatment (Fig. 3). The results indicate that the translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase is mediated by binding of LDL to the LRP but not to the LDL receptor. To determine the intracellular localization of the 12/15-lipoxygenase after LDL treatment, the enzyme-expressing cells were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against the enzyme (Fig.4). A different staining pattern of the 12/15-lipoxygenase was observed between the cells treated with and without LDL under light microscopy. In the non-treated cells, the enzyme was predominantly stained in cytoplasm of 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells (Fig. 4, C and D). When the cells were treated with LDL for 15 min, the positive staining of 12/15-lipoxygenase was observed not only in cytoplasm but also in the plasma membrane of the enzyme-expressing cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Essentially the same results were obtained with LDL-treated resident peritoneal macrophages. The control experiments with preimmune rabbit serum in place of the antiserum against 12/15-lipoxygenase exhibited negative immunostaining (data not shown). The results indicate that the plasma membrane is at least one of the major sites where 12/15-lipoxygenase translocates after LDL treatment. To investigate the precise localization of the enzyme in the LDL-treated cells, we observed the immunostained cells with an electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4F, non-treated cells showed diffuse staining pattern in cytoplasm. In contrast, the plasma membrane was the major site where the 12/15-lipoxygenase was localized in LDL-treated cells, although membranes of some other intracellular organelles were also stained in addition to cytoplasm (Fig. 4E). It should be noted that the nuclear envelope was essentially not stained in LDL-treated cells. To examine whether enzyme association with the membranes is required for the LDL oxidation, we employed a translocation inhibitor, L655238. This compound was first found to inhibit translocation of 5-lipoxygenase (24Evans J.F. Leville C. Mancini J.A. Prasit P. Therien M. Zamboni R. Gauthier J.Y. Fortin R. Charleson P. MacIntyre D.E. Luell S. Bach T.J. Meurer R. Guay J. Vickers P.J. Rouzer C.A. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 22-27PubMed Google Scholar) but later shown to inhibit translocation of other lipoxygenases without affecting the enzyme activity per se (25Ozeki Y. Nagamura Y. Ito H. Unemi F. Kimura Y. Igawa T. Kambayashi J. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), L655238 inhibited translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase in the LDL-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the enzyme activity. Fig. 5C shows that LDL oxidation determined as TBARS generation in the medium was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the translocation inhibitor. The inhibitor at 10 μm, which completely suppressed the enzyme translocation (Fig. 5, A and B), inhibited the LDL oxidation to the level of mock-transfected cells (Fig.5C). The results clearly indicate that the association of the enzyme with the plasma membrane is required for the LDL oxidation. We demonstrate here that 12/15-lipoxygenase is translocated from cytosol to the membranes by LDL treatment in 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing macrophage-like cells and resident peritoneal macrophages (Figs. 1 and 2). The translocated enzyme is preferentially localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4), strongly suggesting that the enzyme directly oxygenates cholesterol ester selectively transferred from the LDL particle to the plasma membrane. In fact, the LDL oxidation was inhibited by a translocation inhibitor, L655238 (Fig. 5). Regio- and stereospecific oxygenation of linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol in LDL by 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells indicates that cholesterol ester is enzymatically oxygenated by the cells (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enzymatic oxygenation is presumed to be the first key step for the generation of the completely oxidized LDL, which is made in the subsequent steps, including non-enzymatic radical chain reaction (12Sakashita T. Takahashi Y. Kinoshita T. Yoshimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Belkner J. Stender H. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23225-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The fact that 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation takes place in a very short period such as 5–15 min supports this notion (Fig. 1). Furthermore, such a short time course minimizes the oxygenation of phospholipids in plasma membrane, which may cause the cell injury. The weak activity of the membrane-associated enzyme after LDL treatment strongly suggests that the enzyme in the plasma membrane reacts with colocalized substrates, including cholesterol ester and then suicides. However, the reduction of the enzyme activity may be due to other mechanisms unrelated to suicide inactivation such as poor substrate availability or conformational changes of the enzyme. It is reported that 12/15-lipoxygenase preferentially oxygenates cholesterol ester in the LDL particle, whereas phospholipids or even free fatty acids are not oxygenated, although they are present on the surface of the LDL particle (23Belkner J. Stender H. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23225-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the specific oxygenation of cholesterol ester transferred to the plasma membrane by 12/15-lipoxygenase could take place. LRP is an LDL-binding receptor that selectively transfers cholesterol ester in the LDL particle (14Swarnakar S. Beers J. Strickland D.K. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21121-21128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).2 We show here that binding of LDL to LRP is also required for 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation (Fig. 3). 12/15-Lipoxygenase-expressing J774A.1 cells have both LRP and the LDL receptor, although the expression level of the LDL receptor is low (13Xu W. Takahashi Y. Sakashita T. Iwasaki T. Hattori H. Yoshimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36454-36459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, normal macrophages express high level of LRP but do not express the LDL receptor (26Hiltunen T.P. Yla-Herttuala S. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137 (suppl.): S81-S88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Pallesen G. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The contribution of LRP but not of the LDL receptor to 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation supports the notion that the LDL-dependent translocation is also mediated by LRP in normal macrophages. In fact, the enzyme translocation is inhibited in mouse peritoneal macrophages lacking the LDL receptor by the anti-LRP antibody (Fig. 3, C and D). However, we cannot completely exclude a role for the LDL receptor in the translocation, because either type of cells used in our experiments express a little or no LDL receptor where an anti-LDL receptor antibody would not be expected to have an effect. Coupling of selective uptake of cholesterol ester with 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation would cause efficient oxygenation of linoleic acid esterified to cholesterol. The mechanisms of the efflux of oxygenated cholesterol ester to the LDL particle are now under extensive investigation in our laboratory. The cholesterol ester in the high density lipoprotein is selectively transferred to the plasma membrane by scavenger receptor class B type I (28Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The same receptor is shown to mediate cholesterol efflux to high density lipoprotein (29Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 30Jian B. de la Llera-Moya M. Ji Y. Wang N. Phillips M.C. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It may be possible that LRP also mediates the efflux of oxygenated cholesterol ester from the plasma membrane to the LDL particle. The mechanism of translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase in macrophages is not known (16Miller Y.I. Chang M.K. Funk C.D. Feramisco J.R. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19431-19439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although the N-terminal C2-like domain in the enzyme is proposed to be responsible for the enzyme binding to the membrane phospholipids in a calcium dependent way (31Walther M. Anton M. Wiedmann M. Fletterick R. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27360-27366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In fact, our finding that the translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase is inhibited by L655238 suggests the similar translocation mechanism to that of 5-lipoxygenase. L655238 was first developed as an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, which was later shown to function as a substrate transfer protein promoting the use of arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids (32Radmark O.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S11-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In 5-lipoxygenase, the N-terminal C2-like domain is demonstrated to be a calcium-dependent membrane-targeting domain without requirement of any special docking protein (33Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have reported that 12-lipoxygenase in human platelets is activated by membrane translocation when stimulated by collagen or thrombin and that a translocation inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, L655238, inhibits production of 12-HETE from platelets without affecting the enzyme activity (25Ozeki Y. Nagamura Y. Ito H. Unemi F. Kimura Y. Igawa T. Kambayashi J. Takahashi Y. Yoshimoto T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results clearly indicate that L655238 is not a 5-lipoxygenase-specific inhibitor but a general translocation inhibitor of lipoxygenases. The structural difference of the C2-like domain in the enzyme has been proposed to determine the enzyme preference of the membrane type (34Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, the C2-like domain in 5-lipoxygenase and cytosolic phospholipase A2 binds preferentially to the nuclear envelope (33Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas that in protein kinase Cα and phospholipase Cδ1 prefers targeting to the plasma membrane (36Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,37Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 3568-3575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in a calcium-dependent way. In fact, our preliminary results using 12/15-lipoxygenase-expressing cells suggested that the calcium ionophore A23187 caused translocation of the enzyme (data not shown), although different results have been reported (35Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). LRP is known to couple with a Gi class of heterotrimeric GTPases when it binds to apoE4 to induce apoptosis of neuronal cells (38Hashimoto Y. Jiang H. Niikura T. Ito Y. Hagiwara A. Umezawa K. Abe Y. Murayama Y. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8401-8409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the LDL binding to LRP but not to the LDL receptor is required for the translocation of 12/15-lipoxygenase (Fig. 3). Although LDL contains apoB but not apoE as an apolipoprotein, some signal transduction pathways may be activated after the binding of LDL to LRP rather than simple membrane association via the N-terminal C2 domain-like structure of the 12/15-lipoxygenase in the cells treated by LDL. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of LRP-mediated membrane association of the 12/15-lipoxygenase. LRP is a multifunctional receptor capable of binding a wide variety of ligands and postulated to participate in a number of pathophysiological processes ranging from atherosclerosis, fibrinolysis, neuronal degeneration, to apoptosis (39Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). As a role in homeostasis of plasma lipoproteins, LRP expressed in liver has been established as a remnant receptor using LRP-disrupted mice in a liver-specific manner (40Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, they demonstrate that more than 70% of the remnant is cleared from plasma by the LDL receptor expressed in liver, and LRP in liver is a compensating receptor for the clearance of the remnant. We have proposed the dual functions of LRP expressed in macrophages, selective uptake of cholesterol ester from LDL, and 12/15-lipoxygenase translocation. Thus, an LRP antagonist may be anti-atherogenic by inhibition of LDL oxidation in the two ways: blocking of the binding of native LDL to macrophages followed by the selective transfer of cholesterol ester to the plasma membrane and by inhibiting the association of the plasma membrane with 12/15-lipoxygenase, which oxygenates the cholesterol ester in the plasma membrane.

Saeki of Shiga University for providing J774A.1 cells, and Dr. S. Nagata for providing the pEF-BOS vector. We thank Dr. M. R.

To understand this enzyme better, differential expression in leaf and seed tissues, protein properties, and substrate preferences of plant cyclopropane synthase were investigated. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies raised to recombinant S. foetidacyclopropane synthase (SfCPA-FAS) revealed thatSfCPA-FAS is expressed in S. foetidaseeds, but not in leaves, and is a membrane protein localized to microsomal fractions. Transformed tobacco cells expressingSfCPA-FAS were labeled in vivo withl-[methyl-14C]methionine and assayed in vitro withS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine. These kinetic experiments demonstrated that dihydrosterculate was synthesized from oleic acid esterified at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Furthermore, analysis of acyl chains atsn-1 and sn-2 positions that accumulated in PC from S. foetida developing seeds and from tobacco cells expressing SfCPA-FAS also demonstrated that greater than 90% of dihydrosterculate was esterified to the sn-1 position. Thus, we conclude that SfCPA-FAS is a microsomal localized membrane protein that catalyzes the addition of methylene groups derived from S-adenosyl-l-methionine across the double bond of oleic acid esterified to the sn-1 position of PC. A survey of plant and bacterial genomes for sequences related to SfCPA-FAS indicated that a peptide domain with a putative flavin-binding site is either fused to the methyltransferase domain of the plant protein or is often found encoded by a gene adjacent to a bacterial cyclopropane synthase gene.

In the plant kingdom, sterculic and malvalic acid, containing 19 and 18 carbons, respectively, are the most commonly found CPE-FAs in seed oils, whereas dihydrosterculic acid is the major carbocyclic fatty acid in the seed oil of Litchi chinensis and Euphoria longana(2Lie Ken Jie M.S.F. Chan M.F. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1977; 1264: 78Google Scholar, 3Gaydou E.M. Ralaimanarivo A. Bianchini J.P. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1993; 41: 886-890Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Kleiman R. Earle F.R. Wolff I.A. Lipids. 1969; 4: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Long-chain CPA- and CPE-FAs are also found in root, leaf, stem, and callus tissue in plants of the Malvaceae family (5Yano I. Nichols B.W. Morris L.J. James A.T. Lipids. 1972; 7: 30-34Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Schmid K.M. Patterson G.W. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 2831-2834Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the biological role of these fatty acids in plants is uncertain, CPE-FAs might function as anti-fungal agents (7Schmid K.M. Patterson G.W. Lipids. 1988; 23: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In tropical areas, CPE-FAs-containing seeds are still often consumed by humans (8Christie W.W. Gunstone F.D. Topics in Lipid Chemistry. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1970: 1-49Google Scholar, 9Ralaimanarivo A. Gaydou E.M. Bianchini J.P. Lipids. 1982; 17: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Among the CPE-FAs-containing oilseeds, cottonseeds are the most prevalent, ranking third in world oilseed crushing (10Chapman K.D. Austin-Brown S. Sparace S.A. Kinney A.J. Ripp K.G. Pirtle I.L. Pirtle R.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 78: 941-947Google Scholar). Cotton oil contains ∼1% CPE-FAs, which is the cause of many physiological disorders in animals fed cottonseed meal, such as pink white in eggs, depression of egg production, delay of sexual maturity in hens, and higher levels of hard fats in cows (11Phelps R.A. Shenstone F.S. Kemmerer A.R. Evans R.J. Poult. Sci. 1965; 44: 358-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Page A.M. Sturdivant C.A. Lunt D.K. Smith S.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 118: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These disorders all reduce product quality or quantity and therefore can be a source of economic loss. The underlying cause of these disorders is due to the fact that CPE-FAs are strong inhibitors of fatty-acid desaturases in animals (13Fogerty A.C. Johnson A.R. Pearson J.A. Lipids. 1972; 7: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Cao J.M. Blond J.P. Bezard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1210: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, vegetable oils containing CPE-FAs, particularly cottonseed oil, are generally treated with high temperature or hydrogenation before consumption to remove these CPE-FAs (15Bianchini J.P. Ralaimanarivo A. Gaydou E.M. J. Food Sci. 1983; 48: 253-255Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because of the added processing costs and the creation oftrans fatty acids during hydrogenation, a more suitable approach to eliminate CPE-FAs from oilseeds is through genetic engineering. This approach might also be useful to increase carbocyclic fatty acid production for specialty oil applications. Although CPE-FAs are anti-nutritional factors in animal diets, the high chemical reactivity of the cyclopropene ring can potentially be utilized for many oleochemical applications (8Christie W.W. Gunstone F.D. Topics in Lipid Chemistry. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1970: 1-49Google Scholar). Therefore, methods of both decreasing CPE-FA occurrence in edible oils and increasing their production in industrial oils are desirable. The isolation of a plant cyclopropane synthase cDNA provides an initial step toward achieving these goals (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). CPA-FAs are also constituents of bacterial and parasitic protozoa lipids (16Grogan D.W. Cronan J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 17Li R. Ganguli S. Pascal R.A.

Formation of the cyclopropane ring has been studied extensively in bacteria, and the enzymatic reaction has been defined as the transfer of a methylene group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the double bond of an unsaturated acyl chain (18Wang A.Y. Grogan D.W. Cronan J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11020-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The position requirement for the cis double bonds is rather loose for theEscherichia coli CPA-FA synthase (19Marinari L.A. Goldfine H. Panos C. Biochemistry. 1978; 13: 1978-1983Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Ohlrogge J. Gustone F.D. Ismail I.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Law J.H. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1304-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the crystal structures of three cyclopropane synthases from Mycobacterium suggests that acyl-ACP might be a substrate for these enzymes (21Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M.S.

Interestingly, alignment of the SfCPA-FAS with bacterial homologs indicates similarity only to the C-terminal half of the plant protein. The N-terminal half (amino acids 1–438) is unique to plant cyclopropane synthase in that known bacterial cyclopropane synthases lack this portion. The cloning of cyclopropane synthase cDNA from developing seeds of S. foetida (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has provided an opportunity to examine the SfCPA-FAS with regard to membrane association, subcellular localization, substrate, and positional specificity. We demonstrate that S. foetida cyclopropane synthase catalyzes the addition of a methylene group, derived fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine, across the double bond position of oleic acid esterified to PC. In contrast to the E. coli homolog and most other fatty acid modification enzymes of plants, SfCPA-FAS acts on the sn-1 rather thansn-2 position of phospholipid. Plant Material and Chemicals—Developing seeds ofSterculia foetida L. were obtained from Montgomery Botanical Center (Miami, FL). Frozen developing seeds were used for lipid analysis and immunoblotting. Tobacco suspension cells (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Bright yellow 2) containing the vector pE1776 orSfCPA-FAS were maintained as described by Bao et al. (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).l-[methyl-14C]Methionine (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (59 mCi/mmol) was from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Phospholipase A2 (from Crotalus atrox venom) was purchased from Sigma. SfCPA-FAS is 864 amino acid long, and only the C-terminal half shares significant similarity with known cyclopropane synthases from E. coliand Mycobacteria. To be able to detect homologs ofSfCPA-FAS in other species, the C-terminal half ofSfCPA-FAS (470–864 aa) was used as antigen. The corresponding fragment was obtained through PCR with upstream primer JO873 (CCGGAATTCTGTTCTCTTAAAACAGCTCTGAAAG TGC) and downstream primer JO885 (CCCTCTAGAGCTCGGATAAATGAAAACTATTTCAATTATCCG). The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the protein expression vector pET28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) at EcoRI and SacI sites. The expressed peptide contains 36 amino acids from the vector including the histidine tag at the N terminus. Protein expression and inclusion body purification were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified inclusion bodies were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the partialSfCPA-FAS protein band was excised and stored at −20 °C. Frozen gel slices of partial SfCPA-FAS were sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA), for antibody preparation in New Zealand White rabbits. Plant tissue (1 g) was homogenized with a mortar and pestle in extraction buffer (5 ml) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and filtered through two layers of Miracloth into centrifuge tubes on ice. Protein was quantitated using a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total protein extracts from transgenic tobacco cell line expressing SfCPA-FAS and developing seeds ofS. foetida were centrifuged at 30,000 × gfor 35 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer. SfCPA-FAS-enriched membranes (pellet) from tobacco suspension cells were resuspended to 2 mg of protein ml−1 in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmγ-amino-n-caproic acid, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm EDTA. Resuspended membranes were washed by 0.5 m NaCl or 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Samples were then vortexed for 30 s and incubated on ice for 10 min. Washed membranes were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 ×g), and supernatant was removed and placed into a fresh tube. Protein samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto 10% SDS gel for electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with antibodies against SfCPA-FAS (1:1000 dilution), and detected as described previously by Thelenet al. (23Thelen J.J. Mekhedov S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2016-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transgenic tobacco suspension cells expressingSfCPA-FAS (0.5 g) were harvested and homogenized with a Potter homogenizer in 50 ml of homogenization buffer (30 mmTES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.35 m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 14 mml-cysteine, 0.6% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) and filtered through two layers of Miracloth into a polycarbonate centrifuge tube on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Organelles were enriched by rate-zonal sedimentation using a procedure adapted from previous protocols (24Elhussein S.A. Miernyk J.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Hayes M.K. Luethy M.H. Elthon T.E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plastids were sedimented by centrifuging the homogenate at 5,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was decanted into a fresh tube and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to sediment intact mitochondria. The 20,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to collect low density membrane particles. The final 100,000 × g supernatant was concentrated on an ultrafiltration membrane (5,000 molecular weight cut-off). Sedimented organelles were gently resuspended in ice-cold resuspension buffer (20 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.3m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and protein was quantified. Purity of organelle fractions was determined by immunoblot analyses using antibodies against plastid and mitochondrion marker proteins. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE under standard conditions and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for antibody probing. Anti-biotin polyclonal antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) detected the biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of the plastid heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (23Thelen J.J. Mekhedov S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2016-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and were therefore used to determine plastid enrichment. Monoclonal antibodies to the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase α-subunit (26Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used to assay mitochondria enrichment. The tobacco cell line expressing SfCPA-FAS was maintained in liquid medium and subcultured as described previously (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After 3 days of subculture, 20 μCi ofl-[methyl-14C]methionine was added to 100 ml of the cell culture followed by continuous growth under the same conditions. At 5-min intervals, 15 ml of cell culture was removed, and cells were harvested by brief centrifugation. Lipids were extracted from cell pellets according to Bligh and Dyer (27Blight E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). Lipids were transmethylated by vortexing at room temperature for 3 min with 0.5% sodium methoxide in methanol:heptane (1:1, v/v). Lipid classes were separated with K6 TLC using two development systems, the first to 12 cm in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (85:15:5:2), drying the plate completely and then followed by second development to the top with hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1). Radioactivity was quantified using an Instant-Imager. PC from each time point was recovered from the TLC plate for positional analysis. To determine the distribution of dihydrosterculic acid (DHSA) on PC, purified PC was subjected to phospholipase A2 treatment as described by Christie (28Christie W.W. Christie W.W. 2nd Ed. Lipid Analysis. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1982: 155-166Google Scholar). Free fatty acids and lyso-PC were separated by TLC using two different mobile phases. The first development was in full in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:2). Free fatty acids were located by spraying with 0.2% (w/v) 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein in ethanol and viewing under UV light. After completely drying the plate, it was developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:4) to immediately below the free fatty acid bands. The distribution of radioactivity between free fatty acids and lyso-PC was quantified using an Instant-Imager. The radioactive lyso-PC of each time point was recovered, and FAMEs were prepare as described before; the FAMEs were separated with C18 reverse-phase TLC developed in acetonitrile:methanol:water (75:25:0.5) and quantified with an Instant-Imager. In a separate experiment, after the PC from tobacco cells expressing SfCPA-FAS and S. foetidadeveloping seeds were treated with phospholipase A2, FAMEs were prepared from both free fatty acids (from sn-2 of PC) and lyso-PC (from sn-1 of PC), and followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph MSD 5972 mass analyzer. The 30,000 × g membrane-enriched pellets from tobacco cells expressing SfCPA-FAS and control containing only empty vector pE1776 were used for CPA-FA synthase assays. The membrane-enriched pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.0, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After protein concentrations were determined, defatted bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). CPA-FA synthase assays were performed at 30 °C, 0.05 mmS-adenosyl[methyl-14C]methionine substrate and with or without 0.05 mm oleoyl-CoA in a total volume of 0.2 ml. The assay was terminated by either lipid extraction or the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% (w/v) KOH and 1.0 ml of ethanol and allowed to stand overnight to saponify lipids completely. The subsequent lipid and fatty acid analyses were performed as described in the in vivo labeling experiments. All assays are the average of three samples. To determine the level and pattern ofSfCPA-FAS expression, total proteins were extracted fromS. foetida leaves, developing seeds, and transgenic tobacco cells expressing SfCPA-FAS. SfCPA-FAS is highly expressed in S. foetida developing seeds but not detected in leaves (Fig. 1A). In tobacco suspension cells, SfCPA-FAS was detected in cell lines expressing SfCPA-FAS cDNA under a constitutive promoter (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but not in a control line carrying an empty vector. Based on immunoblot analysis, the expression level of SfCPA-FAS in tobacco cells was estimated at less than one-tenth that found inS. foetida developing seeds. SfCPA-FAS is an enzyme of 864 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 98 kDa. Analysis of SfCPA-FAS amino acid sequence does not reveal any predicted trans-membrane domain; however, this polypeptide appeared to be associated with membranes (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To characterize further the enzyme localization, protein extracts from cells expressing SfCPA-FAS and developing seeds were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 35 min. The supernatants contained most of the soluble proteins, and pellets were primarily composed of insoluble membrane proteins. SfCPA-FAS was found almost exclusively in the insoluble pellet from both tobacco suspension cells and S. foetida developing seeds (Fig.1B). Thus SfCPA-FAS is a membrane-associated protein in both its native system and after transgenic expression. To determine the nature of the membrane association, the enriched membrane pellets were washed with 0.5 m NaCl. After the salt treatment, the majority of SfCPA-FAS remained in the insoluble membrane fraction indicating that the protein was not likely associated by electrostatic bonds (Fig. 1C). In contrast when Triton X-100 was added to the pellet to a final concentration of 0.1%, the SfCPA-FAS was completely released from the membrane pellet (Fig. 1C). These results indicate thatSfCPA-FAS is either an integral membrane protein or it is strongly associated with membranes by non-electrostatic interactions. To clarify the subcellular location of the cyclopropane synthase, organelle fractionation was performed with tobacco suspension cells expressingSfCPA-FAS. The filtered homogenate was first centrifuged at 5000 × g for 2 min to sediment intact plastids. The biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit of the heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase is located exclusively in plastids, and therefore, an anti-biotin antibody was used to determine the enrichment of plastids (23Thelen J.J. Mekhedov S. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2016-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, the majority of biotin carboxyl carrier protein was found in the 5,000 × g pellet (Fig.2). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to sediment intact mitochondria, and this was confirmed with monoclonal antibodies against the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase α-subunit (26Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The 20,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to collect low density membrane particles derived from microsomes. The SfCPA-FAS was greatly enriched in this fraction (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate thatSfCPA-FAS is a microsomal localized enzyme and suggested that CPA-FAs are synthesized outside of plastids. In previous in vitro labeling experiments with cell-free extracts of S. foetida developing seeds, most [14C]dihydrosterculate was found on PC suggesting that oleoyl-PC might be a substrate for SfCPA-FAS in vivo (1Bao X. Katz S. Pollard M. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tobacco suspension cells expressing SfCPA-FAS provide a more tractable system to conduct tracer labeling studies because the system is available year round, precursors can rapidly enter the cells, and the tissue is uniform and constant throughout the labeling period. To examine further whether PC serves as a direct substrate for SfCPA-FAS in vivo, suspension cells were labeled withl-[methyl-14C]methionine under normal growth conditions. Samples were removed at 3-min intervals from 3 to 24 min, and total lipids from each time point were divided in half. Half of the sample was used to prepare FAMEs, and the other half was used to isolate PC (Fig.3A, 9-min time point). FAMEs from both PC and total lipid at each time point were fractionated in parallel by C18 reversed-phase TLC. As shown in Fig.3B (9-min time point), DHSA was the only radioactive fatty acid esterified to PC, whereas FAME samples from total lipids revealed other radioactive bands (most likely sterols) in addition to DHSA. The percentage of DHSA found in PC versus that from total lipids was calculated and plotted versus assay time (Fig.3C). At early time points (3 and 6 min), ∼99% of DHSA was esterified to PC. At later times some labeled DHSA appeared in other lipids, but the amount in PC stabilized at approximate 85% after 20 min of labeling. This kinetics of appearance of DHSA strongly suggests that PC is a direct substrate for SfCPA-FAS (Fig.3C). Assays were standardized by incubating a range of protein concentrations (from 30,000 × g pellet of tobacco cells expressingSfCPA-FAS) with 0.05 mmS-adenosyl[methyl-14C]methionine and 0.05 mm oleoyl-CoA at 30 °C for 1 h. Radioactive DHSA product increased approximately linearly with proteins up to 1 mg/ml (Fig. 4A), whereas higher protein concentrations saturated the assays under the conditions used. As shown in Fig. 4B, after a 10–20-min lag, DHSA product accumulated linearly for at least 105 min at a rate of 0.34 μmol/h/mg protein. Based on these experiments, subsequent in vitro assays were conducted with 100 μg of protein from the 30,000 × g pellet at 30 °C for 1 h, unless otherwise specified. To further confirm PC as a direct substrate for SfCPA-FAS by an alternative method, in vitro assays were performed with the 30,000 × g pellet usingS-adenosyl[methyl-14C]methionine as the methylene donor. Upon the termination of the reaction, the samples were split equally between two tubes. The reaction in one tube was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 10% KOH and 1 ml of ethanol. After saponification, fatty acids were extracted and FAMEs were prepared. In the other tube, the reaction was stopped by lipid extraction, and lipid classes were separated by TLC (Fig. 5,top panel). PC and other radioactive lipid bands were recovered and used for FAME preparation. Along with the FAMEs from the other half of the reaction, FAMEs from PC and other radioactive bands were separated by C18 reverse-phase TLC (Fig. 5,bottom panel). As shown in Fig. 5, DHSA was only detected in PC and not in any other lipid. In addition, the amount of radioactive DHSA in PC was approximately the same as that found in the total FAMEs prepared through KOH saponification. This result was consistent within vivo labeling and further supports the hypothesis that PC is a direct substrate of SfCPA-FAS. We also considered 18:1-CoA as a potential substrate forSfCPA-FAS. To test this possibility, the 30,000 ×g pellet was washed three times with assay buffer to remove acyl-CoAs and then assayed with or without 50 μmoleoyl-CoA. Proteins from control cells (transformed with empty vector) did not possess any cyclopropane synthase activity with no DHSA synthesized as shown in the control lane (Fig.6A). In contrast, DHSA was produced by the 30,000 × g pellet from tobacco cells expressing SfCPA-FAS (Fig. 6A). However, the biosynthesis of DHSA from assays with oleoyl-CoA and that without oleoyl-CoA was almost identical based on three independent experiments (Fig. 6B), indicating that the addition of exogenous oleoyl-CoA had no effect on the activity of SfCPA-FAS; therefore, oleoyl-CoA is not likely a substrate ofSfCPA-FAS. Although Figs. 3 and 5 indicate that PC is the direct substrate for SfCPA-FAS, the modification could take place on oleic acid esterified to the sn-1, sn-2, or both positions. To clarify further the reaction mechanism, in vivo labeling was conducted with tobacco suspension cells withSfCPA-FAS usingl-[methyl-14C]methionine as radioactive tracer. Samples were taken at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min, and PC was purified and treated with position-specific phospholipase A2 to cleave the fatty acids at the sn-2 positions. The resultant free fatty acids and lyso-PC were separated by TLC. As shown in Fig. 7A, top panel, radioactivity was only associated with lyso-PC, whereas no radioactivity could be detected in the free fatty acid fraction released from sn-2. Because the head group of lyso-PC can also be labeled byl-[methyl-14C]methionine, FAMEs were prepared from the labeled lyso-PCs and fractionated by C18 reverse-phase TLC. Only one radioactive spot corresponding to DHSA could be found on the reverse TLC (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). Radioactivity from total lipids, PC, lyso-PC, and DHSA were plotted versus labeling time (Fig. 7B). The accumulation of radioactivity in total lipids increased linearly during the 25-min labeling period; however, there was a 10-min lag for the accumulation of radioactivity in PC, lyso-PC, and DHSA. As shown in Fig. 7, the in vivo experiment suggested that, in contrast to most acyl modification reactions of PC in plan"

Substitution of Arg440 in IL5 with other residues except positively charged Lys caused a large shift in pHi dependence of22Na+ uptake to an acidic side, whereas substitution of Gly455 or Gly456 within the highly conserved glycine-rich sequence of TM11 shifted pHi dependence to an alkaline side. The observed alkaline shift was larger with substitution of Gly455 with residues with increasing sizes, suggesting the involvement of the steric effect. Interestingly, mutation of Arg440 (R440D) abolished the ATP depletion-induced acidic shift in pHi dependence of22Na+ uptake as well as the cytoplasmic alkalinization induced by various extracellular stimuli, whereas with that of Gly455 (G455Q) these functions were preserved. These mutant exchangers did not alter apparent affinities for extracellular transport substrates Na+ and H+and the inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride.

The activity of ubiquitous exchanger isoform NHE1 is controlled by various extrinsic factors including hormones, growth factors, pharmacological agents, and mechanical stimuli (1Wakabayashi S.

These stimuli have been shown to enhance NHE1 activity by shifting its intracellular pH (pHi) dependence to an alkaline side. This phenomenon is usually explained by assuming that there exists an allosteric regulatory site for intracellular protons in NHE1 that is distinct from the Na+ or H+ transport site and that external stimuli increase the affinity of such H+ modifier site (Ref. 5Aronson P, S.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 213-224Google Scholar). However, the interrelationship of these signaling molecules and the mechanism by which they modulate the interaction of the putative H+modifier site with intracellular protons is still unclear. The NHE family members have similar overall structures, consisting of an N-terminal transmembrane domain (∼500 amino acids) containing 12 membrane spanning segments and a C-terminal cytoplasmic regulatory domain (∼300 amino acids) (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Google Scholar, 2Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Google Scholar, 3Counillon L. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Google Scholar). We previously showed that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 greatly shifted the pHi dependence of exchange to an acidic side, with the steep pHi dependence of exchange being maintained (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have presented evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 contains several subdomains, which increase or decrease the pHisensitivity (19Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 295-303Google Scholar). These data may be consistent with the idea that the putative H+ modifier site exists within the N-terminal transmembrane domain and that the cytoplasmic domain regulates the accessibility of regulatory protons to the site. However, the structural basis for such an idea is largely unknown. Based on the accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to sulfhydryl reagents, we have recently presented a new membrane topology model of NHE1 in which the exchanger consists of 12 transmembrane segments with N- and C-tails located in the cytosol (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar), although a previous study reported the N-tail to be cleaved as a signal peptide during the exchanger biogenesis (21Miyazaki E. Sakaguchi M. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49221-49227Google Scholar). In a subsequent cysteine-scanning mutagenesis study, we found that mutation of Tyr454 or Arg458 in a new transmembrane domain 11 (TM11) impaired the plasma membrane expression of NHE1 (22Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 257-261Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of these residues for proper folding of NHE1. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments suggested that some residues in TM11 regulate pHisensitivity. In addition, it was noted that TM11 contains a phylogenetically conserved Gly-rich segment (see Fig. 1B). These findings prompted us to study the functions of amino acid residues within TM11 and adjacent intracellular (IL5) and extracellular loops (EL6). In this study, we found that mutation of Arg440 within IL5 decreases the pHi sensitivity, whereas mutation of Gly residues within the Gly-rich segment of TM11 increases it, suggesting that the region encompassing IL5 and TM11 is critical for the regulatory function of NHE1. This is the first identification of important residues involved in pHi sensing within the transmembrane domain of NHE1. Biotin maleimide was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. MTSET and streptavidin-conjugated agarose were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. and Pierce, respectively. Amiloride derivative 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) was a gift from the New Drug Research Laboratories of Kanebo, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 22NaCl was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. An NHE1-specific polyclonal antibody (RP-cd) was raised as described previously (8Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouysségur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. An Na+/H+ exchanger-deficient cell line (PS120) (23Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Google Scholar) and corresponding transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco' s modified Eagle' s medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mmNaHCO3 and supplemented with 7.57 (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 ॖg/ml). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 57 CO2. PS120 cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with each plasmid construct (20 ॖg) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. Cell populations that stably express mutant NHE1 were selected by the 舠H+ killing舡 procedure as described (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). A plasmid carrying cDNA coding for the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 human isoform) containing some unique restriction sites cloned into mammalian expression vector pECE was described previously (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). A cDNA construct for Cys-less NHE1 devoid of all endogenous cysteine residues was also described previously (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). For construction of point mutant cDNAs, we used a PCR-based strategy as described previously (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar), using two template plasmids coding for the wild-type or Cys-less NHE1. Briefly, using synthesized sense and antisense primers containing appropriate mutations, DNA fragments were generated by PCR. These fragments were digested and inserted into appropriate sites on the wild-type or Cys-less NHE1 plasmid. The DNA sequences of the PCR fragments were confirmed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 373S autosequencer. We used the prefix 舠cl-舡 for point mutants produced from Cys-less NHE1 as a template. Biotin maleimide labeling of NHE1 mutant molecules was carried out as described previously (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells cultured on 60-mm dishes were washed twice with 5 ml of PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.2) and then incubated in 1 ml of PBSCM containing 0 or 5 mm MTSET for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBSCM and then incubated in 1 ml of PBSCM containing 0.5 mm biotin maleimide (100 mm stock in Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with PBSCM containing 17 2-mercaptoethanol, once with PBSCM, and then collected in the tube by centrifugation. The cells were solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 17 Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mmphosphate-buffered saline, and 1 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-agarose beads (30 ॖl of resin), followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with mild agitation. The agarose beads were washed more than five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, mixed with 50 ॖl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 37 SDS, and then boiled for 10 min at 100 °C. The proteins were separated on an 8.57 gel by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the NHE1 antibody as described previously (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). The blots were developed with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). When indicated, the cells were permeabilized with digitonin (50 ॖg/ml) or streptolysine O (Sigma) immediately before biotinylation, as described previously (20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). 22Na+ uptake activity and its pHi dependence were measured by the K+/nigericin pHi clamp method (19Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 295-303Google Scholar). Serum-depleted cells in 24-well dishes were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Na+-free choline chloride/KCl medium containing 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 1.2–140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 5 ॖm nigericin. In some experiments (see Fig. 6), the preincubation solution contained 2 ॖg/ml oligomycin and 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose instead of glucose.22Na+ uptake was started by adding the same choline chloride/KCl solution containing 22NaCl (37 kBq/ml) (final concentration, 1 mm), 1 mm ouabain, and 100 ॖm bumetanide. In some wells, the uptake solution contained 0.1 mm EIPA. After 1 min, the cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to terminate22Na+ uptake. pHi was calculated from the imposed [K+] gradient by assuming the equilibrium [K+]i/[K+]o = [H+]i/[H+]o and an intracellular [K+] of 120 mm. The data were normalized as to protein concentration, which was measured by bicinchoninic assay system (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The changes in pHi induced by various extracellular agents were measured by the [14C]benzoic acid equilibration method, as described previously (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar). The data for the pH dependence of22Na+ uptake were simulated by fitting the values to the sigmoidal dose-response equation, the rate of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ uptake =Vmax/(1 + 10^(log(pK − pHi)n)) (Vmax, the maximal rate of 22Na+ uptake; pK, pHi giving half-maximal 22Na+ uptake; n, Hill coefficient), with the aid of a simulation program included in the graphing software Graphpad Prizm (Microsoft Corp.). The concentration dependences of extracellular Na+, pH, and EIPA for 22Na+ uptake were also fitted to steady-state kinetic equations with the aid of the same simulation program. Kinetic parameters are expressed as the best fitted values with standard errors, whereas other data are expressed as the means ± S.D. for at least three determinations. Based on the results of cysteine accessibility analysis, we previously presented a novel topology model of NHE1, as shown in Fig. 1A(20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). Here, to obtain more precise topological information of the regions surrounding TM11, we introduced single Cys residues into these regions of Cys-less NHE1 and expressed mutants in the exchanger-deficient cells PS120. All of the mutant exchangers except cl-K438C, cl-R440C, cl-I451C, cl-G456C, and cl-R458C were well expressed in PS120 cells (Fig.2A; also see Fig. 7 of Ref.20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE, we observed two forms of exchanger protein with high (∼110 kDa) and low (∼90 kDa) molecular masses, which are thought to be a mature protein with N- andO-linked glycosylation and an immature protein containing only N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide, respectively (24Counillon L. Pouysségur J. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with 0.5 mm biotin maleimide after preincubation with or without a membrane-impermeable MTSET, and biotinylated proteins were subsequently recovered with streptavidin-agarose, followed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-NHE1 to visualize biotinylated exchangers (Fig. 2B). Mutant exchangers cl-L468C, cl-L469C, cl-D470C, cl-K471C, cl-K472C, cl-H473C, cl-F474C, cl-P475C, and cl-M476C with high molecular mass were efficiently labeled with biotin maleimide (Fig. 2B; not shown for cl-K471C, but see Ref. 20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). cl-E151C, used as a positive control, was also labeled, whereas Cys-less NHE1 was not (data not shown; see Ref. 20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). The biotinylation of mutant exchangers was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with membrane-impermeable MTSET (Fig. 2B), suggesting that these residues face the outside. On the other hand, cl-G466C, cl-D478C, and Cys477* (native cysteine) were not labeled with biotin maleimide, and cl-Y467C was only faintly labeled (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cl-N437C, cl-I441C, cl-V442C, cl-K443C, cl-K447C, and cl-D448C were labeled with biotin maleimide only when the cells were permeabilized with digitonin (Fig.2C; data not shown for some mutants) or streptolysine O (see Ref. 20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar), suggesting that these positions face the inside. Some Cys mutants, i.e. cl-F439C, cl-L444C cl-T445C, cl-P446C, and cl-Q449C, were only faintly labeled even when cells were permeabilized with digitonin (Fig. 2C; data not shown for cl-T445C and cl-P446C). We found that introduced cysteines at Phe450, Ile452, Ala453, Tyr454, Gly455, Leu457, Gly459, Ala460, Ile461, Ala462, Phe463, Ser464, and Leu465 were not labeled with biotin maleimide in either intact or permeabilized cells (data not shown; see Ref. 20Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose that: (i) the putative TM11 consists of 18 residues from Gln449to Tyr467, (ii) the putative TM12 starts from Cys477, (iii) the region from Leu468 to Met476 forms the extracellular loop (EL6), (iv) the region from Asn437 to Asp448 forms part of the intracellular loop (IL5), and (v) some residues in IL5 may not be completely exposed to the cytosol. These topological data would be useful for the functional study of the exchanger in which residues in TM11 and its surrounding regions are mutated (see below). We introduced single Cys residues into the region covering most of IL5 and TM11 in the wild-type NHE1. In the wild-type background, R440C was well expressed in PS120 cells, but K438C, I451C, Y454C, and R458C were not. All Cys mutants expressed well in cells exhibited high EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ uptake activity when cells were acidified. We found that substitution of Arg440 with Cys greatly shifted the pHi dependence of 22Na+ uptake to an acidic side with the pK of less than 6.2 (Fig.3A). We could not determine the precise pK value for this mutant because of incomplete attainment of the maximal activity. On the other hand, mutations at other neighboring residues in IL5 did not significantly affect the pHi dependence (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, unlike the Arg440 mutation, mutations of Gly455 and Gly456 in TM11 significantly shifted the pHidependence of 22Na+ uptake to an alkaline side, respectively (Fig. 3C). The pK values increased by ∼0.3 pH units with these mutations. When these experiments were repeated more than three times, the pK values of mutant exchangers other than R440C, G455C, and G456C were in the range of 6.5–6.8, which is not very different from that of the wild-type NHE1 (Fig. 3D). Thus, we identified Arg440 in IL5 and Gly455/Gly456 in TM11 as residues greatly influencing the pHi sensitivity of NHE1. We substituted Arg440 and Gly455 with other residues and analyzed the functional consequences of these mutations. Fig. 4 shows the pHi dependence of 22Na+ uptake in cells expressing R440D or R440K. Amino acid substitution of Arg440 with Asp greatly shifted the pHi dependence to an acidic side. In theinset to Fig. 4, we present the ratios between the uptake activities of various substitution mutants of Arg440 at pHi 6.8 and 5.4, in place of the respective pHidependences. The ratio decreased significantly when Arg440was substituted with Lys, His, Asp, Glu, or Leu, indicating the acidic shift in the pHi dependence. It is notable that the effect of the Arg440 to Lys substitution on the pHidependence was modest (pK = ∼6.4) compared with the substitution with other residues (Fig. 4). Thus, the positive charge of Arg440 appears to be important for the normal pHi sensitivity. Fig. 5 (A and B) shows the results of amino acid substitution at Gly455. Substitution of Gly455 to Gln, Thr, or Val significantly shifted the pHi dependence of 22Na+uptake to an alkaline side, whereas substitution to Ala, Asp, Asn, or Ser did not shift or only modestly shifted. We plotted the pK values against the surface area or volume of substituted amino acid side chains. The data suggest that the pK increases when Gly455 is substituted with bulky residues (Fig.5C). We analyzed several other kinetic parameters of Na+/H+ exchange in cells expressing R440D and G455Q that exhibited acidic and alkaline pHi dependence of 22Na+ uptake, respectively. Fig. 6 (A–C) shows the extracellular Na+ concentration dependence of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ uptake. TheKm values for Na+ estimated from double reciprocal plots (Fig. 6, A–C, insets) were similar for the wild-type NHE1 (9.22 ± 1.04 mm), R440D (9.30 ± 0.90 mm), and G455Q (14.08 ± 1.75 mm). The dependences of 22Na+uptake on extracellular pH (pHo) and on the EIPA concentration were also similar for the wild-type NHE1, R440D, and G455Q (pK for pHo, 7.29 ± 0.03, 7.50 ± 0.08, and 7.38 ± 0.02; IC50 for EIPA, 106.3 ± 7.3, 91.2 ± 0.1, and 85.0 ± 8.0 nm, respectively). The data suggest that mutations of Arg440and Gly455 only affect the pHi dependence of exchange. Cellular ATP depletion is known to inhibit the exchange activity by reducing the pHisensitivity and/or maximal activity (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar, 25Cassel D. Katz M. Rotman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5460-5466Google Scholar, 26Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Google Scholar, 27Yun C.H.C. Tsé C.M. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10723-10727Google Scholar, 28Goss G.G. Woodside M. Wakabayashi S. Pouysségur J. Waddell T. Downey G.P. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8741-8748Google Scholar). Fig.7 (A and B) shows the effect of ATP depletion on the pHi dependence of22Na+ uptake in cells expressing R440D or G455Q. Interestingly, ATP depletion did not change the pHisensitivity in cells expressing R440D (Fig. 7A), although it caused ∼507 reduction of Vmax (data not shown). In contrast, ATP depletion greatly shifted the pHidependence of cells expressing G455Q to an acidic side without a change in Vmax. However, it is notable that even under ATP depletion G455Q exhibited more alkaline pHi dependence of22Na+ uptake (pK, ∼6.4) compared with the wild type (pK, ∼6.0). Finally, we measured the changes in pHi caused by various extracellular stimuli. In cells expressing the wild-type NHE1 and G455Q, we detected cytoplasmic alkalinization induced by thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor BB, hyperosmotic stress (sucrose), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lysophosphatidic acid, and the recently described activator Li+ (29Kobayashi Y. Pang T. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 455-462Google Scholar), indicating that all of these stimuli are capable of activating exchangers (Fig.8). Of note, the extent of cytoplasmic alkalinization caused by hyperosmotic stress or Li+ was reduced in cells expressing G455Q. In contrast, such alkalinization by extracellular stimuli was not observed in cells expressing R440D. Lack of alkalinization was presumably due to the acidic shift of the pHi dependence of activity of R440D. In this study, after obtaining precise information on the topology of the portion of NHE1 encompassing TM11 and its surrounding regions, we performed scanning mutagenesis analysis of these regions to search for residues possibly involved in the regulation of pHidependence of Na+/H+ exchange. We found that mutation at Arg440 of IL5 of NHE1 greatly shifted pHi dependence of EIPA-sensitive 22Na+uptake to an acidic side, whereas mutation at Gly455 or Gly456 of TM11 shifted it to an alkaline side. Mutation of many other residues in IL5 and TM11, in which it did not impair exchanger expression in the plasma membrane, did not alter the pHi dependence. Furthermore, these arginine and glycine mutations did not alter the apparent affinities of NHE1 for external transport substrates Na+ and H+ and the inhibitor EIPA. We observed similar opposite shifts of the pHi dependence with these NHE1 mutants when we measured the reverse mode of Na+/H+ exchange,i.e. EIPA-sensitive 22Na+ efflux from 22Na-loaded cells, 2S. Wakabayashi, unpublished observations. supporting the possibility that the mutations alter the interaction of intracellular protons with the H+ modifier site rather than the transport site. It thus appears likely that these single mutations exert rather specific effects on the pHi sensor of NHE1. In addition to the effect on pHi dependence of basal Na+/H+ exchange, mutation of Arg440abolished the ATP depletion-induced acidic shift of pHidependence of exchange activity as well as the cytoplasmic alkalinization in response to various extracellular stimuli. We previously reported (18Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Google Scholar) that deletion of the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 causes a large acidic shift of pHidependence of basal exchange activity and the disappearance of growth factor-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization. The same deletion was also found to abolish the ATP depletion-induced acidic shift of pHidependence of exchange activity. We subsequently provided evidence that these effects occur because of deletion of the N-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of NHE1 named subdomain I (amino acids 503–600) (19Ikeda T. Schmitt B. Pouysségur J. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 295-303Google Scholar). Thus, the effects caused by deletion of subdomain I and single mutation of Arg440, which is localized in the internal loop (IL5) connecting TMs 10 and 11, are very similar except that in the latter the Vmax of exchange activity is somewhat reduced by ATP depletion. Recently, we have reported that the calcineurin B homologous protein CHP is an essential co-factor for the expression of high physiological levels of exchange activity in many plasma membrane NHE isoforms (6Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Google Scholar). We showed that CHP is tightly bound to a short juxtamembrane segment of the exchanger (amino acids 510–530 of subdomain I in the case of NHE1) (6Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to the large reduction of Vmax, CHP binding-defective NHE1 mutants exhibited a marked shift of the pHi dependence to an acidic side. 3T. Pang, unpublished observation. Thus, the mutation at Arg440, deletion of subdomain I, and the CHP binding-defective mutation all caused the same effect, i.e.a marked shift of the pHi dependence to the acidic side, suggesting that the region of IL5 containing Arg440 and the CHP-subdomain I complex are both involved in the preservation of physiological pHi sensitivity of the exchanger. In this study, we observed that pHi dependence of exchange activity did not change extensively by substitution of Arg440 with similarly charged but somewhat more bulky Lys residue, unlike substitutions with other residues (Cys, His, Asp, Glu, and Leu). This suggests that the positive charge of Arg440 is important. An attractive hypothesis would be that Arg440 interacts with negatively charged residue(s) localized in the CHP-subdomain I complex and that its substitution with other residues or cell ATP depletion results in the disruption of such interaction, thereby altering pHisensitivity of the exchanger. Consistent with this hypothesis, there is a cluster of acidic amino acid residues on the side opposite to one where CHP binds to NHE1 in a predicted model of CHP structure.2 As opposed to the mutation of Arg440 in IL5, mutation of Gly455 or Gly456 in the glycine-rich region within TM11 shifted the pHi dependence of basal exchange activity to an alkaline side. Furthermore, in the Gly455mutant, ATP depletion was able to induce a large acidic shift of the pHi dependence without a change in Vmax, a pattern mimicking that of the wild-type NHE1, although the pHi dependence itself was shifted to the alkaline side under these conditions (Fig. 7B). In the same mutant, we observed normal cytoplasmic alkalinization in response to growth factors (Fig.8). Thus, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of these Gly mutations and that of the Arg440 mutation in IL5 are likely to be different. The glycine-rich region in TM11 of NHE1 is remarkably conserved in different types of NHEs from bacteria to mammals (Fig. 1B), suggesting its importance for the NHE function. Glycine has been suggested to serve as a molecular hinge permitting the occurrence of conformational changes of intramembrane helices in some proteins (30Youxing J. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar,31Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar) or as a notch for orienting multiple helices at the point of closest packing between membrane helices in several polytopic membrane proteins (32Javadpour M.M. Eilers M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1609-1618Google Scholar). In this study, we observed a clear tendency showing that substitution of Gly455 with more bulky residues are more effective in causing an alkaline shift of pHi dependence of exchange activity (Fig. 5C), which indicates that small residues are required at the position of Gly455 for normal pHi sensitivity. This appears to be in line with the fact that some isoforms such as NHEs 4, 6, 7, and 8 have small residues such as alanine and serine at this position (Fig. 1B). We previously found that single cysteine substitutions at Tyr454 and Arg458, both being close to Gly455 or Gly456 in TM11, cause the retention of NHE1 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 257-261Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutations impair proper protein folding. On the other hand, mutation of Gly455 neither prevented the plasma membrane expression of NHE1 protein nor appeared to alter other transport functions of the exchanger significantly. Based on all these pieces of information, we speculate that a relatively mild change in helix packing interaction of TM 11 with other transmembrane helice(s) was induced by the mutation at Gly455 or Gly456, which indirectly modified the conformation and function of the putative H+-regulatory site(s). It is noteworthy that in Escherichia coliantiporter NhaA distantly related to mammalian NHEs, mutation of Gly338 in the glycine-rich region of TM11 was reported to render the antiporter active in the wide range of pH, i.e.practically independent of the pH level between pH 6 and 9 (33Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Google Scholar). Although the present and previous results suggest important roles of IL5, TM11, and the subdomain I-CHP complex in the modulation of pHi sensing in NHE1, little is known about structures of the ion transport sites and the putative pH sensor and their interaction. In our previous study of membrane topology of NHE1, we found re-entrant loop-like structures between TMs 4 and 5, between TMs 8 and 9, and between TMs 9 and 10 (20). In addition, both TM4 and TM9 have been shown to be important for the interaction of NHE1 with amiloride analogue inhibitors that compete with the transport substrate Na+ (34Wang D. Balkovetz D.F.

Furthermore, other studies identified a few polar amino acid residues required for ion exchange within transmembrane segments in the mammalian NHE1 (38Khadilkar A. Iannuzzi P. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43792-43800Google Scholar, 39Fafournoux P. Noel J. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Google Scholar) as well as in the Na+/H+ antiporters from E. coli (40Noumi T.

Much further study is required for the elucidation of the structural aspect of Na+/H+ exchange. In summary, we have presented evidence that Arg440 in IL5 and Gly455 or Gly456 in TM11 are important residues that oppositely regulate the pHi sensitivity of NHE1. This is the first identification of critical residues involved in pHi sensing within the N-terminal transmembrane domain of NHE1."

Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). GPCR promotes GDP dissociation from Gα. GDP dissociation is the rate-limiting step of the G-protein cycle. Agonist-occupied GPCR then forms a ternary complex with guanine nucleotide-free G-protein. Thereafter, GPCR catalyzes GTP binding to Gα. GαGTPdissociates from GPCR, thereby disrupting the ternary complex. In addition, GαGTP and βγ dissociate from each other, and both GαGTP and βγ regulate the activity of effector systems. G-proteins are deactivated by the GTPase of Gα that cleaves GTP into GDP and Pi. The GTP hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs GTPγS and GppNHp (Fig. 1) induce persistent G-protein activation as does AlF4−, the latter mimicking the transition state of GTP hydrolysis as GDP-AlF4− complex (1Gilman A.G.

Nucleotides substituted with a MANT group at the 2′(3′)-O-position of the ribosyl residue are fluorescent and widely used for the kinetic analysis of enzymes and signaling proteins (7Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, only few studies with MANT-nucleotides and G-proteins have been conducted so far, and the data are controversial. MANT-GTPγS and MANT-GppNHp (Fig. 1) bind to purified Go-proteins with higher affinity than to Gi-proteins, and the MANT group does not have an effect on the affinity of GTPγS for purified Gαi1 (8Remmers A.E.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The maximum fluorescence of Gi/Go-proteins induced by MANT-GTPγS is higher than the maximum fluorescence induced by MANT-GppNHp, suggesting that the two nucleotides stabilize different conformations in G-proteins (8Remmers A.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4791-4797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to the observations made with Gi/Go-proteins, the MANT group substantially reduces the affinity of GTP for the retinal G-protein transducin, and MANT-GTP is ineffective at activating the effector of transducin, cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase (11Zera E.M.

To the best of our knowledge, the effects of MANT-nucleotides on Gs-proteins have not yet been studied. The goal of our study was to learn more about the functional effects of MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp on Gs- and Gi-protein-mediated signaling. As models we used fusion proteins and co-expression systems of the β2AR with the Gαs-proteins, GαsL, GαsS, or Gαolf (12Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J.

As physiologically relevant systems, we studied S49 wt lymphoma cell membranes, a standard model for the analysis of Gαs-proteins (17Ransnäs L.A. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, we found that MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp constitute a novel class of potent competitive AC inhibitors. Initially, MANT-GTPγS, MANT-GppNHp, and MANT-GTP were provided by Drs. R. Sportsman and M. Helms (LJL Biosystems Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) who obtained the compounds as custom synthesis products from Marker Gene Technologies (Eugene, OR). Later, MANT-GppNHp and MANT-GTP were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). In the last phase of the project, MANT-GTPγS and MANT-GppNHp were obtained from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). 2′-Deoxy-3′-MANT-GppNHp was also from Jena Bioscience. Nucleotides obtained from various batches of the different suppliers gave very consistent results. Stock solutions of MANT-nucleotides (0.5–1 mm) were stored at −20 °C for periods up to 2 years (longer times were not studied) without loss of potency and efficacy. FMLP, (−)-isoproterenol, salbutamol, NaF, AlCl3, MnCl2, forskolin, and cholera toxin were from Sigma. GTP, GTPγS, GppNHp, GDPβS, ATP (special quality <0.01% (w/w) GTP as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography), and AMPPNP were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding GαsS and Gαi2 were kindly provided by Drs. A. G. Gilman and R. Sunahara (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Recombinant baculovirus encoding the β1γ2 complex was donated Dr. P. Gierschik (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm, Germany). S49 wt and S49cyc− lymphoma cells were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility of the University of California, San Francisco. The construction of baculoviruses encoding β2AR-Gαs- and FPR-Gαi fusion proteins, β2AR, and FPR have been described elsewhere (12Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J.

[3H]Dihydroalprenolol (85–90 Ci/mmol), [3H]FMLP (56 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]GTP (6,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of the highest purity available and obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Sf9 cells were cultured and infected with 1:100 dilutions of high titer virus stocks as described (22Houston C. Wenzel-Seifert K. Bürckstümmer T. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 678-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sf9 membranes were prepared as described (12Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C until use. S49 wt and S49cyc− cells were cultured under the conditions described recently (23Gille A. Liu H.Y. Sprang S.R. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34434-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). S49 wt cells were treated with cholera toxin (1 μg/ml) for 24 h before membrane preparation. S49 membranes were prepared as Sf9 membranes except that S49 cells were disintegrated by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C and 7000 kPa for 30 min using a nitrogen cavitation chamber (Parr Instruments, Moline, IL) in a buffer consisting of 50 mm KH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Membranes were thawed and sedimented by a 15-min centrifugation at 4 °C and 15,000 × g to remove residual endogenous guanine nucleotides as far as possible and were resuspended in binding buffer (12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). Expression levels of β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins and β2AR in Sf9 membranes (10–30 μg of protein/tube) were determined in the presence of 10 nm[3H]dihydroalprenolol. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm (±)-alprenolol. Expression levels of FPR-Gαi fusion proteins and FPR in Sf9 membranes (30–50 μg of protein/tube) were determined in the presence of 30 nm [3H]FMLP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm FMLP. The total volume of the binding reactions was 500 μl. Incubations were performed for 90 min at 25 °C and shaking at 250 rpm. Bound radioactivity was separated from free radioactivity by rapid filtration through GF/C filters, followed by three washes with 2 ml of binding buffer (4 °C). Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The experimental conditions chosen ensured that not more than 10% of the total amount of radioactivity added to binding tubes was bound to filters. For studying the effects of nucleotides on ternary complex formation, reaction mixtures contained Sf9 membranes expressing β2AR-GαsS(20–25 μg of protein/tube), 1 nm[3H]dihydroalprenolol, 1 μm salbutamol, and guanine nucleotides at increasing concentrations. Alternatively, reaction mixtures contained Sf9 membranes expressing FPR + Gαi2 + β1γ2 (30–50 μg of protein/tube), 10 nm [3H]FMLP, and guanine nucleotides at increasing concentrations. Membranes were thawed and sedimented by a 15-min centrifugation at 4 °C and 15,000 ×g to remove residual endogenous guanine nucleotides as far as possible and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. GTP hydrolysis was determined as described (14Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Assay tubes contained Sf9 membranes expressing fusion proteins (10 μg of protein/tube), 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 100 nm to 1.5 μm unlabeled GTP, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm AppNHp, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 40 μg of creatine kinase, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Tubes additionally contained various guanine nucleotides at increasing concentrations and 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol (β2AR-Gαs fusion proteins) or 10 μm FMLP (FPR-Gαi fusion proteins). Reaction mixtures (80 μl) were incubated for 3 min at 25 °C before the addition of 20 μl of [γ-32P]GTP (0.2–0.5 μCi/tube). All stock and work dilutions of [γ-32P]GTP were prepared in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, because [γ-32P]GTP solutions prepared in distilled water were unstable. Reactions were conducted for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 900 μl of slurry consisting of 5% (w/v) activated charcoal and 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 2.0. Charcoal-quenched reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 15 min at room temperature at 15,000 × g. Seven hundred μl of the supernatant fluid of reaction mixtures were removed, and 32Pi was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Non-enzymatic [γ-32P]GTP degradation was determined in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled GTP and was <1% of the total amount of radioactivity added. Membranes were thawed and sedimented by a 15-min centrifugation at 4 °C and 15,000 × g to remove residual endogenous guanine nucleotides as far as possible and resuspended in binding buffer (12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA and 75 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). AC assays were performed as described (14Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, tubes contained various membranes (15–50 μg of protein/tube), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and guanine nucleotides at various concentrations without or with (−)-isoproterenol. In some experiments, reaction mixtures contained NaF at increasing concentrations plus 10 μmAlCl3, forskolin at increasing concentrations, and MnCl2 (10 mm). Assay tubes containing membranes and various additions in a total volume of 30 μl were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C before starting reactions by adding 20 μl of reaction mixture containing (final) [α-32P]ATP (1.0–1.5 μCi/tube) plus 40 μm unlabeled ATP, 2.7 mmmono(cyclohexyl)ammonium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.125 IU of pyruvate kinase, 1 IU of myokinase, and 0.1 mm cAMP. For determination of the Km value of AC for ATP, reaction mixtures contained 10 μm to 1 mmunlabeled ATP/Mn2+ plus 10 mmMnCl2. Reactions were conducted for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2.2n HCl. Denatured protein was sedimented by a 1-min centrifugation at 25 °C and 15,000 × g. Sixty five μl of the supernatant fluid were applied onto disposable columns filled with 1.3 g of neutral alumina (Sigma A-1522, super I, WN-6). [32P]cAMP was separated from [α-32P]ATP by elution of [32P]cAMP with 4 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (24Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recovery of [32P]cAMP was ∼80%. Blank values were routinely ∼0.01% of the total amount of [α-32P]ATP added. The extremely low blank values allowed for the precise determination of even very low AC activities (such as those observed in Sf9 membranes expressing GαsS in the presence of MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp) or high isotopic dilution of [α-32P]ATP (such as those in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled ATP). [32P]cAMP was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using the Prism 3.02 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). We determined the affinities of GTPγS and GppNHp and their MANT-derivatives for Gαs- and Gαi-proteins by measuring agonist-stimulated steady-state GTP hydrolysis of β2AR-Gαs and FPR-Gαi fusion proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cell membranes (13Seifert R.

The affinity profiles of nucleotides were similar for Gαs-proteins (GαsL, GαsS, and Gαolf) (Fig. 2,A–C) and Gαi-proteins (Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3) (Fig. 2, D–F). GTPγS inhibited GTP hydrolysis with Ki values ranging from 3.6 (β2AR-Gαolf) to 8.9 nm (FPR-Gαi3). As expected (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar, 2Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), GppNHp inhibited GTP hydrolysis with considerably lower potencies (∼20–140-fold) than GTPγS. The Ki values for GppNHp ranged from 170 (FPR-Gαi2) to 520 nm(β2AR-Gαolf). The introduction of the MANT group at the 2′(3′)-O-position of the ribosyl group reduced the affinity of GTPγS for Gαs- and Gαi-proteins by ∼30–300-fold, i.e. theKi values for MANT-GTPγS ranged from 250 (FPR-Gαi2) to 1100 nm(β2AR-Gαolf). The affinities of MANT-GppNHp for Gαs- and Gαi-proteins were 4.5–11-fold lower than those of GppNHp, i.e. the Kivalues for MANT-GppNHp ranged from 1.2 (FPR-Gαi2) to 5.8 μm (β2AR-Gαolf). We also analyzed GTPases with GTP at increasing concentrations in the presence of MANT-GTPγS at various fixed concentrations and plotted the data double-reciprocally according to Lineweaver-Burk (Fig.3). Based on GTPase competition studies with various G-proteins and nucleotides (25Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Klinker J.F. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we expected that the linear regression lines intersect in the y axis, reflecting competitive interaction of GTP with MANT-GTPγS. In fact, MANT-GTPγS exhibited competitive interaction with GTP at Gαs (Fig.3A) and Gαi (Fig. 3B). Collectively, our data show that MANT-GTPγS and MANT-GppNHp bind to Gαs- and Gαi-proteins, although with low affinity. In case of the β2AR/Gαs couple, ternary complex formation is assessed indirectly by measuring binding of radioligand antagonist in the presence of unlabeled agonist. Binding assay mixtures contained [3H]dihydroalprenolol and salbutamol at fixed concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Guanine nucleotides reduce agonist affinity of the β2AR and, thereby,increase [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding (13Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As reported before (14Liu H.-Y. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), GTPγS potently (IC50, 0.7 nm; CI (CI, 95% confidence interval), 0.2–2.1 nm) and efficaciously disrupted the ternary complex in membranes expressing β2AR-GαsS (Fig.4A). MANT-GTPγS (1 μm) reduced ternary complex formation in β2AR-GαsS by ∼50%, but at higher concentrations, the effect of MANT-GTPγS was reverted. MANT-GTPγS at 10 μm apparently increased ternary complex formation by 40% above control. However, because ternary complex formation was assessed indirectly through radioligand antagonist binding, we had to exclude the possibility that MANT-GTPγS inhibited [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to the β2AR. We examined the effect of MANT-GTPγS (10 μm) on binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in Sf9 membranes expressing the β2AR alone, i.e. a system in which ternary complex formation is not detected (12Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In fact, MANT-GTPγS (10 μm) inhibited binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (1 nm) by 40%. Thus, because of interference of MANT-GTPγS with ligand binding to the β2AR, we could not answer the question whether GTPγS and MANT-GTPγS exhibit similar efficacies at disrupting the ternary complex in β2AR-GαsS. In case of the FPR/Gαi2 couple, ternary complex disruption is measured directly by guanine nucleotide-induced reduction of high affinity agonist ([3H]FMLP) binding (15Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M.

Considering the Ki values of MANT-GTPγS for Gαi-proteins (250–500 nm) (Fig. 2, D–F), we would have expected maximal disruption of the ternary complex with MANT-GTPγS at 10 μm. However, MANT-GTPγS (10 μm) decreased [3H]FMLP binding by not more than 25%. Thus, MANT-GTPγS is rather inefficient at stabilizing the conformation in Gαi that is required for ternary complex disruption. Similarly, IDP, XDP, XTP, UTP, and CTP are less efficacious than GTP at disrupting the ternary complex between the β2AR and Gαs (23Gille A. Liu H.Y. Sprang S.R. Seifert R. J. Biol.

GTPγS and GppNHp increased basal AC activity with EC50 values of 6.2 (CI, 5.1–7.4 nm) and 87 nm (CI, 67–110 nm), respectively. GTPγS and GppNHp were similarly efficacious at activating AC. In agreement with previous results (5Eckstein F. Cassel D. Levkovitz H. Lowe M. Selinger Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9829-9834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GDPβS was less efficacious at activating AC than GTPγS/GppNHp, i.e.GDPβS acted as a partial Gαs activator. MANT-GTPγS and MANT-GppNHp abolished basal AC activity in Sf9 membranes expressing GαsS (reflecting the activity of GαsS bound to GDP (13Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U.

Based on the literature and our present data, the hypothesis evolved that MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp could stabilize an inhibitory Gαs conformation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interactions of MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp with GTP, GTPγS, GppNHp, GDPβS and AlF4−, i.e.substances that all bind to the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gα and stabilize distinct conformations (4Sprang S.R.

If MANT-GTPγS/MANT-GppNHp inhibited AC via GαsS, they should competitively block the stimulatory effects of GTPγS, GppNHp, GTP, GDPβS, and AlF4− on AC. As positive control, we studied the interaction of the full GαsS activator, GTPγS, with the partial GαsS activator, GDPβS, on AC (Fig. 5A) (5Eckstein F. Cassel D. Levkovitz H. Lowe M. Selinger Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9829-9834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive interaction of MANT-GTPγS with GTP was already observed in the GTPase studies (Fig. 3). GDPβS shifted the concentration/response curves for GTPγS to the right without reducing the maximal AC activity obtained with GTPγS (Fig.5B). These data confirm the competitive interaction of guanine nucleotides at the nucleotide-binding site of Gαs(31Svoboda M. Furnelle J. Eckstein F. Christophe J.

In the present study, we observed that activation of ATM is required for a UVA-stimulated increase in Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as in activation and phosphorylation of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs). Moreover, UVA-stimulated activation of upstream kinases, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and ERKs, involved in mediating phosphorylation of RSKs and STAT3 was defective or delayed in ATM-deficient cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that RSK2-deficient cells were defective for UV-induced Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT3, and the defect was restored after ectopic expression of transfected full-length RSK2.In vitro experiments showed that active RSK2 and JNK1 induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 precipitates from immunoprecipitation but not from glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down. Interestingly, the GST fusion STAT3 proteins mixed together with STAT3 immunoprecipitates can be phosphorylated by JNK. However, the in vitro phosphorylation of STAT3 was reduced by the GST-STAT3β protein, a dominant negative form of STAT3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 is triggered by active RSK2 or JNK1 in the presence of a downstream kinase or a cofactor, and thereby the intracellular phosphorylation process is stimulated through a signaling pathway involving ATM, MAPKs, RSK2, and an as yet unidentified kinase or cofactor. Additionally, RSK2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 (Ser727) was further determined to be required for basal and UVA-stimulated STAT3 transcriptional activities."

We demonstrate that AK1 deficiency induces fiber-type specific variation in groups of transcripts involved in glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism and in gene products defining structural and myogenic events. This was associated with increased phosphotransfer capacities of the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Moreover, in AK1−/− mice, fast-twitch gastrocnemius, but not slow-twitch soleus, had an increase in adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and mitochondrial creatine kinase protein, along with a doubling of the intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volume.

This implies that myocytes must undergo constant reprogramming of their gene expression in response to fluctuations in intrinsic or extrinsic physiological signals such as intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, hormonal stimulation, or altered workload (1Olson E.N.

Moreover, disturbance of cellular energetics by metabolic inhibitors or genetic mutation may also induce alterations in the muscle phenotype via changes in the gene program for fiber-type specification (4van Deursen J.

Although many other aspects of myocyte infrastructure may change in concert, the molecular mechanisms regulating reprogramming of muscle energetics are still unknown. Indeed, an important unresolved issue is the relationship between muscle design and metabolic pathways maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Adenylate kinases (AK,1 EC 2.7.4.3) are evolutionary strongly conserved enzymes that catalyze the reaction ATP + AMP ⇆ 2 ADP. This reaction is one of the principal steps in adenine nucleotide metabolism and high energy phosphoryl (∼P) transfer in the cellular bioenergetic network (11Atkinson D.E.

Among several AK isoenzymes found in mammals, skeletal muscle is particularly rich in AK1, the major cytosolic isoform (14Tanabe T. Yamada M. Noma T. Kajii T. Nakazawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Along with the AK circuit, the creatine kinase (CK, EC2.7.3.2)/phosphocreatine (PCr), nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDPK or nm23, EC 2.7.4.6), and glycolytic phosphotransfer systems coexist in skeletal muscle and serve to balance adenylates at ATP-consuming and ATP-generating intracellular sites (4van Deursen J.

The relative importance of the AK, CK, and glycolytic phosphotransfer system is muscle fiber-type-dependent (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol.

For example, the CK/PCr phosphotransfer circuit is most active in fast-twitch fibers as demonstrated by a high content of PCr and high levels of cytosolic muscle-type (M)-CK. Slow-twitch fibers exhibit lower amounts of PCr and M-CK, but because of the high mitochondrial content possess relatively large amounts of ScCKmit (20Kushmerick M.J. Moerland T.S. Wiseman R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Expression of glycolytic proteins is most abundant in fast fibers and the mechanisms by which glycolytic genes are collectively or individually activated have in part been identified (21Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In fact, the redox cofactors NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, which couple glycolysis or the pentose phosphate cycle to the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, are important regulators of glycolytic gene transcription (22Rutter J. Reick M. Wu L.C. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Other coupling exists with calcium calcineurin (1Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (9Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P.

The mechanism underlying the regulation and distribution of AK and NDPK gene products in specific fiber-types of muscle is less clear. We have recently demonstrated that inactivation of the AK circuit induces flux redistribution in the cellular phosphotransfer network, associated with an elevated glycolytic metabolism (23Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S. Terjung R.R. Wieringa B. Terzic A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6371-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Preserved muscle function, albeit with lower efficiency, in these animals suggests metabolic and cellular adaptations induced by genetic stress associated with AK deficiency. Indeed, we here uncovered a coherent reprogramming in the genetic and molecular profile of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles from mice lacking AK1. These adaptations occur at the mRNA and/or protein level and could support energy metabolism and performance in muscles compromised by AK1 deficiency. Gene-targeted mice carrying a HygroBR replacement mutation in the exon-3–5 region of theAK1 gene were derived as described in detail elsewhere (23Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S. Terjung R.R. Wieringa B. Terzic A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6371-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Age and sex matched (3–5 months old; born on identical dates) homozygous AK1-deficient and wild-type control animals (both with 50–50% C57BL/6 × 129/Ola mixed inbred background) were used throughout experiments. Housing conditions were kept exactly identical to exclude effects of variations in (steroid) hormone levels, or food supply. Growth rates of wild-type and AK1 knockout mice were similar, resulting in body weights varying between 26–28 and 22–24 g for 3–5-month-old males and females, respectively. The investigation conformed to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Dutch Council and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nijmegen. Total RNA from freshly isolated skeletal gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was extracted using the lithium chloride-urea method (23Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W.

Macroarrays were prepared by spotting individual plasmids with cDNA insert (134 different mouse sequences for glycolytic enzymes, mitochondrial enzymes and transporters, fatty acid metabolism enzymes, muscle regulatory factors, proteins active in Ca2+ signaling, glucose transport, tissue oxygenation as well as cytoskeletal components and transcription factors (see www.ncmls.kun.nl/celbio/data.htm for detailed information) onto Hybond N+ membranes using a gridding robot (24de Groof A.J.

Smeets B. Groot Koerkamp M.J. Mul A.N. Janssen E.E. Tabak H.F. Wieringa B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Four AK1 knockout and control mice were analyzed and statistically compared. Acquisition of radioactive signals from the gridded arrays was performed on a Bio-Rad GS 363 phosphorimager using the Molecular Analyst software from Bio-Rad. Because the signal intensity varied widely, membranes were exposed for 30 min (detection of abundant RNA) and 16 h (non-abundant RNA) and hybridization levels for individual cDNAs expressed as the mean Arbitrary Units (A.U.) of duplicate spots. Signals were divided by the value for the sum of detectable signals, resulting in the identification of an unaffected subset of genes that were used for final normalization. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles excised from the hind legs of 3 mice were pooled. Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed as described (25de Groof A.J. Oerlemans F.T. Jost C.R. Wieringa B. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, extracted proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and proteins electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Specific proteins were detected using antibodies raised against species-specific protein or synthetic peptides of corresponding proteins as described elsewhere (25de Groof A.J. Oerlemans F.T. Jost C.R. Wieringa B. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After image acquisition with a densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-690), proteins were quantified using the Molecular Analyst software from Bio-Rad. For correlation, intensities of signals were compared with intensities of signals in the C57BL/6 calibration series. To confirm equal loading of protein a representative gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250) and, after immunodetection, blots were stained with Ponceau S. RNA blots were prepared as described (23Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S. Terjung R.R. Wieringa B. Terzic A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6371-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), muscle pyruvate kinase (PK-M), β-enolase, MLC-2s, ScCKmit, GLUT4, and α-actin as probe (probe length, 0.5–2 kbp). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 68 °C in 0.5 m NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.2, 7% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC/1% (w/v) SDS at 68 °C and exposed to Kodak X-Omat films. Signals were quantified by phosphorimager analysis as described above. Per genotype, four animals were analyzed (independently from macroarray experiments) and statistically compared. Protein extracts were prepared from frozen powdered muscles as described in detail elsewhere (26Pucar D. Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Juranic N. Macura S. Wieringa B. Terzic A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41424-41429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). AK activity in supernatant, expressed as relative light units (RLU)/min/mg protein, was measured by a luciferase-based ATP bioluminescence assay (Sigma) in the presence of 2 mm ADP using a BioOrbit 1253 luminometer. NDPK activity, expressed as RLU/min/mg protein, was determined with the same bioluminescence assay in the presence of the AK inhibitor, diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5A; 200 μm), and the reaction started with dGTP (2 mm). Three animals per genotype were analyzed and statistically compared. The activity of GAPDH, PK, and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) were measured using coupled enzyme assays (27Dzeja P.P. Pucar D. Redfield M.M. Burnett J.C. Terzic A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 201: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl (GAPDH and PGK) or 20 μl (PK) of muscle extract and activities spectrophotometrically recorded at 340 nm with a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer. Per genotype, five animals were analyzed and statistically compared. Mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2,-tribromorthanol (350 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and the GPS muscle complex was fixed using a clamp and dissected during immersion fixation with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Subsequently, muscles were prepared and examined on a JEOL JEM1010 electron microscope (4van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B.

Intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volumes in superficial gastrocnemius muscle were estimated from electron micrographs at a magnification of ×8000 by point counting. For each individual muscle, at least three randomly taken micrographs were analyzed. Per genotype, six animals were measured and statistically compared. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test for unpaired samples was used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Prior to typing the cellular and molecular adaptations that are evoked as a response to AK1 deficiency we established the normal gene expression characteristics of two distinctly different skeletal muscle types, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. These muscles can be considered the archetypes of fast and slow skeletal muscle in the mouse hind leg (19Burkholder T.J. Fingado B. Baron S. Lieber R.L. J. Morphol. 1994; 221: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), for which differences in contractile performance and metabolic design are mirrored in their transcription profiles (1Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Using a customized cDNA macroarray assay and experimental conditions that avoid mRNA amplification (24de Groof A.J. Smeets B. Groot Koerkamp M.J. Mul A.N. Janssen E.E. Tabak H.F. Wieringa B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) a selective subset of mouse-muscle cDNAs was probed for their potential to discriminate between gastrocnemius and soleus. Ultimately, 86 candidate cDNAs were chosen that belonged to different functional clusters, gave good signal to noise ratio, and were considered suitable indicators for inter- and intramuscular comparison. About 65% of the signals (56 signals) represented mRNAs with similar expression levels in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. The remaining signals (30 signals) represented mRNAs with expression levels that were significantly different (p < 0.05; n = 4). Transcripts with expression levels that differed by a magnitude of 2 or more (p < 0.01; n = 4) between these two muscles are shown in Table I and Fig.1. Quantitative data for the remaining 10 mRNAs, which differed by a magnitude less than 2 can be found at www.ncmls.kun.nl/celbio/data.htm.Table IDifferential mRNA expression in gastrocnemius and soleus skeletal muscleEST/cDNAGastrocnemiusSoleusGDH0.23 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.02Tfam0.31 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.04Glutamine synthetase0.54 ± 0.050.17 ± 0.03GPDH0.97 ± 0.070.21 ± 0.03B-CK1.0 ± 0.20.36 ± 0.08PGK1.08 ± 0.090.40 ± 0.07GAPDH1.3 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.1LDH-A2.4 ± 0.40.91 ± 0.06AK13.0 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.2Glycogen phosphorylase B3.3 ± 0.21.06 ± 0.09Aldolase A14.1 ± 0.54.5 ± 0.4β-Enolase13.4 ± 1.14.7 ± 0.2M-CK73 ± 820 ± 1Serca20.4 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.1MLC-2s; partial cDNA0.55 ± 0.043.7 ± 0.7MLC-1s/v0.8 ± 0.26.6 ± 1.0MLC-2s1.1 ± 0.16.9 ± 1.0Myoglobin0.9 ± 0.13.5 ± 1.0PiC1.06 ± 0.062.1 ± 0.3ScCKmit2.1 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.5Data are expressed in arbitrary units as mean ± S.E.

Differential regulation of energy generation, consumption and distribution pathways is central to the determination of the nature and function of the muscle fiber (1Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the expression level of mRNAs for several key enzymes in these pathways. The relative abundance of AK1 mRNA was 2.2-fold higher in the gastrocnemius muscle compared with the soleus muscle (Fig.2A). This result was confirmed by the observation that AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer activity was ∼3-fold higher in gastrocnemius muscle than in soleus muscle (Fig.2A). Also the composition and function of the CK phosphotransfer system depends on the specific muscle type (20Kushmerick M.J. Moerland T.S. Wiseman R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our macroarray analysis showed that M-CK mRNA is 3.7-fold higher expressed in gastrocnemius compared with the soleus muscle. In contrast, the ScCKmit gene expression level is 2.1-fold higher in soleus muscle (Fig. 2B). Still, the ScCKmit mRNA level was only 3 and 23% of that of M-CK mRNA in gastrocnemius and soleus muscle, respectively. Subsequent comparison of M-CK and ScCKmit protein levels in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle by means of quantitative blot analysis, using specific antibodies directed against ScCKmit and CK-MM (Fig. 2B, inset), indicated that mRNA and protein product levels were well correlated. When normalized to total protein content, the M-CK protein level appeared 1.8-fold higher in gastrocnemius than in soleus, while the ScCKmit protein level was 2.7-fold higher in soleus than in gastrocnemius muscle. Along with the AK- and CK-catalyzed high-energy phosphoryl transfer, the NDPK phosphotransfer pathway warrants transport and distribution of ∼P over nucleotide di- and triphosphates (13Dzeja P.P. Zeleznikar R.J. Goldberg N.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 169-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bessman S.P. Carpenter C.L. Annu. Rev.

The expression level of different NDPK isoforms present on the gridded membranes (nm23-M1, nm23-M2, nm23-M4 and the human homologue of mouse nm23-M3, DR-nm23), did not differ more than 1.2-fold between gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Taken into account that the expression of the nm23-M2 isoform was the highest in skeletal muscle (data not shown), this finding was corroborated by the observation that there was a good correlation between the transcript level for nm23-M2, and the accompanying total NDPK activity (Fig. 2C). The total NDPK activity was not significantly different between soleus and gastrocnemius. Thus, whereas NDPK gene product and activity levels are equally maintained in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle, AK- and CK-mediated phosphoryl transfer activity is clearly dependent on muscle phenotype. The sarcomeric myosin molecule is a hexamer consisting of two myosin heavy chains (MHCs), two essential myosin light chains (ELCs), and two regulatory myosin light chains (RLCs). Because myofibrillar protein isoforms generally show tissue-specific distribution these proteins may serve as useful markers for skeletal muscle fiber typing. As anticipated on the basis of a slow or fast-twitch muscle fiber (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), the expression level of genes encoding the MLC-1s/v and MLC-2s mRNAs differed 6–8-fold between gastrocnemius and soleus muscle (Table I and Fig. 1). Also the signals for the mRNAs for mitochondrial inorganic phosphate carrier (PiC), Ca2+-ATPase isoform Serca2, and myoglobin, of which the translation products are associated with oxidative metabolism, were 2.0-, 3.8-, and 5.2-fold higher in the soleus muscle, respectively (Table I and Fig. 1). Strikingly, the steady-state transcript level for the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcription factor Tfam (or mtTFA) was 3.9-fold higher in the glycolytic gastrocnemius muscle compared with the oxidative soleus muscle. This observation was surprising because the gastrocnemius is a mitochondria-poor muscle, but may be explained by the fact that cooperation of more than one factor is needed to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis (9Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M.

Science. 2002; 296: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, relatively high steady-state B-CK transcript levels were detected in soleus and gastrocnemius muscle. This observation is most easily explained by the fact that immature muscle cells (i.e. satellite cells) actively transcribe theB-CK gene (15Steeghs K. Benders A. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A. Ruitenbeek W. Jost C. van Deursen J. Perryman B. Pette D. Bruckwilder M. Koudijs J. Jap P. Veerkamp J. Wieringa B. Cell. 1997; 89: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As expected, signal intensities for mRNAs related to glycolysis (β-enolase, aldolase A, GAPDH, and PGK) or coupled pathways (glycogen phosphorylase B, LDH-A, and GPDH) were higher in gastrocnemius than in soleus muscle (Table I and Fig.1). Thus, we may conclude that the cDNA macroarray has sufficient discriminating power to distinguish mRNA profiles of fast and slow type muscles. Changes at the molecular level may occur when the muscle genotype or the integrity of various intrinsic or extrinsic physiological control mechanisms are disturbed (6Bergeron R. Ren J.M. Cadman K.S.

To determine the spectrum of molecular changes related to the absence of AK1 we compared mRNA profiles of gastrocnemius and soleus, between wild-type and AK1−/− animals.

The rate of Na+ absorption is governed in part by regulated membrane trafficking mechanisms that control the apical membrane ENaC density. Previous reports have implicated a role for the t-SNARE protein, syntaxin 1A (S1A), in the regulation of ENaC current (INa). In the present study, we examine the structure-function relations influencing S1A-ENaC interactions. In vitro pull-down assays demonstrated that S1A directly interacts with the C termini of the α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits but not with the N terminus of any ENaC subunit. The H3 domain of S1A is the critical motif mediating S1A-ENaC binding. Functional studies in ENaC expressingXenopus oocytes revealed that deletion of the H3 domain of co-expressed S1A eliminated its inhibition of INa, and acute injection of a GST-H3 fusion protein into ENaC expressing oocytes inhibited INa to the same extent as S1A co-expression. In cell surface ENaC labeling experiments, reductions in plasma membrane ENaC accounted for the H3 domain inhibition of INa. Individually substituting C terminus-truncated α-, β-, or γ-ENaC subunits for their wild-type counterparts reversed the S1A-induced inhibition of INa, and oocytes expressing ENaC comprised of three C terminus-truncated subunits showed no S1A inhibition of INa. C terminus truncation or disruption of the C terminus β-subunit PY motif increases INa by interfering with ENaC endocytosis. In contrast to subunit truncation, a β-ENaC PY mutation did not relieve S1A inhibition of INa, suggesting that S1A does not perturb Nedd4 interactions that lead to ENaC endocytosis/degradation.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). This highly selective pathway for Na+ entry is characterized by a low single channel conductance (∼5 picosiemens), high affinity blockade by the diuretic amiloride, and a negligible conductance to K+. Functional ENaCs consist of three homologous subunits (α-, β-, and γ-ENaC) (2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

A key component of this regulation involves both short and long term control over the number of functional apical membrane ENaCs, which is achieved by changes in their exocytic insertion and/or endocytic retrieval (6Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently, significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms underlying ENaC endocytosis (for review see Ref. 6Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Retrieval of ENaC from the cell surface has been shown to depend upon a highly conserved PPXY sequence within the C termini of ENaC subunits, known as a PY motif. The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 interacts primarily with the PY motifs of the β- and γ-subunits (7Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), which decreases cell surface ENaC expression by increasing channel internalization and degradation (8Goulet C.C. Volk K.A.

The ENaC-Nedd4 interaction plays an important role in ENaC regulation, as genetic deletion or mutation of the PY motifs in the C termini of the β- or γ-subunits eliminates Nedd4 interactions and produces Liddle's syndrome (11Shimkets R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20812-20817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggested that plasma membrane insertion of ENaC is mediated via functional interactions with membrane trafficking proteins of the SNARE complex. Exogenous expression of S1A, a target or t-SNARE protein that is a member of the core complex required for vesicle docking and exocytosis, inhibited Na+ currents expressed in Xenopusoocytes, and this inhibition was associated with a decrease in cell surface ENaC expression (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A physical interaction between S1A and ENaC was implicated from the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated that immunoprecipitation of S1A from A6 epithelia co-precipitated γ-ENaC (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a similar study, Saxenaet al. (15Saxena S. Quick M.W. Tousson A. Oh Y. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20812-20817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) found that S1A co-precipitated fromXenopus oocytes with FLAG-tagged subunits of both β- and γ-ENaC, whereas possible interactions with α-ENaC were not addressed. Although these studies have identified a functional interaction of ENaC with S1A, the precise domains of both proteins involved in these interactions remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the specific domains involved in the physical and functional interactions between S1A and ENaC. We evaluated the in vitro binding of S1A with the cytosolic ENaC N and C termini in pull-down assays and examined their functional interactions using oocyte co-expression assays. Our results define the domain interactions between S1A and the ENaC subunits and demonstrate reversal of the S1A inhibitory action on INa by elimination of these domains. These findings, coupled with the effects of S1A on ENaC cell surface expression and on ENaC bearing a PY mutation, support the concept that the S1A-ENaC interaction controls ENaC trafficking mediated by SNARE protein interactions. mMESSAGE mMACHINETM T7 or T3 complimentary RNA synthesis kits were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). DNA Mini-Prep kits, Midi-Prep kits, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were obtained from Qiagen. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA Ligase, Taq polymerase, and Pfu polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets were obtained from Roche. All other reagent grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Plasmids encoding human ENaC α-, β-, and γ-subunits were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Welsh (University of Iowa). Mouse ENaC constructs were generously provided by the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Kleyman (University of Pittsburgh). Subunit truncations were generated by introducing a stop codon by PCR at the designated amino acid (see below). The N and C termini of the human α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits were produced in bacteria as His6 fusion proteins. The appropriate cDNA fragments were synthesized by PCR with a subunit-specific primer pair and the corresponding template, pBS/KS/ENaCs. The sense and antisense primer pairs employed were as follows: αN-ENaC, 5′-CATATGGAGGGGAACAAGCTG and 5′-GGATCCCTAGAAGGCCGTCTTCATGC; αC-ENaC, 5′-CATATGCTGCTCCGAAGGTTC and 5′-GGATCCTCAG GGCCCCCCCAG; βN-ENaC, 5′-CATATGCACGTGAAGAAGTACC and 5′-GGATCCC TAGGCTTTCTTCTTGGGCCC; βC-ENaC, 5′-CATATGGCCTTGGCCAAGAGCCTA and 5′-GGATCCTTAGATGGCATCACCCTCA; γN-ENaC, 5′-CATATGGCACCCGGAG AGAAG and 5′-GGATCCCTAGCGGCGCAGACGGCC; γC-ENaC, 5′-CATATGGCCCGCCGCCAGT and 5′-GGATCCTCAGAGCTCATCCAGCATC. PCR amplicons were cloned into the pTA vector and then digested either withNdeI/BamHI or withXhoI/BamHI to recover the ENaC sequences for subcloning into pET15b vectors for bacterial expression. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. A syntaxin 1A construct deleting amino acids 190–288 of S1A was amplified from the cDNA by PCR using the following primers: sense primer, 5′-ATAAGCTTATGAAGGACCGAACC; antisense primer, 5′-CAGAATTCCTAACTGAGGGCCTGCTTCGA and sense primer, 5′-CGGAATTCATGAAGGACCGAACC; antisense primer, 5′-ATCTCGAGCTAACTGAGGGCCT GCTTC. The amplicons obtained from the first primer set were cloned into a pcDNA3 vector. The product obtained from the second primer set was introduced into a pGEX-6p-1 vector. Other S1A deletion mutants (see below) were constructed in a similar manner. All constructs were verified by microsequence analysis. Syntaxin 1A fusion proteins containing GST at the N terminus were produced in BL21 competent cells. GST-H3 contains the S1A H3 domain, S1A191–267, GST-H3-TM adds the transmembrane domain, S1A194–288, and GST-Δ H3 truncates both the H3 and TM domains from full-length S1A, S1A1–189. These constructs were employed in in vitro pull-down assays with the His6-tagged ENaC C termini (domain deletions are also provided with the results; see Fig. 2A). Conditions for bacterial growth and purification of GST fusion proteins have been described previously (16Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fresh bacterial BL21 colonies harboring His6-tagged ENaC cDNAs were cultured in 20 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Overnight cultures were diluted with pre-warmed LB medium at a ratio of 1:10, cultured at 37 °C for 1–1.5 h and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C with shaking for 3–3.5 h until the A595 was 0.35–0.8. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (100 mm HEPES, 500 mm KCl, 8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm Na2-ATP, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture, 1 tablet/50 ml). Cells were lysed by sonication and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12000 × g at 4 °C and subsequently incubated with pre-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed at least three times in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 200 mmKCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmNa2-ATP, 10% glycerol, 30 mm imidazole). Fusion proteins were eluted by three washes with 250 mmimidazole in Buffer A. Purified His6-tagged ENaC C-terminal or N-terminal proteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline for 36 h at 4 °C. The purified proteins were verified using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE or by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibodies (Sigma). These assays were performed as described previously (16Zhang H. Peters K.W. Sun F. Marino C.R. Lang J. Burgoyne R.D. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28948-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of GST-S1A fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and incubated with 10 μg of His6-tagged ENaC proteins in 200 μl of a modified DIGNAM D buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mmKCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 μm CaCl2, 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture/50 ml of buffer, pH to 7.0, with KOH) at 4 °C with shaking. The next day, samples were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with DIGNAM D buffer at 4 °C, and resolved using 15% SDS-PAGE. His6-tagged ENaC proteins were detected by use of polyhistidine antibodies (see above). The effect of altered Na+ or Ca2+ on ENaC-S1A interactions was assessed by varying the ion concentrations of the binding buffer; solutions containing 0.1 or 10 μm free Ca2+ were generated by EGTA buffering, as described (17Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vectors containing mouse ENaC, human ENaC, and rat syntaxin 1A inserts were linearized, and cRNAs were synthesizedin vitro by use of T7 or T3 cRNA synthesis kits. Oocyte isolation and RNA injection were performed as described previously (18Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ng of cRNA of each ENaC subunit was injected into stage V or VI oocytes. For experiments investigating the effect of S1A co-expression on ENaC function, oocytes were co-injected with 5 ng of S1A. Expression proceeded at 18 °C for 16–24 h in sodium-free ND96 solution before ENaC current recordings. GST fusion proteins were injected in a volume of 50 nl (estimated final concentration, 50 ng/μl) into oocytes expressing ENaC, and currents were recorded 1 h after injection. Protein binding studies (above) were performed using cytoplasmic domains derived from human ENaC, whereas the functional studies generally employed mouse ENaC subunit expression. Amino acid identity within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of human and mouse ENaC is >70% (this region is important in S1A-ENaC interactions; see below). In addition, functional experiments with co-expressed S1A, performed using C terminus human ENaC truncation, yielded results identical to those performed with mouse ENaC (see Fig. 3), confirming that these effects are not species-specific. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (18Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 3 m KCl-filled micropipettes connected to a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Oocytes were bathed continuously in ND96 solution as follows (in mm): 96 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. In sodium-free ND96, equimolarN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride replaced NaCl. After impalement, membrane potentials were allowed to stabilize before voltage clamping at −100 mV; amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were recorded as the difference in current before and after addition of 10 μm amiloride. The general approach was based on that of Zerangue et al. (19Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes expressing mouse α-, β-FLAG, and γ-ENaC subunits for 2 days were blocked for 30 min in MBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (MBS-BSA) and then exposed to MBS-BSA plus 1 μg/ml of a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. β-ENaC contained the FLAG epitope (DYDKKKD) at the extracellular loop position defined by Firsov et al. (20Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which did not alter INa relative to wt ENaC expression. This was confirmed in parallel current measurements performed prior to antibody labeling. After primary antibody labeling the oocytes were washed six times with MBS-BSA at 4 °C and then incubated with MBS-BSA supplemented with 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′2) fragment goat anti-mouse IgG; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After 12 additional washes, individual oocytes were placed in 100 μl of SuperSignal ELISA Femto solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantitated in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) where the signal was integrated over a 60-s interval and is provided in relative light units. These and other results are expressed as mean ± S.E.; statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance. Our previous results (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S.

Tousson A. Oh Y. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20812-20817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that S1A co-expression reduced ENaC currents expressed inXenopus oocytes. A physical interaction of S1A with ENaC subunits was also demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation assays (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J.

We reasoned that the ENaC cytoplasmic domains would be the potential binding sites for S1A, a type 2 plasma membrane protein that has no significant structure within the extracellular compartment. To evaluate the cytoplasmic domains of ENaC as potential binding sites for S1A, GST-S1A4–267 protein was employed in pull-down experiments with His6-tagged ENaC C or N termini. As in similar protein interaction studies, a truncated syntaxin 1A (S1A4–267) lacking the transmembrane domain was employed for its enhanced solubility and purification properties and because the last 21 amino acids of the S1A C terminus constitute the transmembrane domain, which is not expected to be involved in cytosolic protein-protein interactions. In addition, previous studies (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ENaC currents are inhibited to the same extent by co-expression of either full-length S1A or a soluble S1A4–267, lacking the transmembrane domain. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1, the C termini of ENaC α-, β-, and γ-subunits interacted with GST-S1A. In contrast with these results, no interaction could be detected between S1A and the N terminus of any ENaC subunit (Fig. 1, lower panel). These findings demonstrate that S1A binds to the ENaC subunit cytoplasmic C termini. As the H3 helical region of S1A is an important domain for protein-protein interactions within the SNARE fusion complex (21Fergestad T. Wu M.N. Schulze K.L. Lloyd T.E. Bellen H.J. Broadie K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9142-9150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to interact with other ion channels (22Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Bezprozvanny I. Zhong P. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 13943-13948Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we determined whether the H3 domain of S1A was involved in interactions with ENaC. Three deletion constructs (Fig. 2A) containing N terminus GST fusions were derived from a full-length S1A clone for comparison with the data from the GST-S1A used in Fig. 1. These constructs were employed in in vitro pull-down assays with the His6-tagged ENaC C termini. The results (Fig.2B) show that GST fusions containing the syntaxin 1A H3 domain (GST-H3 and GST-H3-TM) generally exhibited a stronger interaction with the ENaC subunit C termini than did the same amount of GST-S1A. This is not unexpected, because prior work (24Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that regions N-terminal to the H3 domain have an autoinhibitory function and can reduce H3 domain interactions with substrates. Deletion of the H3 domain abolished the interactions of syntaxin with the ENaC C termini (Fig. 2B, lane 5). As a negative control, GST alone had no significant affinity for the ENaC C termini. These results indicate that the H3 domain of S1A is the critical site for ENaC C terminus binding. To determine whether the physical interaction between S1A and the ENaC C termini is involved in the inhibition of ENaC current observed with S1A co-expression, we evaluated the effect of S1A on Na+ currents expressed from subunits with C terminus truncations. In agreement with previous studies (14Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30345-30348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Saxena S. Quick M.W. Tousson A. Oh Y. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20812-20817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), S1A co-expression significantly decreased the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in oocytes expressing wt ENaC (Fig.3, A–D). This inhibition averaged 75%. Substitution of the wt α-subunit by α-H613X had no significant effect on the magnitude of the amiloride-sensitive INa, in agreement with prior studies of α-ENaC truncation (12Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, oocytes expressing α-H613X ENaC together with S1A had significantly greater currents than those expressing wt ENaC plus S1A. Under these conditions the S1A inhibition was reduced to 38% (Fig. 3A). Qualitatively similar results were obtained from individual C terminus truncations of the β- and γ-subunits. In contrast to the α truncation, expression of the β-R583X significantly increased INa relative to controls, also consistent with prior findings and the stimulation of INa observed with Liddle's mutations that truncate β-ENaC (12Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that, when co-expressed with β-R583X ENaC, S1A did not significantly inhibit INa, indicating that S1A inhibition may be reversed by truncation of the β-ENaC C terminus alone. Truncation of the γ-ENaC C terminus resulted also in a gain of function consistent with mutations producing Liddle's disease. S1A co-expression did not inhibit γ-R583X ENaC INa as potently as in wild-type controls (Fig. 3C); the inhibition was reduced to 51% with γ-ENaC truncation. These results suggest that S1A can interact with each ENaC subunit C terminus to produce an inhibition of INa, because truncation of individual subunit C termini fully or partially reverse the S1A inhibitory effect. The elimination of S1A inhibition by β-ENaC truncation alone suggests that a selective interaction at this site may be sufficient to account for the inhibitory effect of S1A. Finally, we expressed a functional ENaC comprised of three C terminus truncated subunits and determined the influence of S1A co-expression on INa (Fig. 3D). S1A inhibition was reversed completely under these conditions, as there was no significant difference between the combined αβγ truncated ENaC currents and those with co-expressed S1A. These findings suggest that the S1A inhibition of INa involves functional interactions of syntaxin with the C termini of all ENaC subunits, which is consistent with the protein binding data. The PY motif located in the C terminus of the β- and γ-ENaC subunits is involved in important interactions with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (7Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). To examine whether the PY motif may also influence S1A binding and subsequent ENaC inhibition, we measured INa in oocytes co-expressing a β-ENaC PY mutant, β-Y618A, together with S1A. As described above and shown in Fig. 4, S1A inhibited wt ENaC current, which was reversed upon truncation of the β-ENaC C terminus. Amiloride-sensitive currents were approximately doubled in β-Y618A ENaC-expressing oocytes relative to wt ENaC controls (Fig.4), as has been demonstrated previously for β- or γ-ENaC PY mutations (25Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the β-ENaC C terminus truncation, co-expression of S1A with β-Y618A ENaC resulted in a 76% inhibition of the INa (Fig. 4). This value is quantitatively similar the inhibition observed for S1A co-expr"

To better understand the feedback inhibition properties of GK, we randomly mutagenized a plasmid carrying tomato tomPRO1 cDNA, which encodes proline-sensitive GK. A pool of mutagenized plasmids was transformed into an Escherichia coli GK mutant, and proline-overproducing derivatives were selected on minimal medium containing the toxic proline analog 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline. Thirty-two mutations that conferred 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline resistance were obtained. Thirteen different single amino acid substitutions were identified at nine different residues. The residues were distributed throughout the N-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide, but 9 mutations affecting 6 residues were in a cluster of 16 residues. GK assays revealed that these amino acid substitutions caused varying degrees of diminished sensitivity to proline feedback inhibition and also resulted in a range of increased proline accumulation in vivo. GK belongs to a family of amino acid kinases, and a predicted three-dimensional model of this enzyme was constructed on the basis of the crystal structures of three related kinases. In the model, residues that were identified as important for allosteric control were located close to each other, suggesting that they may contribute to the structure of a proline binding site.

Osmoregulation is of significance for agriculture because water is a major limiting factor for crop productivity. Plants evolved a variety of mechanisms for adapting to environmental stresses, one of which is accumulation of proline under salinity, dehydration, or freezing environments (1Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Paleg L.G. Aspinall D. Physiology and Biochemistry of Drought Resistance in Plants. Academic Press, Inc., Sydney, Australia1981Google Scholar). It has been proposed that proline plays an important role as a compatible solute, maintaining proper balance between the extracellular and intracellular osmolality. However, a number of other functions have been hypothesized for this imino acid, such as carbon or nitrogen reservoir, radical scavenger, or regulator of intracellular pH (3Stewart C.R. Paleg L.G. Aspinall D. The Biochemistry of Drought Resistance in Plants. Academic Press, Inc., Sydney1981: 243-259Google Scholar, 4Delanuey A.J. Verma D.P.S. Plant J. 1993; 4: 215-223Crossref Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Plants have two proline biosynthetic pathways, the glutamate pathway and the ornithine pathway, with the former appearing to play a predominant role under osmotic stress (5Rhodes D. Handa S. Bressan R.A. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 890-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This product cyclizes spontaneously to P5C, which is reduced by NADPH to proline by P5C reductase. In bacteria and yeast, GK and GPR reactions are catalyzed by two separate enzymes. It has been shown in bacteria that the GK activity is sensitive to feedback inhibition by proline (6Csonka L.N. Baich A. Herrmann K.M. Somerville R.L. Amino Acids: Biosynthesis and Genetic Regulation. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1983: 35-51Google Scholar).

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1642-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Kishor P.B.K. Hong Z. Miao G.-H. Hu C.-A.A. Verma D.P.S.

Plant J. 1999; 18: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Osmotic stress was shown to increase the P5CS mRNA levels along with the proline pool size in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), suggesting that transcriptional regulation of P5CS could be important for a control of proline biosynthesis (10Igarashi Y.

Shinozaki K. Plant J. 1995; 7: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) has two distinct genes for P5CS, called tomPRO1 and tomPRO2 (13Fujita T. Maggio A. Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although this species accumulates more than 15-fold higher levels of proline than A. thaliana or rice, the tomPRO1 andtomPRO2 mRNAs are expressed essentially at constitutive levels at low and high osmolality (13Fujita T. Maggio A. Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that some post-transcriptional control mechanism must be taken into account for the regulation of proline synthesis in tomato. The GKs encoded by the tomPRO1 locus of tomato, the P5CS genes ofVigna aconitifolia, and grapevine (Vitis vinifera) have been demonstrated to be subject to feedback regulation by proline (14Hu C.-A.A.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) described the isolation of a salt-tolerant mutant of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia that lost proline feedback inhibition of the P5CS. Also, Hong et al. (18Hong Z. Lakkieneni K. Zhang Z. Verma D.P.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) reported a direct role of feedback inhibition of P5CS for proline accumulation by constructing transgenic plants that expressed a mutated version of the V. aconitifolia P5CS, whose proline feedback regulation was lost. These observations suggest that allosteric control of GK reaction also plays a key role in regulating proline synthesis in plants (16Stines A.P. Naylor D.J. Hoj P.B. van Heeswijk R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18Hong Z. Lakkieneni K. Zhang Z. Verma D.P.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Studies with purified preparations revealed that the bacterial GKs and the plant P5CS enzymes are subject to feedback regulation by proline at very different sensitivities. For the bacterial GKs, the concentration of proline resulting in 50% inhibition of activity (apparentKi) was in the range of 0.01–0.1 mm(19Omori K. Suzuki S. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Smith C.J. Deutch A.H. Rushlow K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 545-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith L.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas for the plant P5CS enzymes, the apparentKi was estimated to be ≥5 mm (16Stines A.P. Naylor D.J. Hoj P.B. van Heeswijk R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Zhang C.-s. Lu Q. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20491-20496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions have been first isolated in the GK ofEscherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, which lessened or eliminated the sensitivity of the enzyme to allosteric control. These mutations resulted in proline overproduction in whole cells (23Csonka L.N. Gelvin S.B. Goodner B.W. Orser C.S. Siemieniak D. Slightom J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1988; : 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Dandekar A.M. Uratsu S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5943-5945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rushlow K.E. Deutch A.H.

Microbiol. 1991; 137: 507-517Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), providing the most compelling proof that feedback inhibition is indeed important for the regulation of proline synthesisin vivo. In a site-directed mutagenesis of the V. aconitifolia P5CS, Zhang et al. (22Zhang C.-s. Lu Q. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20491-20496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) showed that amino acid substitutions at positions 126 and 129 in the V. aconitifolia P5CS abolished proline feedback regulation. Other single amino acid mutations involving feedback regulation of GK have been recently reported in Streptococcus thermophilus andListeria monocytogenes (26Massarelli I. Forlani G. Ricca E. DeFelice M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 143-147PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sleator R.D. Gahan C.G.M. Hill C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In all, eight amino acid residues have been identified in six organisms as important for proline feedback regulation of GK (22Zhang C.-s. Lu Q. Verma D.P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20491-20496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Csonka L.N. Gelvin S.B. Goodner B.W. Orser C.S. Siemieniak D. Slightom J.L.

Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 507-517Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, because the three-dimensional structure of GK has not been determined yet, there is no corroborating information about roles of specific amino acids in the allosteric binding site or other structure-function aspects of this protein. On the basis of primary sequence similarity, GKs have been assigned to the so-called amino acid kinase family of enzymes (PF00696 in the Pfam data base, www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam), which also includes AK, CK, CK-CPS, NAGK, and uridylate kinase. Initial sequence comparisons identified two sequence features that are common to GKs (see Fig. 1). A phosphate binding site and a leucine zipper have been suggested in the GKs, although neither seems to have a perfect match to the respective consensus sequences (11Savouré A. Jaoua S. Hua X.J. Ardiles W. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Hu C.-A.A. Delauney A.J. Verma D.P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9354-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures for CK, CK-CPS, and NAGK are known (29Marina A. Alzari P.M. Bravo J. Uriarte M. Barcelona B. Fita I. Rubio V. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Ramón-Maiques S. Marina A. Uriarte M. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Ramón-Maiques S. Marino A. Gil-Ortiz F. Fita I. Rubio V. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the assignment of the phosphate binding site has been supported by the sequence information. Omori et al. (19Omori K. Suzuki S. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) identified a motif common to GKs and AKs, which they suggested to be part of the catalytic site. This motif (Region II in Fig. 1), which can be recognized in other members of the amino acid kinase family, has been corroborated by the three-dimensional sequence information to contain part of the nucleotide and aminoacyl binding sites. To identify residues in GK that contribute to allosteric regulation and to gain insights into the structure-function relationship of GK enzyme, we carried out random mutagenesis of the tomPRO1 DNA to alter the allosteric properties of the enzyme. The tomPRO1clone, which has been isolated from a tomato cDNA library by complementation of a proB (GK) mutation in E. coli, specifies GK and GPR as two separate polypeptides in two non-overlapping open reading frames, similar to prokaryotic operons (15Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Fujita T. LaRosa P.C. Locy R. Clithero J. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8249-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GK and GPR polypeptides encoded by the tomPRO1 locus are more similar to prokaryotic enzymes than to eukaryotic counterparts, suggesting that GK may have been incorporated into the tomato nuclear genome from a prokaryote by horizontal gene transfer (13Fujita T. Maggio A. Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although unusual for eukaryotic transcripts, a similar bi-cistronic organization has also been observed in a locus specifying two subunits of another amino acid biosynthetic enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase in alfalfa (33Zhou Z. Metcalf A.E. Lovatt C.J. Hyman B.C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ThetomPRO1 GK seems to be suitable for the analysis of the determinants of allosteric control because it is shorter by ∼100 amino acid residues in its C terminus than most other prokaryotic GKs. Based on sequence comparisons, this ∼100-amino acid tail has been suggested to constitute an RNA binding domain (34Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), but the relevance of this element to the activity or regulation of GK is unknown. ThetomPRO1 GK nevertheless contains the essentials for catalysis and is subject to proline feedback inhibition (15Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Fujita T. LaRosa P.C. Locy R. Clithero J. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8249-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the identification and analysis of 13 different amino acid substitutions at 9 different positions in tomPRO1 GK that eliminated feedback regulation by proline, and we discuss the possible roles of these amino acids in a predicted model structure of GK. Minimal medium used was M63 (35Cohen G.N. Rickenberg R.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1956; 91: 693-720Google Scholar) containing 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mm thiamine-HCl unless otherwise stated. M63 was supplemented, as indicated, with a mixture of 19 amino acids consisting of 0.2 mm solutions each of the protein amino acids except proline. In media containing 0.6m NaCl, we used an 18-amino acid mixture that contained 0.2 mm each amino acid except proline and cysteine (because the latter amino acid has been shown to be inhibitory in media of high osmolality (36Csonka L.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). Complex medium was LB (37Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1980Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml Ap as indicated. When used, the proline analog 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline (Dhp) (Sigma) was present at 1.5 mm. Basic techniques of DNA manipulation were carried out according to the procedures described by Sambrook et al. (38Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pPRO1 is a derivative BluescriptKSII+ carrying the tomPRO1 locus (15Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Fujita T. LaRosa P.C. Locy R. Clithero J. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8249-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To introduce mutations into the tomPRO1 GK, this plasmid was transformed into the E. coli mutator strain XL-1 Red (mutD mutS mutT) according to a supplier's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transformants were inoculated to LB plates containing Ap and grown at 37 °C for 26–32 h. Plates containing the transformant colonies were taken up and pooled in 2 ml of LB, and plasmids were isolated from the pooled transformants with the Qiagen plasmid purification procedure (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). This plasmid preparation was transformed into the E. coli proline auxotroph CSH26 (ΔproBA), and transformants were selected on LB Ap plates overnight. More than 2 × 104transformant colonies were replicated to M63 + 19-amino acid plates containing Dhp and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Approximately 400 colonies that were able to grow on Dhp-containing plates were streaked again on the same medium. DhpR derivatives that grew faster than CSH26 carrying wild type pPRO1 were tested on M63 + glucose + 18 amino acid plates containing 0.6 m NaCl as a further step in identifying proline overproducing derivatives by virtue of their increased salinity stress tolerance (36Csonka L.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Pilot experiments indicated that increasing the concentration of Dhp above 1.5 mm did not change the frequency of DhpR, suggesting that maximum Dhp uptake was accomplished at 1.5 mm. At this Dhp concentration, strain CSH26 carrying the wild type pPRO1 did not grow at all. Re-transformation of the mutagenized plasmids into an E. coli proline auxotroph followed by subsequent screening for DhpR enabled us to identify mutations in the plasmid-borne gene as opposed to chromosomal loci, such as the putA or proP (proline transport) genes, where mutations could also result in DhpR(6Csonka L.N. Baich A. Herrmann K.M. Somerville R.L. Amino Acids: Biosynthesis and Genetic Regulation. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1983: 35-51Google Scholar). Derivatives of strain CSH26 carrying the wild type or mutated pPRO1 plasmids were grown overnight in LB plus Ap, and 0.1-ml samples were inoculated to LB Ap and grown overnight at 30 °C. The lawn of cells was taken up in 5 ml of LB, sedimented by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mmHEPES.KOH (pH 7.2) containing 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme. The crude extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatants were used to measure GK/GPR-coupled activity in 50 mm MOPS.KOH (pH 6.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 75 mm sodium glutamate, 4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm NADPH, and various concentrations of proline, as described by Garcı́a-Rı́oset al. (15Garcı́a-Rı́os M. Fujita T. LaRosa P.C. Locy R. Clithero J. Bressan R.A. Csonka L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8249-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The GK/GPR-coupled activity was determined as the rate of NADPH consumption (decrease inA340), and the enzyme specific activity was expressed as nmol of NADPH consumed (min·mg of cell protein)−1. CSH26 derivatives carrying wild type or mutant versions of pPRO1 were inoculated into liquid M63 supplemented with 20 mm glucose, 0.2 mm thiamine, and 18 amino acids and grown at 30 °C toA600 of 1.0. Lysozyme was added to 100 μg/ml, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Culture media were passed through 0.22-μm membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and mixed vigorously with a drop of CHCl3 to kill surviving cells, and the CHCl3 was separated by centrifugation. Proline content in the supernatant was measured by bioassay usingSalmonella typhimurium strain TL131 (ΔproBA-47 putA842::Tn5). In this strain, in which proline biosynthesis is blocked by the ΔproBA-47 mutation and proline catabolism is blocked by theputA842::Tn5 mutation, the biomass yield is linearly dependent on the extracellular proline concentration in the range of 0–200 μm (39Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2374-2378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain TL131 was cultured in M63 with 20 mm glucose, 18 amino acids, and 0.2 mm proline at 37 °C for 12 h, collected by centrifugation, washed with the original volume of H2O to minimize proline carryover, and resuspended at the original cell density in M63 with 20 mm glucose. The suspension was inoculated at 1:200 dilution into 2 ml of cell lysates of the proline-overproducing strains to be tested, glucose was added to 20 mm, the cells were grown at 37 °C for ∼24 h, and the final cell yield was determined as the A600. Because A600 is not proportional to the cell density at A600 > 1, for those cultures that reached this high density, the A600 was determined on appropriate dilutions. A standard curve of the cell yield as a function of proline concentration was generated with strain TL131, grown under identical conditions in M63 containing 20 mmglucose, 18 amino acids, and various input concentrations of proline. DNA sequences were determined using automated fluorescent sequence (ALFexpress;Amersham Biosciences) or by the DNA sequencing service of Iowa State University. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed with programs in the Genetic Computer group (GCG) package of the University of Wisconsin. Amino acid sequence alignment was performed using PILEUP program and manually adjusted. As there were no three-dimensional structures available for GKs from various organisms, we searched the Protein Data Bank for homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structures. The amino acid sequence oftomPRO1 GK was submitted to 3D-PSSM servers (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/∼3dpssm), and CK, CK-CPS, NAGK (Protein Data Bank entries 1B7B, 1E19, and 1GS5 respectively) were identified with the highest PSSM scores. Other modeling servers (GTOP, spock.genes.nig.ac.jp/∼genome/gtop-j.html; UCLA-DOE fold server, fold.doe-mbi.ucla.edu; PredictProtein server, www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein; 3D-Jigsaw, www.bmm.icnet.uk/servers/3djigsaw) were used to search modeling templates to tomPRO1 GK and returned the same proteins as templates. A predicted tertiary model of tomPRO1 GK, based on crystal structures of these enzymes, was built and drawn using program Insight II, Homology and Discover (Accelrys, Tokyo, Japan). Wild type E. coli is inhibited on minimal medium by the proline analog Dhp (40Tristram H. Thurston C.F. Nature. 1966; 212: 74-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because high level accumulation of proline antagonizes Dhp, proline overproducing mutants can be recovered by selecting DhpR derivatives on minimal media (36Csonka L.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Random mutations were introduced into tomPRO1 GK by propagating pPRO1 in the mutator strain XL-1 Red (mutD mutS mutT). A pool of mutagenized pPRO1 plasmids was transformed into CSH26 (ΔproBA), and derivatives carrying mutations in thetomPRO1 gene that confer DhpR were obtained, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasmid DNA was isolated from 34 DhpR derivatives, transformed into strain CSH26, selecting ApR, and re-tested for DhpR. Of the 34 plasmid lines, 32 proved to be able to confer DhpR in the second round, confirming that this phenotype was caused by mutations on the plasmid. The tomPRO1 gene contains a unique HpaI site between codons 186 and 187 of the GPR open reading frame, downstream of the GK sequence; it is possible to obtain the entire open reading frame specifying a functional GK without active GPR by deleting the sequences 3′ to this HpaI site (data not shown). GPR-coding sequences were removed in this manner from 3 of the 32 mutant pPRO1 plasmids, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into E. coli proB mutant G13, which is deficient in GK but has GPR (41Mahan M.J. Csonka L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these plasmids not only complemented the proBmutation of strain G13 strain but also conferred DhpR (data not shown), suggesting that the latter phenotype was due to mutation(s) within the GK sequence of tomPRO1. These data were consistent with the previous observations that single amino acid mutations in GK or the GK domain of bifunctional P5CS could result in proline analog resistance and loss of allosteric control (19Omori K.

The nature and location of mutations in the GK region of tomPRO1 from each of the 32 plasmids were determined by DNA sequence analysis. Because previous mutations that conferred resistance to proline analogs have been reported to lie in the N-terminal third of GK (23Csonka L.N. Gelvin S.B. Goodner B.W. Orser C.S. Siemieniak D.

https://openalex.org/W2008557114,"Signal transduction in biological systems typically involves receptor proteins that possess an extracytosolic sensory domain connected to a cytosolic catalytic domain. Relatively little is known about the mechanism by which the signal is transmitted from the sensory site to the catalytic site. At least in the case of Tar (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein for sensing aspartate) ofEscherichia coli, vertical piston-like displacements of one transmembrane segment relative to the other within the monomer induced by ligand binding has been shown to modulate the catalytic activity of the cytosolic domain. The ArcB sensor kinase of E. coli is a transmembrane protein without a significant periplasmic domain. Here, we explore how the signal is conveyed to the catalytic site by analyzing the property of various Tar-ArcB hybrids. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the piston-like displacement that operates in Tar, the catalytic activity of ArcB is set by altering the orientation of the cytosolic domain of one monomer relative to the other in the homodimer. Thus, ArcB represents a distinct family of membrane receptor proteins whose catalytic activity is determined by rotational movements of the cytosolic domain. Signal transduction in biological systems typically involves receptor proteins that possess an extracytosolic sensory domain connected to a cytosolic catalytic domain. Relatively little is known about the mechanism by which the signal is transmitted from the sensory site to the catalytic site. At least in the case of Tar (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein for sensing aspartate) ofEscherichia coli, vertical piston-like displacements of one transmembrane segment relative to the other within the monomer induced by ligand binding has been shown to modulate the catalytic activity of the cytosolic domain. The ArcB sensor kinase of E. coli is a transmembrane protein without a significant periplasmic domain. Here, we explore how the signal is conveyed to the catalytic site by analyzing the property of various Tar-ArcB hybrids. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the piston-like displacement that operates in Tar, the catalytic activity of ArcB is set by altering the orientation of the cytosolic domain of one monomer relative to the other in the homodimer. Thus, ArcB represents a distinct family of membrane receptor proteins whose catalytic activity is determined by rotational movements of the cytosolic domain. The ArcB/A (anoxic redox control) two-component system ofEscherichia coli regulates the expression of more than 30 operons depending on the redox conditions of growth (1Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. Landes, Georgetown, TX1996: 361-382Crossref Google Scholar, 2Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular biology.

A. 1988; 85: 1888-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This system consists of ArcB as the transmembrane sensor kinase and ArcA as the cognate response regulator (Fig. 1). ArcB is unorthodox in possessing an elaborate cytosolic structure that comprises three catalytic domains: a primary transmitter with a conserved His residue at position 292, a receiver with a conserved Asp at position 576, and a secondary transmitter with a conserved His at position 717 (4Iuchi S. Matsuda Z. Fujiwara T. Lin E.C.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Ishige K. Nagasawa S. Tokishita S.-I. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5195-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ArcA is a typical response regulator possessing an NH2 terminus receiver domain with a conserved Asp residue at position 54 and a COOH terminus helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (1Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. Landes, Georgetown, TX1996: 361-382Crossref Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation at His292, a reaction that is enhanced by several fermentation metabolites such as d-lactate, pyruvate, and acetate (6Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35950-35954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is then sequentially transferred to ArcA via a His292 → Asp576 → His717 → Asp54 phospho-relay (7Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ArcA (ArcA-P), in turn, represses the expression of many operons involved in respiratory metabolism (1Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. Landes, Georgetown, TX1996: 361-382Crossref Google Scholar) and activates other operons encoding proteins involved in fermentative metabolism (10Sawers G. Suppmann B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3474-3478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Brondsted L. Atlung T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5423-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions, ArcB autophosphorylation is curtailed and the protein catalyzes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P via an Asp54 → His717 → Asp576 reverse phospho-relay (12Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Another unorthodox structural feature of ArcB is its short periplasmic sequence of only about 16 amino acid residues (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in contrast to typical sensor kinases that have a substantial periplasmic domain for environmental sensing. Unexpectedly, replacing various segments within the ArcB membrane region by a counterpart of MalF (a subunit of maltose permease without any sequence homology with ArcB) was without significant impact on the signal transduction process (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). From these observations it was concluded that the stretch of ArcB delimited by the two transmembrane segments (amino acid residues 22–77) does not directly participate in signal recognition but rather serves as an anchor to keep the protein close to the source of the signal (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, the oxidized forms of ubiquinone and menaquinone electron carriers, accumulating during aerobiosis, were shown to act as direct negative signals that inhibit autophosphorylation of ArcB (14Georgellis D. Kwon O. Lin E.C.C. Science. 2001; 292: 2314-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This would explain the importance of tethering the sensor kinase to the membrane. Otherwise, the lipophilic quinones located exclusively in the membrane bilayer would only be able to silence a small fraction of the ArcB molecules at any given time, since most of them would be distributed throughout the cytosol. Indeed, liberation of ArcB from the membrane by genetic excision of its NH2-terminal transmembrane region was shown to result in a constitutively active kinase in vivo (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the signals, as well as several effectors, for ArcB have been identified and considerable knowledge about the steps of signal transduction and decay has been gained, the mechanism by which the signal is conducted from the quinone sensory site to the autophosphorylation site of ArcB remains elusive. Several mechanisms have been proposed for signaling across biological membranes by receptors that possess an external ligand-binding sensory domain connected to a cytosolic catalytic domain. The mechanisms include conformational changes of the functional dimer brought about by ligand-induced vertical displacement of one transmembrane segment relative to the other within the monomer (piston mechanism) or by rotational movement of the cytosolic domain (15Kim S.-H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 457-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although the rotational model is yet to be demonstrated experimentally, good evidence for the piston model emerged from studies on Tar, the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein for sensing aspartate in E. coli. Tar has two transmembrane segments, TM 1 (amino acids residues 7–30) and TM 2 (amino acids residues 189–212), and forms a stable dimer in the cytoplasmic membrane (17Russo A.F. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1983; 220: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The periplasmic portion of Tar functions as the signal input domain by binding various ligands such as aspartate. Results from disulfide cross-linking experiments suggested that the aspartate binding does not affect the dimerization status but induce global changes in the conformational structure of Tar (18Falke J.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1597-1600Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments based on spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that binding of the periplasmic domain to aspartate results in a piston-like displacement of TM 2 relative to TM 1 of Tar (19Ottemann K.M. Xiao W. Shin Y.-K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1751-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Such a displacement would decrease an allosteric interaction between the receptor and the membrane by pushing a cytoplasmic domain away from the membrane, thereby altering the methylation and kinase cascades (16Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 457-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 19Ottemann K.M. Xiao W. Shin Y.-K. Koshland Jr., D.E.

The piston mechanism has been proposed to operate also in membrane bound sensor kinases of two-component signal transduction systems (21Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated for the bacterial EnvZ protein, an orthodox sensor kinase with only a single cytoplasmic transmitter domain (22Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The study of EnvZ involved replacing its transmembrane domain with the corresponding domain of Tar. It was found that the kinase activity of the Tar-EnvZ hybrid sensor protein came under the control of periplasmic aspartate (22Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast to EnvZ, ArcB has no periplasmic signal reception domain. The question arises as to whether signal propagation could still involve a piston mechanism. Here we address the problem by analyzing the signaling property of a Tar-ArcB chimeric kinase in which the transmembrane domain of the Tar sensor protein is fused to the cytosolic portion of the ArcB sensor kinase. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB agar, unless otherwise specified. Ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were provided at a final concentration of 50, 12, 40, and 20 μg/ml, respectively. Chromosomal and plasmid DNA were isolated by using respectively the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega) and Quiaprep spin miniprep kit (Quiagen). DNA fragments were recovered from agarose gel by using Quiaquick gel extraction kit (Quiagen). Oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies Inc. PCR were carried out by using the TaqPlus precision PCR system (Stratagene). PCR products were purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Quiagen). Sequence verification of PCR-amplified DNA was performed at Micro Core Facility of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School. To construct a Δtar strain, a 1.4-kb flanking sequence of tarwas prepared by two-step PCR (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from the chromosomal DNA of strain MC4100 with primers DTR-5N (5′-CGCGCGAGATCTATGACCGGTATGACG-3′), DTR-M (5′-CGCAGTCGTGGCTGAGCCGGATCCAACAGCGTGACTACG-3′), and DTR-C (5′-CCCGGGAGATCTTGCGCGTCCACCACAGC-3′). The purified PCR product was digested with BglII and cloned into the BamHI site of pKO3 (23Link A.J. Philips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), resulting in pDTR. Plasmid pDTR was transformed into strains ECL5002 (λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]) and ECL5012 (DarcB::tetrλΦ[lldP′-lacZ]) to delete tar by homologous recombination as described previously (23Link A.J. Philips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), respectively, yielding strains ECL5041 (Δtar λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]) and 5042 (Δtar ΔarcB::tetrλΦ[lldP′-lacZ]). Deletion of tar was confirmed by PCR. To construct Φ(tar-arcB) fusions, PCR were performed using the chromosomal DNA of strain MC4100 (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a template and TAB-N (5′-CCAGGATCCCATATGATTAACCGTATCCGCG-3′) and TAB-1 (5′-CGTGACTCCTCCAGTTGCTCAATGCCGTACCACGCCACC-3′), TAB-2 (5′-CGTGACTCCTCCAGTTGCTCGCGAATGCCGTACCACGCC-3′), TAB-3 (5′-CGTGACTCCTCCAGTTGCTCTCGACGAATGCCGTACCACG-3′), TAB-4 (5′-CGTGACTCCTCCAGTTGCTCCATTCGACGAATGCCGTACC-3′), or TAB-5 (5′-CGTTGTCGTGACTCCTCCATTCGACGAATGCCGTACC-3′) as primers. Each purified PCR product and B3NRU (5′-GTAATGTCGCGACCAAAGCCCATCAAACCG-3′) were used as primers for the second PCR by using pABS (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and PstI. The 0.7-kb fragments were gel-purified and cloned between the corresponding sites of the pIBW (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This process yielded, respectively, pTAB1 through pTAB5. These plasmids were used to integrate the Φ(tar-arcB) sequences into the chromosome of the strain ECL5042 by the gene replacement techniques as described previously (13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This process yielded, respectively, strains ECL5043 (Φ[tar1–212-arcB78–778]::kanrΔtar ΔarcB λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]), ECL5044 (Φ[tar1–213-arcB78–778]::kanrΔtar ΔarcB λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]), ECL5045 (Φ[tar1–214-arcB78–778]::kanrΔtar ΔarcB λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]), ECL5046 (Φ[tar1–215-arcB78–778]::kanrΔtar ΔarcB λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]), and ECL5047 (Φ[tar1–215-arcB81–778]::kanrΔtar ΔarcB λΦ[lldP′-lacZ]). Strains were grown in minimal medium (24Iuchi S. Chepuri V. Fu H.-A. Gennis R.B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 20 mmd-xylose with 20 mml-lactate as a specific inducer (25Dong J.-M. Taylor J.S. Latour D.J. Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6671-6678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For aerobic growth, cells were cultured in 5 ml of medium in 250-ml baffled flasks at 37 °C with shaking (300 rpm). For anaerobic growth, cells were cultured in a screw-capped tube filled with medium up to the rim at 37 °C and stirred by a magnet. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed and expressed in Miller units. Aerobically grown cultures were harvested by centrifugation during mid-exponential growth. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gel), and the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-ECL filter (Amersham Biosciences). The filter was equilibrated in TTBS buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min and incubated in blocking buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. ArcB polyclonal antibodies, raised against His6-ArcB78–520 (9Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was added at a dilution of 1:10,000 to the filter and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibody was detected by using anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). An in-frame fusedtar-arcB sequence encoding Tab-1 (Fig.2, A and B), composed of the transmembrane domain of Tar (residues 1–212) and the cytosolic domains of ArcB (residues 78–778), was prepared. The DNA was incorporated into the chromosome by homologous recombination at thearcB locus of a host strain bearing an ArcA-P repressible λΦ(lldP′-lacZ) operon fusion (9Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Boyd D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2960-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In all strains studied the chromosomal tar sequence was deleted to prevent heterodimer formation between the wild-type Tar and Tar-ArcB hybrids. Western blot analysis of the cell extract with polyclonal antiserum raised against purified His6-ArcB78–520 (9Kwon O. Georgellis D. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) showed the presence of the hybrid protein but not the wild-type ArcB (Fig. 2C). Moreover, Tab-1 was produced at about the same level as that found in the isogenic arcB+ strain and migrated electrophoretically at a rate corresponding to a molecular weight of 103 kDa instead of the 88 kDa expected of the wild-type ArcB. This increment in molecular weight is consistent with the extra 135 amino acid residues present in the Tar-ArcB hybrid. The in vivo signaling ability of the hybrid sensor was determined by analyzing the expression of an ArcA-P repressible reporter, Φ(lldP′-lacZ). Surprisingly, Φ(lldP′-lacZ) was strongly repressed in both aerobically and anaerobically grown cells (Fig. 3). This would indicate that Tar1–212-ArcB78–778is highly active as an autokinase even under aerobic conditions, despite its being anchored to the plasma membrane. It thus appears that a proper mode of anchorage of the cytosolic domains of ArcB might be critical for redox signal transduction. To test whether aspartate could influence the signaling activity of Tab-1, the cells were grown aerobically or anaerobically in the presence or absence of the ligand. No aspartate effect on the expression of Φ(lldP′-lacZ) was found (data not shown), suggesting that a piston-like mechanism is not involved in the regulation of the ArcB kinase activity. The unfavorable evidence for a piston mechanism in ArcB signal transduction led us to examine the alternative model that involves rotational movements of the cytosolic domain around its membrane anchor. It should be noted that ArcB, like many other sensor kinases of two-components systems, functions as a homodimer that catalyzes intermolecular phosphoryl group transfers. 1D. Georgellis, O. Kwon, and E. C. C. Lin, unpublished data. Consequently, the rotational orientation of one subunit relative to the other subunit may be critical for the phosphorylation cascade. To test the importance of the relative orientations of the two ArcB segments imposed by the dimeric membrane anchor, we constructed a series of hybrids with different spatial relationships between the Tar anchor and the cytosolic ArcB parts. This was accomplished by fusing a set of Tar transmembrane domains with progressively extended COOH-terminal region to a constant cytosolic portion of ArcB: Tar1–213-ArcB78–778 (Tab-2), Tar1–214-ArcB78–778 (Tab-3), and Tar1–215-ArcB78–778 (Tab-4) (Fig.2B). The procedure used was similar to that described for the construction of Tab-1. Since the rigid helical structure of the second transmembrane segment of Tar protrudes into the cytoplasm, each extra residue of Tar added at the Tar-ArcB junction should rotate the attached ArcB kinase by ∼100°. Western blot analysis showed that all Tab hybrids were produced about the same level as Tab-1 and the wild-type ArcB. Moreover, all the Tab hybrids migrated electrophoretically at approximately the same rate (Fig.2C). The in vivo signaling properties of these fusion proteins were then analyzed by comparing the aerobic and anaerobic Φ(lldP′-lacZ) expression (Fig. 3). Tab-2, possessing one more amino acid residue of Tar at the junction than Tab-1, was inactive as a kinase, as indicated by the derepression of Φ(lldP′-lacZ) under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions (Fig. 3). The catalytic inactivity of this hybrid is likely due to failure of intermolecular phosphoryl group transfer at one or more steps of the phospho-relay, irrespective of whether the ArcB moiety is in the “on” or “off” conformation. Tab-3, possessing two additional amino acid residues at the junction, behaved like wild-type ArcB in response to altered redox conditions of growth. Tab-4, possessing three additional amino acid residues should have a similar spatial relationship between the two ArcB moieties as in Tab-1. This dimer once again became constitutively active as a kinase. Because insertion of amino acids in the junction region of the chimeric protein not only alters the topological relationship of the anchor to its attached catalytic domain but also the local amino acid sequence of the linker region, a control hybrid kinase, Tar1–215-ArcB81–778 (Tab-5), was constructed as a control. In this construct, the Tar moiety of the hybrid was extended by three amino acid residues on the COOH-terminal side at the expense of three amino acid residues on the NH2-terminal side of ArcB. Thus the ArcB portion of this hybrid should have the same orientation as that of the constitutively active Tab-1. Indeed, Tab-5 turned out to be also constitutively active as a kinase. Finally, the effect of aspartate on the signaling properties of all the chimeras was tested. None of the constructs responded to the ligand (data not shown), indicating that the piston model does not apply to ArcB. Therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the quinone electron carriers, previously identified as the direct signal for ArcB, act by altering the orientation of the cytosolic domain of one monomer relative to that of the other monomer. Since the helical structure of the second transmembrane segment of Tar (26Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.-H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 27Lynch B.A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Pakula A. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4144-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) is known, it is possible to predict the relative orientation of the two ArcB moieties in each dimer. It is assumed that the α-helix of the second transmembrane segment remains in a constant position for each chimera. Fig.4 presents the predicted orientation of the three representative chimeras: Tab-2, Tab-3, and Tab-4. If we use the Glu residue at position 81 of ArcB as a marker, it can be seen that the two Glu81 residues of Tab-2 are located on diametrically opposite sites of the homodimer. This configuration disables the kinase activity irrespective of the redox condition. The addition of an extra amino acid residue at the fusion junction brings the two Glu81residues closer together in Tab-3 because of a 100° clockwise rotation of each monomer relative to Tab-2. The relative orientation of the kinase moieties in Tab-3, which is redox-regulated, most likely represent that of the wild-type ArcB. The addition of two extra amino acid residues at the fusion junction brings the two Glu81residues even closer to each other in Tab-4 as the result of a 200° clockwise rotation of each monomer relative to Tab-2. The orientation of the cytoplasmic ArcB moieties in Tab-4 is very similar to that in Tab-1. Tab-4 exhibits constitutively kinase activity, like Tab-1. A potentially informative approach to verify a signaling mechanism that depends on the relative orientation of the cytosolic portion of a membrane protein with respect to the membrane attached portion would be the use of cysteine-cysteine cross-linking analysis. Such a strategy has been successfully employed to study α-helix interactions in analogous systems (20Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Lee G.F. Burrows G.G. Lebert M.R. Dutton D.P. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29920-29927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, inverted vesicles embedded with various mutant hybrids containing cysteine substitutions in the helical cytosolic domain of the ArcB portion could be prepared and changes in the ability of different cysteine residues to form disulfide bridges depending on the type of hybrid could be examined by Western blotting. On the basis of the catalytic properties of various Tab constructs, we postulate that the mechanism of ArcB signal transduction relies on rotational movements of its cytosolic portion. ArcB thus appears to represent a distinct family of membrane signal transduction proteins. It is of interest to note that the evolution of such a rotational switch mechanism would require coadaptation of a signal receptor protein to function as a dimer. The use of the transmembrane domain of Tar to study chimeric sensor proteins could be applied in two ways. First, this strategy should be useful in distinguishing the piston mechanism from the rotation mechanism in a signal transduction process by a membrane protein. Second, the approach should allow the generation of constitutively active sensor kinases. This can be achieved either by providing aspartate in the growth medium, as in the case of the Tar-EnvZ chimera (22Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), or by altering the orientation of the catalytic domain through addition or subtraction of amino acid residues in the helical region that links the transmembrane to the cytosolic domain, as in the case of the Tar-ArcB chimera. Because the actual signals of most membrane-bound sensor kinases remain unknown, constitutively active sensor kinases could serve as a tool for investigating the downstream processes of each system under in vivo conditions."

Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.-H. Stamenkovitch D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Le Beau M.M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). We have previously presented evidence suggesting a role for Egr1 in suppressing tumor cell growth (2de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Fan Y. Liu C. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3633-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Huang R.P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M.M. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Specifically, we demonstrated that overexpression of Egr1 in transformed cells suppresses growth in soft agar as well as inhibits their tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, it was shown that the DNA-binding domain of Egr1 is necessary for its ability to suppress tumor formation, highlighting the importance of its transactivation of downstream genes in this process (4Huang R.-P. Liu C.-T. Fan Y. Mercola D.A. Adamson E.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results indicate that transformed cells can be induced to revert to normal growth patterns following the re-expression of Egr1. These studies suggest that the loss of Egr1 may result in the loss of cellular homeostasis because of a deficit in Egr1-responsive genes and that this may play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. Clearly, the identification of a genetic profile of Egr1-responsive genes would constitute a significant step in understanding the different activities associated with Egr1, including its role in cellular growth control. Over the past several years there have been numerous studies identifying various individual Egr1 target genes in diverse cell and tissue types. Reported Egr1 targets include TGF-β1, 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRTreverse transcriptase1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRTreverse transcriptase platelet-derived growth factors A and B, basic fibroblast growth factor, tissue factor, interleukin 2, and CD44 to mention only a few (reviewed in Ref. 5Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E.D. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have focused on the in vitroanalysis of an individual target gene in a specific cell type under a defined set of experimental conditions. As a step toward a more complete understanding of the biological role for a transcription factor, it would be informative to be able to identify in vivo target genes.Currently, few techniques are available to address this issue. Both differential display and subtractive hybridization analyses are aimed at isolating messages that are up- or down-regulated from pools of RNA isolated from cells or tissues either positive or negative for the gene in question. One clear drawback with both of these techniques is that they select for any RNA message that shows a change in expression pattern. Therefore, when screening for changes in gene expression induced by a transcription factor, these methods do not select purely for direct targets. Recently we and others have described a method for the direct isolation of protein-bound DNA involving in vivochemical cross-linking using formaldehyde followed by immunoprecipitation from chromatin (ChIP). This method was successfully used in applications ranging from examining chromatin structures surrounding the polycomb group proteins during Drosophiladevelopment (6Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the identification of nuclear matrix attachment sites (7de Belle I. Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J.

BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, the same cross-linking method has been used to examine nucleosomal structure, transcription factor occupancy of promoter sites, regions of histone acetylation, and mapping of telomere silencing protein binding, illustrating its broad application utility (9Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 10Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M.

Recently, coupling the ChIP approach with hybridization to genomic or promoter region DNA microarrays has allowed a comprehensive characterization of in vivo transcription factor DNA binding patterns (13Weinmann A.S.

Nature. 2001; 409: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar).In this report we have extended ChIP technology, allowing gene discovery of Egr1 target genes by multiplex PCR. Moreover, we present the cloning of a newly identified gene, called TOE1, as an Egr1 target gene. We have characterized TOE1 as a cell growth inhibitor by altering the cell cycle through the induction of p21. Furthermore, we show that the increase in the p21 level is consistent with a mechanism involving TGF-β1.DISCUSSIONWith these studies we report, for the first time, the application of chromatin immunoprecipitation to cDNA cloning using a form of multiplex PCR. We have demonstrated that this technique was successful not only in cloning transcription factor target genes but also in the identification of a new target for Egr1. Together our results indicated that the multiplex amplification produced a genuine cDNA and that the cloned DNA represented an expressed gene. This newly cloned gene encodes a 510-amino acid protein that we have shown to be an authentic Egr1 target gene. To confirm that the gene codes for an endogenously expressed protein, we have recently raised a polyclonal antibody using a synthetic peptide epitope derived from the predicted amino acid sequence. Preliminary testing has shown reactivity against both recombinant and an endogenous protein of identical molecular mass, suggesting that the cDNA is expressed at both the mRNA and protein level.During the course of these studies an unpublished and unnamed cDNA generated through a library sequencing effort was deposited in the GenBankTM data base that was identical to our cloned cDNA (nucleotide accession number AK024011). Based on the sum of our observations, we have called this cDNA the HUGO approved name and symbol TOE1 for target ofEgr1. Expression of TOE1 was detected in all of the adult human tissues examined but at varying levels, indicating that the regulation of this gene may vary depending on cell or tissue type.Examination of the sequence of TOE1 did not reveal conserved domain structures apart from a single potential zinc finger and a possible nuclear localization signal. Immunostaining confirmed that TOE1 was found localized to the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Despite the absence of a recognized DNA-binding domain, we have examined the possibility that TOE1 might participate in transcriptional regulation. However, TOE1 cloned as a GAL4 fusion failed to activate a GAL4-binding site reporter, suggesting that TOE1 alone is not sufficient for transcriptional regulation. The possibility remains that TOE1 can participate in transcriptional regulation through protein interactions and indirect DNA association not recapitulated in the GAL4 fusion experiments. Although no extended homology to any known gene was noted by BLAST searches, a limited region of homology to poly(A)-specific deadenylation nuclease was revealed. We are currently investigating the possibility that TOE1 may function as a nuclease.To better understand the biological role of TOE1, we examined the effects of its expression and noted a dramatic decrease in both the growth rate and colony growth of H4 cells. We found that this was not the result of a general decrease in growth rate but rather was due to a G2 cell cycle phase delay. Furthermore, the G2-specific cell cycle delay correlated with an increase in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Deletion of the nuclear localization signal abrogated this effect, suggesting not only that TOE1 could induce cell cycle-specific G2 pausing but also that its nuclear/nucleolar localization was critical for this function. The localization of TOE1 in the nucleolus may provide further evidence for a role in cell cycle regulation because it has been found that many important cell cycle proteins can be found in the nucleolus as a means of sequestration, thereby limiting their function until the appropriate time (22Bond V.C. Wold B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3221-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Gotta M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Renauld H. Laroche T. Kennedy B.K. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar).Because p21 is also able to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase activities controlling passage through the G1 restriction point, it would be predicted that the TOE1-directed increase in p21 levels would also display a G1 phase pausing. Although we did not see this in log phase growing cells, when cells were synchronized in the M phase and then released to pass through G1, we noted a marked delay in the TOE1-expressing cells (data not shown). This suggested that the increase in p21 levels was also active at the G1 check point, but this was only seen if cells had been synchronized outside of the G2 phase. Although p21 is well known for its activity in G1 phase pausing, its role in G2 is being increasingly recognized (25Ando T. Kawabe T. Ohara H. Ducommun B. Itoh M. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42971-42977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Evdokiou A. Raggatt L.J. Atkins G.J. Findlay D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1738-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism by which TOE1 affects cell growth is through transcriptional up-regulation of the p21 gene. We have not, however, formally ruled out the possibility that the increase in p21 levels might be due to an increase in transcript stability rather than increased expression. Also, we have not completely ruled out a contributing role for p53 in the up-regulation of p21 but have demonstrated that p53 levels and serine 15 phosphorylation were not altered. Further, we have provided evidence that TOE1-dependent TGF-β1 activation may participate in the increase in p21. However, it also remains possible that TOE1 and p53 cooperate in the transactivation of p21 either directly or indirectly. We have preliminary evidence that TOE1 and p53 are able to interact physically, but the significance and specificity of this interaction remain to be analyzed. 3I. de Belle, unpublished observation. Although the precise mechanism of action remains to be studied, our results have shown that expression of TOE1 leads to growth inhibition as well as a decrease in colony forming ability, likely involving the activation of p21. Given that these same features are seen following expression of Egr1, we expect that the downstream target TOE1 plays an important role in executing this physiological function of Egr1 in its proposed role as a tumor suppressor.Finally, It is intriguing to note that the chromosomal location ofTOE1 maps to 1p34.1–35.3. Deletion of the distal portion of 1p accounts for a significant proportion of chromosome 1 aberrations and has been observed in brain, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and other tumor types (27Cheung T.H.

Combined data suggest that chromosome 1p likely harbors one and possibly multiple tumor suppressor genes, and given the growth inhibitory effect of TOE1, we are currently investigating the possibility that TOE1 may also function in this capacity.

This suggested that the increase in p21 levels was also active at the G1 check point, but this was only seen if cells had been synchronized outside of the G2 phase. Although p21 is well known for its activity in G1 phase pausing, its role in G2 is being increasingly recognized (25Ando T. Kawabe T. Ohara H. Ducommun B. Itoh M. Okamoto T. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1738-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mechanism by which TOE1 affects cell growth is through transcriptional up-regulation of the p21 gene. We have not, however, formally ruled out the possibility that the increase in p21 levels might be due to an increase in transcript stability rather than increased expression. Also, we have not completely ruled out a contributing role for p53 in the up-regulation of p21 but have demonstrated that p53 levels and serine 15 phosphorylation were not altered. Further, we have provided evidence that TOE1-dependent TGF-β1 activation may participate in the increase in p21. However, it also remains possible that TOE1 and p53 cooperate in the transactivation of p21 either directly or indirectly. We have preliminary evidence that TOE1 and p53 are able to interact physically, but the significance and specificity of this interaction remain to be analyzed. 3I. de Belle, unpublished observation. Although the precise mechanism of action remains to be studied, our results have shown that expression of TOE1 leads to growth inhibition as well as a decrease in colony forming ability, likely involving the activation of p21. Given that these same features are seen following expression of Egr1, we expect that the downstream target TOE1 plays an important role in executing this physiological function of Egr1 in its proposed role as a tumor suppressor. Finally, It is intriguing to note that the chromosomal location ofTOE1 maps to 1p34.1–35.3. Deletion of the distal portion of 1p accounts for a significant proportion of chromosome 1 aberrations and has been observed in brain, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and other tumor types (27Cheung T.H.

Combined data suggest that chromosome 1p likely harbors one and possibly multiple tumor suppressor genes, and given the growth inhibitory effect of TOE1, we are currently investigating the possibility that TOE1 may also function in this capacity.

Based on sequence comparisons and structural models, both subunits are predicted to have adenine nucleotide binding sites. This was tested by alanine replacement of residues in putative sites in each subunit. Targets included adjacent aspartate/isoleucine residues implicated as important for determining cofactor specificity in related dehydrogenases and a residue in each IDH subunit in a position occupied by histidine in other cofactor binding sites. The primary kinetic effects of D286A/I287A and of H281A replacements in IDH2 were found to be a dramatic reduction in apparent affinity of the holoenzyme for NAD+ and a concomitant reduction inVmax. Ligand binding assays also showed that the H281A mutant enzyme fails to bind NAD+ under conditions that are saturating for the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the primary effect of corresponding D279A/D280A and of R274A replacements in IDH1 is a reduction in holoenzyme binding of AMP, with concomitant alterations in kinetic and isocitrate binding properties normally associated with activation by this allosteric effector. These results suggest that the nucleotide cofactor binding site is primarily contributed by the IDH2 subunit, whereas the homologous nucleotide binding site in IDH1 has evolved for regulatory binding of AMP. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the catalytic isocitrate binding sites are comprised of residues primarily contributed by IDH2, whereas sites for regulatory binding of isocitrate are contributed by analogous residues of IDH1. In this study, we also demonstrate that a prerequisite for holoenzyme binding of NAD+ is binding of isocitrate/Mg2+ at the IDH2 catalytic site.

In particular, because of allosteric activation of the mammalian enzyme by ADP (1Chen R.F. Plaut G.W.E. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and of the yeast enzyme by AMP, IDH is proposed to regulate metabolic flux in response to energy needs of the cell (2Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae IDH is an octamer composed of four each of two homologous subunits, IDH1 and IDH2 (3Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature polypeptides are similar in size (349 and 354 amino acid residues, respectively) and share 42% residue sequence identity (4Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Both subunits are essential for holoenzyme structure and function, although, as described below, catalytic function has been primarily attributed to IDH2 whereas regulatory functions have been assigned to IDH1 (6Cupp J.R.

Mammalian IDH contains three different types of subunits that share significant homology with those of yeast IDH, an α-subunit with catalytic functions similar to those of yeast IDH2, and β- and γ-subunits that are presumed to impart regulatory properties (9Nichols B.J. Hall L. Perry A.C.F. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Nichols B.J. Perry A.C. Hall L. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Although crystallographic data are unavailable for yeast and mammalian IDHs, these enzymes share substantial similarity in sequence with several bacterial decarboxylating dehydrogenases for which three-dimensional structures are available. As a family, these dehydrogenases are unique in that they lack the classic Rossman fold described for other enzymes that bind NAD(P)+ (11Rossman M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Particularly useful for analyses of yeast IDH are structures reported for Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (12Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The former is a homodimeric NADP+-specific enzyme that functions in the bacterial tricarboxylic acid cycle, but that is regulated by phosphorylation rather than by allostery (16Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is a homodimeric NAD+-specific enzyme in the leucine biosynthetic pathway. Consistent with catalysis of similar reactions, these bacterial enzymes share some similarity in primary structure (∼25% residue identity) and substantial similarity in three-dimensional structure. Differences between residues in catalytic sites of the enzymes have been instructive for analyses of substrate and cofactor specificity (17Chen R. Greer A. Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Doyle S.A. Fung S.Y. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14348-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Both yeast IDH1 and IDH2 subunits share residue sequence identities of ∼32% with E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase. Based on sequence alignments and modeling, the catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+ binding site of yeast IDH was predicted to be primarily composed of residues from IDH2 (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), because IDH2 contains identities for nine key residues in the catalytic site of the E. coli enzyme (12Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). IDH1, however, contains identities for only five of these nine residues, and was proposed to bind but not catalytically alter isocitrate. These predictions have been confirmed by results summarized in Table I of site-directed mutagenesis studies (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L.

A., Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Doctoral Dissertation, 2000, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX.Google Scholar). Among shared residues in isocitrate binding sites, IDH1 and IDH2 each contain a serine residue analogous to bacterial Ser-113. The latter is the site for phosphorylation of theE. coli enzyme in vivo (16Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a modification that inactivates the enzyme by preventing binding of isocitrate (23Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine replacement of the analogous Ser-98 in IDH2 was found to profoundly reduce catalysis. Similar replacement in Ser-92 of IDH1 had much less of an effect on catalytic capacity; however, it dramatically reduced cooperativity and allosteric activation by AMP (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Replacement of the serine residue in either yeast subunit eliminated half of the holoenzyme isocitrate binding sites, and the combination of these residue replacements in both subunits prevented isocitrate binding (Ref. 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar and Table I). Thus, both the IDH1 and IDH2 sites bind isocitrate but for different kinetic functions. In other studies, the four of nine residues that differ in each of the putative IDH1 and IDH2 isocitrate binding sites were replaced by the corresponding residues in the other subunit site (22Panisko, E. A., Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Doctoral Dissertation, 2000, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX.Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes containing these reciprocal residue replacements in IDH1 (A108R/F136Y/T241D/N245D) and/or in IDH2 (R114A/Y142F/D248T/D252N) were found to retain the wild-type number of isocitrate binding sites (Ref. 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar and Table I), indicating that these replacements were permissive for binding at each site. However, the mutant enzyme with residue replacements in IDH2 retained very little catalytic activity, and the mutant enzyme with residue replacements in IDH1 exhibited no allosteric activation by AMP nor any binding of AMP (20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). Thus, the unique residues in each subunit isocitrate binding site are essential for different functions in catalysis (IDH2 site) or in allosteric regulation (IDH1 site).Table ISummary of effects of residue replacements in isocitrate sites of IDHEnzyme1-aResults of residue replacements were reported by Linet al.

Open table in a new tab Based on these and other results, the homologous yeast IDH subunits appear to be an exceptional model for divergent evolution. The catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+ binding site in IDH2 has been highly conserved, and a similar isocitrate binding site in IDH1 has evolved for regulatory function. In the current study, we use mutagenesis to investigate putative nucleotide binding sites in each subunit. Our hypothesis is that residues important for cofactor NAD+ binding are primarily contributed by IDH2, and that the AMP binding site is comprised of analogous residues of IDH1. A corollary is that residues in the putative NAD+ binding site of IDH2 are likely to be evolutionarily conserved with residues in other cofactor binding sites, whereas analogous residues in the putative AMP binding site in IDH1 are likely to have diverged for binding of the structurally related allosteric activator.Yeast IDH also displays complex interdependencies among various ligands for binding to the enzyme (24Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of isocitrate is a prerequisite for AMP binding, and we have shown the specific nature of this requirement is binding of isocitrate by the regulatory IDH1 site (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). In this report, we also use mutant and wild-type enzymes to investigate the dependence upon citrate or isocitrate to obtain NAD+ binding and the dependence upon Mg2+ for binding of other ligands of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONKinetic and ligand binding analyses described in this report suggest that yeast IDH has distinct but homologous nucleotide binding sites for NAD+ and for AMP. The cofactor binding site contains residues of the IDH2 subunit that are homologous with those in cofactor binding sites of other NAD+-specific decarboxylating dehydrogenases (Fig. 1). Adjacent Asp-286 and Ile-287 residues of IDH2 apparently correspond with adjacent Asp-279 and Ile-280 residues of T. thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, residues implicated as important for cofactor specificity (17Chen R. Greer A. Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases, equivalent positions are occupied by adjacent or nearby lysine (or arginine) and tyrosine residues. Thus, replacement of IDH2 Asp-286 and Ile-287 with alanine residues produces a dramatic reduction in apparent affinity for NAD+ and a concomitant reduction in the catalytic capacity of IDH. Similar effects on affinity for NADP+ and on velocity were reported for mutant enzymes containing replacements for Arg-314 and Tyr-316 residues of mammalian mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (30Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, His-281 of IDH2 is important for cofactor binding, since the most dramatic effect of alanine replacement of this residue is a reduction in affinity for NAD+. His-281 thus appears to be the functional homologue of a specific histidine residue in the cofactor binding sites of the T. thermophilus enzyme (His-274, Ref. 15Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), of the mammalian enzyme mentioned above (His-309, Ref. 31Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5637-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and of E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (His-339, Refs. 13Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unlike the aspartate/isoleucine or lysine/tyrosine pairs described above, this histidine residue apparently functions in binding NAD+ or NADP+ but is not a determinant of cofactor specificity.The yeast IDH1 subunit also contains an aspartate/isoleucine pair at residue positions 279 and 280, but contains an arginine in residue position 274 that aligns with the histidine in position 281 of IDH2. We have shown that the primary effect associated with alanine replacements for both types of residues in IDH1 is a significant reduction in holoenzyme affinity for AMP. The consequence is a defect in allosteric activation, i.e. for these mutant enzymes, isocitrate binding is unaffected by the presence of AMP. Despite similar effects on holoenzyme affinity for AMP, the D279A/I280A and R274A replacements in IDH1 have different kinetic effects. The latter replacement has a greater effect on apparent Vmax values and significantly reduces cooperativity with respect to isocitrate. These results suggest that, in addition to participating in binding of AMP, IDH1 Arg-274 may function in communication between regulatory and catalytic sites.Overall, results obtained in this study suggest that related but unique sites have evolved in the homologous subunits to facilitate binding of different nucleotide ligands of IDH. The differential functions of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits in nucleotide binding are consistent with previous results showing that both subunits also contribute isocitrate binding sites (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar), but that the site comprised primarily of residues from IDH2 is catalytic whereas the site comprised primarily of residues from IDH1 supports regulatory properties of the holoenzyme. Thus, the catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+- and NAD+ binding sites are contributed by IDH2, whereas the regulatory isocitrate- and AMP binding sites are contributed by IDH1. As might be expected, the IDH2 catalytic site(s) exhibits a more significant conservation of residues in catalytic sites of related enzymes (20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of IDH1, some residue conservation is observed for binding of structurally related ligands, but key residue differences appear to be important elements in the evolution of regulatory properties of this complex allosteric enzyme.A key to the communication between catalytic and regulatory sites in IDH is that, while each ligand binding site is primarily comprised of residues from one type of subunit, a few residues are apparently contributed by the other type of subunit. For example, results of previous mutagenesis studies (8Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are consistent with the conclusion that of nine residues in the IDH2 catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+binding site, two are contributed by IDH1 and, reciprocally, the analogous two residues of nine in the IDH1 regulatory isocitrate binding site are contributed by IDH2. These and other results from yeast two-hybrid studies (8Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) support a model for a heterodimer of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits as the basic structural/functional unit of the holoenzyme. Consistent with reciprocal subunit contributions to isocitrate binding sites, we have also reported kinetic analyses of other mutant enzymes that indicate similar potential intersubunit contributions to nucleotide binding sites (7Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies will be expanded by replacement of other residues with similar putative intersubunit functions and by direct ligand binding analyses.In current and previous studies (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar), we have also evaluated some of the complex interrelationships among various ligands for binding by yeast IDH. Cumulative results suggest the following conclusions: (A) Despite residue differences in the isocitrate binding sites, the catalytic site in IDH2 and the regulatory site in IDH1 bind isocitrate with similar affinity. Binding at catalytic and regulatory sites is independent, since isocitrate binding at either site is not affected by loss of isocitrate binding at the other site (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). (B) Nucleotide binding sites are also independent of each other, because residue replacements examined in this study primarily affect either NAD+ or AMP binding (Fig. 4). (C) Binding of isocitrate by the catalytic IDH2 site, but not by the regulatory IDH1 site, requires Mg2+. Thus, the substrate bound by the enzyme is a complex of isocitrate/Mg2+. Furthermore, that isocitrate binding by the IDH1 site is independent of Mg2+ is additional evidence for evolutionary divergence of this site for regulatory rather than catalytic function. (D) A prerequisite for binding of NAD+ is binding of the (iso)citrate/Mg2+ complex by the catalytic IDH2 site. No binding of cofactor is observed in the absence of either (iso)citrate or Mg2+. (E) A prerequisite for binding of AMP is binding of isocitrate by the IDH1 regulatory binding site. An additional prerequisite for binding of AMP is some subsequent change(s) in the holoenzyme elicited by isocitrate binding at the IDH1 site, since replacement of the four non-identical of nine residues in the IDH1 isocitrate binding site with corresponding residues from the IDH2 site is permissive for isocitrate binding but not for AMP binding (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar).Collectively, these results suggest that only isocitrate binding by the regulatory IDH1 site occurs in the absence of other ligands of the enzyme. The complex prerequisites for binding of other ligands may reflect mechanisms for tight control of IDH in vivo,e.g. to ensure that binding and sequestering of a common tricarboxylic acid cycle cofactor occurs only in the presence of sufficient substrate (isocitrate/Mg2+), and to ensure that allosteric activation by AMP occurs only when concentrations of isocitrate are sufficiently elevated. Mitochondrial NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is subject to complex allosteric regulation. In particular, because of allosteric activation of the mammalian enzyme by ADP (1Chen R.F. Plaut G.W.E. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and of the yeast enzyme by AMP, IDH is proposed to regulate metabolic flux in response to energy needs of the cell (2Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae IDH is an octamer composed of four each of two homologous subunits, IDH1 and IDH2 (3Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature polypeptides are similar in size (349 and 354 amino acid residues, respectively) and share 42% residue sequence identity (4Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both subunits are essential for holoenzyme structure and function, although, as described below, catalytic function has been primarily attributed to IDH2 whereas regulatory functions have been assigned to IDH1 (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mammalian IDH contains three different types of subunits that share significant homology with those of yeast IDH, an α-subunit with catalytic functions similar to those of yeast IDH2, and β- and γ-subunits that are presumed to impart regulatory properties (9Nichols B.J. Hall L. Perry A.C.F. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Nichols B.J. Perry A.C. Hall L. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although crystallographic data are unavailable for yeast and mammalian IDHs, these enzymes share substantial similarity in sequence with several bacterial decarboxylating dehydrogenases for which three-dimensional structures are available. As a family, these dehydrogenases are unique in that they lack the classic Rossman fold described for other enzymes that bind NAD(P)+ (11Rossman M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Particularly useful for analyses of yeast IDH are structures reported for Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (12Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Stoddard B.L. Dean A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9310-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and for Thermus thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (15Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The former is a homodimeric NADP+-specific enzyme that functions in the bacterial tricarboxylic acid cycle, but that is regulated by phosphorylation rather than by allostery (16Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is a homodimeric NAD+-specific enzyme in the leucine biosynthetic pathway. Consistent with catalysis of similar reactions, these bacterial enzymes share some similarity in primary structure (∼25% residue identity) and substantial similarity in three-dimensional structure. Differences between residues in catalytic sites of the enzymes have been instructive for analyses of substrate and cofactor specificity (17Chen R. Greer A. Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Doyle S.A. Fung S.Y. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14348-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both yeast IDH1 and IDH2 subunits share residue sequence identities of ∼32% with E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase. Based on sequence alignments and modeling, the catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+ binding site of yeast IDH was predicted to be primarily composed of residues from IDH2 (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), because IDH2 contains identities for nine key residues in the catalytic site of the E. coli enzyme (12Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). IDH1, however, contains identities for only five of these nine residues, and was proposed to bind but not catalytically alter isocitrate. These predictions have been confirmed by results summarized in Table I of site-directed mutagenesis studies (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar, 22Panisko, E. A., Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Doctoral Dissertation, 2000, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX.Google Scholar). Among shared residues in isocitrate binding sites, IDH1 and IDH2 each contain a serine residue analogous to bacterial Ser-113. The latter is the site for phosphorylation of theE. coli enzyme in vivo (16Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a modification that inactivates the enzyme by preventing binding of isocitrate (23Dean A.M. Lee M.H.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20482-20486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine replacement of the analogous Ser-98 in IDH2 was found to profoundly reduce catalysis. Similar replacement in Ser-92 of IDH1 had much less of an effect on catalytic capacity; however, it dramatically reduced cooperativity and allosteric activation by AMP (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Replacement of the serine residue in either yeast subunit eliminated half of the holoenzyme isocitrate binding sites, and the combination of these residue replacements in both subunits prevented isocitrate binding (Ref. 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar and Table I). Thus, both the IDH1 and IDH2 sites bind isocitrate but for different kinetic functions. In other studies, the four of nine residues that differ in each of the putative IDH1 and IDH2 isocitrate binding sites were replaced by the corresponding residues in the other subunit site (22Panisko, E. A., Subunit Interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase.Doctoral Dissertation, 2000, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX.Google Scholar). Mutant enzymes containing these reciprocal residue replacements in IDH1 (A108R/F136Y/T241D/N245D) and/or in IDH2 (R114A/Y142F/D248T/D252N) were found to retain the wild-type number of isocitrate binding sites (Ref. 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar and Table I), indicating that these replacements were permissive for binding at each site. However, the mutant enzyme with residue replacements in IDH2 retained very little catalytic activity, and the mutant enzyme with residue replacements in IDH1 exhibited no allosteric activation by AMP nor any binding of AMP (20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). Thus, the unique residues in each subunit isocitrate binding site are essential for different functions in catalysis (IDH2 site) or in allosteric regulation (IDH1 site). Based on these and other results, the homologous yeast IDH subunits appear to be an exceptional model for divergent evolution. The catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+ binding site in IDH2 has been highly conserved, and a similar isocitrate binding site in IDH1 has evolved for regulatory function. In the current study, we use mutagenesis to investigate putative nucleotide binding sites in each subunit. Our hypothesis is that residues important for cofactor NAD+ binding are primarily contributed by IDH2, and that the AMP binding site is comprised of analogous residues of IDH1. A corollary is that residues in the putative NAD+ binding site of IDH2 are likely to be evolutionarily conserved with residues in other cofactor binding sites, whereas analogous residues in the putative AMP binding site in IDH1 are likely to have diverged for binding of the structurally related allosteric activator. Yeast IDH also displays complex interdependencies among various ligands for binding to the enzyme (24Kuehn G.D. Barnes L.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3945-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of isocitrate is a prerequisite for AMP binding, and we have shown the specific nature of this requirement is binding of isocitrate by the regulatory IDH1 site (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). In this report, we also use mutant and wild-type enzymes to investigate the dependence upon citrate or isocitrate to obtain NAD+ binding and the dependence upon Mg2+ for binding of other ligands of the enzyme. DISCUSSIONKinetic and ligand binding analyses described in this report suggest that yeast IDH has distinct but homologous nucleotide binding sites for NAD+ and for AMP. The cofactor binding site contains residues of the IDH2 subunit that are homologous with those in cofactor binding sites of other NAD+-specific decarboxylating dehydrogenases (Fig. 1). Adjacent Asp-286 and Ile-287 residues of IDH2 apparently correspond with adjacent Asp-279 and Ile-280 residues of T. thermophilus 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, residues implicated as important for cofactor specificity (17Chen R. Greer A. Dean A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11666-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases, equivalent positions are occupied by adjacent or nearby lysine (or arginine) and tyrosine residues. Thus, replacement of IDH2 Asp-286 and Ile-287 with alanine residues produces a dramatic reduction in apparent affinity for NAD+ and a concomitant reduction in the catalytic capacity of IDH. Similar effects on affinity for NADP+ and on velocity were reported for mutant enzymes containing replacements for Arg-314 and Tyr-316 residues of mammalian mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (30Lee P. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, His-281 of IDH2 is important for cofactor binding, since the most dramatic effect of alanine replacement of this residue is a reduction in affinity for NAD+. His-281 thus appears to be the functional homologue of a specific histidine residue in the cofactor binding sites of the T. thermophilus enzyme (His-274, Ref. 15Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), of the mammalian enzyme mentioned above (His-309, Ref. 31Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5637-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and of E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (His-339, Refs. 13Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8671-8678Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 18Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unlike the aspartate/isoleucine or lysine/tyrosine pairs described above, this histidine residue apparently functions in binding NAD+ or NADP+ but is not a determinant of cofactor specificity.The yeast IDH1 subunit also contains an aspartate/isoleucine pair at residue positions 279 and 280, but contains an arginine in residue position 274 that aligns with the histidine in position 281 of IDH2. We have shown that the primary effect associated with alanine replacements for both types of residues in IDH1 is a significant reduction in holoenzyme affinity for AMP. The consequence is a defect in allosteric activation, i.e. for these mutant enzymes, isocitrate binding is unaffected by the presence of AMP. Despite similar effects on holoenzyme affinity for AMP, the D279A/I280A and R274A replacements in IDH1 have different kinetic effects. The latter replacement has a greater effect on apparent Vmax values and significantly reduces cooperativity with respect to isocitrate. These results suggest that, in addition to participating in binding of AMP, IDH1 Arg-274 may function in communication between regulatory and catalytic sites.Overall, results obtained in this study suggest that related but unique sites have evolved in the homologous subunits to facilitate binding of different nucleotide ligands of IDH. The differential functions of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits in nucleotide binding are consistent with previous results showing that both subunits also contribute isocitrate binding sites (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar), but that the site comprised primarily of residues from IDH2 is catalytic whereas the site comprised primarily of residues from IDH1 supports regulatory properties of the holoenzyme. Thus, the catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+- and NAD+ binding sites are contributed by IDH2, whereas the regulatory isocitrate- and AMP binding sites are contributed by IDH1. As might be expected, the IDH2 catalytic site(s) exhibits a more significant conservation of residues in catalytic sites of related enzymes (20Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of IDH1, some residue conservation is observed for binding of structurally related ligands, but key residue differences appear to be important elements in the evolution of regulatory properties of this complex allosteric enzyme.A key to the communication between catalytic and regulatory sites in IDH is that, while each ligand binding site is primarily comprised of residues from one type of subunit, a few residues are apparently contributed by the other type of subunit. For example, results of previous mutagenesis studies (8Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are consistent with the conclusion that of nine residues in the IDH2 catalytic isocitrate/Mg2+binding site, two are contributed by IDH1 and, reciprocally, the analogous two residues of nine in the IDH1 regulatory isocitrate binding site are contributed by IDH2. These and other results from yeast two-hybrid studies (8Panisko E.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) support a model for a heterodimer of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits as the basic structural/functional unit of the holoenzyme. Consistent with reciprocal subunit contributions to isocitrate binding sites, we have also reported kinetic analyses of other mutant enzymes that indicate similar potential intersubunit contributions to nucleotide binding sites (7Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies will be expanded by replacement of other residues with similar putative intersubunit functions and by direct ligand binding analyses.In current and previous studies (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar), we have also evaluated some of the complex interrelationships among various ligands for binding by yeast IDH. Cumulative results suggest the following conclusions: (A) Despite residue differences in the isocitrate binding sites, the catalytic site in IDH2 and the regulatory site in IDH1 bind isocitrate with similar affinity. Binding at catalytic and regulatory sites is independent, since isocitrate binding at either site is not affected by loss of isocitrate binding at the other site (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). (B) Nucleotide binding sites are also independent of each other, because residue replacements examined in this study primarily affect either NAD+ or AMP binding (Fig. 4). (C) Binding of isocitrate by the catalytic IDH2 site, but not by the regulatory IDH1 site, requires Mg2+. Thus, the substrate bound by the enzyme is a complex of isocitrate/Mg2+. Furthermore, that isocitrate binding by the IDH1 site is independent of Mg2+ is additional evidence for evolutionary divergence of this site for regulatory rather than catalytic function. (D) A prerequisite for binding of NAD+ is binding of the (iso)citrate/Mg2+ complex by the catalytic IDH2 site. No binding of cofactor is observed in the absence of either (iso)citrate or Mg2+. (E) A prerequisite for binding of AMP is binding of isocitrate by the IDH1 regulatory binding site. An additional prerequisite for binding of AMP is some subsequent change(s) in the holoenzyme elicited by isocitrate binding at the IDH1 site, since replacement of the four non-identical of nine residues in the IDH1 isocitrate binding site with corresponding residues from the IDH2 site is permissive for isocitrate binding but not for AMP binding (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These studies will be expanded by replacement of other residues with similar putative intersubunit functions and by direct ligand binding analyses. In current and previous studies (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar), we have also evaluated some of the complex interrelationships among various ligands for binding by yeast IDH. Cumulative results suggest the following conclusions: (A) Despite residue differences in the isocitrate binding sites, the catalytic site in IDH2 and the regulatory site in IDH1 bind isocitrate with similar affinity. Binding at catalytic and regulatory sites is independent, since isocitrate binding at either site is not affected by loss of isocitrate binding at the other site (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). (B) Nucleotide binding sites are also independent of each other, because residue replacements examined in this study primarily affect either NAD+ or AMP binding (Fig. 4). (C) Binding of isocitrate by the catalytic IDH2 site, but not by the regulatory IDH1 site, requires Mg2+. Thus, the substrate bound by the enzyme is a complex of isocitrate/Mg2+. Furthermore, that isocitrate binding by the IDH1 site is independent of Mg2+ is additional evidence for evolutionary divergence of this site for regulatory rather than catalytic function. (D) A prerequisite for binding of NAD+ is binding of the (iso)citrate/Mg2+ complex by the catalytic IDH2 site. No binding of cofactor is observed in the absence of either (iso)citrate or Mg2+. (E) A prerequisite for binding of AMP is binding of isocitrate by the IDH1 regulatory binding site. An additional prerequisite for binding of AMP is some subsequent change(s) in the holoenzyme elicited by isocitrate binding at the IDH1 site, since replacement of the four non-identical of nine residues in the IDH1 isocitrate binding site with corresponding residues from the IDH2 site is permissive for isocitrate binding but not for AMP binding (21Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22476-22483Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that only isocitrate binding by the regulatory IDH1 site occurs in the absence of other ligands of the enzyme. The complex prerequisites for binding of other ligands may reflect mechanisms for tight control of IDH in vivo,e.g. to ensure that binding and sequestering of a common tricarboxylic acid cycle cofactor occurs only in the presence of sufficient substrate (isocitrate/Mg2+), and to ensure that allosteric activation by AMP occurs only when concentrations of isocitrate are sufficiently elevated.

We identified conserved motifs within intracellular domains 2 and 3 of selective subtypes of several G protein-coupled receptor families that confer coupling to the Na-H exchanger, NHE1. A T(s,p)V motif within intracellular domain 2 and a QQ(r) motif within intracellular domain 3 are shared by the somatostatin receptor subtypes SSTR1, -3, and -4, which couple to the inhibition of NHE1, but not by SSTR2 and -5, which do not signal to NHE1. Only the collective substitution of cognate SSTR2 residues with these two motifs conferred the ability of mutant SSTR2 to inhibit NHE1. Both motifs are present in D2-dopamine receptors, which inhibit NHE1, and in α2B-adrenergic receptors, which couple to the inhibition of NHE1, but not in α2A-adrenergic receptors, which do not regulate NHE1. These findings indicate that motifs shared by different subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, but not necessarily by receptor subtypes within a subfamily, can confer coupling to a common effector.

G protein-coupled receptor somatostatin receptor intracellular domains 2 and 3, respectively Na-H exchanger Chinese hamster ovary fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium transmembrane guanine nucleotide exchange factor Members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 share a heptahelical transmembrane topology and similar mechanisms for transducing signals through trimeric G proteins to intracellular effectors. Subfamilies of GPCRs, distinguished by sequence identity, generally include several receptor isoforms or subtypes that can be activated by similar ligands. Although receptor subtypes within a GPCR subfamily often regulate similar intracellular effectors, they can also signal to distinct effectors and signaling networks through a process termed receptor subtype-specific signaling. Using the subfamily of somatostatin receptors as a model, the objective of this study was to determine a molecular basis for subtype-specific signaling by GPCRs. The somatostatin receptor family includes five subtypes (SSTR1 to SSTR5) (1Yamada Y. Post S.R. Wang K. Tager H.S. Bell G.I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SST inhibits diverse cell functions such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, smooth muscle contractility, and cell proliferation. These cellular effects are mediated by coupling of the five SSTR subtypes to similar as well as distinct effectors and signaling networks. All five subtypes couple to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(Noisy-le-grand). 1999; 45: 1183-1189PubMed Google Scholar) also inhibits the activity of the ubiquitously expressed Na-H exchanger NHE1. When heterologously expressed in fibroblasts, SSTR1, but not SSTR2, mediates this effect (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using chimeric SSTR2/SSTR1 receptors, we found previously that the collective, but not individual, replacement of intracellular domains 2 (IL2) and 3 (IL3) of SSTR2 with those of SSTR1 is sufficient to confer inhibition of NHE1 (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that receptor subtype-selective coupling to NHE1 might require an interactive conformation of these two intracellular domains. From previous studies on GPCR regions critical for selective signaling, a general principle has emerged that the relative contribution of different intracellular domains to the selectivity of G protein recognition, and hence effector coupling, varies among different classes of GPCRs (reviewed in Ref. 23Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Currently, there is no a priori certainty that related structural domains have similar functions in different receptors (24Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified selective amino acid motifs in IL2 and IL3 of SSTRs that confer the inhibition of NHE1. We first extended the investigation of SSTR inhibition of NHE1 and found that, when stably expressed in fibroblasts, SSTR3 and -4, but not SSTR5, mediated SST inhibition of NHE1. Using a FASTA search of the Swiss Protein Database and aligning amino acid residues of IL2 and IL3 of 16 SSTRs retrieved with PILEUP, we found that consensus motifs of T(s,p)V in IL2 and QQ(r) in IL3 were present in NHE1-coupled SSTR1, -3, and -4 but absent in SSTR2 and -5, which do not signal to NHE1. The collective, but not individual, replacement of cognate amino acids in SSTR2 with these motifs was sufficient to confer SST inhibition of NHE1. Moreover, we found that these IL2 and IL3 motifs are present in selective subtypes of class A GPCRs within the D2-dopamine, α2-adrenergic, and thromboxane A2 subfamilies. We previously determined that D2-dopamine receptors couple to the inhibition of NHE1 (25Ganz M.B. Pachter J.A. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8989-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Neve K.A. Rosner M.P. Barber D.L. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 25: 225-241Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and now show that activation of the α2B-adrenergic receptor, which contains IL2-TV and IL3-QQ residues, but not the α2A-adrenergic receptor, which contains IL2-TV, but not IL3-QQ, also inhibits NHE1. Together these findings provide a molecular basis for receptor subtype-specific signaling, suggesting that common motifs shared by distinct subfamilies of GPCRs can be used to regulate a common effector. The cDNAs for rat SSTR3 and rat SSTR4 were provided by Cyanamid (Princeton, NJ) and subcloned into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) atEcoRI/XbaI sites. Mouse fibroblast Ltk– cells and CHO-K1 cells were transfected with SSTR3, and Ltk– cells were transfected with SSTR4 by using Ca2+-phosphate precipitation as previously described (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with pRSVneo. G418-resistant clones were selected and screened for receptor expression by radioligand binding with [125I-Tyr11]SST. Ltk-R3 and Ltk-R4 cells were maintained in DME-H21 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.2 mg/ml G418, and CHO-R3 cells were maintained in F-12 Hamm's medium containing 10% FBS and 0.2 mg/ml G418. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing SSTR5 (CHO-R5) were provided by Y. C. Patel (Royal Victoria Hospital and Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada) (27Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2814-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and maintained in F-12 Hamm's medium containing 10% FBS and 0.2 mg/ml G418. hSSTR1 and -2 were obtained from G. Bell (University of Chicago) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV at HindIII/XbaI sites.hSSTR2 mutants, hSSTR22TV,hSSTR23WQQ, andhSSTR22TV3WQQ, were constructed by replacing arginine-threonine (RT) in IL2 and serine-serine-lysine (SSK) in IL3 of hSSTR2 with cognate threonine-valine (TV) and tryptophan-glutamine-glutamine (WQQ) of hSSTR1, respectively. Collective mutants were constructed by using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Inc.) with specifically designed primers of 5′-CAAGTGGAGGAGACCCACGGTGGCCAAGATGATCACCATG-3′ and 5′-CATGGTGATCATCTTGGCCACCGTGGGTCTCCTCCACTTG-3′ for IL2mutations and 5′-CTCTGGAATCCGAGTGGGCTGGCAGCAGAGGAAGAAGTCTGAGAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTCTCAGACTTCTTCCTCTGCTGCCAGCCCACTCGGATTCCAGAG-3′ forIL3 mutations. DNA sequencing confirmed the indicated mutations in the hSSTR2 mutant constructs. cDNAs ofhSSTR1, hSSTR2, and hSSTR2 mutants were co-transfected with pRSVneo into clonal CCL39 fibroblasts, which do not express endogenous SSTR, using the Transfast transfection reagent (Promega, Inc.). Clones stably expressing wild-type and mutant SSTRs were selected by G418 resistance (0.6 mg/ml) and screened for receptor expression by radioligand binding with [125I-Tyr11]SST. Positive clones were maintained in DME-H21 medium supplemented with 5% FBS and 0.2 mg/ml G418. HEK293 cells stably expressing α2A- and α2B-adrenergic receptors were obtained from J. Donello and K. Kedzie (Allergan) and maintained in DME-H21 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. Radioligand binding to total cell membranes was used to determine receptor expression in the cell clones stably expressing SSTR1 to 5. Cell membranes, prepared by hypotonic lysis of cells (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Membranes (10 μg) were incubated in the resuspension buffer containing 0.06 nm[125I-Tyr11]SST (Amersham Biosciences; specific activity, 2000 Ci/mol) for 60 min at 30 °C in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 100 nmSST (Bachem). The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined by incubating cells in HBSS with [125I-Tyr11]somatostain-14 and serial dilutions of unlabeled SST-14. Values for Kd were determined from displacement curves using GraphPad Prism, version 3.0. The binding reaction was terminated by vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/F glass filters. Filters were washed three times with resuspension buffer, and bound radioactivity was subjected to counting in a Packard γ-spectrometer. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the values for nonspecific binding from the values for total binding. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate membrane preparations. SSTR function was confirmed by the ability of SST to inhibit cAMP accumulation. Cells plated at 0.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and maintained for 48 h at 37 °C were incubated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μmforskolin or forskolin plus 100 nm SST. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The acid-solubilized intracellular cAMP in the cell lysate was determined by using a cAMP radioimmunoassay (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) according to the suggested protocol of the manufacturer. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate cell preparations. NHE1 activity was determined by measuring the rate of pHi recovery (dpHi/dt) from an NH4Cl-induced acid load in a nominally HCO3–-free Hepes buffer (28Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells plated on glass coverslips were maintained in the absence of serum for 16–20 h before pHi determinations, transferred to a Hepes buffer, and loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BECEF-AM, 1 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were placed in a cuvette maintained in a thermostatically controlled cuvette holder within a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorometer. BCECF fluorescence was measured at 530 nm by exciting the dye alternately at 500 and 440 nm. The emission ratio was calibrated to pH for each determination by using the high K+/nigericin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) technique (29Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). To determine NHE1 activity, cells were pulsed for 10 min with 30 mm NH4Cl. The rate of pHi recovery (dpHi/dt) from an acid load induced by the rapid removal of NH4Cl was calculated at pHi intervals of 0.05 unit by measuring the slope of the pHi tracing at the indicated pHi. Steady-state pHi was determined in a Hepes buffer in the absence of an NH4Cl prepulse. Changes in quiescent NHE1 activity and pHi were determined by adding 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 100 nm SST during the NH4Cl prepulse and recovery periods. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four to six separate cell preparations. We previously reported that, when stably expressed in Ltk– cells or transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, SSTR1, but not SSTR2, mediates SST inhibition of NHE1 activity (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the inhibition of NHE1 is shared by other SSTR subtypes, we stably expressed SSTR3 and -4 in Ltk– cells. After three separate transfections, we were unable to obtain Ltk– cells stably expressing SSTR5. We therefore used CHO-K1 cells stably expressing SSTR5 (27Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2814-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and established CHO-K1 cells stably expressing SSTR3. Receptor expression was determined by radioligand binding using [125I-Tyr11]SST, and receptor function was confirmed by the ability to mediate SST inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig.1). All three SSTRs coupled to the inhibition of cAMP accumulation, although this was more effective in Ltk– cells than in CHO cells perhaps because of higher receptor expression. These data are consistent with previous findings that all five SSTRs mediate SST inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We found that SSTR3 and -4, but not SSTR5, mediate SST inhibition of NHE1 activity. NHE1 activity was determined in a nominally HCO3−-free Hepes buffer and expressed as the rate of recovery of intracellular pH (pHi) from an NH4Cl-induced acid load. SST (100 nm) had no effect on quiescent NHE1 activity in any of the SSTR-expressing cell lines (n = 3; data not shown), in accordance with its inability to inhibit quiescent cAMP accumulation. We found, however, that SST inhibited serum-stimulated NHE1 activity in Ltk–cells expressing SSTR3 (Ltk-R3) or SSTR4 (Ltk-R4) and in CHO cells expressing SSTR3 (CHO-R3) but not in CHO cells expressing SSTR5 (CHO-R5) (Fig. 2, A–D). At pHi 6.70, SST decreased the rate of serum-stimulated pHi recovery (dpHi/dt) from 26.7 ± 2.1 × 10−4 pH/s to 15.1 ± 1.4 × 10−4 pH/s in Ltk-R3 cells (mean ± S.E.;n = 6), from 25.2 ± 1.8 × 10−4pH/s to 15.2 ± 1.2 × 10−4 pH/s in Ltk-R4 cells (n = 4), and from 29.1 ± 2.8 × 10−4 pH/s to 15.6 ± 1.5 10−4 pH/s in CHO-R3 cells (n = 5). In contrast, in CHO-R5 cells, serum-stimulated NHE1 activity was not significantly different in the absence (27.6 ± 1.9 × 10−4 pH/s) or presence (26.3 ± 2.1 × 10−4 pH/s) of SST (n = 4; p > 0.1). SST also decreased serum-induced steady-state pHi in Ltk-R3, Ltk-R4, and CHO-R3 cells but not in CHO-R5 cells (Fig. 2E). These new data, together with our previous findings (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that SSTR1, -3, and -4, but not SSTR2 and -5, couple to the inhibition of NHE1. Using chimeric SSTR2/SSTR1 receptors, we previously determined that collective, but not individual, replacement of IL2 and IL3 of SSTR2 with those of SSTR1 confers inhibition of NHE1 by SST (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that an interaction between the second and third cytoplasmic domains of SSTR1 might be critical for this effect. We therefore examined the sequence of all five receptor subtypes by performing a FASTA search of the Swiss Protein Database and aligning amino acid residues of IL2 and IL3 of 16 SSTRs retrieved with PILEUP. Comparing the amino acid sequences of SSTR1, -3, and -4 with those of SSTR2 and -5 revealed a number of potentially important changes in both IL2 and IL3 (Fig.3A). All species of SSTR2 and SSTR5 have an arginine in IL2 (Arg-16) that is absent in SSTR1, -3, and -4. This difference in charge could possibly restrict an IL2-IL3 interaction of the receptor, which is critical for NHE1 coupling. The cognate position in IL2 of SSTR1, -3, and -4 contains a consensus motif of T(s,p)V. In IL3, SSTR1 and -4 have two polar glutamines, QQ, that are not present in SSTR2 or -5. In SSTR3, the second Gln varies to Arg. Homology modeling of SSTR1 based on the recently determined structure of rhodopsin (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) suggests that the TV motif is at the C-terminal end of IL2 near the cytoplasmic tip of transmembrane (TM) IV, whereas QQ is squarely within IL3 (Fig.3B). To determine whether these selective amino acid residues in SSTR1, -3, and -4 were sufficient to confer coupling to the inhibition of NHE1, we made site-directed substitutions in hSSTR2 by replacing the arginine-threonine (RT) residues in IL2 with threonine-valine (TV) found in the cognate position of hSSTR1 and replacing the serine-serine-lysine (SSK) motif in IL3 with tryptophan-glutamine-glutamine (WQQ) found in hSSTR1 (Fig.3A). Substitutions in IL2 and IL3 of SSTR2 were made individually (SSTR22TV and SSTR23WQQ) and collectively (SSTR22TV3WQQ). Because we were unable to stably express high levels of mutant SSTR2 in Ltk– cells, we used CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts, which express only the NHE1 Na-H exchanger subtype (31Lin X.

To compare the action of mutant SSTR2 with that of wild-type receptors, we also stably expressed wild-type SSTR1 and SSTR2 in CCL39 cells. Receptor expression was determined by radioligand binding using [125I-Tyr11]SST (Fig.4). Competition binding assays were used to confirm that receptor affinities between wild-type and mutant SSTR were similar. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined to be 3.39 nm for SSTR1, 7.65 nm for SSTR2, 2.88 nm for SSTR22TV, 3.31 nm for SSTR23WQQ, and 1.32 nm for SSTR22TV3WQQ. The Kd of SSTR2 mutants was more similar to the Kd of SSTR1 than to theKd of SSTR2, suggesting that the mutations might alter receptor conformation, possibly through a change in receptor domains or a change in G protein coupling. The function of wild-type and mutant receptors was confirmed by their ability to mediate SST inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4). The relatively greater attenuation of cAMP by wild-type SSTR2, compared with wild-type SSTR1, was previously found in Ltk– and HEK293 cells (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CCL39 cells transfected with pRSVneo in the absence of SSTR complementary DNA (cDNA) had no detectable specific binding of [125I-Tyr11]SST and had no change in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the presence of SST (Fig. 4,CCL-Neo). To study NHE1 activity, we first confirmed our previous findings in Ltk– and HEK293 cells (22Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that wild-type SSTR1, but not SSTR2, mediates SST inhibition of NHE1. In both CCL-R1 and CCL-R2 cells, the addition of 10% serum increased quiescent NHE1 activity; however, in the presence of SST, serum-stimulated activity was attenuated in CCL-R1 but not CCL-R2, cells (Fig.5). Serum also increased quiescent NHE1 activity in CCL39 cells expressing mutant SSTR2; however, SST attenuated serum-stimulated activity only in cells containing collective IL2 and IL3 substitutions in SSTR2 (CCL-R22TV3WQQ) (Fig.6C). In contrast, SST had no effect on serum-stimulated NHE1 activity in cells expressing individual IL2 and IL3 substitutions in SSTR2 (CCL-R22TV and CCL-R23WQQ) (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with its ability to mediate inhibition of NHE1 activity, SST attenuated serum-induced steady-state pHi in CCL-R22TV3WQQ cells but not in CCL-R22TV or CCL-R23WQQ cells (Fig. 6D). To determine whether there were clonal variations in the ability of mutant SSTR2 to regulate NHE1 activity, we studied additional CCL39 clones stably expressing each of the mutant receptors. In three separate cell preparations, we consistently found that SST inhibited serum-stimulated NHE1 activity in cells expressing SSTR22TV3WQQ but not in cells expressing SSTR22TV or SSTR23WQQ (data not shown). Hence, the ability to inhibit NHE1 was conferred by the collective substitutions of cognate amino acids in IL2 and IL3 ofhSSTR2 with TV and WQQ of hSSTR1 but not individual substitutions in each of the domains.Figure 6Collective but not individual substitution of IL2 and IL3 motifs confers inhibition of NHE1 activity.A–C, the rates of pHi recovery (dpHi/dt × 10−4 pH/s) from an NH4Cl-induced acid load were determined in cells stably expressing SSTR2 containing the indicated substitutions in IL2 and IL3. Data were obtained from quiescent cells (Control) and from cells treated with serum (10%) in the absence or presence of SST (100 nm) and are representative of four to six separate cell preparations. D, steady-state pHi in quiescent cells and in cells treated with serum in the absence or presence of SST is expressed as the means ± S.E. of four to six separate cell preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because TV in IL2 and WQQ in IL3 act in concert to provide a molecular basis for SSTR inhibition of NHE1 activity, we investigated whether these motifs occur in other class A GPCRs. We previously determined that endogenously expressed D2-dopamine receptors in GH3 cells (25Ganz M.B. Pachter J.A. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8989-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and heterologously expressed D2-dopamine receptors in Ltk– cells (26Neve K.A. Rosner M.P. Barber D.L. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 25: 225-241Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) couple to the inhibition of NHE1. Using the tGRAP alignment data base (32Beukers M.W. Kristiansen K. IJzerman A.P. Edvardsen O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 475-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found that both motifs are present in the D2-dopamine receptor but not in the D1- or D3-dopamine receptors (Fig.7A). We therefore investigated whether amino acid motifs T(s,p)V near or within IL2 and QQ(r) near or within IL3 were found in other class A GPCRs, as defined by the GPCR data base (33Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SSTR and D2-dopamine family sequences were added when analyzing each family to help identify the exact location of the respective motifs. Alignment of loop regions and their immediate TM extensions using CLUSTALW failed to align either the T(s,p)V or QQ(r) motifs between families. Alignment of IL3 was more difficult than that of IL2 because of large insertions in some families, which made it impossible to use an alignment tool. These loops were therefore aligned manually. There were many instances of these motifs occurring independently, especially the T(s,p)V motif, which is present in classes of α-adrenergic and C-C-type chemokine receptors (data not shown). Co-occurrence of TV in IL2 and QQ in IL3, however, was rare and was found selectively in α2B-adrenergic and thromboxane A2 receptors (Fig. 7A); however, there was no detectable pattern in the distances of these motifs from TM helices in these receptors compared with SSTR. Although a TV motif is present in α2A- and α2B-adrenergic receptors, the QQ motif in the 2B subtype is not found in the 2A subtype (Fig.7A). Moreover, as in SSTR1, the co-presence of an IL2-TV and an IL3-QQ in D2-dopamine, α2B-adrenergic, and thromboxane A2 receptors is nearly invariant across species (Fig. 7, A and B). These data suggest that the presence of T(s,p)V near the TM IV-IL2 transition and the presence of QQ(r) in IL3 might represent conserved motifs that collectively confer coupling to the inhibition of NHE1. Further confirming the validity of this hypothesis, we found that the α2B-adrenergic receptor, which contains both motifs, but not the α2A-adrenergic receptor, which contains an IL2-TV but not an IL3-QQ, couples to the inhibition of NHE1 activity. Both receptor subtypes were stably expressed in HEK293 c"

The reaction requires both monovalent and divalent cations, normally K+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-6-P2) is the heterotropic activator of YPK. The net reaction catalyzed by YPK is the sum of at least two partial reactions. Phosphoryl transfer from PEP to M(II)ADP occurs by an apparent Sn2 mechanism with inversion of configuration at the phosphoryl group to yield the enolate of pyruvate and M(II)ATP (1Blättler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the second partial reaction, a proton donor at the active site stereospecifically protonates the C-3 of enolpyruvate at the 2-si face of the double bond to form ketopyruvate (2Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6052-6056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 6288-6289Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Kuo D.J. O'Connell E.L. Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 5025-5030Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enolate of pyruvate, the common species in both partial reactions, is a tightly bound intermediate in the net reaction catalyzed by PK (5Seeholzer S.H. Jaworski A. Rose I.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The two-step character of the net PK reaction is demonstrated by the ability of PK to catalyze the enolization of bound pyruvate without phosphoryl transfer (6Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1170-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Robinson J.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1096-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ford S.R.

YPK requires ATP as a cofactor for this activity (8Ford S.R. Robinson J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PK will also catalyze the ketonization of enolpyruvate, generated in situ subsequent to the hydrolysis of PEP catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (3Kuo D.J. Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 6288-6289Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial crystallographic data from cat muscle PK (9Muirhead H. Claydon D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Schlitz E. Schmitt W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) indicated that Lys-269 (Lys-240 in the YPK numbering sequence) can serve as the putative proton donor because it was positioned close to the methyl carbon of the bound pyruvate. The ε-amino group of Lys-269 as the possible candidate for the acid/base catalyst in PK was supported by the measurement of multiple protons that are incorporated into pyruvate with rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (10Rose I.A. Kuo D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9579-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequent refined x-ray crystal structures of the yeast enzyme with bound phosphoglycolate (11Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and of the rabbit muscle enzyme complexed with pyruvate (12Larsen T.M. Laughlin T.L. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Lys-240 is at the 2-re face of the double bond of the enolate and is in apparent contact with the phosphoryl group of PEP. The recent studies of the K240M mutant of YPK support the role of this lysine in facilitating phosphoryl transfer but not enolpyruvate protonation (13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The location of the methyl group of pyruvate is oriented such that Thr-298 (Thr-327 in the muscle PK numbering sequence) is in the correct position to protonate the enolate intermediate at C-3 (12Larsen T.M. Laughlin T.L. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thr-298 of YPK relative to bound phosphoglycolate is in the same location (11Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rose et al.(14Rose I.A. Kuo D.J. Warms J.V.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have suggested that the proton donor in pyruvate kinase is a high pKa monoprotic acid that rapidly exchanges protons with solvent in the unliganded enzyme. The secondary alcohol of Thr-298 satisfies these requirements and that of the stereochemistry. On the other hand, pH rate profiles with rabbit muscle PK reveal an ionization with a pKa = 8.3. This ionization has been interpreted as the pKa of the acid-base catalyst (15Dougherty T.M. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5870-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The strict conservation of both Lys-240 and Thr-298 in all PKs that have been sequenced and their critical location within the active site of PK suggest that the side chains of both residues play important roles in catalysis. Studies of YPK by Bollenbach et al. (13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the pKa of 8.8 is lost on mutation of Lys-240 to methionine. Furthermore, the results of the kinetic characterization of K240M suggest that Lys-240 is not the direct proton donor to the enolpyruvate intermediate in YPK. In its protonated form, Lys-240 is important in stabilization of the pentavalent transition state of the phosphoryl group undergoing transfer. The present study focuses on the role of Thr-298 in catalysis of the pyruvate kinase reaction. This question was addressed by altering Thr-298 by site-directed mutagenesis and by physical and kinetic analyses of the wild type and the resulting mutant enzymes. The results indicate that it is water at the active site that serves as the proton donor. l-(+)-Lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Wild type, T298S, and T298A yeast pyruvate kinases were purified as described by Mesecar and Nowak (16Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6803-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PEP, ADP, Fru-6-P2, disodium NADH, glycerol, Dowex 1 chloride (400-mesh), and buffers were purchased from Sigma. Deuterium oxide (99.9%) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. 3-[3H]Pyruvate was synthesized by T. Bollenbach (17Bollenbach, T. J., Catalytic Mechanism and Activation of Yeast Pyruvate Kinase.Ph.D. thesis, 1999, University of Notre Dame.Google Scholar). The Altered Sites mutagenesis kit was purchased from Promega, and the mutagenic nucleotides were obtained from Genosys. Mutagenesis reactions were performed in the pSelectTM-1 vector according to the Promega Altered Sites® II manual. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used for constructing the specific point mutants are as follows: T298S, CCAACATTTGGGAAGCACAGATAACTGG; T298A, CCAACATTTGGGCAGCACAGATAACTGG; and T298V, CCAACATTTGGACAGCACAGATAACTGG. The underlined sequences correspond to the mutated nucleotides. A 1402-bpXbaI/EcoRI fragment of the YPK gene was subcloned into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of the pSelectTM-1 vector (18Mesecar, A. D., Kinetic Responses and Conformational Changes Required for Yeast Pyruvate Kinase Activation and Catalysis.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Notre Dame.Google Scholar). For each of the Thr-298 mutants, the 751-bp fragment of DNA containing the desired mutation in the YPK gene was excised from the pSelect vector byBglII/BstEII restriction digest, followed by isolation on a 1% agarose gel. The 751-bp fragments were cloned into the BglII/BstEII sites of the yeast shuttle vector, pPYK101, that contains the entire PK gene. In order to verify the presence of the desired mutations, the mutated genes were sequenced (DNA Sequence Facility, Iowa State University, Ames, IA). The mutant pPYK101 constructs were transformed into the pyruvate kinase-deficient yeast strain, pyk1-5 (19Burke R.L. Tekamp-Olson P. Najarian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2193-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a lithium acetate procedure (20Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast pyk1-5 containing the wild type pPYK101 was grown on rich media containing the following per liter: 10 g of yeast extract, 20 of g bactopeptone, and 2% glucose. Transformed pyk1-5 containing pPYK101 with the T298S and T298A mutations were grown on glucose minimal media containing the following per liter: 6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base, 10 of g succinic acid, 4 of g NaOH, 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 0.001% adenine, and 0.001% methionine. Cells were harvested, and the wild type YPK and T298S and T298A mutants were purified by the procedure published previously (16Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6803-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast pyk1-5 containing the T298V PYK101 was grown on glycerol-ethanol minimal media prepared the same as for T298S and T298A except containing 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol in place of 2% glucose. CD spectra of apo wild type, T298S, and T298A YPK were acquired on an Aviv 62 DS circular dichroism spectrometer at 25 ± 1 °C. Protein solutions at concentrations of 0.04 mg/ml in potassium phosphate buffer (4 mm (pH 6.2)) were measured in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.4 cm. Each spectrum was recorded with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and a scan rate of 1 nm/s. The scans were acquired from 280 to 200 nm. For each sample, 5 repetitive scans were obtained and averaged. A scan of the buffer is subtracted from each of these spectra. Pyruvate kinase was assayed by a variation of the method of Teitz and Ochoa (21Teitz A. Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 78: 477-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Typical assay mixtures contained in 1 ml: 100 mm MES, (pH 6.2), 4% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, either 15 mm MgCl2 or 4 mm MnCl2, 5 mm ADP, 5 mm PEP, 175 μm NADH, 20 μg ofl-lactate dehydrogenase, and YPK (1–2 μg of wild type, 2–5 μg of T298S, and 10 μg of T298A, respectively). When present, the concentration of Fru-6-P2 was 1 mm. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH oxidation was measured as a function of time using a Gilford 240 or 250 spectrophotometer. The specific activity of YPK is expressed as μmol of NADH oxidized/ml/min/mg protein. The concentration of YPK was determined by absorbance at 280 nm and by using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 0.51 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1. Initial velocity data were fit to either the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) or the Hill equation (Equation 2), depending on which model best describes the experimental data.v/Vmax=1/(1+Km/[S])Equation 1 v/Vmax=1/(1+(Km/[S])Hn)Equation 2 The effect of pH on the maximal velocity of the reaction catalyzed by wild type YPK, T298S, and T298A, respectively, was studied in the pH range 4.5–9.1. The measurements were performed in the presence of 1 mm Fru-6-P2 and with Mg2+ (15 mm) or Mn2+ (4 mm) as the divalent activator. The buffers used were acetate (pH 4.5–5.2), MES (pH 5.0–6.8), HEPES (pH 6.5–7.5), and TAPS (pH 7.5–9.1). The buffers were all titrated to the desired pH by using either potassium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The pH of the kinetic assay mixtures, containing all of the assay components except the coupling enzyme (l-lactate dehydrogenase) and pyruvate kinase, was determined before the initiation of the reactions. The pH rate data were fit to either Equation 3 or Equation 4, which were previously derived (13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), 2In Ref. 13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, the numerator in Equation 3 should be Vmax(α + [H+]/KB). or to Equation 5. Equation 3 describes the ionization of two groups in the enzyme-substrate complex (ES) that are required for catalytic activity (KA and KC), and the ionization of a group in the ES complex (KB) that modifies the rate of reaction. Equation 4describes two ionizations, KA and KB, in the ES complex. Equation 5corresponds to the situation where only the two groupsKA and KC are required for catalytic activity. Vmax,app is the observed maximal rate of reaction at a given pH value. The maximal velocity in the plateau region, Vmax′, can be related to the maximal velocity, Vmax, by a proportionality factor α, where Vmax′ = αVmax. The value of α can be either greater than or less than 1, depending on whether the protons inhibit or activate the reaction rate, respectively.Vmax,app=Vmaxα+[H+]KB1+[H+]2KAKB+[H+]KB+KC[H+]Equation 3 Vmax,app=Vmax1+αKB[H+]1+[H+]KA+KB[H+]Equation 4 Vmax,app=Vmax1+[H+]KA+KC[H+]Equation 5 The dissociation constants of the ligands to various enzyme complexes were measured by steady-state fluorescence. Fluorescence quenching of the intrinsic single tryptophan residue of YPK upon ligand binding was monitored on an SLM model 8100 fluorimeter thermostated at 24 ± 1 °C. The excitation monochromator was a model MC400, and the emission monochromator was a model MC200. Fluorescence titrations were performed by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity at 334 nm upon excitation at 295 nm. Titrations were performed by sequentially adding 1–10-μl aliquots of a concentrated ligand solution to 900 μl of a mixture containing 100 mm MES (pH 6.2), 5% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.05–0.07 mg/ml wild type YPK or Thr-298 mutants, and other ligands as specified. The percent fluorescence quenching, Q, was calculated using the relationship: Q = ((F0 −F)/F0) × 100, whereF and F0 are the fluorescence intensities of YPK in the presence and absence of a ligand, respectively. F was corrected for dilution effects. Fluorescence titration data were fit to Equations 6 and 7, where [L] represents the variable ligand concentration; KD is the dissociation constant for ligand L to the respective enzyme complex; Qmax is the percent maximal quenching; and nH is the Hill coefficient. Equations 6 and7 are analogous to the Michaelis-Menten and the Hill equations, respectively.Q=Qmax/(1+KD/[L])Equation 6 Q=Qmax/(1+(KD/[L])Hn)Equation 7 The rate of phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by YPK was measured using the glycolate kinase activity, as described by Bollenbach et al. (13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained in 1 ml, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm Fru-6-P2, 50 mm glycolate, 10 mm MnCl2 or 15 mm MgCl2, 0.2–8 mm ATP, and YPK (100–200 μg of wild type and T298S, or 200–300 μg of T298A). The glycolate kinase reaction was followed as the decrease of ATP peaks over time using high pressure liquid chromatography separation. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis was performed on a Beckman 421 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Beckman 334 Gradient System and a Rainin 218TP54-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with a pore size of 300 Å. Detection was at 260 nm. Integration and plotting of chromatograms were performed on a Spectra Physics SP4290 integrator. Initial velocities of phosphoryl transfer were calculated from measurements of ATP disappearance with time. Thekcat for phosphoryl transfer catalyzed by YPK (vp) was determined from initial velocitiesversus [ATP] and fitting the data to Equation 1. A nonenzymatic blank was run at each ATP concentration. There was no detectable decrease in ATP concentration over the course of the experiment in the absence of enzyme. The enolization of pyruvate was measured as the time-dependent exchange of tritium from 3-[3H]pyruvate into water, as described previously (13Bollenbach T.J. Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9137-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The activity of 3-[3H]pyruvate was 75,170 dpm/μmol pyruvate in the experiments with wild type YPK and T298S or 72,900 dpm/μmol pyruvate in the experiments with T298A. The PK-catalyzed rate of pyruvate enolization, vT, is defined as μmol of protons exchanged into water/min/mg protein. All buffers, divalent and monovalent cations, and substrates were exchanged in 99.9% D2O by dissolving solutes 3 times in D2O followed by lyophilization. In each case the final sample was re-dissolved in D2O to give the desired solute concentrations. The pD and pH values of the assay buffer were adjusted to 6.2 using KOD and KOH, respectively. The assay buffer was adjusted to pD 6.2 according to the relationship pD = (pH)meter reading + 0.4 (22Lumry R. Smith E.L. Glantz R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 73: 4330-4340Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). NADH was dissolved in the assay buffer, prepared as above, immediately prior to use. Assays (1 ml) were prepared and covered with parafilm prior to measurements. Assays were performed in duplicate. Solvent isotope effects (SIE) onkcat,D(kcat), and onkcat/Km,PEP,D(kcat/Km,PEP), were determined from fitting initial velocity versus [PEP] data in H2O and in D2O to Equation 1. The stock solutions were prepared as described above. The final deuterium content of the deuterated stock solutions was estimated to be 97%. Wild type YPK and Thr-298 mutants were assayed in a series of isotopically mixed water ([1H]H2O and [2H] H2O) of deuterium molar fraction n. In each case, initial velocities were measured at saturating PEP concentration (5 mm). Assays were performed in triplicate. Data were fit to the Gross-Butler equation either in the linear form (Equation 8) or in the nonlinear form (Equation 9) (23Kresge A.J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1964; 8: 243-258Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Equation 8 describes the case where a single proton in the transition state of the YPK-catalyzed reaction contributes to the observed isotope effect. Equation 9represents the situation of a single proton in the transition state and one in the reactant state, respectively. Alternatively, one proton may have different contributions in the reactant state than in the transition state. Vn/V0=1+n(φT−1)Equation 8 Vn/V0=(1+n(φT−1))/(1+n(φR−1))Equation 9 In these equations, φT and φR are the fractionation factors for the proton in the transition state and reactant state, respectively, and Vn and V0 represent the maximal velocities observed in a mixture of isotopic water of n mole fraction of D2O and in H2O, where n = 0, respectively (23Kresge A.J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1964; 8: 243-258Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Showen K.B. Showen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). T298S, T298A, and T298V were constructed and expressed using the same procedure as for wild type YPK. The pyruvate kinase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, pyk1-5, containing the pPYK101 plasmid with either the T298S or the T298A mutation was grown on media containing glucose as the sole carbon source. In both cases, 10 liters of glucose minimal media yielded ∼100 g of cells. T298S and T298A were purified according to Mesecar and Nowak (16Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6803-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with no modification from the protocol for wild type YPK. Yeast pyk1-5 containing the T298V pPYK101 was unable to grow on media containing glucose as the sole carbon source (glucose minimal media). These cells were successfully grown on glycerol-ethanol media. The inability of pyk1-5 containing the T298V pPYK101 to grow on media containing glucose is indicative of a catalytically inactive mutant or a mutant enzyme of very low activity (<5% relative to wild type YPK, the value for T298A). In the absence of an active PK gene, yeast do not have the ability to catabolize glucose to pyruvate. The T298S and T298A mutants were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity based on SDS-PAGE, with yields of 35 and 30 mg/liter of culture, respectively. The T298V mutant was not purified. The secondary structures of the apo T298S and T298A mutants were monitored by far UV-CD and compared with wild type YPK (data not shown). Both mutants showed a slight and consistent difference in the magnitude of the molar ellipticity relative to wild type enzyme. The general shape of the far UV spectra of the Thr-298 mutants and wild type YPK was the same over the full spectral range (200–280 nm). These results indicate that neither mutation caused any significant changes in the secondary structure and that the wild type and mutant YPKs were folded into a similar if not identical structure. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of apo T298S and apo T298A mutants were recorded between 310 and 400 nm and compared with wild type YPK. The single tryptophan, Trp-452, was selectively excited at 295 nm so that observed changes in the intrinsic fluorescence could be correlated with conformational changes at a specific localized region in YPK. The apo forms of T298S and T298A YPK have a tryptophan emission maximum at ∼334 nm, similar to that for apo wild type YPK (16Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6803-6813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed for the wild type YPK and for the mutant enzymes under identical conditions. An example of the steady-state kinetic rate profiles for T298S at variable PEP concentrations with Mg2+ and with Mn2+ as divalent activator in the absence or presence of Fru-6-P2is shown in Fig. 1. Similar profiles were obtained with T298A (data not shown). The kinetic responses of wild type and the Thr-298 mutants with either Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the activator and in the absence or presence of Fru-6-P2 were fit to Equations 1 and 2 as appropriate. The best fits from the appropriate equations were used accordingly.

Measurements were performed in the absence or presence of saturating concentrations of Fru-6-P2 and with either wild type YPK, T298S, or T298A mutants as indicated. The mutant enzymes showed differential allosteric responses, depending upon the divalent metal activator (Mg2+ or Mn2+). The T298S mutation showed alterations primarily inkcat. Thekcat/Km,PEPvalues for wild type and T298S were similar. The divalent metal specificity with T298S was the same as with wild type. Based onkcat values, Mg2+ > Mn2+. The T298S mutation had a minor effect onKm,PEP only in the presence of Mn2+. The Mn2+-activated T298S did not display kinetic cooperativity with PEP in the absence of Fru-6-P2, with nH = 1 compared withnH = 2.5 for wild type YPK. T298S activated by Mg2+ showed cooperative behavior (nH= 1.9) similar to that of wild type enzyme (nH = 2.8). The turnover rates for T298A decreased by a factor of 24 and 11 compared with wild type YPK when activated by Mg2+ in the absence and in the presence of Fru-6-P2, respectively. Fru-6-P2 increased the kcat of the reaction with T298A and decreased Km,PEPwith Mg2+ as the activator. The decrease inkcat for T298A relative to wild type YPK in the absence or presence of Fru-6-P2 was ∼18-fold with Mn2+ as the activator. The divalent metal specificity with T298A based on kcat was the same as with wild type and with T298S. The steady-state interaction between PEP and YPK, as measured by Km and kcat/Km values, has been affected significantly by the T298A mutation. The thermodynamic interaction of PEP with the enzyme was unaffected (see below). In the absence of Fru-6-P2, the Mn2+-activated T298S and T298A enzymes did not exhibit positive cooperativity with PEP. T298A displayed slight negative cooperativity for PEP in the presence of Fru-6-P2 (nH = 0.7 compared withnH = 1 in wild type). T298A activated by Mg2+ had kinetic behavior similar to that observed for wild type enzyme and T298S YPK activated by Mg2+. The Km,M2+ for Mn2+and for Mg2+ (Table I) is an apparent value based on the total metal concentration and was not corrected for the divalent metal bound by ADP in solution. The concentration of ADP is constant and saturating in all of the kinetic studies. Mutation of Thr-298 to serine had no effect on Km,Mg2+ and resulted in a 3-fold decrease ofKm,Mn2+ compared with wild type YPK. Mutation of Thr-298 to alanine had no effect on theKm,M2+ values. Any relevance of Thr-298 to an ionization that affects catalysis was addressed by measuring pH rate profiles. The effect of pH on theVmax,app for the Mn2+- and the Mg2+-activated wild type, T298S, and T298A enzymes in the presence of Fru-6-P2 was measured over the pH range of 4.5–9.1. The pH rate profiles for the enzymes activated by Fru-6-P2 and with Mn2+ and with Mg2+ are shown in Fig. 2,A and B, respectively.

Updat. 2001; 4: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bacteria become protected from aminoglycosides, because the modified antibiotics can no longer bind with high affinity to their target, the A-site of the small ribosomal subunit, because of unfavorable steric and/or electrostatic constraints (3Llano-Sotelo B. Azucena E.F. Kotra L.P. Mobashery S. Chow C.S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The AMEs are a diverse set of proteins composed of three families: aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferases, aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (AACs), and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs). The most clinically important AME in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus is AAC(6′)-APH(2“) (4Miller G.H. Sabatelli F.J. Hare R.S. Glupczynski Y. Mackey P. Shlaes D. Shimizu K. Shaw K.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24 (Suppl. 1): S46-S62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is unique in that it is bifunctional, comprising activities from two classes of AMEs: an N-terminal AAC (AAC(6′)-Ie) and a C-terminal APH (APH(2”)-Ia) (Fig. 1) (5Ferretti J.J. Gilmore K.S. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Culebras E. Martinez J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D1-D8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). AAC(6′)-APH(2“) has an extraordinary ability to detoxify a wide selection of aminoglycosides (7Azucena E. Grapsas I. Mobashery S. J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) not only as a result of its bifunctional nature but also because of the special characteristics of each activity. For example, APH(2”)-Ia has a tremendous ability to accommodate a vast range of antibiotics and binding conformations as evidenced by the remarkably broad regiospecificity of phosphoryl transfer that enables modification to occur on hydroxyl groups from four different aminoglycoside ring systems (see Fig. 1) (8Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Conversely, AAC(6′)-Ie, has a very stringent regiospecificity of acetyl transfer, because it is restricted to acetylation of the 6′-position of aminoglycosides only (see Fig. 1) (8Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). AAC(6′)-Ie is the sole member of the very large AAC(6′) subclass known to acetylate the antibiotic fortimicin A (9Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and moreover, in addition to N-acetylation activity, this enzyme has been shown to have O-acetylation capabilities (8Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The unusual activities of AAC(6′)-Ie may be related to residues that can bind fortimicin A and 6′-OH aminoglycosides, or to unique residues that are required to catalyze the acetylation of these antibiotics. The APH class of enzyme is relatively well characterized (10Wright G.D. Thompson P.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D9-D21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mostly owing to structural and functional studies on APH(3′)-IIIa (Refs. 11Burk D.L. Hon W.C. Leung A.K. Berghuis A.M.

Wright, unpublished. are consistent with results obtained with APH(3′)-IIIa. On the other hand, the molecular mechanisms of AACs are comparatively less understood, despite the fact that crystal structures for AAC(3′)-Ia (14Wolf E. Vassilev A. Makino Y. Sali A. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), AAC(2′)-Ic (15Vetting M.W. Hegde S.S. Javid-Majd F. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Nat. Struct.

The clinical importance of AAC(6′)-APH(2“) and the substrate specificity differences between AAC(6′)-Ie and other aminoglycoside acetyltransferases warrant more thorough study of the acetyltransferase domain of AAC(6′)-APH(2”) to understand the distinct properties of this enzyme. Structural studies on AACs have demonstrated that the aminoglycoside acetyltransferases belong to the GNAT (GCN-5 relatedN-acetyltransferases) superfamily (for review, see Ref. 17Dyda F. Klein D.C.

Crystal structures of Tetrahymena GCN5 (tGCN5) histone acetyltransferase bound with acetyl-CoA and histone H3 (24Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R.

For such a transfer to occur, the amine of the acceptor substrate must react with the carbonyl carbon of acetyl-CoA. However, at physiological pH, amines tend to be fully protonated and, hence, are not in a chemically competent state to accept the acetyl group. Consequently, an active site base has been proposed to deprotonate the amine to generate a more potent nucleophile capable of being acetylated.

Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31321-31331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, studies with AANAT have been less enlightening, as mutation of His-122 to Gln only results in a 6-fold decrease in activity (29Scheibner K.A. De Angelis J. Burley S.K. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18118-18126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that substrate deprotonation does not occur directly, but through a series of well-ordered water molecules, or “proton wire,” connecting the substrate amine and the catalytic base (reviewed in Refs. 17Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In such a scenario, other residues in the active site that are capable of accepting hydrogen from these water molecules may compensate in part for the loss of the normal proton acceptor. Indeed, His-120 in AANAT appears to play this role and only when both His-122 and His-120 are mutated to Gln is there a much more substantial effect consistent with base catalysis (29Scheibner K.A. De Angelis J. Burley S.K. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18118-18126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to either tGCN5 or AANAT, glucosamine 6-phosphateN-acetyltransferase (GNA1) appears to lack an active site base since mutational analysis of Glu-98, which is at the same geometrical position as His-120 in AANAT, is inconsistent with base catalysis (32Mio T. Yamada-Okabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 424-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this case, an active site base may not be required considering that the pKa of its substrate (∼7.75) is sufficiently low that a significant proportion will be in the chemically competent form at physiological pH (33Peneff C. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Bourne Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16328-16334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A very complex picture of catalysis emerges from these findings where the molecular details of acetyl transfer in the GNAT family depend on the specific enzyme and/or substrate. This is not surprising, taking into account the limited sequence similarity shared between these proteins where the conserved GNAT core is mostly involved in providing a binding site for acetyl-CoA and not in providing common scaffolding for catalysis. Here we have addressed the role of an active base in the catalytic mechanism of AAC(6′)-Ie. We demonstrate through solvent isotope effects, pH studies, and mutational analysis that Asp-99 fulfills the role of an active site base and is responsible for the ability of AAC(6′)-Ie to catalyze O-acetyl transfer. Although Asp-99 provides the enzyme with an enhanced detoxification profile, we further demonstrate that compounds such as 1-(bromomethyl)phenanthrene can inactivate AAC(6′)-Ie by covalently modifying this residue. These compounds have the potential to be further developed as potent inhibitors of AAC(6′)-APH(2“) to overcome aminoglycoside resistance in vivo. Kanamycin A was from Bioshop (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). 4,4′-Dithiodipyridine was from Amersham Biosciences (Baie d'Urfe, Quebec, Canada). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the Central Facility of the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University. The purification of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged AAC(6′)-APH(2“) has been previously described (13Boehr D.D. Lane W.S. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and mutant enzymes were purified similarly. Aminoglycoside acetylation by AAC(6′)-Ie was normally monitored by the in situ titration of free coenzyme A product with 4,4′-dithiodipyridine as previously described (8Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, assays were scaled down from 1-ml to 250-μl volumes, so they could be conducted in 96-well microtiter plates using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus microtiter plate reader. For more sensitive assays, acetyltransferase activity was determined using [1-14C]acetyl-CoA and a phosphocellulose binding assay described previously (16Wybenga-Groot L.E. Draker K. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures typically contained 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 μCi of [1-14C]AcCoA (200 μm final concentration), 1 mm aminoglycoside substrate, and 0.3 nmol of pure AAC(6′)-Ie, and were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. Initial rates were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation1) using Grafit 4.0 (34Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 4.0. Erithacus Software, Staines, UK2000Google Scholar),v=(kcat/Et)[S]/(Km+[S])Equation 1 where v is the initial velocity,Et is the total amount of enzyme in the assay and [S] is the concentration of substrate. The concentrations of acetyl-CoA and kanamycin A were held at 300 μm when measuring the steady-state kinetic parameters for aminoglycoside substrate and acetyl-CoA, respectively. The solvent viscosity, solvent isotope, and pH effects for AAC(6′)-Ie were determined by varying the buffer conditions of the standard assay. For the solvent viscosity effect experiments, steady-state kinetic parameters were determined with varying concentrations of the microviscosogen glycerol (0, 15, 22.5, and 30% (w/v)). The viscosity of the solutions was determined using an Ostwald viscometer in triplicate, and the slope of a plot of relative viscosityversus rateo/rateviscogen reveals the solvent viscosity effect (SVE). Steady-state kinetic parameters were also performed in the macroviscosogen polyethylene glycol 8000 (6.7% w/v) and were not found to have a significant effect on the rate constants. Solvent isotope effects were measured by conducting kinetic analyses in D2O (99.9% from Isotec), where the final amount of H2O was not more than 5%. pD values were determined by measuring pH and adding 0.4 unit (pD = pH + 0.4). The proton inventory study was conducted by adding ratios of buffer in H2O and D2O and making appropriate corrections for the addition of enzyme and substrates to calculate the final amount of D2O in the enzyme assay solution. Buffers with overlapping pH ranges were used to investigate the effect of pH on enzyme activity. Buffers used were: 25 mmMOPS-NaOH (pH 6.0–6.5), 25 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.5–7.5), 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0–8.0), and 25 mmglycylglycine (pH 8.0–9.5). None of the buffers gave any significant nonspecific effects. The data were analyzed using Grafit 4 (34Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 4.0. Erithacus Software, Staines, UK2000Google Scholar). For AAC(6′)-Ie WT, which displays two ionizations, the data can be fit to the following equation through nonlinear regression,logv=logC/1+HKa+KbHEquation 2 For single ionization analysis with AAC(6′)-Ie Asp-99 → Ala, the data can be fit using nonlinear regression analysis of the following equation,logv=logC/1+KbHEquation 3 where v is the first-order (kcat) or second-order (kcat/Km) rate constant,Ka and Kb are the acid and base equilibrium constants, respectively, C is the pH-independent value, and H is the proton concentration. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The appropriate mutagenic primers (Tyr-96 → Phe, GAGATAGTCTTTGGTATGGATCAATTTATAGGAGAGCC; Asp-99 → Ala, GAGATAGTCTATGGTATGGCTCAATTTATAGGAGAGCC; Asp-99 → Asn, GAGATAGTCTATGGTATGGAACAATTTATAGGAGAGCC; and Asp-99 → Glu, GAGATAGTCTATGGTATGAATCAATTTATAGGAGAGCC) and their reverse complements were used in combination with 20 ng of template DNA (pET15AACAPH (13Boehr D.D. Lane W.S. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) in Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)-catalyzed PCR reactions. After parental DNA was digested with DpnI, mutant plasmid DNA was transformed into CaCl2-competentEscherichia coli XL-1 Blue. Positive clones were sequenced in their entirety and then used to transform into E. coliBL21(DE3) for subsequent protein purification. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations were performed as described in Ref. 35Thompson P.R. Boehr D.D. Berghuis A.M. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7001-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, where the MICs for E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying control plasmid pET15b(+) were compared with E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET15AACAPH and appropriate plasmids with site mutants in the aac(6′)-aph(2“)gene. The preparation of 1-(bromomethyl)phenanthrene and 9-(chloromethyl)phenanthrene using N-bromo- and N-chlorosuccinimide, respectively, has been previously reported (36Wright G.D. Parent T. Honek J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 1-(Bromomethyl)naphthalene was prepared in an analogous manner using N-bromosuccinimide: thin-layer chromatography,Rf (SiO2, 2% (v/v) EtOAc in hexanes), 0.42; 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.21 (d, J = 8.57 Hz, 1H, CH), 7.90 (t, J = 9.18 Hz, 2H, CH), 7.43–7.67 (m, 4 H, CH), 4.99 (s, 2H, CH2Br);13C NMR (50 MHz, CDCl3): δ 133.9, 133.2, 131.0, 129.7, 128.8, 127.7, 126.5, 126.1, 125.3, 123.6, and 31.7. Inactivation experiments were carried out by incubating enzyme (0.2–2 μm) with compound (0–200 μm) dissolved in Me2SO (0.04% v/v total) in 240 μl of 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 2 mm 4,4′-dithiodipyridine at 37 °C for 10–40 min, prior to the addition of kanamycin A and acetyl-CoA (300 μm final concentrations) to measure acetyltransferase activity. For the substrate protection experiments, kanamycin A (500 μm) and/or desulfo-CoA (100 μm) was incubated with the inactivation mixture for 10 min before the addition of acetyl-CoA (500 μm final). The concentration of desulfo-CoA used in these experiments (100 μm) was in the range of the IC50 for desulfo-CoA using 300 μm kanamycin A and 300 μmacetyl-CoA.2 The effect of pH on inactivation was determined by conducting inactivation experiments in the following buffers: 25 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 6.5), 25 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0–8.0), and 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 8.5). AAC(6′)-Ie is unique in that it is the only known member of the AAC(6′) subclass that can acetylate fortimicin A, and it also has the ability to O-acetylate aminoglycosides at the 6′ position as represented by paromomycin (8Daigle D.M. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 99-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1and Table I). The pKaof the 6′-NH3+ of aminoglycosides related to neamine (37Botto R.E. Coxon B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 1021-1028Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and kanamycin A (38Dorman D.E. Paschal J.W. Merkel K.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 6885-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has previously been determined to be 8.6. As such, a significant proportion of the aminoglycoside will be in the fully protonated state at physiological pH, and a catalytic base would be predicted to increase the efficiency of the reaction, although there is no absolute requirement for an active site base. An active site base would be predicted to be more critical with 6′-OH aminoglycosides, because the pKa of the hydroxyl will be in the range of 14–16.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of wild type and mutant AAC(6′)-IeSubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmkcatWT/kcatMUT(kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)MUTμms−1m−1s−1AAC(6′)-Ie wild type Acetyl-CoA1-aValues taken from Ref. 13.38 ± 51.2 ± 0.33.1 × 104 Kanamycin A1-aValues taken from Ref. 13.31 ± 31.7 ± 0.25.6 × 104 Neamine78.3 ± 15.70.43 ± 0.025.6 × 103 Fortimicin A25.4 ± 5.50.28 ± 0.041.1 × 104 Paromomycin324 ± 450.059 ± 0.0031.8 × 102AAC(6′)-Ie Tyr-96 → Phe Acetyl-CoA73.6 ± 12.21.3 ± 0.11.8 × 1040.921.7 Kanamycin A79.0 ± 11.11.1 ± 0.11.3 × 1041.64.2 Neamine326 ± 351.3 ± 0.13.9 × 1030.341.4 Fortimicin A43.5 ± 12.10.45 ± 0.041.0 × 1040.621.1 Paromomycin771 ± 3100.026 ± 0.0063.3 × 1012.35.5AAC(6′)-Ie Asp-99 → Ala Acetyl-CoA45.3 ± 9.00.035 ± 0.0027.9 × 1023439 Kanamycin A126 ± 280.033 ± 0.0032.6 × 10252215 Neamine443 ± 890.029 ± 0.0016.5 × 1011585 Fortimicin A1-bDue to the low activities in the mutant proteins associated with these substrates, only an estimate of kcatcould be determined where aminoglycoside was held at 1 mmand [14C]acetyl-CoA was held at 200 μm.ND1-cND, not determined.2 × 10−4ND1400ND Paromomycin1-bDue to the low activities in the mutant proteins associated with these substrates, only an estimate of kcatcould be determined where aminoglycoside was held at 1 mmand [14C]acetyl-CoA was held at 200 μm.

Open table in a new tab AAC(6′)-Ie has previously been shown to follow a random order Bi Bi kinetic mechanism (23Martel A. Masson M. Moreau N. Le Goffic F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further define the kinetic mechanism, we performed solvent viscosity effect (SVE) experiments with glycerol as the microviscosogen to identify the rate-determining step(s) in the catalytic cycle. A significant SVE indicates that one or more rate-determining steps are diffusion-controlled, with either substrate coming to the enzyme, product leaving the enzyme, or a diffusion-controlled conformational change, whereas the lack of a significant SVE effect indicates a diffusion-independent rate-determining step, such as a viscosity-independent conformational change or chemistry at the active site. There was a minor solvent viscosity effect for bothkcat and kcat/Km with acetyl-CoA as the variable substrate, but there was not a significant SVE for eitherkcat orkcat/Km with kanamycin A as the variable substrate (Table II). The lack of a SVE is consistent with the chemical step(s) being rate-limiting.Table IISolvent viscosity and solvent isotope effects for AAC(6′)-IeVaried substrateSolvent viscosity effectSolvent isotope effectn(kcat)n(kcat/Km)Hkcat/DkcatH(kcat/Km)/D(kcat/Km)Acetyl-CoA0.42 ± 0.100.44 ± 0.151.18 ± 0.041.23 ± 0.15Kanamycin A0.22 ± 0.100.08 ± 0.031.52 ± 0.053.27 ± 0.39 Open table in a new tab The importance of proton extraction in the chemical step(s) was investigated by determining solvent isotope effects (SIEs) (Hkcat/Dkcat). The only significant SIE determined for AAC(6′)-Ie was for the second order rate constant (kcat/Km) with respect to kanamycin A (Table II). As solvent isotope effects may be related to one or multiple exchangeable hydrogens, we further defined the solvent isotope effect for kanamycin A by performing a proton inventory study, where the steady-state kinetic parameters are determined in varying ratios of H2O to D2O (Fig. 2). The linearity of the curve is consistent with the SIE being due to mobilization of only one hydrogen (39Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), likely a hydrogen extracted from the 6′-NH3+position of kanamycin A. Thus, these results are consistent with deprotonation of kanamycin A being important in productive aminoglycoside capture. The effects of pH on steady-state kinetic parameters can give insight into the required ionization state of important enzyme active site residues. The pH effects for AAC(6′)-Ie showed two important ionizations whether acetyl-CoA or neamine was the variable substrate (Fig. 3, Aand B, and Table III). These pKa values may be related to the required ionization states of enzymatically important residues. Thus, for example, the acidic limb of the pH curve (pKa = 7.2–7.3) could be associated with a residue that needs to be deprotonated for maximum enzyme activity. The putative active site base required to deprotonate the antibiotic would normally need to be deprotonated to accept a hydrogen from the aminoglycoside substrate. Thus, the pH profiles are consistent with a chemical mechanism employing an active site base and an active site acid, and we can tentatively assign the first pKa to the active site base.Table IIISummary of the dependence of AAC(6′)-Ie WT and Asp-99 → Ala steady-state kinetics on pHkcatkcat/KmpKa1p"
