Two telencephalic song control nuclei, the hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale, and nucleus robustus archistriatalis are, respectively, 99 and 76 percent larger in the spring, when male canaries are producing stable adult song, than in the fall, at the end of the molt and after several months of not singing. It is hypothesized that such fluctuations reflect an increase and then reduction in numbers of synapses and are related to the yearly ability to acquire new motor coordinations."

The regular and irregular dynamics produced by periodic stimulation were predicted theoretically from a mathematical analysis of the response to single pulses. Period-doubling bifurcations, in which the period of a regular oscillation doubles, were predicted theoretically and observed experimentally."

https://openalex.org/W2018950212,"A dihydropyridine-pyridinium salt type of redox system is used in a general and flexible method for site-specific or sustained delivery (or both) of drugs to the brain. A biologically active compound linked to a lipoidal dihydropyridine carrier easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Oxidation of the carrier part in vivo to the ionic pyridinium salt prevents its elimination from the brain, while elimination from the general circulation is accelerated. Subsequent cleavage of the quaternary carrier-drug species results in sustained delivery of the drug in the brain and facile elimination of the carrier part."
https://openalex.org/W2103073905,"Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC 27774), a strictly anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, is able to perform anaerobic nitrate respiration in which nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by the action of nitrate reductase, and nitrite reductase then catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia. The nitrite reductase was found to be a membrane-bound enzyme and has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a minimal Mr = 66,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and contains 6 c-type heme groups/molecule. Pure nitrite reductase exhibits a typical c-type cytochrome absorption spectrum with reduced alpha-band at 552.5 nm. NADH and NADPH do not function as direct electron donors for the nitrite reductase. Desulfovibrio vulgaris hydrogenase, however, is able to transfer electrons from H2 to the nitrite reductase using FAD as the electron transfer mediator. The dithionite-reduced nitrite reductase was demonstrated to be auto-oxidizable even in the presence of potassium cyanide. On addition of nitrite, the dithionite-reduced enzyme is re-oxidized immediately. Hydroxylamine, however, can only partially re-oxidize the reduced enzyme. Ascorbate reduces the enzyme to a limited extent and the partially reduced enzyme is neither auto-oxidizable nor re-oxidizable by nitrite or hydroxylamine. Purified nitrite reductase has a pH optimum in the range of 8.0-9.5 and optimal activity at 57 degrees C. Purified nitrite reductase also has hydroxylamine reductase activity, and the Km for nitrite was determined to be 1.14 mM and that for hydroxylamine is 113.5 mM. The difference in Km values seems to exclude the possibility of hydroxylamine being a free intermediate in the reduction of nitrite."

https://openalex.org/W1491723881,"High mannose-type oligosaccharides of acid hydrolases are phosphorylated by the transfer of N-acetyl-glucosamine 1-phosphate to the 6 position of mannose. This is followed by removal of the covering N-acetyl-glucosamine residue to expose a phosphomonoester. We have examined the kinetics of this phosphorylation pathway in the murine macrophage line P388D1. Cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose for 15-20 min and then chased with unlabeled mannose for various times up to 5 h. The lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase was immunoprecipitated and its oligosaccharide units examined for extent of phosphorylation and uncovering. The first phosphorylated oligosaccharides were detected after 20 min of labeling. Most of the phosphorylation occurred during the first 40 min of the chase period, and a maximum of 30% of the oligosaccharide units were eventually phosphorylated. Oligosaccharides with one and two phosphodiesters were found. The earliest detectable phosphorylated species were devoid of the glucose residues known to be present on the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. Uncovering of the phosphodiesters began shortly after the oligosaccharides were phosphorylated and occurred concomitantly with the removal of outer mannose residues. Taken together, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides is a post-translational event. Proteolytic fragmentation of [3H]mannose-labeled beta-glucuronidase and partial digestion of [3H]leucine-labeled beta-glucuronidase with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H suggest that there are 3 glycosylation sites per subunit. Each glycosylation site is partially phosphorylated. A portion of the high mannose oligosaccharides at one site are processed to complex-type units."
https://openalex.org/W2090438873,"It is well established that taurine plays an important role in the maintenance of intracellular osmolal concentration in marine invertebrates, teleosts, and amphibians. In fresh water, concentrations of taurine in body tissues decrease; in salt water, they increase. In this study with mice we found that during adaptation of these mammals to chronic hypernatremia, the taurine content of the heart increased; concentrations of other amino acids were unchanged or were decreased. Welty and his associated have shown that acute hyponatremia lowered the taurine concentration of rat heart. In concert, these data suggest that taurine also may serve as an osmotic agent in mammalian heart."

https://openalex.org/W1602106147,"Platelet cytoskeletons were isolated by extracting these highly contractile cells with a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid as recently described (Rosenberg, S., Stracher, A., and Lucas, R. C. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 91, 201-211). The Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton consists mostly of actin, a high molecular weight actin-binding protein and a previously unidentified protein with an apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels of 105,000 (+/- 5,000). We describe the purification of this 105,000-dalton protein from the platelet cytoskeleton using ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion exchange chromatography. This 105,000-dalton protein was found to cross-react with antibodies to beef cardiac alpha-actinin. One-dimensional partial proteolysis maps showed similarity to, but not identity with, the major peptides of the platelet 105,000-dalton protein and skeletal muscle alpha-actinin. The platelet 105,000-dalton cytoskeletal protein binds to and causes the sedimentation of skeletal muscle F-actin under comparatively low centrifugal force. This process, however, is inhibited by calcium ions, unlike the binding of any of the muscle alpha-actinins described to date. Thus, it is likely that the 105,000-dalton protein is the platelet form of alpha-actinin, its different structure accounting for its different actin-binding behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1553997359,"Procedures for determining a 7.5 S oxysterol-binding protein in the cytosol fraction of cultured mouse fibroblasts were developed. The methods involved precipitation of cytosolic proteins between 0.3 and 0.4 saturation with (NH4)2SO4, incubation of the proteins with 25-hydroxy[3H]cholesterol at 0 degrees C and analysis by velocity sedimentation of 7.5 S radioactivity or of specific binding using dextran-charcoal to adsorb free sterol. By these means it was shown that binding of the ligand to the protein in a citric acid-phosphate buffer was optimal at pH 5.5 and that the sedimentation rate of the complex was greater at pH 7.4 (7.5 S) than at pH 5.5 (6.9 S). The binding protein was essentially saturated at a diol concentration of about 20 X 10(-9) M. The apparent Kd of the sterol-protein complex was approximately 3.9 X 10(-9) M. Cholesterol did not bind to 25-hydroxycholesterol-binding sites on the 7.5 S protein, whereas several oxysterols that are potent suppressors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase also inhibited the binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol. One of these sterols, 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one was shown to compete for sites occupied by 25-hydroxycholesterol."

https://openalex.org/W1670449993,"Male C57BL/6J mice were shown to excrete in their urine approximately 50 times as much glycolipid as do female mice. These lipids were primarily galabiglycosylceramides and globotriglycosylceramides which contained nonhydroxy and hydroxy fatty acids, sphingosine, and phytosphingosine as components of their ceramide moieties. The lipids were shown to be associated with multilamellar bodies. Neutral glycosphingolipids from kidney and urine were separated and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatographic techniques. Male kidneys were shown to contain about twice as much neutral glycosphingolipid as female kidneys. The female kidneys were virtually devoid of galactosylceramides and galabiglycosylceramides. Implantation of testosterone pellets in female mice resulted in a concomitant increase in urinary glycosphingolipids (greater than 100-fold) and in urinary lysosomal enzymes (about 10-fold). In mutant light ear mice, which are defective in excretion of lysosomal enzymes, the urinary excretion of glycolipids is also blocked. Taken together these data suggest that testosterone induces the formation of multilamellar kidney lysosomes which contain a complement of glycosphingolipids and which are normally excreted in the urine."
https://openalex.org/W1495774102,"The dehydrogenation of 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol (lathosterol) to cholest-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol (7-dehydrocholesterol) was studied in rat liver microsomes with [3H]lathosterol as substrate. Microsomal delta 5-dehydrogenase activity was stimulated by purified and sterol carrier protein (SCP) (Dempsey, M. E., McCoy, K. E., Barker, H. N., Vafiadou, A. D., Lorsbach, T., and Haward, J. B. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1867-1873). When the integrity of microsomal membranes was perturbed by treatment with detergents such as 0.2% Triton X-100 or 0.05% sodium deoxycholate or by phospholipase A2, the stimulatory effect of SCP was abolished, indicating that an intact membrane system is required for the response to SCP. Dehydrogenase solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 was not stimulated by SCP. Lathosterol was effectively incorporated into microsomes in the presence or absence of SCP. The effect of SCP on the enzymatic dehydrogenation of lathosterol previously incorporated into microsomes was significantly greater than on the conversion of exogenous substrate. Kinetically, the effect of SCP was not on initial velocity except to maintain it for much longer periods of time. Tryptic digestion of previously lathosterol-loaded microsomes inactivated the delta 5-dehydrogenase. When such trypsin-treated microsomes containing [3H]lathosterol (donor microsomes) were incubated with normal, enzymatically active microsomes (acceptor microsomes), formation of 7-dehydrocholesterol could not be detected. However, if SCP was included in this assay system, dehydrogenation occurred rapidly, suggesting SCP-mediated intermembrane translocation of lathosterol. When the membranes of acceptor microsomes were damaged by detergent or phospholipase A2, the SCP effect disappeared. SCP-mediated lathosterol transfer was shown more directly by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate trypsinized and normal microsomes. These findings show that cytoplasmic proteins promote not only intermembrane transfer of squalene (Friedlander, E. J., Caras, T. W., Liu, L.-F. H., and Bloch, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8042-8045) but also of later intermediates in cholesterol biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1610629723,"The addition of hemoglobin to isolated membrane ghosts of human erythrocytes followed by catalytic oxidation with Cu2+-o-phenanthroline results in the covalent attachment of hemoglobin to the membrane. A decrease in the mobility of Band 3 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to an increase in molecular weight of approximately 16,000 suggests that Band 3 is a site for the covalent attachment of hemoglobin to the membrane under these conditions. This conclusion was confirmed using two-dimensional gels in which the covalent linkage was cleaved with 2-mercaptoethanol in the second dimension. 14C-labeled hemoglobin was used to show that the new band was composed of one globin monomer per Band 3 monomer. Additionally, it was demonstrated that only the beta chain of hemoglobin is covalently bound to the Band 3 protein."

The first enzyme methylates phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine and has a high Km (40-42 microM) for S-adenosylmethionine, whereas the second enzyme(s) catalyzes two successive methylations of phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine to phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine and then to phosphatidylcholine and has a low Km (6.7 microM) for S-adenyl-L-methionine. The first enzyme is loosely bound to the membrane fraction; therefore it appears in both particulate (20,000 X g) and supernatant (20,000 X g) fractions, whereas the second enzyme(s) is tightly bound to the membrane and thus appears only in the particulate fraction.

https://openalex.org/W1558821334,"Rat liver phosphorylase kinase activity was increased up to 7-fold by low concentrations of heparin, but other glycosaminoglycans were relatively ineffective. A half-maximal effect was seen with 0.5 units of heparin/ml, corresponding to 150 nM. The stimulation was rapid, i.e. occurring within 15 s, and was prevented or reversed by addition of the heparin-binding protein antithrombin III. The action of heparin was also sharply reduced by prior activation of the enzyme by MgATP. In the absence of heparin, the time course of the phosphorylase kinase reaction was concave upward, whereas in the presence of heparin, a constant rate was seen. The stimulatory effect of heparin was inversely proportional to the concentration of phosphorylase b. The data suggest that heparin reversibly stimulates a low activity form of liver phosphorylase kinase to a degree similar to that found with activation by phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1608935590,"Effects of maleate on the content of CoA derivatives in isolated mitochondria and in the tissues of maleate-intoxicated rats have been studied. The addition of maleate to kidney mitochondria incubated with 2-oxo-glutarate decreased CoA-SH and acid-soluble acyl-CoA concentrations while acid insoluble acyl-CoA content remained unchanged. As a result, a substantial loss (depletion) of the total CoA occurred. Similar changes in CoA content were found in vivo in the kidneys of maleate-treated rats. Neither in the isolated liver mitochondria nor in the liver of intoxicated animals have such changes been observed before. Acetoacetate, the substrate for CoA transferase, added to kidney mitochondria before maleate, abolished its inhibitory effect on oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate and prevented the decrease of CoA content. The data are in accord with the previous findings indicating that maleate can bind and sequester CoA in the form of a stable and metabolically inert compound."

The proteins were found to be heterogeneous in their turnover rates, proteins, or subunits, with higher molecular weights being more rapidly degraded than those with lower molecular weights. The Kd values of three selected microsomal proteins with Mr 52,000, 54,000, and 56,000 presumed to represent cytochrome P-450 apoproteins were found unaltered following treatment of cultured hepatocytes with inducers of cytochrome P-450 such as phenobarbital or beta-naphthoflavone. Based on their Kd values, the half-lives of these inducible microsomal proteins were estimated to be 10.4, 9.6, and 11.3 h. The response to phenobarbital was markedly modified when cells were either pretreated with dexamethasone or formamidoxime, agents inhibiting replicative DNA synthesis. Under these conditions, the phenobarbital-mediated de novo synthesis of several microsomal proteins was enhanced. Our turnover data may offer an explanation for the rapid changes in cytochrome P-450 concentration and function following drug exposure of cultured chick embryo hepatocytes."
