https://openalex.org/W2056279562,"Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor."
https://openalex.org/W1988571169,"Oct4 is considered a master transcription factor for pluripotent cell self-renewal, but its biology remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of Oct4 using the process of induced pluripotency. We found that a defined embryonic stem cell (ESC) level of Oct4 is required for pluripotency entry. However, once pluripotency is established, the Oct4 level can be decreased up to sevenfold without loss of self-renewal. Unexpectedly, cells constitutively expressing Oct4 at an ESC level robustly differentiated into all embryonic lineages and germline. In contrast, cells with low Oct4 levels were deficient in differentiation, exhibiting expression of naive pluripotency genes in the absence of pluripotency culture requisites. The restoration of Oct4 expression to an ESC level rescued the ability of these to restrict naive pluripotent gene expression and to differentiate. In conclusion, a defined Oct4 level controls the establishment of naive pluripotency as well as commitment to all embryonic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2031754652,"Aggregation of α-synuclein can be promoted by the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25α, which we have used here as a tool to study the role of autophagy in the clearance of α-synuclein. In NGF-differentiated PC12 catecholaminergic nerve cells, we show that de novo expressed p25α co-localizes with α-synuclein and causes its aggregation and distribution into autophagosomes. However, p25α also lowered the mobility of autophagosomes and hindered the final maturation of autophagosomes by preventing their fusion with lysosomes for the final degradation of α-synuclein. Instead, p25α caused a 4-fold increase in the basal level of α-synuclein secreted into the medium. Secretion was strictly dependent on autophagy and could be up-regulated (trehalose and Rab1A) or down-regulated (3-methyladenine and ATG5 shRNA) by enhancers or inhibitors of autophagy or by modulating minus-end-directed (HDAC6 shRNA) or plus-end-directed (Rab8) trafficking of autophagosomes along microtubules. Finally, we show in the absence of tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25α that α-synuclein release was modulated by dominant mutants of Rab27A, known to regulate exocytosis of late endosomal (and amphisomal) elements, and that both lysosomal fusion block and secretion of α-synuclein could be replicated by knockdown of the p25α target, HDAC6, the predominant cytosolic deacetylase in neurons. Our data indicate that unconventional secretion of α-synuclein can be mediated through exophagy and that factors, which increase the pool of autophagosomes/amphisomes (e.g. lysosomal disturbance) or alter the polarity of vesicular transport of autophagosomes on microtubules, can result in an increased release of α-synuclein monomer and aggregates to the surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W2047043751,"Controlled induction of phagocytosis in macrophages offers the ability to therapeutically regulate the immune system as well as improve delivery of chemicals or biologicals for immune processing. Maximizing particle uptake by macrophages through Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis could lead to new delivery mechanisms in drug or vaccine development. Fc ligand density and particle size were examined independently and in combination in order to optimize and tune the phagocytosis of opsonized microparticles. We show the internalization efficiency of small polystyrene particles (0.5 µm to 2 µm) is significantly affected by changes in Fc ligand density, while particles greater than 2 µm show little correlation between internalization and Fc density. We found that while macrophages can efficiently phagocytose a large number of smaller particles, the total volume of phagocytosed particles is maximized through the non-specific uptake of larger microparticles. Therefore, larger microparticles may be more efficient at delivering a greater therapeutic payload to macrophages, but smaller opsonized microparticles can deliver bio-active substances to a greater percentage of the macrophage population. This study is the first to treat as independent variables the physical and biological properties of Fc density and microparticle size that initiate macrophage phagocytosis. Defining the physical and biological parameters that affect phagocytosis efficiency will lead to improved methods of microparticle delivery to macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1964595024,"To assess the role of the kynurenine pathway in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression and localization of key components of the kynurenine pathway including the key regulatory enzyme tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO), and the metabolites tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid and picolinic acid were assessed in different brain regions of triple transgenic AD mice. The expression and cell distribution of TDO and quinolinic acid, and their co-localization with neurofibrillary tangles and senile β amyloid deposition were also determined in hippocampal sections from human AD brains. The expression of TDO mRNA was significantly increased in the cerebellum of AD mouse brain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the density of TDO immuno-positive cells was significantly higher in the AD mice. The production of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid strongly increased in the hippocampus in a progressive and age-dependent manner in AD mice. Significantly higher TDO and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 immunoreactivity was observed in the hippocampus of AD patients. Furthermore, TDO co-localizes with quinolinic acid, neurofibrillary tangles-tau and amyloid deposits in the hippocampus of AD. These results show that the kynurenine pathway is over-activated in AD mice. This is the first report demonstrating that TDO is highly expressed in the brains of AD mice and in AD patients, suggesting that TDO-mediated activation of the kynurenine pathway could be involved in neurofibrillary tangles formation and associated with senile plaque. Our study adds to the evidence that the kynurenine pathway may play important roles in the neurodegenerative processes of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2058727654,"Phytoplasmas are a group of bacteria that are associated with hundreds of plant diseases. Due to their economical importance and the difficulties involved in the experimental study of these obligate pathogens, genome sequencing and comparative analysis have been utilized as powerful tools to understand phytoplasma biology. To date four complete phytoplasma genome sequences have been published. However, these four strains represent limited phylogenetic diversity. In this study, we report the shotgun sequencing and evolutionary analysis of a peanut witches'-broom (PnWB) phytoplasma genome. The availability of this genome provides the first representative of the 16SrII group and substantially improves the taxon sampling to investigate genome evolution. The draft genome assembly contains 13 chromosomal contigs with a total size of 562,473 bp, covering ∼90% of the chromosome. Additionally, a complete plasmid sequence is included. Comparisons among the five available phytoplasma genomes reveal the differentiations in gene content and metabolic capacity. Notably, phylogenetic inferences of the potential mobile units (PMUs) in these genomes indicate that horizontal transfer may have occurred between divergent phytoplasma lineages. Because many effectors are associated with PMUs, the horizontal transfer of these transposon-like elements can contribute to the adaptation and diversification of these pathogens. In summary, the findings from this study highlight the importance of improving taxon sampling when investigating genome evolution. Moreover, the currently available sequences are inadequate to fully characterize the pan-genome of phytoplasmas. Future genome sequencing efforts to expand phylogenetic diversity are essential in improving our understanding of phytoplasma evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2002791213,"Filaggrin protein is synthesized in the stratum granulosum of the skin and contributes to the formation of the human skin barrier. Profilaggrin is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes and converted to functional filaggrin, but its processing mechanism remains not fully elucidated. Kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) is a major serine protease found in the skin, which is secreted from lamellar granules following its expression in the stratum granulosum and activated in the extracellular space of the stratum corneum. Here, we searched for profilaggrin-processing protease(s) by partial purification of epidermal extracts and found KLK5 as a possible candidate. We used high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to show that KLK5 cleaves profilaggrin. Furthermore, based on a proximity ligation assay, immunohistochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopy analysis, we reveal that KLK5 and profilaggrin co-localize in the stratum granulosum in human epidermis. KLK5 knockdown in normal cultured human epidermal keratinocytes resulted in higher levels of profilaggrin, indicating that KLK5 potentially functions in profilaggrin cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2168433979,"Although several recent studies have reported that GPCRs adopt multiple conformations, it remains unclear how subtle conformational changes are translated into divergent downstream responses. In this study, we report on a novel class of FRET-based sensors that can detect the ligand/mutagenic stabilization of GPCR conformations that promote interactions with G proteins in live cells. These sensors rely on the well characterized interaction between a GPCR and the C terminus of a Gα subunit. We use these sensors to elucidate the influence of the highly conserved (E/D)RY motif on GPCR conformation. Specifically, Glu/Asp but not Arg mutants of the (E/D)RY motif are known to enhance basal GPCR signaling. Hence, it is unclear whether ionic interactions formed by the (E/D)RY motif (ionic lock) are necessary to stabilize basal GPCR states. We find that mutagenesis of the β2-AR (E/D)RY ionic lock enhances interaction with Gs. However, only Glu/Asp but not Arg mutants increase G protein activation. In contrast, mutagenesis of the opsin (E/D)RY ionic lock does not alter its interaction with transducin. Instead, opsin-specific ionic interactions centered on residue Lys-296 are both necessary and sufficient to promote interactions with transducin. Effective suppression of β2-AR basal activity by inverse agonist ICI 118,551 requires ionic interactions formed by the (E/D)RY motif. In contrast, the inverse agonist metoprolol suppresses interactions with Gs and promotes Gi binding, with concomitant pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Taken together, these studies validate the use of the new FRET sensors while revealing distinct structural mechanisms for ligand-dependent GPCR function."
https://openalex.org/W2059472273,"The endogenously produced oxidant hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) inhibits and kills pathogens but paradoxically is well tolerated by mammalian host tissue. Mammalian high molecular weight thioredoxin reductase (H-TrxR) is evolutionarily divergent from bacterial low molecular weight thioredoxin reductase (L-TrxR). Notably, mammalian H-TrxR contains a selenocysteine (Sec) and has wider substrate reactivity than L-TrxR. Recombinant rat cytosolic H-TrxR1, mouse mitochondrial H-TrxR2, and a purified mixture of both from rat selectively turned over HOSCN (kcat = 357 ± 16 min(-1); Km = 31.9 ± 10.3 μM) but were inactive against the related oxidant hypochlorous acid. Replacing Sec with Cys or deleting the final eight C-terminal peptides decreased affinity and turnover of HOSCN by H-TrxR. Similarly, glutathione reductase (an H-TrxR homologue lacking Sec) was less effective at HOSCN turnover. In contrast to H-TrxR and glutathione reductase, recombinant Escherichia coli L-TrxR was potently inhibited by HOSCN (IC50 = 2.75 μM). Similarly, human bronchial epithelial cell (16HBE) lysates metabolized HOSCN, but E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lysates had little or no activity. HOSCN selectively produced toxicity in bacteria, whereas hypochlorous acid was nonselectively toxic to both bacteria and 16HBE. Treatment with the H-TrxR inhibitor auranofin inhibited HOSCN metabolism in 16HBE lysates and significantly increased HOSCN-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate both the metabolism of HOSCN by mammalian H-TrxR resulting in resistance to HOSCN in mammalian cells and the potent inhibition of bacterial L-TrxR resulting in cytotoxicity in bacteria. These data support a novel selective mechanism of host defense in mammals wherein HOSCN formation simultaneously inhibits pathogens while sparing host tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2007126009,"Trithorax group proteins methylate lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) at active gene promoters. MLL5 protein, a member of the Trithorax protein family, has been implicated in the control of the cell cycle progression; however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) have not been fully determined. In this study, we found that the MLL5 protein can associate with the cell cycle regulator ""host cell factor"" (HCF-1). The interaction between MLL5 and HCF-1 is mediated by the ""HCF-1 binding motif"" (HBM) of the MLL5 protein and the Kelch domain of the HCF-1 protein. Confocal microscopy showed that the MLL5 protein largely colocalized with HCF-1 in the nucleus. Knockdown of MLL5 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Moreover, down-regulation of E2F1 target gene expression and decreased H3K4me3 levels at E2F1-responsive promoters were observed in MLL5 knockdown cells. Additionally, the core subunits, including ASH2L, RBBP5, and WDR5, that are necessary for effective H3K4 methyltransferase activities of the Trithorax protein complexes, were absent in the MLL5 complex, suggesting that a distinct mechanism may be used by MLL5 for exerting its H3K4 methyltransferase activity. Together, our findings demonstrate that MLL5 could associate with HCF-1 and then be recruited to E2F1-responsive promoters to stimulate H3K4 trimethylation and transcriptional activation, thereby facilitating the cell cycle G1 to S phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W2046669934,"Despite appropriate anti-malarial treatment, cerebral malaria (CM)-associated mortalities remain as high as 30%. Thus, adjunctive therapies are urgently needed to prevent or reduce such mortalities. Overproduction of CXCL10 in a subset of CM patients has been shown to be tightly associated with fatal human CM. Mice with deleted CXCL10 gene are partially protected against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mortality indicating the importance of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of CM. However, the direct effect of increased CXCL10 production on brain cells is unknown. We assessed apoptotic effects of CXCL10 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBVECs) and neuroglia cells in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that reducing overexpression of CXCL10 with a synthetic drug during CM pathogenesis will increase survival and reduce mortality. We utilized atorvastatin, a widely used synthetic blood cholesterol-lowering drug that specifically targets and reduces plasma CXCL10 levels in humans, to determine the effects of atorvastatin and artemether combination therapy on murine ECM outcome. We assessed effects of atorvastatin treatment on immune determinants of severity, survival, and parasitemia in ECM mice receiving a combination therapy from onset of ECM (day 6 through 9 post-infection) and compared results with controls. The results indicate that CXCL10 induces apoptosis in HBVECs and neuroglia cells in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that increased levels of CXCL10 in CM patients may play a role in vasculopathy, neuropathogenesis, and brain injury during CM pathogenesis. Treatment of ECM in mice with atorvastatin significantly reduced systemic and brain inflammation by reducing the levels of the anti-angiogenic and apoptotic factor (CXCL10) and increasing angiogenic factor (VEGF) production. Treatment with a combination of atorvastatin and artemether improved survival (100%) when compared with artemether monotherapy (70%), p<0.05. Thus, adjunctively reducing CXCL10 levels and inflammation by atorvastatin treatment during anti-malarial therapy may represent a novel approach to treating CM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2072052386,"Frequent collisions between cellular DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and obstacles such as damaged DNA or frozen protein complexes make DNA replication fork progression surprisingly sporadic. These collisions can lead to the ejection of replisomes prior to completion of replication, which, if left unrepaired, results in bacterial cell death. As such, bacteria have evolved DNA replication restart mechanisms that function to reload replisomes onto abandoned DNA replication forks. Here, we define a direct interaction between PriC, a key Escherichia coli DNA replication restart protein, and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), a protein that is ubiquitously associated with DNA replication forks. PriC/SSB complex formation requires evolutionarily conserved residues from both proteins, including a pair of Arg residues from PriC and the C terminus of SSB. In vitro, disruption of the PriC/SSB interface by sequence changes in either protein blocks the first step of DNA replication restart, reloading of the replicative DnaB helicase onto an abandoned replication fork. Consistent with the critical role of PriC/SSB complex formation in DNA replication restart, PriC variants that cannot bind SSB are non-functional in vivo. Single-molecule experiments demonstrate that PriC binding to SSB alters SSB/DNA complexes, exposing single-stranded DNA and creating a platform for other proteins to bind. These data lead to a model in which PriC interaction with SSB remodels SSB/DNA structures at abandoned DNA replication forks to create a DNA structure that is competent for DnaB loading."
https://openalex.org/W2105166054,"Nonsegmental vitiligo (NSV) is characterized by loss of inherited skin color. The cause of the disease is still unknown despite accumulating in vivo and in vitro evidence of massive epidermal oxidative stress via H2O2 and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) in affected individuals. The most favored hypothesis is based on autoimmune mechanisms. Strictly segmental vitiligo (SSV) with dermatomal distribution is a rare entity, often associated with stable outcome. Recently, it was documented that this form can be associated with NSV (mixed vitiligo). We here asked the question whether ROS and possibly ONOO(-) could be players in the pathogenesis of SSV. Our in situ results demonstrate for the first time epidermal biopterin accumulation together with significantly decreased epidermal catalase, thioredoxin/thioreoxin reductase, and MSRA/MSRB expression. Moreover, we show epidermal ONOO(-) accumulation. In vivo FT-Raman spectroscopy reveals the presence of H2O2, methionine sulfoxide, and tryptophan metabolites; i.e., N-formylkynurenine and kynurenine, implying Fenton chemistry in the cascade (n=10). Validation of the basic data stems from successful repigmentation of skin and eyelashes in affected individuals, regardless of SSV or segmental vitiligo in association with NSV after reduction of epidermal H2O2 (n=5). Taken together, our contribution strongly supports H2O2/ONOO-mediated stress in the pathogenesis of SSV. Our findings offer new treatment intervention for lost skin and hair color."
https://openalex.org/W2015498372,"The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is overexpressed in many cancer types including thyroid carcinomas and has well established roles in tumor formation and progression. Proper folding, maturation, and activity of several oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases require HSP90 chaperoning. HSP90 inhibition by the antibiotic geldanamycin or its derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) causes destabilization of its client proteins. Here we show that AXL is a novel client protein of HSP90. 17-AAG induced a time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of endogenous or ectopically expressed AXL protein, thereby inhibiting AXL-mediated signaling and biological activity. 17-AAG-induced AXL down-regulation specifically affected fully glycosylated mature receptor present on cell membrane. By using biotin and [35S]methionine labeling, we showed that 17-AAG caused depletion of membrane-localized AXL by mediating its degradation in the intracellular compartment, thus restricting its exposure on the cell surface. 17-AAG induced AXL polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation; under basal conditions, AXL co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90. Upon 17-AAG treatment, AXL associated with the co-chaperone HSP70 and the ubiquitin E3 ligase carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP). Overexpression of CHIP, but not of the inactive mutant CHIP K30A, induced accumulation of AXL polyubiquitinated species upon 17-AAG treatment. The sensitivity of AXL to 17-AAG required its intracellular domain because an AXL intracellular domain-deleted mutant was insensitive to the compound. Active AXL and kinase-dead AXL were similarly sensitive to 17-AAG, implying that 17-AAG sensitivity does not require receptor phosphorylation. Overall our data elucidate the molecular basis of AXL down-regulation by HSP90 inhibitors and suggest that HSP90 inhibition in anticancer therapy can exert its effect through inhibition of multiple kinases including AXL.Background: AXL is an established therapeutic target in various cancers. HSP90 chaperoning is critical in maintaining the stability of several oncogenic kinases.Results: HSP90 blockade by 17-AAG induced cytosolic mature AXL degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and impeded its membrane localization.Conclusion: AXL depends on HSP90 for its stability and membrane translocation.Significance: Targeting HSP90 would avail a strategy to counteract AXL.

https://openalex.org/W2120449014,"Interactions between the immune and skeletal systems in inflammatory bone diseases are well appreciated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that coordinate the resolution phase of inflammation and bone turnover have not been unveiled. Here we investigated the direct actions of the proresolution mediator resolvin E1 (RvE1) on bone-marrow-cell-derived osteoclasts in an in vitro murine model of osteoclast maturation and inflammatory bone resorption. Investigation of the actions of RvE1 treatment on the specific stages of osteoclast maturation revealed that RvE1 targeted late stages of osteoclast maturation to decrease osteoclast formation by 32.8%. Time-lapse vital microscopy and migration assays confirmed that membrane fusion of osteoclast precursors was inhibited. The osteoclast fusion protein DC-STAMP was specifically targeted by RvE1 receptor binding and was down-regulated by 65.4%. RvE1 did not affect the induction of the essential osteoclast transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) or its nuclear translocation; however, NFATc1 binding to the DC-STAMP promoter was significantly inhibited by 60.9% with RvE1 treatment as shown in electrophoresis mobility shift assay. Our findings suggest that proresolution mediators act directly on osteoclasts, in addition to down-regulation of inflammation, providing a novel mechanism for modulating osteoclast signaling in osteolytic inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070375238,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. C. jejuni lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a potent activator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated innate immunity. Structural variations of the LOS have been previously reported in the oligosaccharide (OS) moiety, the disaccharide lipid A (LA) backbone, and the phosphorylation of the LA. Here, we studied LOS structural variation between C. jejuni strains associated with different ecological sources and analyzed their ability to activate TLR4 function. MALDI-TOF MS was performed to characterize structural variation in both the OS and LA among 15 different C. jejuni isolates. Cytokine induction in THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was correlated with LOS structural variation in each strain. Additionally, structural variation was correlated with the source of each strain. OS sialylation, increasing abundance of LA d-glucosamine versus 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucose, and phosphorylation status all correlated with TLR4 activation as measured in THP-1 cells and monocytes. Importantly, LOS-induced inflammatory responses were similar to those elicited by live bacteria, highlighting the prominent contribution of the LOS component in driving host immunity. OS sialylation status but not LA structure showed significant association with strains clustering with livestock sources. Our study highlights how variations in three structural components of C. jejuni LOS alter TLR4 activation and consequent monocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W2076628461,"Background DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands is associated with gene suppression, and its unique genome-wide profiles have been linked to tumor progression. Coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, it can now efficiently determine genome-wide methylation profiles in cancer cells. Also, experimental and computational technologies make it possible to find the functional relationship between cancer-specific methylation patterns and their clinicopathological parameters. Methodology/Principal Findings Cancer methylome system (CMS) is a web-based database application designed for the visualization, comparison and statistical analysis of human cancer-specific DNA methylation. Methylation intensities were obtained from MBDCap-sequencing, pre-processed and stored in the database. 191 patient samples (169 tumor and 22 normal specimen) and 41 breast cancer cell-lines are deposited in the database, comprising about 6.6 billion uniquely mapped sequence reads. This provides comprehensive and genome-wide epigenetic portraits of human breast cancer and endometrial cancer to date. Two views are proposed for users to better understand methylation structure at the genomic level or systemic methylation alteration at the gene level. In addition, a variety of annotation tracks are provided to cover genomic information. CMS includes important analytic functions for interpretation of methylation data, such as the detection of differentially methylated regions, statistical calculation of global methylation intensities, multiple gene sets of biologically significant categories, interactivity with UCSC via custom-track data. We also present examples of discoveries utilizing the framework. Conclusions/Significance CMS provides visualization and analytic functions for cancer methylome datasets. A comprehensive collection of datasets, a variety of embedded analytic functions and extensive applications with biological and translational significance make this system powerful and unique in cancer methylation research.

https://openalex.org/W2029378486,"The aims of the present study were to elucidate a possible mechanism of kidney crystal formation by using a metabolic syndrome (MetS) mouse model and to assess the effectiveness of adiponectin treatment for the prevention of kidney crystals. Further, we performed genome-wide expression analyses for investigating novel genetic environmental changes. Wild-type (+/+) mice showed no kidney crystal formation, whereas ob/ob mice showed crystal depositions in their renal tubules. However, this deposition was remarkably reduced by adiponectin. Expression analysis of genes associated with MetS-related kidney crystal formation identified 259 genes that were >2.0-fold up-regulated and 243 genes that were <0.5-fold down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed that the up-regulated genes belonged to the categories of immunoreaction, inflammation, and adhesion molecules and that the down-regulated genes belonged to the categories of oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. Expression analysis of adiponectin-induced genes related to crystal prevention revealed that the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes were 154 and 190, respectively. GO analyses indicated that the up-regulated genes belonged to the categories of cellular and mitochondrial repair, whereas the down-regulated genes belonged to the categories of immune and inflammatory reactions and apoptosis. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that the mechanism of kidney crystal formation in the MetS environment involves the progression of an inflammation and immunoresponse, including oxidative stress and adhesion reactions in renal tissues. This is the first report to prove the preventive effect of adiponectin treatment for kidney crystal formation by renoprotective activities and inhibition of inflammation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2090560504,"Adenoviral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric patients. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived human adenovirus (HAdV)-specific T-cells represents a promising treatment option. However, the difficulty in identifying and selecting rare HAdV-specific T-cells, and the short time span between patients at high risk for invasive infection and viremia are major limitations. We therefore developed an IL-15-driven 6 to 12 day short-term protocol for in vitro detection of HAdV-specific T cells, as revealed by known MHC class I multimers and a newly identified adenoviral CD8 T-cell epitope derived from the E1A protein for the frequent HLA-type A*02∶01 and IFN-γ. Using this novel and improved diagnostic approach we observed a correlation between adenoviral load and reconstitution of CD8(+) and CD4(+) HAdV-specific T-cells including central memory cells in HSCT-patients. Adaption of the 12-day protocol to good manufacturing practice conditions resulted in a 2.6-log (mean) expansion of HAdV-specific T-cells displaying high cytolytic activity (4-fold) compared to controls and low or absent alloreactivity. Similar protocols successfully identified and rapidly expanded CMV-, EBV-, and BKV-specific T-cells. Our approach provides a powerful clinical-grade convertible tool for rapid and cost-effective detection and enrichment of multiple virus-specific T-cells that may facilitate broad clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W1972624411,"The goal of this study was to identify novel factors that mediate skeletal muscle development or function. We began the study by searching the gene expression databases for genes that have no known functions but are preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle. This search led to the identification of the Src homology three (SH3) domain and cysteine rich (C1) domain 3 (Stac3) gene. We experimentally confirmed that Stac3 mRNA was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. We determined if Stac3 plays a role in skeletal muscle development or function by generating Stac3 knockout mice. All Stac3 homozygous mutant mice were found dead at birth, were never seen move, and had a curved body and dropping forelimbs. These mice had marked abnormalities in skeletal muscles throughout the body, including central location of myonuclei, decreased number but increased cross-sectional area of myofibers, decreased number and size of myofibrils, disarrayed myofibrils, and streaming Z-lines. These phenotypes demonstrate that the Stac3 gene plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development and function in mice."

Expression of myocilin was detected in MSCs derived from mouse, rat, and human bone marrow, with human MSCs exhibiting the highest level of myocilin expression. Expression of myocilin rose during the course of human MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes, and treatment with exogenous myocilin further enhanced osteogenesis. MSCs derived from Myoc-null mice had a reduced ability to differentiate into the osteoblastic lineage, which was partially rescued by exogenous extracellular myocilin treatment. Myocilin also stimulated osteogenic differentiation of wild-type MSCs, which was associated with activation of the p38, Erk1/2, and JNK MAP kinase signaling pathways as well as up-regulated expression of the osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Dlx5. Finally, cortical bone thickness and trabecular volume, as well as the expression level of osteopontin, a known factor of bone remodeling and osteoblast differentiation, were reduced dramatically in the femurs of Myoc-null mice compared with wild-type mice. These data suggest that myocilin should be considered as a target for improving the bone regenerative potential of MSCs and may identify a new role for myocilin in bone formation and/or maintenance in vivo.Background: Myocilin, a secreted glaucoma-associated protein, is detected in ocular and non-ocular tissues.Results: Myocilin is expressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and stimulates their differentiation into osteoblasts.Conclusion: Myocilin-stimulated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is associated with activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways.Significance: Modulation of myocilin activity could potentially be targeted to improve the bone-regenerative potential of MSCs.

https://openalex.org/W2045200199,"Ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins link cortical actin to the plasma membrane and coordinate cellular events that require cytoskeletal rearrangement, including cell division, migration, and invasion. While ERM proteins are involved in many important cellular events, the mechanisms regulating their function are not completely understood. Our laboratory previously identified reciprocal roles for the sphingolipids ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the regulation of ERM proteins. We recently showed that ceramide-induced activation of PP1α leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERM proteins, while S1P results in phosphorylation and activation of ERM proteins. Following these findings, we aimed to examine known inducers of the SK/S1P pathway and evaluate their ability to regulate ERM proteins. We examined EGF, a known inducer of the SK/S1P pathway, for its ability to regulate the ERM family of proteins. We found that EGF induces ERM c-terminal threonine phosphorylation via activation of the SK/S1P pathway, as this was prevented by siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SK. Using pharmacological, as well as genetic, knockdown approaches, we determined that EGF induces ERM phosphorylation via activation of S1PR2. In addition, EGF led to cell polarization in the form of lamellipodia, and this occurred through a mechanism involving S1PR2-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin T567. EGF-induced cellular invasion was also found to be dependent on S1PR2-induced T567 ezrin phosphorylation, such that S1PR2 antagonist, JTE-013, and expression of a dominant-negative ezrin mutant prevented cellular invasion toward EGF. In this work, a novel mechanism of EGF-stimulated invasion is unveiled, whereby S1P-mediated activation of S1PR2 and phosphorylation of ezrin T567 is required.—Orr Gandy, K.

https://openalex.org/W2128958592,"To elucidate the molecular requirements for cancer cell internalization of the extracellular cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C, 12 variants of the protein were produced and used for uptake experiments in MCF-7 cells. Variants with alterations in the cysteine cathepsin binding region ((Δ1–10)-, K5A-, R8G-, (R8G,L9G,V10G)-, (R8G,L9G,V10G,W106G)-, and W106G-cystatin C) were internalized to a very low extent compared with the wild-type inhibitor. Substitutions of N39 in the legumain binding region (N39K- and N39A-cystatin C) decreased the internalization and (R24A,R25A)-cystatin C, with substitutions of charged residues not involved in enzyme inhibition, was not taken up at all. Two variants, W106F- and K75A-cystatin C, showed that the internalization can be positively affected by engineering of the cystatin molecule. Microscopy revealed vesicular co-localization of internalized cystatin C with the lysosomal marker proteins cathepsin D and legumain. Activities of both cysteine cathepsins and legumain, possible target enzymes associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis, were down-regulated in cell homogenates following cystatin C uptake. A positive effect on regulation of intracellular enzyme activity by a cystatin variant selected from uptake properties was illustrated by incubating cells with W106F-cystatin C. This resulted in more efficient down-regulation of intracellular legumain activity than when cells were incubated with wild-type cystatin C. Uptake experiments in prostate cancer cells corroborated that the cystatin C internalization is generally relevant and confirmed an increased uptake of W106F-cystatin C, in PC3 cells. Thus, intracellular cysteine proteases involved in cancer-promoting processes might be controled by cystatin uptake.Background: The secreted protease inhibitor cystatin C is internalized into cancer cells.Results: Cystatin variants with altered uptake characteristics were identified, and shown to differently inhibit intracellular cathepsin B and legumain activities.Conclusion: The internalization process, and hence intracellular enzyme activity, can be modulated by selected cystatin variants.Significance: The cystatin C uptake system may be targeted to control cancer-promoting activities of tumor cells.

We evaluated the roles of RORγt-expressing cells in mouse acute hepatitis model using RORγt deficient (RORγt−/−) mice and RAG-2 and RORγt double deficient (RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/−) mice. Acute hepatitis was induced in mice by injection with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), to investigate the regulation of liver inflammation by RORγt-expressing cells. We detected RORC expression in three compartments, CD4+ T cells, NKT cells, and lineage marker-negative SCA-1+Thy1high ILCs, of the liver of wild type (WT) mice. CCl4-treated RORγt−/− mice developed liver damage in spite of lack of RORγt-dependent cells, but with reduced infiltration of macrophages compared with WT mice. In this regard, ILCs were significantly decreased in RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/− mice that lacked T and NKT cells. Surprisingly, RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/− mice developed significantly severer CCl4-induced hepatitis compared with RAG-2−/− mice, in accordance with the fact that hepatic ILCs failed to produce IL-22. Lastly, anti-Thy1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not anti-NK1.1 mAb or anti-asialo GM1 Ab administration exacerbated liver damage in RAG-2−/− mice with the depletion of liver ILCs. Collectively, hepatic RORγt-dependent ILCs play a part of protective roles in hepatic immune response in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1979481826,"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor protein are highly frequent in tumors and often endow cells with tumorigenic capacities. We sought to examine a possible role for mutant p53 in the cross-talk between cancer cells and their surrounding stroma, which is a crucial factor affecting tumor outcome. Here we present a novel model which enables individual monitoring of the response of cancer cells and stromal cells (fibroblasts) to co-culturing. We found that fibroblasts elicit the interferon beta (IFNβ) pathway when in contact with cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their migration. Mutant p53 in the tumor was able to alleviate this response via SOCS1 mediated inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation. IFNβ on the other hand, reduced mutant p53 RNA levels by restricting its RNA stabilizer, WIG1. These data underscore mutant p53 oncogenic properties in the context of the tumor microenvironment and suggest that mutant p53 positive cancer patients might benefit from IFNβ treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2009145856,"Studying the dispersal of small flying insects such as Culicoides constitutes a great challenge due to huge population sizes and lack of a method to efficiently mark and objectively detect many specimens at a time. We here describe a novel mark-release-recapture method for Culicoides in the field using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as marking agent without anaesthesia. Using a plate scanner, this detection technique can be used to analyse thousands of individual Culicoides specimens per day at a reasonable cost. We marked and released an estimated 853 specimens of the Pulicaris group and 607 specimens of the Obsoletus group on a cattle farm in Denmark. An estimated 9,090 (8,918-9,260) Obsoletus group specimens and 14,272 (14,194-14,448) Pulicaris group specimens were captured in the surroundings and subsequently analysed. Two (0.3%) Obsoletus group specimens and 28 (4.6%) Pulicaris group specimens were recaptured. The two recaptured Obsoletus group specimens were caught at the release point on the night following release. Eight (29%) of the recaptured Pulicaris group specimens were caught at a pig farm 1,750 m upwind from the release point. Five of these were recaptured on the night following release and the three other were recaptured on the second night after release. This is the first time that movement of Culicoides vectors between farms in Europe has been directly quantified. The findings suggest an extensive and rapid exchange of disease vectors between farms. Rapid movement of vectors between neighboring farms may explain the the high rate of spatial spread of Schmallenberg and bluetongue virus (BTV) in northern Europe."
https://openalex.org/W1974067315,"Background syndromic surveillance system has great advantages in promoting the early detection of epidemics and reducing the necessities of disease confirmation, and it is especially effective for surveillance in resource poor settings. However, most current syndromic surveillance systems are established in developed countries, and there are very few reports on the development of an electronic syndromic surveillance system in resource-constrained settings. Objective this study describes the design and pilot implementation of an electronic surveillance system (ISS) for the early detection of infectious disease epidemics in rural China, complementing the conventional case report surveillance system. Methods ISS was developed based on an existing platform ‘Crisis Information Sharing Platform’ (CRISP), combining with modern communication and GIS technology. ISS has four interconnected functions: 1) work group and communication group; 2) data source and collection; 3) data visualization; and 4) outbreak detection and alerting. Results As of Jan. 31st 2012, ISS has been installed and pilot tested for six months in four counties in rural China. 95 health facilities, 14 pharmacies and 24 primary schools participated in the pilot study, entering respectively 74256, 79701, and 2330 daily records into the central database. More than 90% of surveillance units at the study sites are able to send daily information into the system. In the paper, we also presented the pilot data from health facilities in the two counties, which showed the ISS system had the potential to identify the change of disease patterns at the community level. Conclusions The ISS platform may facilitate the early detection of infectious disease epidemic as it provides near real-time syndromic data collection, interactive visualization, and automated aberration detection. However, several constraints and challenges were encountered during the pilot implementation of ISS in rural China."
https://openalex.org/W2091691018,"Although functional trait variability is increasingly used in community ecology, the scale- and size-dependent aspects of trait variation are usually disregarded. Here we quantified the spatial structure of shoot height, branch length, root/shoot ratio and leaf number in a macrophyte species Potamogeton maackianus, and then disentangled the environmental and ontogenetic effects on these traits. Using a hierarchical nested design, we measured the four traits from 681 individuals across five ecological scales: lake, transect, depth stratus, quadrat and individual. A notable high trait variation (coefficient variation: 48-112%) was observed within species. These traits differed in the spatial structure, depending on environmental factors of different scales. Shoot height and branch length were most responsive to lake, transect and depth stratus scales, while root/shoot ratio and leaf number to quadrat and individual scales. The trait variations caused by environment are nearly three times higher than that caused by ontogeny, with ontogenetic variance ranging from 21% (leaf number) to 33% (branch length) of total variance. Remarkably, these traits showed non-negligible ontogenetic variation (0-60%) in each ecological scale, and significant shifts in allometric trajectories at lake and depth stratus scales. Our results highlight that environmental filtering processes can sort individuals within species with traits values adaptive to environmental changes and ontogenetic variation of functional traits was non-negligible across the five ecological scales."
https://openalex.org/W2119694742,"Recruited macrophages play a critical role in liver repair after acute liver injury. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoattractant for macrophages. In this study, we investigated the role of LTB4 receptor type 1 (BLT1) in liver repair during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. BLT1-knockout mice (BLT1-/-) or their wild-type counterparts (WT) were subjected to partial hepatic I/R. Compared with WT, BLT1-/- exhibited delayed liver repair and hepatocyte proliferation accompanied by a 70% reduction in the recruitment of macrophages and a 70–80% attenuation in hepatic expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Disruption of BLT1 signaling also reduced the expression of EGF by 67% on recruited macrophages expressing VEGFR1 in the injured liver. Treatment of WT mice with an EGF-neutralizing antibody delayed liver repair and reduced macrophage recruitment, compared with control immunoglobulin G (IgG). BLT1 signaling enhanced the expression of VEGF, VEGFR1, and EGF in isolated peritoneal macrophages in vitro. These results indicate that BLT1 signaling plays a role in liver repair after hepatic I/R through enhanced expression of EGF in recruited macrophages and that the development of a specific agonist for BLT1 could be useful for liver recovery from acute liver injury.—Ohkubo, H., Ito, Y., Minamino, T., Mishima, T., Hirata, M., Hosono, K., Shibuya, M., Yokomizo, T., Shimizu, T., Watanabe, M., Majima, M., Leukotriene B4 type-1 receptor signaling promotes liver repair after hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury through the enhancement of macrophage recruitment.

https://openalex.org/W1985556671,"Objective To describe severity of anemia and explore its determinants among children under 36 months old in rural western China. Study Design The family information of 6711 children was collected and their hemoglobin was measured in 2005. A generalized estimated equation (GEE) linear model was used to identify the determinants of severity of childhood anemia. Results The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anemia among these children was 27.4%, 21.9% and 3.2% respectively. GEE model analysis showed that province-level region and severity of maternal anemia affected the severity of childhood anemia not only in 0–5 months but also beyond 5 months. In addition, children aged 0–5 months in families using iron pot (coefficient = −0.26 95%CI −0.41,−0.12) had seldom more severe anemia, and children aged 6–36 months in families more than 4 members (coefficient = −0.03 95%CI −0.06,−0.01) or of Han ethnicity (coefficient = −0.08 95%CI −0.13,−0.04) seldom had more severe anemia but boys (coefficient = 0.03 95%CI 0.01,0.06) or younger children (6–11 month vs 30–36 month: coefficient = 0.23 95%CI 0.17, 0.28; 12–17 month vs 30–36 month: coefficient = 0.19 95%CI 0.15,0.24; 18–23 vs 30–36 month: coefficient = 0.09 95%CI 0.04,0.13) had more severe anemia. Conclusion The prevalence of moderate-to-severe anemia in these children was about 25%. Province-level region, iron pot use, family size, ethnicity, age and gender of children and severity of maternal anemia were important determinants of the severity of childhood anemia. These findings have some important implications for health policy decision for childhood anemia in rural western China."

Here, we report that young Sle1b mice, but not Sle1b.Slamf6-H1 or B6 mice, contain a memory T-helper cell subset identified by ∗∗∗[mt]2-fold increase in expression of 17 genes, chief among which is Spp1, encoding the cytokine osteopontin (OPN). These T follicular helper (TFH) cells, including OPN+ TFH cells, expand concomitantly with severity of the disease. By contrast, Sle1b.Slamf6-H1 or Sle1b.SAP–/– mice do not develop autoantibodies and the number of TFH cells is 5 times lower than in age-matched Sle1b mice. By comparing Sle1b and Sle1b.OPN–/– mice, we find that the lack of OPN expression impedes early autoantibody production. Furthermore, on the adoptive transfer of Sle1b.OPN–/– CD4+ T cells into bm12 recipients autoantibody production and germinal center formation is reduced compared to recipients of Sle1b.OPN+/+ CD4+ T cells. We propose a model in which OPN provides a survival signal for a precursor TFH cell subset, which is a key factor in autoimmunity.

In the present investigation, we use redox experiments of monomeric cystatin C, stabilized against domain swapping by an intramolecular disulfide bond, to generate stable oligomers (dimers, trimers, tetramers, decamers, and high molecular weight oligomers). These oligomers were characterized concerning size by gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry, shape by electron and atomic force microscopy, and, function by assays of their capacity to inhibit proteases.

https://openalex.org/W1977844327,"Long-chain fatty acids are internalized by receptor-mediated mechanisms or receptor-independent diffusion across cytoplasmic membranes and are utilized as nutrients, building blocks, and signaling intermediates. Here we describe how the association of long-chain fatty acids to a partially unfolded, extracellular protein can alter the presentation to target cells and cellular effects. HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a tumoricidal complex of partially unfolded α-lactalbumin and oleic acid (OA). As OA lacks independent tumoricidal activity at concentrations equimolar to HAMLET, the contribution of the lipid has been debated. We show by natural abundance (13)C NMR that the lipid in HAMLET is deprotonated and by chromatography that oleate rather than oleic acid is the relevant HAMLET constituent. Compared with HAMLET, oleate (175 μm) showed weak effects on ion fluxes and gene expression. Unlike HAMLET, which causes metabolic paralysis, fatty acid metabolites were less strongly altered. The functional overlap increased with higher oleate concentrations (500 μm). Cellular responses to OA were weak or absent, suggesting that deprotonation favors cellular interactions of fatty acids. Fatty acids may thus exert some of their essential effects on host cells when in the deprotonated state and when presented in the context of a partially unfolded protein."
https://openalex.org/W1984893046,"Background Obesity is considered as a systemic chronic low grade inflammation characterized by increased serum pro-inflammatory proteins and accumulation of macrophages within white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese patients. C5L2, a 7-transmembrane receptor, serves a dual function, binding the lipogenic hormone acylation stimulating protein (ASP), and C5a, involved in innate immunity. Aim We evaluated the impact of C5L2 on macrophage infiltration in WAT of wildtype (Ctl) and C5L2 knock-out (C5L2−/−) mice over 6, 12 and 24 weeks on a chow diet and moderate diet-induced obesity (DIO) conditions. Results In Ctl mice, WAT C5L2 and C5a receptor mRNA increased (up to 10-fold) both over time and with DIO. By contrast, in C5L2−/−, there was no change in C5aR in WAT. C5L2−/− mice displayed higher macrophage content in WAT, varying by time, fat depot and diet, associated with altered systemic and WAT cytokine patterns compared to Ctl mice. However, in all cases, the M1 (pro-) vs M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophage proportion was unchanged but C5L2−/− adipose tissue secretome appeared to be more chemoattractant. Moreover, C5L2−/− mice have increased food intake, increased WAT, and altered WAT lipid gene expression, which is reflected systemically. Furthermore, C5L2−/− mice have altered glucose/insulin metabolism, adiponectin and insulin signalling gene expression in WAT, which could contribute to development of insulin resistance. Conclusion Disruption of C5L2 increases macrophage presence in WAT, contributing to obesity-associated pathologies, and further supports a dual role of complement in WAT. Understanding this effect of the complement system pathway could contribute to targeting treatment of obesity and its comorbidities."

Data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health needs, pattern of usage, and satisfaction with provided service were compiled. The validity of the response was evaluated by an explanatory mixed-effects multilevel model in order to assess the factors associated with the response according to the welfare theory. Response reliability was also evaluated. Subjects included in the study indicated an average Willingness to Pay (WTP) of €14.4 (CI 95%: €13.2–15.5; median €10) and an average Willingness to Accept [Compensation] (WTA) of €20.9 (CI 95%: €19.6–22.2; median €20). Average area income, personal income, consultation duration, home visit, and education level correlated with greater WTP. Women and older subjects showed lower WTP. Fixed parameters explained 8.41% of the residual variability, and response clustering in different health centers explained 4–6% of the total variability. The influence of income on WTP was different in each center. The responses for WTP and WTA in a subgroup of subjects were consistent when reassessed after 2 weeks (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.952 and 0.893, respectively). Conclusions The economic value of nursing services provided within PC in a public health system is clearly perceived by its user. The perception of this value is influenced by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the subjects and their environment, and by the unique characteristics of the evaluated service. The method of contingent valuation is useful for making explicit this perception of value of health services."
https://openalex.org/W1995269246,"Morbidity and mortality rates of low birth weight (LBW) newborns at term are higher than rates in normal birth weight (NBW) newborns. LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity.To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW newborns we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW newborns (n = 8) compared to NBW newborns (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW = 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns. ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW newborns and in adults (LBW = 18, NBW = 18, Adults= 8).Upon microarray analysis, we identified 1,391 differentially expressed genes, of which, 1,065 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated in the LBW compared to NBW newborns. Of note, 70 IFN-signature genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LBW compared to NBW newborns. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed pattern recognition receptors signaling including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -1, -5, and -8 genes and IFN signaling as the most significantly impacted pathways. Respiratory infectious diseases were the most significantly affected bio-functions in LBW newborns.Diminished PRRs, IFN-signature, and BPI gene expression raises the possibility that impairments in these pathways contribute to the susceptibility of LBW term infants to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2001575594,"The distributions and relative densities of species are keys to ecology. Large amounts of tracking data are being collected on a wide variety of animal species using several methods, especially electronic tags that record location. These tracking data are effectively used for many purposes, but generally provide biased measures of distribution, because the starts of the tracks are not randomly distributed among the locations used by the animals. We introduce a simple Markov-chain method that produces unbiased measures of relative density from tracking data. The density estimates can be over a geographical grid, and/or relative to environmental measures. The method assumes that the tracked animals are a random subset of the population in respect to how they move through the habitat cells, and that the movements of the animals among the habitat cells form a time-homogenous Markov chain. We illustrate the method using simulated data as well as real data on the movements of sperm whales. The simulations illustrate the bias introduced when the initial tracking locations are not randomly distributed, as well as the lack of bias when the Markov method is used. We believe that this method will be important in giving unbiased estimates of density from the growing corpus of animal tracking data."
https://openalex.org/W2044055986,"Citrus bacterial canker caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri is a serious disease that impacts citrus production worldwide, and X. axonopodis pv. citri is listed as a quarantine pest in certain countries. Biofilm formation is important for the successful development of a pathogenic relationship between various bacteria and their host(s). To understand the mechanisms of biofilm formation by X. axonopodis pv. citri strain XW19, the strain was subjected to transposon mutagenesis. One mutant with a mutation in a two-component response regulator gene that was deficient in biofilm formation on a polystyrene microplate was selected for further study. The protein was designated as BfdR for biofilm formation defective regulator. BfdR from strain XW19 shares 100% amino acid sequence identity with XAC1284 of X. axonopodis pv. citri strain 306 and 30–100% identity with two-component response regulators in various pathogens and environmental microorganisms. The bfdR mutant strain exhibited significantly decreased biofilm formation on the leaf surfaces of Mexican lime compared with the wild type strain. The bfdR mutant was also compromised in its ability to cause canker lesions. The wild-type phenotype was restored by providing pbfdR in trans in the bfdR mutant. Our data indicated that BfdR did not regulate the production of virulence-related extracellular enzymes including amylase, lipase, protease, and lecithinase or the expression of hrpG, rfbC, and katE; however, BfdR controlled the expression of rpfF in XVM2 medium, which mimics cytoplasmic fluids in planta. In conclusion, biofilm formation on leaf surfaces of citrus is important for canker development in X. axonopodis pv. citri XW19. The process is controlled by the two-component response regulator BfdR via regulation of rpfF, which is required for the biosynthesis of a diffusible signal factor."

Transcription of the PLA2g2a gene is induced by multiple cytokines. Here, we report the surprising observation that thyroid hormone (T3) inhibited PLA2g2a gene expression in human and rat hepatocytes as well as in rat liver. Moreover, T3 reduced the cytokine-mediated induction of PLA2g2a, suggesting that the thyroid status may modulate aspects of the inflammatory response. In an effort to dissect the mechanism of repression by T3, we cloned the PLA2g2a gene and identified a negative T3 response element in the promoter.

Gelb M.H. Biochemistry and physiology of mammalian secreted phospholipases A2.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 495-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid serves as a precursor for the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (2Dennis E.A. Cao J. Hsu Y.H. Magrioti V. Kokotos G. Phospholipase A2 enzymes. Physical structure, biological function, disease implication, chemical inhibition, and therapeutic intervention.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6130-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). PLA2s are classified into three main families including the Ca2+-dependent secretory PLA2s, the cytosolic PLA2s, and the Ca2+-independent phospholipases (3Murakami M. Taketomi Y. Girard C.

The phospholipase A2 group IIa (PLA2g2a) isoform belongs to the family of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2). Elevated levels of PLA2g2a are observed in many diseases associated with inflammation including rheumatoid arthritis, pancreatitis, and septic shock. PLA2g2a contributes to the development of atherosclerosis (4Arsenault B.J. Boekholdt S.M. Kastelein J.J. Varespladib. Targeting the inflammatory face of atherosclerosis.Eur.

Hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone (T3) modulates lipid metabolism, plasma lipids, and cardiovascular function (19Yen P.M. Physiological and molecular basis of thyroid hormone action.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). T3 exerts its physiological actions through two T3 receptor isoforms: TRα and TRβ (20Lazar M.A. Thyroid hormone action. A binding contract.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TRs bind primarily as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) but can bind as homodimers to thyroid response elements (TREs) in the promoters of target genes. Consensus positive TREs contain a direct repeat of the AGGTCA-like motif separated by four nucleotides (DR4). The classical view is that the unliganded TRβ binds DNA and recruits corepressors like silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (NCoR), and histone deacetylases. T3 binding leads to recruitment of coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC-1) and the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP/p300) (21Cheng S.Y. Leonard J.L. Davis P.J. Molecular aspects of thyroid hormone actions.Endocr. Rev. 2010; 31: 139-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Although one activity of liganded TR is to stimulate transcription, an important regulatory role of T3 involves gene repression (22Flores-Morales A. Gullberg H. Fernandez L. Ståhlberg N. Lee N.H.

Thyroid hormone regulation of hepatic genes in vivo detected by complementary DNA microarray.Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Examples of genes inhibited by T3 include TSHα, TSHβ, Necdin, and others (24Lin J.Z. Sieglaff D.H. Yuan C. Su J. Arumanayagam A.S. Firouzbakht S. Cantu Pompa J.J. Reynolds F.D. Zhou X. Cvoro A. Webb P. Gene specific actions of thyroid hormone receptor subtypes.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e52407Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, T3 suppresses many genes in liver (25Weitzel J.M. Radtke C. Seitz H.J. Two thyroid hormone-mediated gene expression patterns in vivo identified by cDNA expression arrays in rat.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unlike transcriptional stimulation, the mechanisms by which T3 represses gene expression are not well understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the TR-mediated gene repression (26Weitzel J.M. To bind or not to bind.

However, despite considerable effort, no consensus mechanism has been established. In contrast to positive TREs, the sequence requirements of negative TRES (nTRE) are poorly defined. The nTREs, which were identified in the promoters of genes like TSHα and TSHβ, are near the transcription start site and loosely resemble the TRE half-site (28Li Q.L. Jansen E. Brent G.A.

It remains to be elucidated whether it is the TRE sequence or the promoter environment that is critical for negative T3 actions. There have been very few reports linking T3 with the expression of PLA2. One group found that PLA2g2a expression in astrocytes was reduced by T3 (31Thomas G. Bertrand F. Saunier B. The differential regulation of group II(A) and group V low molecular weight phospholipases A2 in cultured rat astrocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10876-10886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, decreased expression of PLA2g2a was detected on a gene array analyzing hypophysectomized rats treated with T3 (32Boone L.R. Lagor W.R. Moya Mde L. Niesen M.I. Rothblat G.H. Ness G.C. Thyroid hormone enhances the ability of serum to accept cellular cholesterol via the ABCA1 transporter.Atherosclerosis. 2011; 218: 77-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to characterize the regulation of PLA2g2a in liver by T3 and to identify the mechanism by which T3 inhibits PLA2g2a expression. We showed that in rats the thyroid status modulated the expression of PLA2g2a and other sPLA2 isoforms. Hyperthyroid rats had significantly lower levels of PLA2g2a as compared with hypothyroid rats. T3 decreased the basal levels of PLA2g2a and blocked the cytokine-mediated induction of PLA2g2a. Mechanistically, we have identified a negative TRE in the PLA2g2a promoter and found that the coactivator CBP enhanced the unliganded TRβ-mediated induction of PLA2g2a. We demonstrated that the corepressors SMRT and NCoR1 contribute to the T3-mediated inhibition of PLA2g2a. Our studies provide a cellular mechanism by which T3 inhibits PLA2g2a expression. Genomic DNA was isolated from a rat tail using Qiagen genomic DNA isolation kit (51304). The promoter region was obtained from the PCR amplification of the genomic DNA. The forward primers contain SacI restriction sites, whereas the reverse primers contain a BglII restriction sites. The PCR products were cut with appropriate restriction enzymes and were cloned in to PGL4 expression vector. HepG2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (33Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A.

Transfections included 2 μg of PLA2g2a luciferase reporters, 1 μg of SV40-TRβ, and 0.1 μg of TK-Renilla. On the next day, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and T3 was added. The cells were harvested after 24 h, and luciferase assays were conducted using the Promega dual luciferase kit (catalog no. E 1960). Luciferase values were normalized for protein content and Renilla luciferase activity to account for cell density and transfection efficiency, respectively. RNA was isolated with RNA-Stat-60 (Tel-Test). Isolated RNA was further purified with the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (74104) and quantified using a NanoDrop machine (Thermo Scientific). RNA (2.5 μg) was reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:5 in nuclease-free water for real time PCR reactions. The parameters for real time PCR were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 10 s. The final concentration of primers in each well in the PCR plates was 0.1 μm. The target genes were normalized with the 18 S gene. PCR products were quantified using the ΔΔCt method.

HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 0.2 × 106. The following day, serum-free DMEM was added to the cells. After 24 h, cell culture medium was collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1200 rpm to ensure that the cell supernatant was free of cell debris. ELISA was performed with the sPLA2 (human Type IIA) EIA kit from Cayman Chemicals (585000). Rat hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion as described previously (35Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S.

Hepatocytes (3 × 106 in 60-mm dishes) were maintained for 12 h in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Following two washes with PBS, the medium was replaced by RPMI 1640 medium without serum. The cells were treated with 100 nm T3 for 24 h. TNFα was added to the cells at a concentration of 25 ng/ml. For mRNA stability determinations, 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D was used. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed under controlled conditions (22 °C, constant humidity, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) in the animal care facility of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Hypothyroidism was induced by feeding an iodine-free diet containing 0.1% propylthiouracil (PTU) (Teklad 95125) for 5 weeks. The rats were given intraperitoneal injection of T3 (0.33 mg/kg of body weight) (36Cook G.A. Edwards T.L. Jansen M.S. Bahouth S.W. Wilcox H.G. Park E.A.

Free T3 levels in serum were measured at the University of Tennessee Endocrinology Laboratory. T3 levels were 1.1 and 45 pg/ml in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid animals, respectively. The rats were sacrificed after 24 h, and the livers were isolated for RNA and protein. To conduct electrophoretic mobility shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. Recombinant histidine-tagged TRβ and RXRα were prepared in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain as described previously (33Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A.

The protein-DNA binding mixtures contained labeled probe (60,000 cpm) in 80 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and poly(dI-dC). The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then resolved on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in Tris-glycine buffer (22 mm Tris and 190 mm glycine) (33Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. Thyroid hormone regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase Iα gene expression through elements in the promoter and first intron.J. Biol.

The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to alter nucleotides in the nTRE in the −448/+58 PLA2g2a-luciferase vector. The sequences of the forward primers used in the mutagenesis reactions were: −102Mut, ccgtctgtgaatccatgcgcagggcacacccacctcc; −97Mut, ccgtctgtgaatccatgcgcaggccacacccacctcc; −92Mut, cgtctgtgaatccattattttatagcacccacctccccatccctg; −87Mut, gtgaatccattctttggccaagataacctccccatccctgtggc; and −82Mut, cattatttggccacaccctatgtcccatccctgtggctctc. siRNA against human SMRT and NCoR1 and RNA interference-negative control were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HepG2 cells were transfected with the siRNA against SMRT (L-020145-01), NCoR1 (L-003518-00), or nonspecific siRNA (D-001810-10-20) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Knockdown of SMRT and NCoR1 was confirmed by real time PCR and Western blot. After 16 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 250 nm T3 in serum-free medium for 24 h. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested for RNA and proteins. Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell extracts from HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes (37Attia R.R. Sharma P. Janssen R.C. Friedman J.E. Deng X. Lee J.S. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ).J. Biol.

The cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). The cells were kept on ice for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein was quantified by BCA method. An equal amount of protein was loaded on a 3–8% Tris acetate acrylamide gel and transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies NCoR1 (5948; Cell Signaling), SMRT (06-891; Millipore), and actin (A3853; Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using Supersignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). PLA2g2a core promoter fragment −119/+58 and the +1108 to +1256 control region were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the 5′ biotinylated forward primer and the reverse primers. The template DNA was purified with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen; M-280). Streptavidin Dynal beads (Invitrogen) were resuspended in equilibration buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl) and then conjugated with 70 ng of biotinylated template for 30 min at room temperature with constant agitation. The immobilized templates were concentrated with a magnetic particle concentrator, washed once with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and subsequently with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 4 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.08 mm EDTA, 8 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 20). The beads were concentrated by magnetic separator and resuspended in 25 μl of binding buffer along with TRβ, RXRα, poly(dI-dC), and 100 nm T3 for 20 min at room temperature. The Dynal beads were washed four times with binding buffer, resuspended in 3× SDS loading buffer, resolved by 4–12% Bis-Tris gel, and analyzed via immunoblotting using TRβ antibody (sc-738). ChIP assays were conducted according to manufacturer's protocol Millipore Magna ChIP kit (17–610) with minor modifications. Rat hepatocytes were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum for 24 h. The cells were treated with 100 nm T3 overnight in serum-free medium. The next day, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and sonicated as previously described (37Attia R.R. Sharma P. Janssen R.C. Friedman J.E. Deng X. Lee J.S.

The supernatant chromatin was precleared and immunoprecipitated with the control antibody IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz), anti-TRβ (MA1–216; Thermo Scientific), anti-NCoR1 (5948; Cell Signaling), or anti-SMRT (17-10057; Millipore) overnight at 4 °C along with magnetic protein G beads. The beads were washed, and the DNA was eluted. Eluted DNA was purified using the PCR purification kit (28104; Qiagen). DNA was subjected to 32 cycles of PCR using 3–5 μl of DNA. PCR products were analyzed on 2% Nusieve 3:1 agarose (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and visualized with a Multimage light cabinet with Alpha Imager EP software. The following primers were used to amplify the 180/+61 PLA2g2a promoter: PLA2g2a FP, gcccgtctgtgaatccattatttggc; and PLA2g2a RP, caaatgcatccaaagggcaggagt. For the downstream +1639/+1900 control region, the primers were PLA2g2a FP (cacacacatgcatgctgggaactt) and PLA2g2a RP (gcttaggctgcctttgagttctct). Our first experiments characterized the regulation of PLA2g2a gene expression by T3. We treated rat hepatocytes and human HepG2 cells with 100 nm T3 for 24 h and measured the mRNA and protein abundance of PLA2g2a. In hepatocytes, there was a 48% decrease in the PLA2g2a mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). To rule out the possibility of nongenomic effects of T3, we conducted a time course study for PLA2g2a mRNA abundance. No rapid T3 effect was observed, and a significant reduction in PLA2g2a mRNA levels was seen after 12 h (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the actions of T3 on PLA2g2a involved genomic mechanisms. PLA2g2a protein abundance was reduced nearly 70% by T3 (Fig. 1C). We tested whether T3 could decrease the mRNA stability of PLA2g2a by adding actinomycin D. The rate of mRNA decay was identical for actinomycin D and actinomycin with T3, suggesting that T3 does not impact the mRNA stability (Fig. 1D). To examine whether T3 had similar effects in human hepatoma cells, HepG2 cells were treated with T3. Both the levels of mRNA as well as secreted PLA2g2a protein in cell media were decreased 50% (Fig. 1, E and F). We investigated whether T3 could block the cytokine-mediated induction of PLA2g2a. We treated rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells with TNFα and IL-6, respectively. The addition of T3 decreased TNFα induced expression of PLA2g2a mRNA from 7- to 2.5-fold in hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). Similarly, T3 treatment reduced the IL-6-mediated induction of PLA2g2a mRNA from 10- to 5-fold (Fig. 2B) in HepG2 cells. The levels of secreted PLA2g2a protein as measured by ELISA in HepG2 cells were also decreased following T3 treatment from 11- to 4-f"

For the Arg Cα chemical shifts, differences are observed between LHCII in the active, light-harvesting and in the photoprotective, quenched state. These differences are attributed to a conformational change of the Arg residue in the stromal loop region. We conclude that the interlocked helices of LHCII form a rigid core.

Significance: This work reveals consequences for the molecular switching of LHCII. The elementary step in photosynthesis is the capture of solar energy by the light-harvesting antenna. In eukaryotic organisms, this step is performed by a family of pigment-binding proteins called light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) 2The abbreviations used are: LHC, light-harvesting complex; LHCII, light-harvesting complex II; Chl, chlorophyll; Lut, lutein; NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; MAS, magic angle spinning; CP-MAS, cross-polarization-MAS; HetCor, heteronuclear correlation; β-DM, β-dodecylmaltoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DFT, density functional theory. that absorb sunlight and transfer the excitation energy toward the reaction centers, where charge separation takes place (1Ballottari M.

The Lhcb antenna proteins of higher plants and moss and Lhcbm antenna proteins of LHCs in green algae contain three membrane-spanning helices A, B, and C, and their tertiary structure is typified by two crossing A/B helices interconnected by Arg-Glu ion pairs that form ligation sites for Chls. The most abundant LHC in plants and green algae is the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), which captures about 50% of all land-bound chlorophylls. The LHCII complex is trimeric, and each monomer forms a scaffold for eight Chla and six Chlb molecules, two luteins (Lut), one neoxanthin, and one violaxanthin, which is reversibly replaced by zeaxanthin upon de-epoxidation during the xanthophyll cycle (2Liu Z.

In addition to their light-harvesting function, LHCII complexes are involved in several regulatory mechanisms that balance the incoming excitation energies and prevent photodamage (1Ballottari M.

Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2012; 367: 3455-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under high sunlight conditions, the photosynthetic antenna can rapidly switch from light-harvesting into a photoprotective state in which excess light energy is safely dissipated as heat (7Szabó I.

Light and oxygenic photosynthesis: energy dissipation as a protection mechanism against photo-oxidation.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This photoprotective mechanism is called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and protects oxygenic organisms against photooxidative damage. The major component of NPQ, qE, depends on the transmembrane proton gradient ΔpH. In plants, a decrease in lumenal pH triggers protonation of PsbS (8Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R.

Under NPQ conditions, changes in the thickness of the thylakoid membrane have been observed, and it was proposed that LHCII adopts a more condensed structure (35Johnson M.P. Brain A.P.R. Ruban A.V.

In this work, we applied MAS-NMR techniques in combination with selective Arg isotope labeling as a noninvasive method to obtain high-resolution structural information of LHCII in its active and photoprotective states.

Here we analyze LHCII complexes from an Arg-auxotrophic strain of C. reinhardtii that was supplied with 13C6-15N4 Arg. One-dimensional 13C and 15N CP-MAS and two-dimensional 1H-13C dipolar heteronuclear correlation (HetCor) Arg NMR spectra are presented of LHCII in quenched and unquenched states. The Arg residues that stabilize the interlocked helix pair in LHCII are identified because of Chl ring current-induced shifts of their NMR responses. We show that these protein sites are preserved in the photoprotective state, confirming a structural view in which the flexible loop regions of the LHCII polypeptides are complemented by a relatively rigid scaffolding of the protein interior (42Dockter C.

Thylakoids were separated from other materials on a discontinuous gradient (24,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C) in a TST-41.14 swing-out rotor. Thylakoid membranes were washed two times, first with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA and finally with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Thylakoids were resuspended in solubilization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) to a Chl concentration of 1 mg/ml, and equal amounts of β-dodecylmaltoside (β-DM) were added to get a final concentration of 0.6% β-DM. The suspension was vortexed a few seconds and centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove unsolubilized material, and the supernatant was loaded on a sucrose density gradient, prepared by 0.65 m sucrose, 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.03% β-DM and ultracentrifuged for 17 h at 37,000 rpm. The top band of the sucrose gradient contained LHCII trimer complexes with more than 90% purity, verified by FPLC. For obtaining LHCII in its quenched state, isolated LHCII trimers in 0.03% β-DM were dialyzed for 72 h against detergent-free buffer. The quenched state of the detergent-depleted LHCII aggregates was verified by low temperature fluorescence spectroscopy, whereas the unquenched, light-harvesting state of the LHCII trimers in β-DM was verified by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Steady-state fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were measured with a commercial spectrophotometer (HORIBA Scientific, FluoroLog). For 77 K fluorescence emission measurements, the samples were diluted in 40% HEPES/β-DM buffer and 60% glycerol (v/v) and cooled in a nitrogen-bath cryostat to 77 K. Time-resolved fluorescence emission measurements were performed at room temperature with a Streak camera setup. The sample was measured front-face using a 1-mm quartz cuvette. To minimize the effects of photodamage, about 10 spectra of maximum 1 min per scan were acquired. It was verified that within this time period of illumination, no degradation of sample occurred. Excitation pulses of 400 nm (∼100 fs) with vertical polarization were generated using a titanium:sapphire laser (Coherent Vitesse) with a regenerative amplifier (Coherent, MIRA seed, and RegA) that was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (Coherent, OPA). The repetition rate was 50 kHz with pulse energies of ∼0.2 nJ. A 10-fold increase or 2-fold decrease of the excitation pulse energy did not affect the fluorescence lifetimes, confirming that experiments were performed in the annihilation-free regime. The obtained streak data were analyzed with Glotaran3 (47Snellenburg J.J. Laptenok S.P. Seger R. Mullen K.M. van Stokkum I.H.M.

One-dimensional 13C and 15N and two-dimensional 1H-13C frequency-switched Lee-Goldburg heteronuclear correlation experiments were performed with a Bruker AV-750 spectrometer equipped with a 4-mm triple resonance MAS probe head, using a 13C radio frequency of 188.6 MHz. The temperature was lowered to 220–240 K under slow spinning of the sample. For the NMR experiments, spinning frequencies of 13 kHz were used. The chemical shift scale was calibrated from an FSLG spectrum of solid tyrosine HCl salt.

https://openalex.org/W2015548446,"The role of cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system in development and maintenance of individual organs and tissues remains poorly understood. Here we identify a regulatory region sufficient for accurate in vivo expression of synaptophysin (SYP), a common marker of neuroendocrine differentiation, and report generation of Tg(Syp-EGFPloxP-DTA)147Ayn (SypELDTA) mice suitable for flexible organ-specific ablation of neuroendocrine cells. These mice express EGFP and diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) in SYP positive cells before and after Cre-loxP mediated recombination, respectively. As a proof of principle, we have crossed SypELDTA mice with EIIA-Cre and PB-Cre4 mice. EIIA-Cre mice express Cre recombinase in a broad range of tissues, while PB-Cre4 mice specifically express Cre recombinase in the prostate epithelium. Double transgenic EIIA-Cre; SypELDTA embryos exhibited massive cell death in SYP positive cells. At the same time, PB-Cre4; SypELDTA mice showed a substantial decrease in the number of neuroendocrine cells and associated prostate hypotrophy. As no increase in cell death and/or Cre-loxP mediated recombination was observed in non-neuroendocrine epithelium cells, these results suggest that neuroendocrine cells play an important role in prostate development. High cell type specificity of Syp locus-based cassette and versatility of generated mouse model should assure applicability of these resources to studies of neuroendocrine cell functions in various tissues and organs."
https://openalex.org/W2076012423,"Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a growth factor with both pro-angiogenic and limited pro-tumorigenic activity. We evaluated the potential for PTN to be used for safe angiogenic gene therapy using the full length gene and a truncated gene variant lacking the domain implicated in tumorigenesis. Mouse myoblasts were transduced to express full length or truncated PTN (PTN or T-PTN), along with a LacZ reporter gene, and injected into mouse limb muscle and myocardium. In cultured myoblasts, PTN was expressed and secreted via the Golgi apparatus, but T-PTN was not properly secreted. Nonetheless, no evidence of uncontrolled growth was observed in cells expressing either form of PTN. PTN gene delivery to myocardium, and non-ischemic skeletal muscle, did not result in a detectable change in vascularity or function. In ischemic hindlimb at 14 days post-implantation, intramuscular injection with PTN-expressing myoblasts led to a significant increase in skin perfusion and muscle arteriole density. We conclude that (1) delivery of the full length PTN gene to muscle can be accomplished without tumorigenesis, (2) the truncated PTN gene may be difficult to use in a gene therapy context due to inefficient secretion, (3) PTN gene delivery leads to functional benefit in the mouse acute ischemic hindlimb model."
https://openalex.org/W3189144901,"Graph representations of brain connectivity have attracted a lot of recent interest, but existing methods for dividing such graphs into connected subnetworks have a number of limitations in the context of neuroimaging. This is an important problem because most cognitive functions would be expected to involve some but not all brain regions. In this paper we outline a simple approach for decomposing graphs, which may be based on any measure of interregional association, into coherent ""principal networks"". The technique is based on an eigendecomposition of the association matrix, and is closely related to principal components analysis. We demonstrate the technique using cortical thickness and diffusion tractography data, showing that the subnetworks which emerge are stable, meaningful and reproducible. Graph-theoretic measures of network cost and efficiency may be calculated separately for each principal network. Unlike some other approaches, all available connectivity information is taken into account, and vertices may appear in none or several of the subnetworks. Subject-by-subject ""scores"" for each principal network may also be obtained, under certain circumstances, and related to demographic or cognitive variables of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2126638395,"Specific binding between proteins plays a crucial role in molecular functions and biological processes. Protein binding interfaces and their atomic contacts are typically defined by simple criteria, such as distance-based definitions that only use some threshold of spatial distance in previous studies. These definitions neglect the nearby atomic organization of contact atoms, and thus detect predominant contacts which are interrupted by other atoms. It is questionable whether such kinds of interrupted contacts are as important as other contacts in protein binding. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new definition called beta (β) atomic contacts. Our definition, founded on the β-skeletons in computational geometry, requires that there is no other atom in the contact spheres defined by two contact atoms; this sphere is similar to the van der Waals spheres of atoms. The statistical analysis on a large dataset shows that β contacts are only a small fraction of conventional distance-based contacts. To empirically quantify the importance of β contacts, we design βACV, an SVM classifier with β contacts as input, to classify homodimers from crystal packing. We found that our βACV is able to achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance superior to SVM classifiers with distance-based contacts as input. Our βACV also outperforms several existing methods when being evaluated on several datasets in previous works. The promising empirical performance suggests that β contacts can truly identify critical specific contacts in protein binding interfaces. β contacts thus provide a new model for more precise description of atomic organization in protein quaternary structures than distance-based contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2067238672,"Significant insight into the signaling pathways leading to activation of the Rel transcription factor family, collectively termed NF-κB, has been gained. Less well understood is how subsets of NF-κB-dependent genes are regulated in a signal specific manner. The SIMPL protein (signaling molecule that interacts with mouse pelle-like kinase) is required for full Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα) induced NF-κB activity. We show that SIMPL is required for steady-state hematopoiesis and the expression of a subset of TNFα induced genes whose products regulate hematopoietic cell activity. To gain insight into the mechanism through which SIMPL modulates gene expression we focused on the Tnf gene, an immune response regulator required for steady-state hematopoiesis. In response to TNFα SIMPL localizes to the Tnf gene promoter where it modulates the initiation of Tnf gene transcription. SIMPL binding partners identified by mass spectrometry include proteins involved in transcription and the interaction between SIMPL and MED1 was characterized in more detail. In response to TNFα, SIMPL is found in p65-MED1 complexes where SIMPL enhances p65/MED1/SIMPL complex formation. Together our results indicate that SIMPL functions as a TNFα-dependent p65 co-activator by facilitating the recruitment of MED1 to p65 containing transcriptional complexes to control the expression of a subset of TNFα-induced genes."
