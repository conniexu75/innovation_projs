https://openalex.org/W2169799551,"Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone, which has been shown to play important roles in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Eight mutations in human adiponectin have been reported, some of which were significantly related to diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia, but the molecular mechanisms of decreased plasma levels and impaired action of adiponectin mutants were not clarified. Adiponectin structurally belongs to the complement 1q family and is known to form a characteristic homomultimer. Herein, we demonstrated that simple SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions clearly separates multimer species of adiponectin. Adiponectin in human or mouse serum and adiponectin expressed in NIH-3T3 or Escherichia coli formed a wide range of multimers from trimers to high molecular weight (HMW) multimers. A disulfide bond through an amino-terminal cysteine was required for the formation of multimers larger than a trimer. An amino-terminal Cys-Ser mutation, which could not form multimers larger than a trimer, abrogated the effect of adiponectin on the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway in hepatocytes. Among human adiponectin mutations, G84R and G90S mutants, which are associated with diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia, did not form HMW multimers. R112C and I164T mutants, which are associated with hypoadiponectinemia, did not assemble into trimers, resulting in impaired secretion from the cell. These data suggested impaired multimerization and/or the consequent impaired secretion to be among the causes of a diabetic phenotype or hypoadiponectinemia in subjects having these mutations. In conclusion, not only total concentrations, but also multimer distribution should always be considered in the interpretation of plasma adiponectin levels in health as well as various disease states.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia have yet to be clarified. Adiponectin structurally belongs to the complement 1q family and consists of a carboxyl-terminal globular domain and an amino-terminal collagenous domain (17Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr.

Gel filtration and velocity gradient studies revealed adiponectin circulating in serum to form several different molecular weight species; the largest species was more than several hundred kilodaltons in size (1Scherer P.E.

In this study, we demonstrated that simple SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions clearly separates multimer species of adiponectin. Applying this method, we investigated the molecular structure and mode of multimerization of adiponectin from human or mouse serum and cultured cells. Since we speculated that adiponectin mutations might alter multimer formations of adiponectin, we analyzed these mutants with SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions. We demonstrated impaired multimerization and secretion in these mutants to possibly contribute to the development of diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia. Adiponectin has been shown to be one of the major regulators of energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. This study sheds new light on the molecular structure-function relationship.

U37222) flanked by a Kozak sequence was cloned from mouse white adipose tissue and inserted between EcoRI and NotI in the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1(+). Human adiponectin (NCBI accession no. D45371) was also cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) in the same manner. For mammalian expression, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the purification of recombinant adiponectin from NIN-3T3 fibroblast medium, we prepared an expression vector in which the FLAG tag sequence, 5′-GATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAG-3′ (DYKDDDDK in amino acids) was inserted into the carboxyl terminus of adiponectin. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with the FLAG-tagged adiponectin expression vector and recombinant protein was allowed to secrete into the medium for 48 h. Collected medium was applied to an anti-FLAG affinity column. The column was washed with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH7.5, TBS) and bound recombinant adiponectin was eluted with FLAG peptide. Adiponectin-rich fractions were collected and dialyzed against TBS. For prokaryotic expression, the coding sequence deprived of the signal sequence (corresponding to residues 18-247) of mouse adiponectin was inserted between BamHI and HindIII of the PQE30 expression vector, which expressed the His6 tag attached to the amino terminus of adiponectin. For the globular domain, the sequence corresponding the residues 104-247 was inserted. Expression and purification of His-tagged adiponectin from the Escherichia coli lysate was performed as described in Ref. 6Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat.

Briefly, the soluble fraction of the E. coli lysate was applied to Ni-NTA agarose, washed thoroughly and bound adiponectin was eluted stepwise with imidazole. Fractions containing adiponectin was collected and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Adiponectin—Mouse C39S mutant adiponectin was generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sense primer was 5′-CACCCAAGGGAACTAGTGCAGGTTGGATGG-3′ and the antisense primer was complementary to it. For human adiponectin mutagenesis, the sense primers were 5′-CATCGGTGAAACCAGAGTACCCGGGGC-3′ for G84R, 5′-CGGGGCTGAAAGTCCCCGAGGCTTTC-3′ for G90S, 5′-GCTGAAGGTCCCTGAGGCTTTCCG GG-3′ for R92X, 5′-GGTGCCTATGTACACCGCTCAGCATTCAGT G-3′ for Y111H, 5′-GGTGCCTATGTATACTGCTCAGCATTCAGTGTGG-3′ for R112C, 5′-CCTGG GCTGTACGACTTTGCCTACCACATC-3′ for Y159D, 5′-CTACTTTGCCTACCACACCACAGTCTATATGAAGG-3′ for I164T, 5′-GTATGGGGAAGGAGAGAGTAATGGACTCTATGCTG-3′ for R221S, and 5′-GGCTTTCTTCTCTACCCTGACACCAACTGATCAC-3′ for H241P. The antisense primers were complementary to these sense primers. The coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 19-71 (from the variable region to the middle of the collagenous region) was deleted for the expression of amino-terminally truncated human adiponectin (ΔH). The sense primer was 5′-GGTCTTATTGGTCCTAAGGGAGACATCGGTG-3′ with 5′-phosphorylation, and the antisense primer was 5′-CTGGTCATGCCCGGGCAGAGCTAATAGCAG-3′ with 5′-phosphorylation. The deleted construct was amplified from human adiponectin pcDNA3.1 by pfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene), and the gained blunted DNA fragment was self-ligated to form a circular plasmid. Generation of Anti-adiponectin Antibodies—Anti-mouse adiponectin globular domain antiserum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with mouse recombinant adiponectin globular domain produced in E. coli. Anti-mouse amino-terminal peptide antibody, and anti-human carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody were raised against the synthesized mouse amino-terminal peptide EDDVTTTEELAPALV and the human carboxyl-terminal peptide CYADNDSTFTGFLLYHDTN. Anti-human carboxyl-terminal peptide antibody showed good cross-reactivity against mouse adiponectin (data not shown). Preparation of Adiponectin Globular Domain by Trypsin Digestion of Full-length Adiponectin—Full-length adiponectin expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and secreted in DMEM without serum was cleaved by trypsin V-S according to Ref. 24Fruebis J.

SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to the standard Laemmli's method (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Sample buffer for reducing conditions was 3% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. For complete reduction of serum sample, 10 mm dithiothreitol was also added to the buffer. For non-reducing conditions, 2-mercaptoethanol was excluded from the sample buffer described above. The sample was mixed with 5× sample buffer and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. For heat-denaturation, samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min unless indicated. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBS-T (TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 3% skim milk and then incubated with 1:1000 diluted antiserum in TBS-T containing 3% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed thoroughly. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Fuji film) using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration Chromatography Analysis of Adiponectin—Samples were filtered through 0.44-μm pore membranes and 200 μl were injected into a Superdex S300HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with PBS using the FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Samples were eluted with PBS at a rate of 0.5 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. Analysis of Adiponectin from Human or Mouse Serum and Medium of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Freshly drawn human or mouse blood was coagulated for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, 0.7 μl of the supernatant was diluted into non-reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into mature adipocytes for 10 days and washed twice in DMEM without serum. Adiponectin was allowed to secrete into DMEM without serum for 48 h and 10-μl aliquots were diluted into non-reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions. For an analysis of serum of human subjects heterozygous for G90S mutation, subjects are identified through screening of 1373 French Caucasians (16Vasseur F. Helbecque N. Dina C. Lobbens S.

Subjects ranging from 40 to 69 of age were selected and examined. Average age ± S.E. of these groups were 56.4 ± 7.9 (wild-type female), 54.7 ± 1.7 (G90S female), 59.4 ± 4.2 (wild-type male), 52.3 ± 2.9 (G90S male).

Briefly, after cells had been incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) for 6 h, RPMI 1640 containing E. coli recombinant adiponectin was added to the well and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with liquid nitrogen and cells were lysed and homogenized by a sonicator in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was centrifuged and the protein concentration was assayed using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The same amount of lysate protein was applied to SDS-PAGE under reducing and heat-denaturing conditions, blotted onto PVDF membranes and immunostained with anti-phosphorylated AMPK antibodies or anti-phosphorylated ACC antibodies. NIH-Image was used for band quantification. SDS-PAGE under Non-reducing and Non-heat-denaturing Conditions Separates Multimer Species of Adiponectin—Adiponectin was reported to form several different molecular weight multimers by gel filtration and velocity gradient studies (1Scherer P.E.

When human and mouse adiponectin from serum or adipocytes, and recombinant adiponectin expressed in mammalian cells, were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing conditions, three different molecular mass species (∼67, 136, and >300 kDa) of adiponectin were detected in all preparations (Fig. 1A). We designated these species as LMW (low molecular weight), MMW (middle molecular weight), and HMW (high molecular weight) multimers, respectively. In order to demonstrate these three species seen in Fig. 1A represent different multimer species, we subjected adiponectin to gel filtration analysis in parallel. Purified mouse adiponectin expressed in NIH-3T3 resolved into three peaks in gel filtration as reported before (Fig. 1B) (21Tsao T-S. Murrey H.E. Hug C. Lee D.H. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of each fraction revealed that these three peaks represented HMW, MMW, and LMW multimers (Fig. 1C). Adiponectin in human serum and adiponectin expressed in E. coli also had three peaks, which corresponded to HMW, MMW and LMW multimers (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1, E and F are examples showing adiponectin multimer distribution in serum of representative female and male human subjects. Both non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1E) and gel filtration analysis (Fig. 1F) clearly demonstrated that the levels of HMW multimers were high in a female subject and low in a male subject. These data suggested that non-reducing and non-heat-denaturing SDS-PAGE was able to represent different adiponectin multimers as accurately as the conventional gel filtration analysis. Our SDS-PAGE analysis was superior to the gel filtration analysis in terms of resolving power. SDS-PAGE was able to clearly separate each of multimer species (Fig. 1E), whereas gel filtration did not completely separate each multimers (Fig. 1F). We also noted that there were several HMW species, whereas murine adiponectin had only one (Fig. 1A). These species were not recognized by conventional gel filtration analysis (Fig. 1F). Total adiponectin concentrations are known to be higher in females than in males (5Arita Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Miyagawa J. Hotta K. Shimomura I. Nakamura T. Miyaoka K. Kuriyama H. Nishida M. Yamashita S. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar). HMW multimers, but not MMW and LMW multimers, were significantly less abundant in male subjects than in female subjects (Fig. 1, E and F and Table I). This suggested that not only total adiponectin concentration but also multimer distribution are different in two genders.Table IGender difference in the multimer formation of adiponectinFemaleMaleHMW100 ± 1929.0 ± 14ap < 0.05 (Student's t-test) values of the same multimer species were compared between genders.MMW100 ± 6.981.5 ± 5.2LMW100 ± 1284.0 ± 6.6a p < 0.05 (Student's t-test) values of the same multimer species were compared between genders. Open table in a new tab Influence of Reduction and Heat Denaturation on Adiponectin Multimer Formation—When adiponectin expressed in NIH-3T3 or serum adiponectin were electrophoresed after reduction and heat denaturation, all molecular mass species were converted to a single 28-kDa band, indicating all of these species to be composed of identical monomers, namely, homomultimers (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 4). 56- and 28-kDa bands were seen, when the sample was heat-denatured under non-reducing conditions, suggesting the 56-kDa band to be a dimer (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2). On the other hand, reduction without heat denaturation converted all of the molecular mass species to a 67-kDa band, which was the smallest molecular weight component of adiponectin, that is, a LMW multimer (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3). This 67-kDa band was deduced to represent a trimer because the collagen-like structure and the globular domain of adiponectin are known to form a trimer (17Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prove the 67-kDa band to be a trimer, we co-expressed amino-terminally truncated adiponectin (ΔH) and full-length wild-type adiponectin (WT). Two heterogeneous bands were observed when samples were separated by reducing and non-heat-denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, lane 4). These data suggested that the 67-kDa band (Fig. 3A, lane 2, Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3) was a trimer, and the two heterogeneous bands (Fig. 3A, lane 4) were heterotrimers (i.e. WT x2/ΔH x1, WT x1/ΔH x2).

The Paf1 protein complex, which associates with RNA polymerase II, is known to be required for these histone H3 methylation events. During the early elongation stage of transcription, the Paf1 complex is required for association of COMPASS with RNA polymerase II, but the role the Paf1 complex plays at the promoter has not been clear.

We also show that Paf1 complex is required for the interaction of Rad6 and COMPASS with RNA polymerase II. Finally, we show that the Paf1 complex is required for Rad6-Bre1 catalytic activity but not for the recruitment of Rad6-Bre1 to promoters.

The DNA of eukaryotic organisms assembles around histone proteins in nucleosomes to form highly organized structures known as chromatin (1Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Alterations in chromatin structure play a major role in regulating gene expression, and for this reason much attention has been focused recently on the covalent modifications of histone proteins and their outcomes in transcriptional elongation (1Berger S.L.

Essential to this process are the N-terminal tails of histone proteins. Because they protrude from the globular body of the nucleosome and are available for interactions with other proteins, the tails are the site of many covalent modifications that alter nucleosome structure. A myriad of modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, decorate each histone tail (2Gerber M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol.

It has been demonstrated that some of the components of the Paf1 complex, a complex that associates with the initiating and elongating RNA polymerase II, is also required for histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (17Krogan N.J.

A further requirement for the methylation of both lysines 4 and 79 of histone H3 is the prior modification of another histone protein; monoubiquitination of histone H2B, catalyzed by the Rad6-Bre1 protein-ubiquitin ligase (23Robzyk K.

Although the Paf1 complex also plays a role in histone H3 Lys-36 methylation by Set2, this modification does not require monoubiquitination of histone H2B. Because the Paf1 complex is associated with RNA polymerase II at the promoter, we wished to determine whether it is also required for the monoubiquitination of histone H2B. Here we present evidence that components of the Paf1 complex are required for monoubiquitination of histone H2B. Strains in which several components of the Paf1 complex are deleted are defective in monoubiquitination of histone H2B at promoter regions, and this in turn results in the loss of methylation on histone H3 on lysines 4 and 79 within the body of active genes. Previously we demonstrated that the Paf1 complex is required for the interaction between RNA polymerase II and COMPASS, and that loss of the Paf1 subunit Ctr9 dissolved this interaction (17Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). We have recently found that Rad6 associates with RNA Pol II and COMPASS, and the Paf1 complex mediates this interaction as well. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicate that the Paf1 complex is not required for the recruitment of Rad6-Bre1 to the promoter. Together, our studies indicate a role for the Paf1 complex at the promoter in regulating the functional activity of the Rad6-Bre1 complex in monoubiquitination of histone H2B, which is distinct from the role of the Paf1 complex in histone methylation during the process of transcription elongation. Preparation of Histone Extracts—Histone extraction was performed as described in (31Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) with several changes. 50 ml of YPD (yeast/peptone/dextrose) were inoculated and allowed to grow at 30 °Ctoan A 600 of ∼1. The cultures were then transferred to 50-ml conical tubes and the cells pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm. Cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of sterile water and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes (cell pellet size ∼150–200 μl). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm, resuspended in 500 μl of NIB (0.25 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 14 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8% Triton X-100), and then pelleted again. After removal of the supernatant by pipetting, cells were resuspended in another 500 μl of NIB, and ∼150 μl of 0.5-mm glass beads were added to one-third of the total volume of the suspension. The tubes were then closed, and lids were wrapped in parafilm to prevent leakage during lysis. The tubes were then vortexed vigorously for 15 min at 4 °C, and lysates were recovered into 15-ml conical tubes by puncturing the bottom of the 1.5-ml tube with a small-gauge needle, inserting the punctured tube into the top of the 15-ml tube, and briefly centrifuging the contents at 2000 rpm. The supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets were washed with 1 ml of chilled NIB followed by centrifugation to pellet the nuclei. After the supernatant was discarded, the nuclei were suspended in 200 μl of 0.4 n H2SO4 and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing. Cellular debris were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, acetone was added at a 1:5 ratio (1 ml in this case), and the tubes were kept on ice for 45 min. Free histones were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the supernatants were drained, and the pellets were resuspended in 75 μl of sterile water and 25 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. Extracts were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved using 16% SDS-PAGE. ChIP Experiments—Overnight culture of cells were treated with formaldehyde to achieve cross-linking as described previously (26Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Golshani A. Zhang Y. Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). After the cross-linked cells were lysed, the chromatin was isolated and sheared by sonication. The sheared chromatin solution was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using IgG-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were eluted and de-cross-linked, and then the free DNA was precipitated and used for PCR with primer pairs directed against different regions of the PMA1 gene. Each reaction contains a control primer set directed against a region of yeast chromosome 5 with no open reading frames. The -fold enrichment was determined by comparing the ratio of the immunoprecipitated PCR product to input DNA PCR product using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Bre1 Is Required for Recruitment of Rad6 to the Promoter— Rad6 is required for monoubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 123 (23Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and is recruited to promoters via Bre1, one of its E3 ubiquitin ligases (26Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Golshani A. Zhang Y. Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Bre1 interacts with Rad6 through its C-terminal C3HC4 ring finger domain, and thus perturbation of this domain by the addition of the TAP-tag to the C terminus of Bre1 abolishes the interaction of Rad6 with Bre1. However, this TAP-tagged Bre1 is still capable of being targeted to the promoter, suggesting that (a) Bre1 is the protein that targets Rad6 to promoters and (b) the C-terminal domain of Bre1 is dispensable for its localization to promoters (Fig. 1). Paf1 Complex Affects Both Histone H3 Methylation and H2B Ubiquitination—Both the components of the Paf1 complex and the ubiquitination activity of the Rad6-Bre1 complex are required for methylation of histone H3 on both lysines 4 and 79 (Fig. 2A) (24Dover J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34655-34657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Paf1 complex is also required for histone H2B ubiquitination via Rad6-Bre1, we tested whether H2B is ubiquitinated in the absence of either of the Paf1 complex subunits Rtf1 or Paf1. Interestingly, deletion of either RTF1 or PAF1 resulted in the loss of histone H2B ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). Ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation of histone H3 were complemented by introducing a plasmid containing either wild-type RTF1 or PAF1 into the mutant cells lacking Rtf1 or Paf1 (Fig. 2C). Interaction among Rad6, COMPASS, and RNA Polymerase II Requires Paf1 Complex—COMPASS interacts with RNA polymerase II during the early stages of transcriptional elongation (17Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 18Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To determine whether there are interactions between COMPASS, RNA polymerase II, and Rad6, COMPASS was purified via one of its tagged subunits, the Ash2 homologue CPS60/Bre2. RNA polymerase II co-purifies with COMPASS, as does Rad6 (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that a functional as well as physical interaction exists between the ubiquitination and methylation machinery at the promoter region of active genes. However, in strains missing the gene encoding the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex, Rad6 no longer associates with COMPASS and RNA polymerase II (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9), but the interaction between COMPASS and Pol II remains stable (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 8 and 9). From this it seems likely that the deletion of Rtf1 does not affect the stability of the Paf1 complex but may instead be a part of the site where Rad6 interacts. Previously, we demonstrated that the Ctr9 subunit (one of the largest subunit) of the Paf1 complex is required for the interaction of COMPASS and RNA polymerase II (17Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, removal of the Rtf1 component of the Paf1 complex has no effect on the interaction between RNA polymerase II and COMPASS (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 8 and 9), indicating that COMPASS may physically interact with Ctr9 subunit of the Paf1 complex or that Ctr9 is essential for the stability of the Paf1 complex and therefore its interaction with RNA polymerase II. We have also demonstrated that the interaction between RNA polymerase II and COMPASS with Rad6 is dependent on the presence of the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 6–9). Paf1 Complex Is Not Necessary for Rad6 Recruitment to the Promoter—A simple model that could account for these observations is that the Paf1 complex is responsible for the localization of the Rad6-Bre1 complex to the promoter, possibly by acting as a recruitment platform for the ubiquitination machinery to bind. To determine whether the Paf1 complex is indeed required for Rad6-Bre1 recruitment to promoters, ChIP experiments using TAP-tagged Rad6 were performed in a mutant missing the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex. As previously shown, Bre1 is required for the recruitment of Rad6 to promoter (Fig. 4B). However, Rad6 localization at the promoter is not affected in the absence of the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex (Fig. 4B). Thus, the mechanism by which the Paf1 complex affects monoubiquitination of histone H2B and the association of Rad6 with COMPASS and Pol II does not affect recruitment of the Rad6-Bre1 complex to the promoter region. Our results suggest that the Paf1 complex promotes ubiquitination of histone H2B by affecting the activity of the Rad6-Bre1 complex and regulating its interaction with initiating RNA polymerase II. This suggests a cooperative cross-talk mechanism between the ubiquitination and methylation machinery at the promoter regions of active genes. Following formation of the preinitiation complex, the Paf1 complex is recruited to the promoters and is required for the functional activation and ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Rad6-Bre1 complex (Fig. 5). The Paf1 complex is also involved in the subsequent association of RNA polymerase II with COMPASS (Fig. 5C). The methylation of lysines 4 and 36 of histone H3 by Set1 and Set2 has recently been linked to transcriptional elongation, and the Paf1 complex also seems to play a role in this process (17Krogan N.J.

https://openalex.org/W1982391915,"The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription is now well established. Hypoxia reduces activity of prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) that hydroxylate specific proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). As a consequence, HIF-1α accumulates and promotes hypoxic tolerance by activating gene transcription. This paper identifies the three forms of PHDs in rats and shows that a period of hypoxia selectively increases expression of PHD-2 mRNAs levels. We developed assays for PHD activity that used (i) the peptide-specific conversion of labeled 2-oxoglutarate into succinate and (ii) the binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein to a glutathione S-transferase-ODD fusion protein. The two assays indicated a low enzymatic activity in normoxic and hypoxic cells and a rapid increase during reoxygenation. We also developed hydroxyproline-specific antibodies that recognized hydroxylated forms of a fusion protein (ODD-green fluorescent protein) that combined the ODD domain of HIF-1α and the green fluorescent protein. Using this antibody, we demonstrated that reoxygenation induced a rapid hydroxylation of Pro-564, which was followed by a massive degradation of the proteins. The results suggest that a hypoxic upregulation of PHD (presumably PHD-2) acts as a feedback mechanism to stop hypoxic responses in reoxygenated cells. We propose that proline hydroxylation might play a role in hypoxic preconditioning. The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription is now well established.

We propose that proline hydroxylation might play a role in hypoxic preconditioning. Cells respond to reduced oxygen tensions by up-regulating the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor), erythropoiesis (e.g. erythropoietin), and glycolysis. The transcriptional activation of target genes is induced by a common transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; vHL, von Hippel-Lindau protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; vHL, von Hippel-Lindau protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. HIF-1 was first identified as a heterodimeric transactivator that recognizes a specific DNA sequence termed hypoxia-responsive element in the 3′-untranslated region of the erythropoietin gene (1Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator, both of which belong to the large family of basic helix-loop-helix-perarnt-sim transcription factors (2Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α has recently been identified. Under normoxic conditions, specific HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) hydroxylate two proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564) in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1α (3Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar, 4Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.-M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. von Kriegsheim A. Heberstreit H.F. Mikherji M. Scofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar). The von Hippel-Lindau protein (vHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex associates to hydroxylated proline residues and targets HIF-1α to proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, oxygen becomes rate-limiting for proline hydroxylation. As a consequence, HIF-1α accumulates, migrates to the nucleus, and associates with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator and the complex interacts with hypoxia-responsive element of target genes (5Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar, 6Kallio P.J. Wilson W.J. O'Brien S. Makino Y. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).Less attention has been given to the situation in which hypoxic cells are reoxygenated. Tissue reoxygenation is not an unusual condition. It is frequently observed in pathological situations. For instance, newly formed blood vessels in tumors tend to be highly irregular and malformed. As a consequence, tumor cells often face transient changes in oxygen tension because of the irregular opening and closing of malformed vessels. Reoxygenation of cardiac or brain tissues after a period of ischemia has been extensively documented. Reperfusion has both deleterious and beneficial aspects. Reoxygenation is a major cause of cell damage via the production of reactive oxygen species. A short period of hypoxia followed by tissue reoxygenation is well known to protect the heart and the brain against further hypoxia. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for hypoxic preconditioning. First, opening of K ATP channels reduces cellular excitability and saves energy stores (7O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Second, adenosine is released and exerts its protective effect via A1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C (8Baxter G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hypoxic preconditioning is a major therapeutic and pharmacological target. Therefore, we examined the regulation of HIF-1α during reoxygenation. For this purpose, we developed different biochemical assays for PHDs and antibodies directed against hydroxylated prolines to analyze protein prolyl hydroxylation during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Our results document a dramatic increase of PHD activity in freshly reoxygenated cells that probably serves to stop hypoxic signaling. They also provide direct evidence that hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain of HIF-1α controls the degradation of ODD-containing proteins during reoxygenation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega. Culture medium and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. [5-14C]2-OG and l-[35S]methionine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [α-32P]dCTP was from ICN.Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Rat C6 glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Stable ODD-GFP transfectants were prepared as follows. A 222-bp DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 530–603 (nucleotides 1616–1837) of human HIF-1α (pcDNA3-HIF-1α vector kindly provided by Dr. P. J. Ratcliffe) was PCR-amplified using the sense primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCACCATGGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGGTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGACTGGAATACTGTAAC-5′. The product was digested by XhoI and XbaI and fused in-frame with the enhanced GFP of a XhoI/XbaI-digested pCI-eGFP2 plasmid. The product was digested by BglII and NotI and inserted into the BglII/NotI-digested pCDNA 3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). C6 cells were transfected using a mixture of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μg of LipofectAMINE for 5 h at 37 °C. Stable transfectants were selected using 1.5 mg/ml G418 and cloned by limited dilution. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified incubator. Hypoxic incubations (16 h at 2% O2) were performed in a sealed “Bug-Box” anaerobic workstation (Ruskin Technologies).Reverse Transcription-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from normoxic and hypoxic C6 cells was isolated by the acid/phenol method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). The following forward and reverse sets of primers were used. For PHD-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_053208) (forward 5′-CACCATGGACAGCCCGTGCCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTAGGTGTAGTTGGCTGTGATACTGGTACTTG-3′), for PHD-2 (GenBank™ accession number XM_134453) (forward 5′-ACCATGAACAAGCACGGCATCTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GACGTCTTTGCTGACTGAATTGGGCTT-3′), and for PHD-3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_019371), forward 5′-GCTTCTGCTACCTGGACAACTT-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGCATCAAAATACCAGACAGT-3′ PCR amplifications were carried out using 10 mm dNTP and 3 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). For PHD-1 and PHD-2, the PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). PHD-1, PHD-2, and PHD-3 products were sequenced using the dideoxy terminator method.For Northern blot analysis, samples of total RNA (10 μg) were fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel, capillary-blotted to charged nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe GT membrane, Bio-Rad) in 20× SSC buffer, and covalently linked by ultraviolet irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 0.25 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml α-32P-labeled PCR-purified fragments for rat PHD-1, PHD-2, and PHD-3 probes (specific activity >109 cpm/μg DNA). Membranes were washed twice in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5% SDS and once in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C (each wash). Hybridization signals were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. α-32P-Labeled PCR-purified fragments and 18 S cDNA probe were prepared by using the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega).Antibodies—Pro-564 (LDLEALAPYIPADDDFQLRS)- and Hyp564 (LDLEALAHypYIPADDDFQLRS)-peptides were from Genaxis (Nimes, France). They corresponded to the 557–576 sequence of human HIF-1α. Methionines were converted to alanines to avoid spurious oxidation events. Rabbit anti-Hyp564 antibodies were obtained from Genaxis and characterized using a radioimmunoassay. The Hyp564 peptide was iodinated using chloramine T and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The radioimmunoassay buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 0.1 g/liter sodium azide, and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) supplemented with 20,000 cpm/ml iodinated peptide. After 16 h of incubation at 4 °C, antibody-peptide complexes were precipitated with polyethylene glycol. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the following sources: HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), GFP (Roche Applied Science), α-tubulin (Sigma), and vHL (BD Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After 20 min at 4 °C with continuous rocking, extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay. Protein extracts were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using standard procedures. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) instant nonfat milk powder in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α (1:1,000), Hyp564 (1:2,000), vHL (1:500), GFP (1:1,000), or α-tubulin (1:5,000). Blots were washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibodies or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After extensive washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, chemiluminescence detection was performed by incubating the membranes with 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 2.65 mm H2O2, 0.45 mm luminol, and 0.625 mm coumaric acid for 1 min followed by exposure to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.).HIF Peptide Hydroxylation Assay—Cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei. Cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the reaction buffer (0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 1 mm ascorbate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 0.3 mm unlabeled 2-OG in 40 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.5) supplemented with 50,000 dpm of [5-14C]2-OG and 100 μm Pro-564 peptide. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the radioactivity associated to succinate was determined as described previously (10Baader E. Tschank G. Baringhaus K.H. Burghard H. Gunzler V. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Experiments under hypoxia were performed in a hypoxic workstation.Recombinant Proteins—GST-ODD fusion proteins were prepared as follows. pcDNA3-HIF-1α was PCR-amplified with the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ sets of primers. The P564A mutant was generated following three rounds of PCR amplification. (i) The 1616–1741-bp fragment was PCR-amplified with the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and the reverse 5′-GTCATCATCCATTGGGATATAGGCAGCTAACATCTCCAAGTCTAA-3′ sets of primers. (ii) The 1697–1837-bp fragment was amplified with the forward 5′-TTAGACTTGGAGATGTTAGCTGCCTATATCCCAATGGATGATGAC-3′ and the reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ sets of primers. (iii) The final PCR amplification was initiated in the presence of an equimolar ratio of the two PCR-purified products and followed by the addition of the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and the reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ primers. The ODD and the P564A ODD fragments were purified, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and ligated into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate N-terminal GST-tagged fusion proteins. The two plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. The constructs (pGEX-GST-ODD and pGEX-GST-ODD P564A) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min and pelleted. Cells were sonicated on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the clarified sonicates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for1hat4 °C. After four washes in PBS, the GST-tagged fusion proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8). The integrity and yield of purified GST fusion proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE. vHL was synthesized by using pcDNA3.1/V5-His-vHL as a template (a gift of Dr. S. L. McKnight) and the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega).GST Pull-down Assay—Total cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in reaction buffer (see above) supplemented with glutathione-purified GST-ODD and vHL. After 2 h, glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times with cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were eluted in SDS-running buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bound vHL was visualized by autoradiography or by Western blotting.RESULTSHypoxia Up-regulates Expression of PHD-2 mRNAs and PHD Proteins—HIF-PHDs belong to the extended family of 2-OG-dependent oxygenases that require Fe(II) and ascorbate as cofactors. Three forms of the enzymes are known in human and mouse genomes. Rat PHD-1, PHD-2, and PHD-3 (already known as SM-20) were cloned from rat C6 cell mRNAs and sequenced. Sequences of rat PHD-1 and PHD-2, which were novel, have been deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AY229997 and AY228140). Fig. 1A shows that mRNA species for the three forms of PHD were present in normoxic cells and that hypoxia specifically up-regulated expression of PHD-2 mRNAs. This expression was blocked by actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). PHD-2 mRNA expression remained elevated for at least 1 h when hypoxic cells were reoxygenated (data not shown).To determine whether the hypoxic induction of PHD-2 mRNA expression was accompanied by the synthesis of the corresponding protein, we used a newly devised PHD assay. Extracts of normoxic or hypoxic cells were incubated in the absence or the presence of a peptide substrate (Pro-564) that reproduced the 557–576 amino acid sequence of human HIF-1α. The sequence comprised the Pro-564 residue that is hydroxylated by PHDs. Experiments were performed at normal oxygen tension, i.e. in the presence of unlimiting amounts of oxygen. Under these conditions, our assay measured the maximum velocity of the enzyme, i.e. an estimation of the amount of active protein. The Pro-564 peptide-dependent activity was very low in extracts from normoxic cells (1.5 ± 0.7 nmol/30 min/mg protein). A 6-times larger enzyme activity was observed when hypoxic cell extracts were tested at ambient oxygen tension (Fig. 1B). The Pro-564 peptide-dependent activity was inhibited by iron chelation using 2,2′-dipyridyl and was strictly dependent on the presence of oxygen. The basal activity measured in the absence of Pro-564 peptide substrate was insensitive to iron chelation (data not shown). It probably represented the activity of enzymes that degraded 2-OG but that were unrelated to HIF-PHDs. The up-regulation of PHD activity by hypoxia might be the result of the de novo synthesis or the unmasking of a latent enzyme activity. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used actinomycin D to block transcription. Results indicated that actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) prevented the hypoxic induction of PHD activity (data not shown).A second PHD assay used bacterially expressed GST-ODD fusion proteins as substrate and a pull-down assay relying on the ability of vHL to bind hydroxylated Pro-564 (Hyp564). The ODD sequence reproduced the 530–603 amino acid sequence of human HIF-1α. Fig. 1C shows that incubation of GST-ODD with extracts from normoxic cells promoted vHL binding to GST-ODD. Binding was prevented by 2,2′-dipyridyl. As expected, it was not observed when a GST-ODD P564A fusion protein was used as a substrate. Fig. 1C further shows that extracts from hypoxic cells promoted a larger association of vHL with GST-ODD. Note that in the two in vitro assays, PHD activity was assayed at ambient oxygen, i.e. in the presence of unlimiting amounts of oxygen. As a consequence, activities represented maximum velocities of the enzymes, i.e. enzyme concentrations. Indeed enzyme activities were lower in hypoxic cells because of the lack of oxygen. Taken together, these results indicated that hypoxia increased the levels of both PHD-2 mRNAs and PHD enzyme.Fig. 2 analyzes changes in PHD activity during reoxygenation. It shows that the enzyme activity, measured using the 2-OG degradation assay (panel A) or the vHL binding assay (panel B), increased upon oxygenation and then decreased. Activity was back to basal levels after 45–60 min of reoxygenation. The peptide-independent activity was not modified by hypoxia. It increased slowly during reoxygenation (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Reoxygenation down-regulates expression of PHD. A, 2-OG degradation was analyzed in extracts from normoxic, hypoxic, and reoxygenated cells. Pro-564 peptide-dependent (▾) and Pro-564 peptide-independent (○) activities were measured. Means ± S.E. (n = 3) in a representative experiment are shown. B, GST pull-down assay. GST-ODD was in vitro hydroxylated by cell extracts in the presence of cofactors and [35S]vHL. The bound [35S]vHL was pulled-down and visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reoxygenation Destabilized ODD—To further analyze the effect of reoxygenation, we generated a chimeric protein consisting of the C-terminal part of the ODD domain of human HIF-1α fused to GFP and used it as a reporter protein. The ODD sequence corresponded to the HIF-1α-(530–603) sequence and included Pro-564. Fig. 3A analyzes the degradation of ODD-GFP fusion protein during reoxygenation. It shows that ODD-GFP, which had accumulated during hypoxia, rapidly disappeared during reoxygenation. The ODD-GFP signal was quantitated and plotted against time. Fig. 3B indicated a half-life of ODD-GFP of ∼3 min. It was much shorter than that of GFP (24 h) or of ODD-GFP (6 h) in the same cells (11D'Angelo G. Duplan E. Vigne P. Frelin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15406-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A decrease in the half-life of ODD-GFP from 6 h to 3 min suggested that the rate of degradation of the protein had increased 120-fold during reoxygenation. Similarly, we observed that hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α disappeared after only 5 min of reoxygenation (data not shown).Fig. 3Degradation of ODD-GFP during reoxygenation. A, Western blots showing expression of ODD-GFP (top) and α-tubulin (bottom) during reoxygenation of hypoxic cells. Control normoxic cells are shown for comparison. A representative experiment (n = 3) is shown. B, quantification of the data. The ODD-GFP signal was normalized to that of α–tubulin and plotted against time of reoxygenation. 100% represents maximum ODD-GFP to α-tubulin ratio observed in freshly reoxygenated cells (0.2 min).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Hydroxylated Proteins in Cell Extracts—To examine the hydroxylation status of ODD-containing proteins during hypoxia and reoxygenation, we generated hydroxyproline-specific antibodies. The Hyp564 peptide was used to immunize a rabbit. The antibody recognized the Hyp564 peptide with a 300-times higher affinity that the non-hydroxylated peptide (data not shown). We then used Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments to identify hydroxylated HIF-1α in cell extracts. Labeling of endogenous HIF-1α with the anti-Hyp564 antibody could not be demonstrated in extracts from normoxic, hypoxic, or reoxygenated cells. Thus, the data suggested that only unhydroxylated forms of HIF-1α were present in these cells. This conclusion fully supports the hypothesis that hydroxylation of Pro-564 is essential for the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α (see “Discussion”). A weak labeling of HIF-1α with the anti-Hyp564 antibody was only detected when normoxic cells were incubated in the presence of MG132 (10 μm) to block the proteasomal degradation machinery (data not shown).Fig. 4 analyzes the hydroxylation status of ODD-GFP using the anti-Hyp564 antibody. Panel A shows that hydroxylation of ODD-GFP was increased in the presence of MG132. It was very low in hypoxic cells, as expected, since PHDs were inactive in the absence of oxygen (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the antibody was ascertained by the fact that an excess of Hyp564 peptide prevented the detection of the protein (Fig. 4A , right panel). Fig. 4B shows that hydroxylation of ODD-GFP increased during the first seconds of reoxygenation. Fig. 4C provides a quantitative analysis of the data. Maximum hydroxylation was observed during the first seconds of reoxygenation. It decreased nearly to control levels after 2 min and further disappeared. Note that the expression of ODD-GFP in reoxygenated cells also falls down below control normoxic levels (Fig. 3A). These results are the direct evidence that PHDs, which had accumulated during hypoxia (in a non-functional state since oxygen was limiting), forced the hydroxylation of Pro-564 and destabilized ODD-GFP when cells were reoxygenated.Fig. 4Hydroxylation status of ODD-GFP during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Extracts from normoxic, hypoxic, or reoxygenated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-Hyp564 (top) or anti α-tubulin (bottom) antibodies. A, the white arrow shows a nonspecific band that serves as a control for loading. Hypoxic cells were extracted in a hypoxic workstation to prevent hydroxylation of Pro-564 during extraction. Also shown is an extract from normoxic cells treated for 16 h with 10 μm MG132 (PI) to block proteasomal degradation of ODD-GFP. The right panel shows the same experiment performed in the presence of 0.1 μm Hyp564 peptide to neutralize specific antibodies. B, reoxygenation induces a transient accumulation of hydroxylated ODD-GFP. C, quantitative analysis of the data. The anti-Hyp564 signal was normalized to that of α-tubulin. 100% represents the ratio observed in control normoxic cells. Means ± S.E.

They are important tools to visualize these post-translational modifications and to assess their functional significance. Here we generated antibodies against a synthetic peptide that mimicked the 557–576 sequence of human HIF-1α and analyzed the in vivo hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain of HIF-1α. The antibody distinguished hydroxylated and native forms of the Pro-564 peptide but it was unable to recognize endogenous HIF-1α in extracts from normoxic, hypoxic, or reoxygenated cells. This suggested that most of the HIF-1α molecules were not hydroxylated. Chan et al. (12Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) recently reached the same conclusion using a different antibody. The absence of hydroxylated HIF-1α molecules is fully consistent with the hypothesis that hydroxylation of Pro-564 targets HIF-1α to the proteasome. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α molecules are hydroxylated. They are rapidly degraded by the proteasome and cannot be detected. Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of PHDs is limited by the lack of oxygen. HIF-1α escapes from degradation and accumulates under a non-hydroxylated form that is not recognized by the anti-Hyp564 antibody.This paper also analyzes the hydroxylation status of Pro-564 in the context of an ODD-GFP fusion protein. Results indicated the presence of both native and hydroxylated forms of ODD-GFP in normoxic cells. The presence of a hydroxyproline in ODD-GFP but not in HIF-1α suggested that hydroxylated ODD-GFP was degraded at a slower rate than hydroxylated HIF-1α. This result was not surprising. Efficient targeting of HIF-1α to the proteasome is now known to require hydroxylation of both Pro-402 and Pro-564 residues (13Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The ODD sequence used in the ODD-GFP fusion protein only reproduced the 530–603 amino acid sequence of HIF-1α and did not include the Pro-402 residue.A major observation of this study is that a period of hypoxia up-regulates PHD enzyme levels. (i) Rat PHD-2 mRNAs are hypoxically induced (Fig. 1) as reported recently for human PHD-2 (14Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E.

(iii) Hydroxylated forms of an ODD-GFP fusion protein accumulate in reoxygenated cells. (iv) ODD-GFP is destabilized in reoxygenated cells. Thus, our results suggest the possibility that PHD-2 is responsible for the destabilization of ODD-GFP and HIF-1α during reoxygenation.

https://openalex.org/W2027349141,"In yeast cells, the Rtf1 and Paf1 components of the Paf1 transcriptional elongation complex are important for recruitment of Set1, the histone H3-lysine 4 (H3-Lys4) methylase, to a highly localized domain at the 5' portion of active mRNA coding regions. Here, we show that Rtf1 is essential for global methylation of H3-Lys4 and H3-Lys79, but not H3-Lys36. This role of Rtf1 resembles that of Rad6, which mediates ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 123. Indeed, Rtf1 is required for H2B ubiquitination, suggesting that its effects on H3-Lys4 and H3-Lys79 methylation are an indirect consequence of its effect on H2B ubiquitination. Rtf1 is important for telomeric silencing, with loss of H3-Lys4 and H3-Lys79 methylation synergistically reducing Sir2 association with telomeric DNA. Dot1, the H3-Lys79 methylase, associates with transcriptionally active genes, but unlike the association of Set1 and Set2 (the H3-Lys36 methylase), this association is largely independent of Rtf1. We suggest that Rtf1 affects genome-wide ubiquitination of H2B by a mechanism that is distinct from its function as a transcriptional elongation factor."
https://openalex.org/W1963691526,"A variety of cell surface adhesion molecules can exist as both transmembrane proteins and soluble circulating forms. Increases in the levels of soluble adhesion molecules have been correlated with a variety of inflammatory diseases, suggesting a pathological role. Although soluble forms are thought to result from proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface, relatively little is known about the proteases responsible for their release. In this report we demonstrate that under normal culture conditions, cells expressing vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) release a soluble form of the extracellular domain that is generated by metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage. VCAM-1 release can be rapidly simulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and this induced VCAM-1 shedding is mediated by metalloproteinase cleavage of VCAM-1 near the transmembrane domain. PMA-induced VCAM-1 shedding occurs as the result of activation of a specific pathway, as the generation of soluble forms of three other adhesion molecules, E-selectin, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, are not altered by PMA stimulation. Using cells derived from genetically deficient mice, we identify tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM 17) as the protease responsible for PMA-induced VCAM-1 release, including shedding of endogenously expressed VCAM-1 by murine endothelial cells. Therefore, TACE-mediated shedding of VCAM-1 may be important for the regulation of VCAM-1 function at the cell surface.

The proteolytic cleavage and release of transmembrane cell surface proteins, termed ectodomain shedding, has emerged as an important post-translational mechanism for regulating the function of cell surface proteins (1Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A wide variety of structurally diverse proteins including cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules can be shed from the cell surface. In many cases, these shed ectodomains are biologically active. Ectodomain shedding can be mediated by both membrane-bound as well as soluble proteases. To date, members of the Zn2+-dependent protease superfamily, including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT-MMP, membrane-tethered MMP; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin epitope tag; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; PE, phycoerythrin; PECAM-1, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; WT, wild type. membrane-tethered MMPs (MT-MMPs), and the disintegrin metalloproteinases (ADAMs), have been shown to be responsible for the cleavage of the majority of shed proteins identified. In addition, soluble neutrophil-derived proteases including neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 have also been implicated in the shedding of cell surface proteins (2Bank U. Ansorge S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 197-206PubMed Google Scholar). Of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family of proteases, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM 17) has emerged as a central mammalian ectodomain sheddase (3Black R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). TACE-deficient mice are not viable and show multiple developmental defects (4Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells isolated from TACE-deficient mice lack shedding of several unrelated cell surface proteins including tumor necrosis factor-α, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor, several epidermal growth factor receptor ligands, Notch-1, amyloid precursor protein, L-selectin, and fractalkine (4Peschon J.J.

A role for ectodomain shedding in the regulation of adhesion molecule function was first suggested by the observation that L-selectin is rapidly shed from the surface of leukocytes upon activation (11Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the generation of soluble L-selectin is metalloproteinase-dependent, and cells derived from TACE-deficient mice lack L-selectin shedding (4Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that cleavage of the adhesion molecule L1 is mediated by ADAM 10 and is required for L1-mediated cell migration (12Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, cleavage of the adhesion receptor CD44 by MT1-MMP plays an important role in CD44-mediated migration in vitro (13Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that cleavage and shedding of the endothelial adhesion molecule, fractalkine, is mediated by TACE (ADAM 17) (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that metalloproteinase-dependent processing of cell surface adhesion molecules may represent an important novel regulatory mechanism. A variety of cell adhesion molecules have been shown to exist as cell-associated as well as soluble proteins that are thought to arise by cleavage from the cell surface (14Gearing A.J. Newman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Examples include the selectins E-selectin and P-selectin and members of the Ig superfamily including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). Levels of these soluble adhesion molecules are elevated in vivo in a variety of inflammatory diseases (14Gearing A.J. Newman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). In most cases, relatively little is known about the protease(s) responsible for adhesion molecule shedding. However, the finding that TACE (ADAM 17) mediates the cleavage of L-selectin and fractalkine has suggested that ADAM-family proteases may play an important role in the generation of these soluble adhesion molecules. In this report we have used in vitro cell-based systems to characterize factors that regulate the generation of soluble VCAM-1. We find that VCAM-1 can undergo metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage and shedding from the cell surface and that this can be rapidly stimulated by phorbol esters. We additionally demonstrate that TACE (ADAM 17) function is required for VCAM-1 shedding. The possible implications of TACE-mediated cleavage and shedding for VCAM-1 function are also discussed.

Whitehead R.H. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the SV40 transgene were identified by PCR using as a forward primer 5′-cctggaatagtcaccat and as a reverse primer caatgcctgtttcatgcc-3′. Genotyping for ADAM 9 was by Southern blotting (16Weskamp G.C.H. Brodie T.A. Higashyama S. Manova K. Ludwig T. Blobel C.P. Mol. Cell.

F1 mice that were positive for the SV40 large T transgene and tested positive for the presence of the targeted ADAM 17 or 9 allele were mated. F2 mice carrying at least one copy of the SV40 large T antigen and either wild type or expressing homozygous ADAM 17 or 9 deletion were used for cell isolation.

Even at 2 days, mice homozygous for the targeted mutation in ADAM 17 (TACEΔZn/ΔZn) are underrepresented in crosses with H-2Kb-tsA58 Tag mice. Isolation of Cell Lines—Wild type, conditionally immortalized mouse stomach (Stom-WT) cell lines were established from the stomach mucosa of the H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse as previously described (18Whitehead R.H. Noble V.P. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and from crosses with ADAM-deficient mice generated as described above. The stomach was removed, and the glandular portion was resected, washed, and incubated in 0.04% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min at room temp followed by a 90-min incubation in 3 mm EDTA plus 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in phosphate-buffered saline at room temp. The pits were liberated from the mucosa by vigorous shaking and after a brief centrifugation were plated in RPMI 1640 media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% conditioned medium from the LIM1863 colon carcinoma cell line and 5 units/ml mouse IFN-γ in a type I collagen-coated 24-well tray and incubated at 32–33 °C. After a 24-h incubation, 1 ml of medium was added to each well. When cell growth was evident, the cells were passaged with trypsin-EDTA solution. The epithelial phenotype of the 80% confluent cells was confirmed by cytokeratin staining (monoclonal antibody LE61 to keratin 18, Dr. E. B. Lane, University of Dundee, UK) after cold acetone fixation for 15 min. The presence of a characteristic basket weave staining pattern in the cytoplasm was considered evidence of the presence of the keratin fibers indicative of epithelial cells. Dermal fibroblasts were prepared from mouse skin by digestion in 0.2% trypsin overnight at 4 °C to allow separation of the epidermis from the dermis. Fibroblasts were isolated from the dermis by incubation on a sterile pad preequilibrated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% type III collagenase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 2 h (newborn) or at 4 °C overnight (adult). After digestion, debris was removed, and the cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Endothelial cells were isolated using a modified version of a published protocol (19Lidington E.A. Rao R.M. Marelli-Berg F.M. Jat P.S. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heart and aorta were aseptically removed and minced in digestion buffer (serum-free M199 media, 0.024 m Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.2% type 1A collagenase) before digestion for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After filtering through a 70-μm cell strainer, cells from a single mouse were plated in M199 containing 20% fetal calf serum, ECM2 supplement (Clonetics), and 5 units/ml IFN-γ in a well of a 6-well tray (gelatin coated). After a 16-h incubation at 32–32 °C, cells were washed to remove non-adherent cells, and cultures were subsequently maintained at 32–33 °C. Two cycles of cell sorting were utilized to isolate cells greater than 98% positive for endoglin (12Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—All cell culture media contained penicillin and streptomycin. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Stomach epithelial and dermal fibroblast cell lines from ADAM 9- and ADAM 17-deficient cells were maintained at 32–33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum plus 5 units/ml IFN-γ, whereas endothelial cells were kept in M199 containing 20% fetal calf serum, ECM2 supplement (Clonetics), and 5 units/ml IFN-γ in gelatin-coated tissue culture plasticware. For experiments, cells were plated in the absence of IFN and grown at 37 °C for 36 h to arrest immortalization by the SV40 large T antigen. Generation of Expression Constructs and Retroviral Infection—HA epitope-tagged adhesion molecules were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using primers containing 5′ and 3′ SfiI sites for subcloning into the pBM-HA-IRES-PURO retroviral vector. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Retroviral expression plasmids were constructed using the pBM-IRES-EGFP vector (G. Nolan, Stanford University) or the pBM-IRES-PURO vector (20Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. Biotechniques. 2002; 32: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). High titer retrovirus was prepared as previously described (21Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For infection, 4 × 105 NIH3T3 or ADAM-deficient cells were plated into 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks 24 h before infection by incubation with 5 ml of virus stock for 12 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After infection, retroviral supernatant was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were cultured for at least 48 h before use in subsequent experiments. For puromycin selection, cells were subsequently cultured in the presence of 1–2 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. Adhesion Molecule Shedding Assays—Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in complete growth medium 36 h before stimulation. Cells were pretreated for 15 min by the addition of GM6001 (50 μm final) or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) vehicle control directly to the culture medium. Cells were washed with serum-free medium and stimulated with 2.5 ml of serum-free medium with or without PMA (100 ng/ml), GM6001 (50 μm), or Me2SO control followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min or the indicated time. After stimulation, supernatants were removed, and cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm iodoacetamide). Resulting cell supernatants and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Adhesion molecule concentrations were determined by ELISA using either commercially available ELISA kits (E-selectin and PECAM-1; R&D Systems) or matched ELISA antibody pairs (ICAM-1 and human VCAM-1, BIOSOURCE; anti-mouse VCAM-1, R&D Systems). The levels of soluble adhesion molecules were determined for triplicate dishes and reported as the mean ± S.D. All experiments shown are representative of duplicate experiments. Protein Analysis—Cells expressing HA epitope-tagged human adhesion molecules were plated, stimulated, and lysed as described previously (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and subsequently immunoblotted with specific antibodies prior to visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting—Cell surface levels of adhesion molecules were confirmed after retroviral infections by flow cytometric analyses (FACScan; BD Biosciences) of cells stained with specific PE-conjugated antibodies (Pharmingen). For reconstitution experiments, TACE-deficient cells were infected with an IRES-EGFP retrovirus encoding TACE, a catalytically inactive TACE (Glu → Ala) mutant, or an empty vector control. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were subsequently superinfected with pBM-VCAM1HA-IRES-PURO retrovirus and selected with puromycin as above. To isolate purified endothelial cells from mixed cultures, cells were stained with anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody MJ7/18 (15Ge A.Z. Butcher E.C.

PMA Induces Rapid Cleavage and Shedding of VCAM-1— The release of a variety of proteins from the cell surface can be stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA through activation of a metalloproteinase-dependent ectodomain sheddase machinery, a pathway that appears to be conserved across multiple cell types. We have previously shown that NIH3T3 cells can be used to study PMA-induced shedding (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, decided to characterize factors that regulate the shedding of VCAM-1 and other adhesion molecules in this cell line. A cDNA encoding full-length VCAM-1 with a cytoplasmic tail HA epitope tag (Fig. 1A) was cloned into the pBM-IRES-PURO retroviral vector (20Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. Biotechniques. 2002; 32: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After infection and selection with puromycin, flow cytometry was used to confirm that VCAM-1 is efficiently expressed and appropriately targeted to the cell surface (Fig. 1B). 3T3-VCAM-1 cells were subsequently cultured in the presence or absence of PMA for 45 min, and levels of soluble VCAM-1 released into the medium were determined by ELISA. Stimulation of 3T3-VCAM-1 cells with PMA leads to a 16-fold increase in the amount of soluble VCAM-1 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that PMA stimulation did not simply induce the release of proteins from the surface of NIH3T3 cells, we also determined the effect of PMA on shedding of three additional adhesion molecules: ICAM-1, E-selectin, and PECAM-1. Despite efficient cell surface expression as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B), PMA stimulation has no effect on the shedding of ICAM-1, E-selectin, or PECAM-1 from retrovirally infected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1C). This finding suggests that among these proteins, VCAM-1 is part of a specific shedding pathway that can be rapidly activated by PMA stimulation. We next determined whether the release of soluble VCAM-1 in response to PMA occurs by cleavage of the transmembrane form of VCAM-1. Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against the VCAM-1 extracellular domain or the cytoplasmic tail HA epitope tag shows that cell-associated VCAM-1 exists predominantly as a 110-kDa species (Fig. 1D). As expected, cellular VCAM-1 is recognized by antibodies against both the extracellular domain and the intracellular HA epitope-tag (Fig. 1D). In contrast, after release from the cell surface in the presence or absence of PMA, soluble VCAM-1 exists as a 100-kDa species that is recognized by the antibody against the extracellular domain but not by an antibody against the cytoplasmic tail HA epitope tag (Fig. 1D). This finding confirms that soluble VCAM-1 is generated by cleavage of full-length VCAM-1 near the transmembrane domain, leading to removal of the cytoplasmic tail and release of the majority of the ectodomain. Constitutive and PMA-inducible VCAM-1 Shedding Are Metalloproteinase-dependent—To determine whether constitutive and/or PMA-inducible shedding of VCAM-1 from NIH3T3 cells is mediated by metalloproteinases, we treated cells with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 that inhibits both MMP and ADAM-family proteases and efficiently blocks TACE-dependent ectodomain shedding (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of PMA stimulation, constitutive VCAM-1 shedding from NIH3T3 cells is partially blocked by GM6001 pretreatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, GM6001 pretreatment completely inhibits VCAM-1 shedding in response to PMA stimulation (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the model that VCAM-1 internalization and degradation are metalloproteinase-independent, the decrease in cellular VCAM-1 with PMA stimulation is only partially reversed by GM6001 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, constitutive VCAM-1 shedding is partially metalloproteinase-dependent, whereas PMA-inducible VCAM-1 shedding is completely mediated by metalloproteinases, a pattern of sensitivity to GM6001 similar to that shown for constitutive and inducible shedding of the TACE substrate fractalkine (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the apparent basal levels of soluble VCAM-1 at 1 h in Fig. 2A and after 45 min in Fig. 2B likely reflect differences in culture conditions, including cell density and media volume. TACE Is Required for PMA-induced VCAM-1 Shedding— The marked sensitivity of PMA-induced VCAM-1 shedding to inhibition by GM6001 suggests that an ADAM-family protease, such as TACE, is likely involved in VCAM-1 shedding. To test this, we analyzed VCAM-1 shedding in conditionally immortalized cells derived from mice genetically deficient for individual ADAM proteases that were intercrossed with transgenic mice (Immortomouse) expressing an interferon-γ-inducible and temperature-sensitive SV40 large T-antigen allele (17D'Abaco G.M. Whitehead R.H. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using the VCAM-1-IRES-PURO retroviral vector, VCAM-1 was expressed in stomach epithelial cells and dermal fibroblasts derived from wild type (WT) and ADAM 9- and TACE-deficient mice intercrossed with the Immortomouse, and the generation of soluble VCAM-1 was determined by ELISA in the presence or absence of PMA. Stomach epithelial cells and dermal fibroblasts specifically lacking TACE fail to shed VCAM-1 in response to PMA (Fig. 3A). However, neither TACE nor ADAM 9 is required for constitutive VCAM-1 shedding, as cells deficient in these proteases are able to shed VCAM-1 under basal conditions (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the loss of PMA-induced VCAM-1 shedding in TACE-deficient cells is due to the absence of TACE function and not due to nonspecific effects of the mutant TACE protein, TACE-deficient stomach epithelial cells were infected with an IRES-EGFP retrovirus encoding either WT-TACE, a catalytically inactive TACE (Glu → Ala) mutant, or an empty vector control. Expression of WT-TACE specifically rescues the loss of PMA-inducible VCAM-1 shedding in TACE-deficient cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, overexpression of WT-TACE increases basal VCAM-1 shedding, suggesting that TACE is not efficiently regulated when overexpressed in this cell type, similar to what we have observed with fractalkine shedding (10Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether constitutive VCAM-1 shedding in TACE-deficient cells is also mediated by a metalloproteinase, we evaluated the effect of GM6001 on the release of soluble VCAM-1. TACE-deficient stomach cells showed constitutive release of VCAM-1 that was partially, but not completely, blocked by GM6001 (Fig. 3C). Thus, TACE function is absolutely required for PMA-induced VCAM-1 shedding but not for basal VCAM-1 shedding. However, constitutive shedding is partially mediated by a metalloproteinase that does not appear to be ADAM 9 since basal VCAM-1 shedding is maintained in cells genetically deficient for ADAM 9 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). To confirm that TACE is required for the shedding of endogenous VCAM-1, we isolated endothelial cells from WT and TACE-deficient mice intercrossed with the Immortomouse. Polyclonal populations of primary endothelial cells were isolated by FACS sorting based on endoglin expression (19Lidington E.A. Rao R.M. Marelli-Berg F.M. Jat P.S. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to previous studies with murine endothelial cells, both WT and TACE-deficient cells expressed significant and comparable levels of VCAM-1 on their cell surface (data not shown). Endothelial cells specifically lacking TACE function failed to shed endogenous VCAM-1 in response to PMA stimulation (Fig. 3D and data not shown). Furthermore, retroviral expression of wild type TACE, but not the catalytically inactive TACE (Glu → Ala) mutant, efficiently restored PMA-induced VCAM-1 shedding that is completely blocked by GM6001 (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the shedding of VCAM-1 by TACE is not an artifact due to increased substrate availability after retroviral expression in NIH3T3 cells, and shedding of endogenously expressed VCAM-1 is also mediated by TACE in murine endothelial cells. Although the existence of a soluble form of VCAM-1 has been known for more than a decade, relatively little is known about the mechanism(s) by which VCAM-1 can be shed from the cell surface. In this study we show for the first time that VCAM-1 shedding can be mediated by two distinct metalloproteinase activities, a constitutive VCAM-1 sheddase that is active under normal cell culture conditions and a PMA-inducible protease that we identify as TACE (ADAM 17). Similar to other TACE substrates, we show that cleavage of VCAM-1 occurs near the transmembrane region, leading to release of an intact VCAM-1 ectodomain. In addition, we show that the proteolytic release of soluble VCAM-1 from the cell surface by TACE is not simply due to ubiquitous and nonspecific protein shedding as PMA fails to alter the levels of soluble ICAM-1, E-selectin, and PECAM-1. Ectodomain cleavage and shedding of VCAM-1 would be predicted to affect its function at several levels. First, cleavage of VCAM-1 by TACE may play a role in regulating the adhesive function of VCAM-1 by rapidly decreasing its levels at the cell surface. In support of this model, it has been shown that L-selectin, another TACE substrate, is rapidly shed from the surface of leukocytes during emigration into sites of inflammation (22Faveeuw C. Preece G. Ager A. Blood. 2001; 98: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and MMP inhibitors have been shown to decrease the rolling velocity of leukocytes on microvessels in vivo by 40%, although the exact mechanism is not yet clear (23Hafezi-Moghadam A. Ley K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Hafezi-Moghadam A. Thomas K.L. Prorock A.J. Huo Y. Ley K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These and other studies suggest novel roles for proteases in the dynamic regulation of adhesion molecule function. A second potential implication of VCAM-1 shedding is that the soluble ectodomain generated by TACE cleavage may remain functionally active. For example, soluble ICAM-1 retains its ability to bind to leukocyte integrins and reduces leukocyte recruitment in diverse in vivo models of inflammation (14Gearing A.J. Newman W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 506-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 25Shingu M. Hashimoto M. Nobunaga M. Isayama T. Yasutake C. Naono T. Inflammation. 1994; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent studies have additionally shown that the cell-associated transmembrane cleavage fragments generated by ectodomain cleavage may have unique functions. For example, MMP-mediated cleavage of the CD44 ectodomain is followed by further cleavage of the membrane-anchored fragment by a γ-secretase-like protease, leading to the release of an intracellular cytoplasmic tail fragment (26Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The resulting CD44 tail fragment subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it can function as a transcriptional activator (26Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether any of these secondary functions are also seen after TACE-mediated cleavage and shedding of VCAM-1. Furthermore, our understanding of the functional significance of TACE-mediated VCAM-1 shedding will be further clarified by identifying more physiologically relevant stimuli of TACE activity. Although the in vivo significance of VCAM-1 cleavage and shedding is not yet known, the observation of high levels of soluble VCAM-1 in human serum suggests a likely physiological role (27Levesque J.P. Takamatsu Y. Nilsson S.K. Haylock D.N. Simmons P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Soluble VCAM-1 present in both human and mouse serum (data not shown) exists as a 100-kDa protein similar to that released by NIH3T3 cells in vitro and suggests that it is likely generated by juxtamembrane cleavage. Recent studies report that VCAM-1 can also be cleaved from the cell surface by the soluble protease neutrophil elastase (27Levesque J.P. Takamatsu Y. Nilsson S.K. Haylock D.N. Simmons P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed from in vitro data that neutrophil elastase cleavage of VCAM-1 from the surface of bone marrow stromal cells plays a role in the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells (27Levesque J.P. Takamatsu Y. Nilsson S.K. Haylock D.N. Simmons P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We also find that neutrophil elastase cleaves VCAM-1 from NIH3T3 cells, generating a 65-kDa form of soluble VCAM-1 distinct from the 100 kDa form generated by TACE-mediated shedding (data not shown). However, the predominant form of VCAM-1 seen in serum is 100 kDa (data not shown), inconsistent with cleavage by neutrophil elastase but compatible with its generation by a juxtamembrane sheddase. Through the data presented in this paper we clearly show that TACE can be added to the list of proteases that can mediate the cleavage and shedding of VCAM-1. However, more definitive in vivo experiments are needed to determine when neutrophil elastase, TACE, or other proteases are responsible for the generation of soluble VCAM-1 in vivo. It will also be important to understand whether the proteases lead to the generation of different forms of soluble VCAM-1 with distinct biological activities and functions.

Recently, we described the SUF system of Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi as being important for Fe-S biogenesis under stressful conditions. The SUF system is made of six proteins: SufC is an atypical cytoplasmic ABC-ATPase, which forms a complex with SufB and SufD; SufA plays the role of a scaffold protein for assembly of iron-sulfur clusters and delivery to target proteins; SufS is a cysteine desulfurase which mobilizes the sulfur atom from cysteine and provides it to the cluster; SufE has no associated function yet. Here we demonstrate that: (i) SufE and SufS are both cystosolic as all members of the SUF system; (ii) SufE is a homodimeric protein; (iii) SufE forms a complex with SufS as shown by the yeast two-hybrid system and by affinity chromatography; (iv) binding of SufE to SufS is responsible for a 50-fold stimulation of the cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS. This is the first example of a two-component cysteine desulfurase enzyme. Biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) depends on multiprotein systems.

Mobilization of sulfur is achieved by a recently discovered class of enzymes, named cysteine desulfurases (2Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The first original observation was made by Dean and co-workers (5Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) who identified the product of the nifS gene in Azotobacter vinelandii as a cysteine desulfurase providing inorganic sulfide required for the formation of Fe-S clusters in a component protein of nitrogenase. Since then, homolog genes have been discovered in almost all living organisms and some of the corresponding proteins biochemically and structurally characterized. It is thus now well established that cysteine desulfurases are pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, which decompose l-cysteine into l-alanine and sulfane-sulfur (Fig. 1) (6Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The cysteine desulfuration mechanism has been strongly supported by recent remarkable structural studies of two cysteine desulfurases: the IscS protein from Thermotoga maritima and the SufS protein from Escherichia coli (7Kaiser J.T. Clauser T. Bourenhow G.P. Bartunik H.D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Mihara H. Fujii T. Kato K. Hata Y. Esaki N. J.

Even though the three-dimensional structures display significant differences at the active site, they both contain a protein-bound PLP as well as the conserved active cysteine in close proximity (1 in Fig. 1). Furthermore, several postulated intermediates have now been structurally characterized: (i) the enzyme-cysteine complex (2 in Fig. 1), (ii) the enzyme form in which a substrate analogue, propargylglycine, is covalently attached to PLP through an aldimine bond (3 in Fig. 1), and (iii) the enzyme form in which the active cysteine is in the persulfide form (4 in Fig. 1). All cysteine desulfurases thus have a critical cysteine residue in the active site and site-directed mutagenesis of that residue completely abolishes enzyme activity (10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A different situation occurs in the PLP-dependent l-cyst(e)ine C-S-lyase (C-DES) isolated from Synechocystis PCC 6714 which participates to Fe-S cluster assembly in this organism (11Lang T. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3856-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). C-DES does not have a conserved functional cysteine residue at the active site and forms pyruvate, rather than alanine, and sulfide from cysteine. It has a strong preference for cystine as a substrate. A cysteine persulfide is also intermediately formed but as a free product during catalysis, further supporting the importance of persulfidic intermediates during Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Finally, cysteine desulfurases have also the ability to mobilize the selenium atom from selenocysteine, but the mechanism of the reaction is less well understood. Nevertheless it is known that the deselenation process is not dependent on the active site cysteine residue, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis, suggesting different mechanisms for desulfuration and deselenation. E. coli contains three cysteine desulfurases (2Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A first system, named CSD (for cysteine sulfinate desulfinase) and encoded by the csdA gene, has broad substrate specificity since, besides cysteine and selenocysteine, it acts on cysteine sulfinic acid, the best substrate in terms of Km and V m values, cystine and selenocystine (10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Its biological function is not identified but it was shown to be the most efficient sulfur donor for the formation of molybdopterin in vitro (14Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied cysteine desulfurase is the IscS protein because it proved to be essential for biosynthesis of thiamin and most thionucleosides in tRNAs (15Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Lauhon C.T. J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6830-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). IscS mobilizes sulfur and selenium from cysteine and selenocysteine, respectively, equally well. IscS has been discovered as a component of the ISC system, which plays an important role in the assembly of Fe-S clusters in various iron-sulfur proteins (18Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Several genetic studies in E. coli and yeast clearly demonstrated that deletion of the iscS gene drastically affected the activity of Fe-S containing enzymes (aconitase, biotin synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, ferredoxins) (19Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 20Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A.B. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol.

The third cysteine desulfurase is the homodimeric SufS protein, encoded by the sufS (csdB) gene. It was shown to be highly specific for selenocysteine and to display a relatively much weaker cysteine desulfurase activity (corresponding to about 1% of the deselenation activity) (10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was thus earlier considered rather as a selenocysteine lyase. Substitution of the conserved Cys364 residue to alanine completely abolished the low cysteine desulfurase activity but, in contrast, resulted in a slight stimulation of the selenocysteine deselenation activity (10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Even though its cysteine desulfurase activity was very low, SufS was nevertheless proposed to participate to sulfur metabolism. Indeed, SufS belongs to the suf operon, which was recently shown to be involved in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (24Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 25Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol.

In particular, Takahashi et al. (24Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of the suf operon restores both the growth phenotype and the activity of Fe-S proteins in mutant E. coli cells lacking the iscSUA operon. Moreover, synthetic lethality was observed upon inactivation of both the isc and suf operons (24Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Hence, despite its low cysteine desulfurase activity, SufS was proposed to mediate sulfur atom transfer from cysteine to target proteins during assembly of Fe-S clusters. At the genetic level though, both suf and isc operons exhibit important differences since the suf operon is under both the Fe-dependent Fur repressor and the oxidative stress-dependent OxyR activator while the isc operon is autoregulated (25Nachin L.

In particular, this led to the proposal that the SUF system operates under specific stressfull conditions such as oxidative stress and iron limitation (25Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The suf operon includes sufA, sufB, sufC, sufD, sufS, sufE genes in this order. Recent genetic and biochemical experiments using E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi, a Gram-negative plant pathogen, have recently provided more informations on the function of the corresponding Suf proteins. In both species SufC appears to be the most critical protein during biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters since inactivation of sufC in E. chrysanthemi or E. coli resulted in a wide range of phenotypes, all related to iron homeostasis and oxidative stress (25Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sufC mutation resulted in decreased virulence of E. chrysanthemi (25Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, SufC is an ABC-ATPase located in the cytosol wherein it interacts with SufB and SufD (26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have recently found that purified SufA is able to assemble iron-sulfur clusters transiently and to transfer them in vitro to target apoproteins such as biotin synthase or ferredoxin (31Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Nachin L. Sanakis Y. Loiseau L. Barras F. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17998-18001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have thus proposed that SufA plays the role of a scaffold protein for assembly of Fe-S clusters, providing a mechanism for bringing together elemental sulfur and iron into transient assembled clusters. The last gene of the suf operon, sufE, encodes a protein with no associated function. However, in E. coli we identified a paralog of sufE, referred to as ygdK (54% similarity) that lies just after csdA, encoding the cysteine desulfurase CSD discussed above. Similar examples of this association are found in P. aeruginosa, V. cholerae, H. influenzae. It was thus tempting to make the working hypothesis that SufE collaborated with SufS in cysteine desulfuration, for providing sulfur atoms during Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In this paper we report the first purification and characterization of a SufE protein and show that it binds tightly to SufS. The complex displays a drastically enhanced cysteine desulfurase activity as compared with SufS alone. These results challenge the notion that SufS is essentially a selenocysteine lyase and remove the intriguing contradiction between the established role of suf operon in Fe-S biogenesis metabolism and the low cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS. In fact we show here that in the SUF system, the cysteine desulfurase activity is provided by the SufS/SufE complex. Materials—All chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. or Fluka unless otherwise stated. Cysteine was from Roche Applied Science. All strains used are described in Table I. The E. coli TG1 strain was used for routine DNA manipulation. E. coli strains were grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) rich medium (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When necessary, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. E. chrysanthemi strains were grown aerobically in LB medium at 30 °C. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD or appropriate minimal dropout media (CM) in which 2% (w/v) glucose or 2% (w/v) galactose and 2% (w/v) raffinose were added (33Lundblad V.

The pEG202 and pJG4–5 vectors were used to express Suf proteins fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA and to the transcriptional activation motif B42, respectively. The sufE and sufS inserts were amplified using E. chrysanthemi chromosomal DNA as a template and primer 6s/6as and 5s/5as, respectively. The sufE and sufS inserts were digested by EcoRI-XhoI and then cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI-digested pEG202 and pJG4–5, yielding the pB42 and pLexA plasmid series: pB42-E, pB42-S, pLexA-E, pLexA-S. A similar strategy was used to construct LexA- or B42-SufSC369S derivatives.Table IISequence of oligonucleotides used for strains and plasmids constructionsOligonucleotide5′-3′sequence5sGCATCGAATTCGTGAATTATCCTGTCGAAC5asGCCTTCTCGAGTTACTCGCCCAACAGACG6sCCTAGGAATTCATGGCGCAACTGCCGG6asGCCTTCTCGAGTTATATCAATGCGGACNdel-5sCCGCATATGGTGAATTATCCTGTCGAAXhol-5asGTTCTCGAGCTCGCCCAACAGACGATGXhol-6asGTTCTCGAGTATCAATGCGGACGCACG5′sufS C369SACCGGCCACCATAGCGCTATGCCGCTG3′sufS C369SCAGCGGCATAGCGCTATGGTGGCCGGTNco-c-myc-sufECCGTAACCATGGAACAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAAGAAGATCTGATGGCGCAACTGCCGGATCCNcoHACCCTACCATGGCTTACCCATATGATGTGCCAGATTATG Open table in a new tab The pBAD24-based plasmids, containing the PBAD arabinose-inducible promoter, were used to express HA-tagged SufS and c-Myc-tagged SufE proteins. The ha-sufS and c-myc-sufE inserts were obtained by PCR amplification using pB42-S or pB42-E as templates, and oligonucleotides NcoHA/5as and Nco-c-Myc-sufE/6as, respectively. The ha-sufS and cmyc-sufE PCR products were NcoI/XhoI digested and inserted into NcoI/SalI-digested pBAD24 or pBADIK, yielding plasmids pA-S and pA-E, respectively. Plasmid pA-S-E was obtained as follows. The NheI/XhoI fragment from pA-E was cloned in pA-S digested by HindIII, subsequently blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA I, thereby creating an NheI site, and finally cut with XhoI. The sufS-c-myc-sufE fragment was obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides NdeI-5s and XhoI-6as, and pA-S-E as a template. The sufS-c-myc-sufE PCR product was NdeI/XhoI digested and inserted into pET22b+ digested by the same enzymes, yielding pET-S-cEhis. In order to overproduce the SufS-His6 and c-Myc-SufE-His6 proteins, the sufS and sufE genes were cloned into pET22b+. The sufS insert was obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides NdeI-5s/XhoI-5as and NdeI-XhoI digestion. The restricted fragment was inserted into pET22b+ digested by the same enzymes, yielding pET-Shis. The c-myc-sufE insert was obtained by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides Nco-c-Myc-sufE and XhoI-6as and NcoI/XhoI digestion. In order to have c-myc-sufEhis expression under the control of the pBAD promoter, the restricted fragment was inserted in the NcoI-XhoI-digested pBADIK-His, yielding pK-cEhis. Site-directed Mutagenesis of sufS—Mutagenesis of sufS was performed by PCR in two steps. First, two DNA fragments, sufS1 and sufS2 were obtained by PCR as following. Two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides, 3′sufS C369S and 5′sufS C369S were each used in combination with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′-end (NdeI-5s) and 3′-end (XhoI-5as) of sufS, respectively. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed such as cysteine 369 will be changed to a serine residue. Oligonucleotides 3′sufS C369S and NdeI-5s yielded sufS1 and oligonucleotides 5′sufS C369S and XhoI-5as yielded sufS2. The matrix used was pET-Shis. In the second step sufS1 and sufS2 were hybridized and used as templates for PCR with the pair of oligonucleotides NdeI-5s/XhoI-5as. The resulting NdeI-XhoI fragment was cloned into pET22b+ yielding the plasmid pET-SC369Shis. Purification of SufS-His6 and SufSC369S-His6—Plasmids pET-Shis and pET-SC369Shis were introduced into BL21(DE3) cells by transformation and expression of sufS and sufS C369S (Cys369 → Ser) were induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at an OD600 of 0.5. After 4 h at 30 °C, the pellet obtained from a 400-ml culture was immediately resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8). Cell disruption was obtained by means of two passages through a French press. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel Hi-trap column (Amersham Biosciences). The His-tagged proteins were eluted with a 4–500 mm imidazole linear gradient in buffer A. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The pure fractions were pooled, and imidazole was removed using a BIOMAX-5K device (Millipore). FPLC gel filtration with an analytical Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) at flow rate of 0.5 ml/min equilibrated with buffer A was used for size determination. A gel filtration calibration kit (molecular weight marker kit, Sigma) was used as molecular weight standards. Purification of c-Myc-sufE(his)6 Protein—To overproduce c-Myc-SufE, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pK-cEhis. Overnight cultures (100 ml) were used as an inoculum for 800 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg of ampicillin ml–1. Cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of 0.5–0.6 and expression was induced with 0.02% l-arabinose for 6 h at 30 °C. Culture was harvested by centrifugation, the pellet suspended in buffer A and subsequently broken with a French press. After centrifugation (30 min at 12,000 rpm, 4 °C), supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-trap column charged with nickel and equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted by a 25-ml gradient from 0.04 to 0.5 m imidazole with buffer A (buffer A + 1 m imidazole) and was washed twice with buffer A onto a BIOMAX-5K device in order to remove imidazole. The solution was loaded onto a Superdex-75 gelfiltration column and elution steps were carried out at 4 °C with buffer A, at 30 ml h–1. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated onto a BIOMAX-5K. C-Myc-SufE protein was then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Cell Fractionation Procedures—E. chrysanthemi A3559 strain was grown overnight in LB medium at 30 °C. When plasmids pA-E or pA-S were used, ampicillin was added to the medium. Overnight cultures were used to inoculate fresh LB medium at OD600 0.35. After growth for 1 h, 0.02% l-arabinose (w/v) was added and cultures were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C. Culture was then divided in two equal samples. On one hand, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) allowing for the estimation of the amount of Suf proteins present in the cells. On the other hand, sphaeroplasts were prepared in 1.5 ml of buffer B as described (34Bortoli-German I. Brun E. Py B. Chippaux M. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) periplasmic fraction containing supernatants were stored at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were washed, resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer B and disrupted by French Pressure treatment. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), supernatants were submitted to ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm over 1.5 h at 4 °C. Resulting supernatants corresponded to cytosol. Membranes were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer B. SufE and SufS proteins were detected using anti-c-Myc and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. For each location experiment, efficiency and reliability of the cell fractionation procedure were checked using antibody raised against Cel5, OutF, and MsrA. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as previously described (26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 35Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Unit 13.14. John Wiley and Sons, NY1994Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity from diploid cells, obtained by mating of strains EGY48 and RF206 carrying the appropriated plasmid, was detected on plates and was quantified from liquid culture. The β-galactosidase activity was expressed as nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolyzed per minute per milligram of protein (with ϵ = 4.5 103m–1). The diploid cells were also assayed for the expression of the Leu reporter gene as described (26Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The hybrid proteins were detected in cell extracts, by immunoblots using primary antibody raised against the HA epitope or LexA. Affinity Co-purification of SufS and SufE—Plasmid pET-S-cEhis was introduced into into BL21(DE3) cells by transformation and synthesis of proteins was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at an OD600 of 0.3. After 5 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer C containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, and disrupted by means of two passages through a French press. After two centrifugations (10 min, 12,000 rpm, 4 °C), supernatant was treated with a HISTAGcatcher kit (Interchim-CytoSignal) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the Ni2+-charged resin was washed extensively with a buffer C containing 10 mm imidazole, and the bound proteins were eluted from the resin using a buffer C containing 200 mm imidazole. Assay for Cysteine Desulfurase Activity of SufS and SufSC369S—The activity was assayed from the amount of alanine formed from cysteine or selenocysteine. Selenocysteine solution was obtained af"

Here we report the use of cDNA phage libraries in conjunction with synthetic biotinylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate in the identification of a mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate-binding protein, mVps24p. This protein is orthologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, Vps24p, a class-E vacuolar protein-sorting protein. Using in vitro liposome binding and competition assays, we demonstrate that mVps24p selectively binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate in preference to other phosphoinositides tested. When expressed in cultured mammalian cells, full-length mVps24p is cytosolic. However, when cells expressing the full-length mVps24p are co-transfected with a mutated form of mVps4p (which is defective in ATP hydrolysis), or when a N-terminal construct of mVps24p is expressed, the class-E cellular phenotype with swollen vacuoles is induced and mVps24p is membrane-associated. Furthermore, the accumulation of the N-terminal mVps24p construct on the swollen endosomal membranes is abrogated when phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate synthesis is blocked with wortmannin. These data provide the first direct link between phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate and the protein machinery involved in the production of the class-E cellular phenotype. We hypothesize that accumulation of Vps24 on membranes occurs when membrane association (dependent on interaction of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate with the N-terminal domain of the protein) is uncoupled from membrane disassociation (driven by Vps4p).

The most recent addition to the repertoire of phosphoinositides found in eukaryotic cell membranes came with the discovery of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in yeast and fibroblasts (3Dove S.K.

One of the major defects in fab1Δ cells, which are unable to make PtdIns(3,5)P2, is the failure to sort some proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (7Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D.

A mammalian orthologue of Fab1p, named PIKfyve, was originally identified in insulin-sensitive tissues using a differential display screen (9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PIKfyve is largely localized to late endosomal membranes (10Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) where the local synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2 may be regulated by insulin action in some cell types (11Sbrissa D.

Int. 2001; 25: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression of a kinase-dead mutant of PIKfyve in mammalian cells results in the dilation and vacuolation of endosomal membranes, drastically altering cell morphology (13Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26141-26147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with the fab1Δ phenotype seen in yeast, suggesting a conserved role for PtdIns(3,5)P2 in MVB formation throughout the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. The sorting of membrane proteins into MVBs, often leading to their hydrolysis in lysosomal compartments is an important process in regulating their cellular levels. Degradation of membrane proteins may have particular importance in the control of cell signaling, by mediating the down-regulation of activated receptors such as the EGF receptor (14Piper R.C.

There are presently, however, only two reports of proteins binding specifically to PtdIns(3,5)P2: centaurin-β2, which has a PH domain with binding specificity for this phosphoinositide (16Dowler S.

The aim of this study has been to identify PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding proteins in rat adipocytes. These have elevated levels of PIKfyve compared with non-insulin-sensitive tissues and should therefore be a good source of PtdIns(3,5)P2 (9Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell.

However, a screen utilizing in vitro coupled transcription/translation system has recently been used for the same purpose, demonstrating the power of combining cDNA library technology with affinity isolation techniques (20Rao V.R.

The screen described here also combines affinity purification with cDNA libraries but is based on phage display technology. This technology has been used in the selection of proteins able to bind to target ligands such as IgE (21Crameri R. Jaussi R. Menz G. Blaser K. Eur.

These targets are not readily amenable to the two-hybrid technologies commonly used in the identification of interactions between two proteins.We report the use of a phage display screen in the isolation of PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding proteins from a complex library containing a vast excess of nonspecific proteins. In addition we report the characterization of one of the selected proteins, mVps24p, and demonstrate that it is selective in its binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2. Furthermore, we show that the subcellular localization of mVps24p and cellular phenotype associated with expression of mVps24p derivatives is consistent with it being a PtdIns(3,5)P2 effector in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Adipocyte Phage Display Library—Epididymal fat pads were removed from male Wistar rats and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Polyadenylated mRNA was purified using the PolyATract mRNA isolation system (Promega, UK) and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Randomly primed cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of adipocyte mRNA and directionally cloned into the T7Select10-3 vector arms using the T7Select10-3 OrientExpress cDNA cloning system (Novagen). The cloned cDNA was packaged into phage particles, and a serial dilution was made of a small proportion (5%) of the packaged phage to determine the primary size of the library. To make an amplified phage lysate for biopanning, the remainder of the phage were used to infect and lyse Escherichia coli strain BLT5615. All the packaging, titration, and preparation of phage lysates were performed according to protocols provided with the T7Select10-3 cloning system.Synthesis of Biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P 2 —The protected 3,5-phosphoinositide precursor (1, Fig. 1) was synthesized as previously described (25Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 6769-6772Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reaction of 1 with phosphoramidite 2 (25Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 6769-6772Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) followed by oxidation with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid gave 3, which was then subjected to hydrogenolysis over palladium on carbon to provide the sn-2-aminohexanoyl PtdIns(3,5)P2 derivative 4. Reaction of the primary amine group of 4 with N-biotinylaminohexanoyl succinimide ester 5 in dimethylformamide/triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.2) gave biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P2 6 in a manner previously described (20Rao V.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37893-37900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of biotinylated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Products were purified chromatographically. Other phosphoinositides and inositol phosphates used in this study were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories Inc. and Alexis Biochemicals, respectively.Biopanning against Biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P 2 —A slurry of immobilized NeutrAvidin (500 μl) (Pierce) was washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P2 (50 μlofa500 μm solution) was added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer and resuspended in 250 μl of the same buffer. 50 μl of these NeutrAvidin PtdIns(3,5)P2 beads were placed into siliconized 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes diluted in 1 ml of binding buffer. 100 μl of amplified phage lysate (∼1010 plaque forming units) was added to the tube and incubated at 18 °C with rotation for 1 h. The beads were then washed 12 times with 1 ml of binding buffer to remove unbound phage. Bound phage were eluted in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 1% SDS. A small aliquot (10 μl) of the eluted phage was serially diluted and used in a titration assay to determine the number of phage eluted. To make an enriched phage lysate, the remainder was used to infect and lyse BLT5615. The enriched phage lysate was used in the next round of biopanning, and the process was repeated three times before the eluted phage were plated, and individual plaques were picked. The cDNA inserts were amplified using PCR and sequenced following protocols supplied with the T7Select cloning system.DNA Manipulations and Expression—Standard protocols for recombinant DNA manipulations were used. The coding region of rat VPS24 was amplified from phage containing the VPS24 cDNA insert using PCR and oligonucleotides containing convenient restriction sites for cloning into expression vectors. For expression in E. coli VPS24 was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen). His6-mVps24p was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified using Talon (Clontech) metal affinity resin using standard methods. Purified protein was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C. For expression in mammalian tissue culture cells VPS24 was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV5c (Sigma).Rat VPS4 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers designed against the mouse VPS4 cDNA sequence. A Marathon (Clontech) cDNA library constructed according to the manufacturer's instructions from mRNA isolated from rat adipocytes was used as the template. The amplified PCR product was purified and ligated into the blunt cloning vector pT7-Blue3 (Novagen), and the correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to make the Vps4 E235Q mutation. The coding region of Vps4 WT and Vps4 E235Q was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEGFPC1 (Clontech) to express these proteins with enhanced green fluorescent protein GFP at their N termini.Antibodies—An anti-mVps24 antibody was raised in rabbits, with His6-mVps24p as an antigen. The antibody was affinity-purified against the same antigen covalently coupled to Reacti-Gel (6×) (Pierce). The rabbit anti-rat ciM6PR was as described previously (26Reaves B.J. Row P.E. Bright N.A. Luzio J.P. Davidson H.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4099-4108PubMed Google Scholar) and was a gift of Dr. J. P. Luzio, University of Cambridge; the mouse anti-FLAG was purchased from Sigma; and the AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG, AlexaFluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and AlexaFluor 633 goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Binding of mVps24p to PtdIns(3,5)P 2 Beads and Phosphoinositide Competition for mVps24p Binding to PtdIns(3,5)P 2 Beads—Biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P2 (typically 1 nmol for phosphoinositide competition experiments or amount indicated in individual experiments) was incubated with 25 μl of NeutrAvidin beads that had been pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) in a total volume of 500 μl for 30 min. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer and then resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Recombinant His6-mVps24p (5 μg) was added to the NeutrAvidin PtdIns(3,5)P2 beads and incubated at 18 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of detergent buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and the final pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). Samples were analyzed for mVps24p by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The bead competition assays followed the same format described above except that the His6-mVps24p was mixed with competing phosphoinositides (typically 4 nmol of competitor was used) prior to incubation with the NeutrAvidin-PtdIns(3,5)P2 beads.Liposome Binding—Phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine liposomes containing the amounts of phosphoinositide indicated in the legends to Figs. 3, 4, and 5 were prepared as described by Patki et al.

Liposomes (100 μg of total lipid) in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) were incubated with 5 μg of His6-mVps24p at 18 °C for 30 min. Samples were cooled on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed, and SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30 μl) was added to the pellets.

Control beads were mock treated without the addition of biotinylated PtdIns(3,5)P2. For each experiment, 25 μl of beads was incubated with 1 mg of cytosol from rat adipocytes in binding buffer for 1 h at 18 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of the binding buffer, and after the final wash the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting for the presence of mVps24p using anti-mVps24 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown until ∼60% confluent prior to transfection using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected 18-24 h prior to fixation and processing for immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min prior to permeabilizing with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum for 20 min prior to addition of primary antibodies. Double labeling of Vps24p and M6PR was carried out using mouse anti-FLAG (10 μg/ml final) and rabbit anti-rat ciM6PR followed by washing and addition of Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG at 5-8 μg/ml in 10% fetal calf serum-PBS. Coverslips were washed and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). In cells expressing GFP-Vps4E235Q, rabbit anti-M6PR was detected using Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Vps24-FLAG using Alexa 633 goat anti-mouse IgG. The labeled cells were viewed, and images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope or on a Nikon Eclipse fluorescent microscope.RESULTSIdentification of PtdIns(3,5)P2 Binding Proteins Using Phage Display—The affinity ligand (biotin-PtdIns(3,5)P2) (6, Fig. 1) was immobilized on NeutrAvidin beads. A T7Select10-3 adipocyte library was constructed that contained 2 × 106 independent phage. Phage selected at random from the un-amplified library all contained cDNA inserts over 200 base pairs in length.Following the first round of biopanning against the NeutrAvidin PtdIns(3,5)P2 beads, the titer of the eluted phage was 2 × 105. The eluted titer was 1.5 × 106 in the second round and 5 × 106 in the third, a 25-fold overall increase. This was an indicator of successful biopanning, because the enrichment of phage that bind the target molecule during early rounds usually results in increases in titer for recovered phage in later rounds (T7-Select manual, Novagen). Following the third round of biopanning, individual plaques were picked, and their cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR and then sequenced. Sequencing of 12 plaques revealed only two different cDNA inserts, indicating a highly specific enrichment from the initial library, potentially containing 2 × 106 different clones. Only one of the cDNA inserts is considered here, encoding for an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to 230 amino acids, in-frame with the T7-capsid protein (Fig. 2A). The ORF shared a high degree of sequence identity (30%) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps24p (Fig. 2B). S. cerevisiae Vps24p is a vacuolar protein-sorting protein of the class-E type (28Raymond C.K.

The sequence of mVps24p lacks any previously identified phosphoinositide binding domains. It is predicted to be a 223-amino acid (7Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D.

One noticeable feature is that the charge distribution of the protein is extremely biased, with the N-terminal half being very basic (pI = 10.2) and the C-terminal half being acidic (pI = 3.9).Fig. 2Sequence analysis of PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding phage.

https://openalex.org/W2087147260,"We have determined the crystal structure of a 154-residue intein derived from the dnaB gene of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 and refined it to a 2.0-A resolution. The x-ray structure suggests that this intein possesses two catalytic sites that appear to be separately responsible for splicing and cleavage of the N- and C-terminal scissile bonds. The conserved intein block F residues are the important components of a catalytic site for side chain cyclization of the last intein residue, Asn-154. The data suggest that the imidazole ring of His-143 is involved in the activation of the side chain Nδ atom of Asn-154, leading to a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of Asn-154. Substitution of His-143 with Ala or Gln resulted in the inhibition of C-terminal cleavage. His-153, Asp-136, and a water molecule appear to constitute an oxyanion binding site by contacting the carbonyl oxygen of Asn-154 to stabilize the transition state. The structure and mutagenesis data also support that the close contact between the hydroxyl groups of Thr-138 and Ser-155, whose side chain participates in an S → O acyl shift, plays an important role in the nucleophile orientation. Our structural modeling suggests that this catalytic module is conserved in the C-terminal subdomains of inteins from diverse organisms."

In this report, we demonstrate that canstatin inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt, focal adhesion kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E-binding protein-1, and ribosomal S6 kinase in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It also induces Fas ligand expression, activates procaspases 8 and 9 cleavage, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, and increases cell death (as determined by propidium iodide staining). Canstatin-induced activation of procaspases 8 and 9 as well as the induced reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability were attenuated by the forced expression of FLICE-inhibitory protein. Canstatin-induced procaspase 8 activation and cell death were also inhibited by a neutralizing anti-Fas antibody. Collectively, these data indicate that canstatin-induced apoptosis is associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt inhibition and is dependent upon signaling events transduced through membrane death receptors.

The isolated C-terminal globular non-collagenous (NC1) domains of several type IV collagen α chains, however, function as potent angiogenesis inhibitors.

In these xenograft models, tumors excised from canstatin-treated mice were less extensively infiltrated with CD31-staining cells than were control tumors. This reduced tumor vascularity and the fact that canstatin had no effect on tumor cell growth in vitro indicate that angiogenesis suppression is the dominant mechanism by which canstatin retards tumor growth. The 26-kDa NC1 domain of the type IV collagen α1 chain (known as arresten) also inhibits endothelial tube formation and migration in vitro (5Colorado P.C. Torre A. Kamphaus G. Maeshima Y. Hopfer H.

Although this angiostatic peptide binds to both melanoma and endothelial cells, its antiproliferative effects are restricted to EC. As with canstatin and arresten, tumstatin also has potent antitumor activity in vivo. Thus, the NC1 domains of at least three distinct type IV collagen α chains have documented angiostatic activity and, in this respect, seem to resemble the previously characterized angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin, a peptide derived from the NC1 domain of the α1 chain of type XVIII collagen (9Sudhakar A.

In addition to its suppressive effects on EC proliferation and tube formation, canstatin induces apoptosis in EC (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y.

FLIP is a structural homologue of procaspases 8 and 10, but unlike these proteases, FLIP lacks a critical cysteine at what would otherwise be the active site of a functional protease (12Tschopp J.

Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). FLIP is recruited in competition with procaspase 8 to the plasma membrane through an interaction between its death effector domain and that of the adaptor protein FADD. This recruitment is triggered by the multimerization of FADD, an event usually initiated by an interaction between the death domain of FADD and one of the TNF receptor family members (e.g. Fas, TRAIL death receptors 4 and 5) induced by the binding of Fas ligand or TRAIL to its respective receptor (15Hyer M.L.

Once complexed with FADD, FLIP interacts with TRAFs 1 and 2, receptor-interacting protein, and Raf to facilitate the activation of the NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (19Kataoka T.

Therefore, one would expect that the down-modulation of FLIP induced by exposure to canstatin would sensitize endothelial cells to apoptosis mediated through procaspase 8 activation. In our previous study, we provided no information on the mechanism by which canstatin down-modulates FLIP or data about whether its disappearance from endothelial cells contributed to the anti-angiogenic effects of canstatin. In this report, we demonstrate that canstatin inhibits the activation of Akt, a kinase previously shown to regulate FLIP levels in several cell types including EC (20Panka D.J. Mano T. Suhara T. Walsh K. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We also establish an unambiguous causal link between the loss of FLIP and the induction of apoptosis by canstatin. Cell Lines and Reagents—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in McCoy's 5A media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 μg/ml polymyxin B (to inhibit the effects of residual lipopolysaccharide in the canstatin preparations), and 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF, Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). The vinculin antibody used in our studies was purchased from Sigma. The pFAK-Tyr397 antibody and the anti-Fas antibody used in Western blots were purchased from Calbiochem. The rabbit anti-FasL, pp70s6k, caspase-8, and FLIP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Fas antibody (ZB4) used in the neutralization assays was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The pAkt (Ser473) antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences, and the procaspase 9, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-4E-BP1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The canstatin cDNA was provided by Raghu Kalluri (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Recombinant canstatin was produced and purified as reported previously (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Western Analyses—HUVEC were lysed in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, protease (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin), and phosphatase (NaF, Na3VO4, glycerophosphate, and Na4P2O7) inhibitors. Lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and the fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed first with rabbit or murine antibodies specific for the protein of interest and then with either a goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The blots were then treated with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film. The films were analyzed by densitometry with a Bio-Rad densitometer. Cytotoxicity and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assays—In these assays, adherent cells were detached by gentle trypsinization and combined with detached, floating cells. Propidium iodide (5 ng/ml), annexin V-FITC (5 μl), or 5 μg/ml BD Mitosensor reagent (BD Biosciences) were added to the cell pool, and the cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry with a BD Biosciences FACScan. Infection of HUVEC with FLIP-Tet Adenovirus—Cells were co-infected with the rTA adenovirus and an adenovirus into which the cDNA of the long isoform human FLIP had been inserted (obtained from Ken Walsh, Boston University Medical Center) (21Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), each at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced. The FLIP gene is regulated by doxycycline and readily induced by exposing infected cells to an antibiotic concentration of 300 ng/ml. Canstatin Inhibits the Phosphorylation of Akt and FAK and Induces Fas Ligand Expression in HUVEC—We demonstrated previously that cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to canstatin (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this effect was not explored in our earlier report, we did show that canstatin exposure was associated with the down-modulation of the anti-apoptotic protein FLIP. We and others have since shown that FLIP expression is determined primarily by the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in a variety of cell types including tumor and endothelial cells (20Panka D.J. Mano T. Suhara T. Walsh K. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that canstatin-induced FLIP down-modulation might be caused by PI3K/Akt inhibition. To test this hypothesis, HUVEC were first incubated for 4 h in culture medium containing no exogenous growth factor and only 5% serum to reduce background signaling. Canstatin (20 μg/ml) was then added to some of the cells, and 1 h later, the medium was replaced by fresh serum-supplemented (20%) medium containing ECGF (100 μg/ml) with or without canstatin (20 μg/ml). The cells were lysed at various time points, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blot for the phosphorylation of Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an integrin-associated kinase upstream of PI3K/Akt (22Chen H.C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of serum/ECGF resulted in a prompt increase in Akt phosphorylation. This effect was totally blocked by canstatin. The initial exposure to canstatin slightly increased FAK phosphorylation over background but completely blunted the subsequent response to ECGF. As reported previously, FLIP expression was suppressed in the canstatin-treated cells (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Exposure to canstatin modestly increased Fas expression in HUVEC and markedly enhanced that of Fas ligand, especially at the later time points tested. These data confirm that canstatin does indeed suppress Akt phosphorylation in HUVEC as proposed, and they suggest that the disruption of this signaling pathway may be responsible for the disappearance of FLIP, the induction of Fas ligand, and other events triggered by canstatin. Canstatin Inhibits the Phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70s6k—Many of the effects of Akt on cell growth, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression are mediated by the kinase mTOR and its effectors 4E-BP1 and p70s6k (23Jeffries H. Thomas G.B. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonnenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar, 24Dancey J.E. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 16: 1101-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether canstatin-induced inhibition of Akt affected the activity of these downstream targets, HUVEC were exposed first to canstatin as described above, and 1 h later, ECGF was added to the culture. The cells were then lysed and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, even the 1 h of exposure to canstatin that preceded the addition of ECGF (the zero time point) was sufficient to completely inhibit mTOR phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was also markedly attenuated with similar kinetics. Canstatin also completely blocked the phosphorylation of p70s6k (Fig. 2B), although this effect was not evident until 24 h. Role of FLIP, Fas, and Fas Ligand in Canstatin-induced Apoptosis—The observation that exposure to canstatin reduces FLIP levels and induces Fas ligand expression in HUVEC suggests that canstatin-induced apoptosis might be mediated through a death receptor (i.e. Fas)-dependent pathway (12Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 13Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K.

Immunol. 2001; 54: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether exposure to canstatin induced the cleavage of procaspase 8 and if this effect was blocked by forced expression of FLIP. In this experiment, HUVEC were first co-infected with an rTA adenovirus and one containing a doxycycline-inducible FLIP construct. Doxycycline (300 ng/ml) was then added to some of the cell cultures to induce FLIP expression (21Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were placed into culture in ECGF-containing medium in the presence or absence of canstatin (20 μg/ml), and after 48 h of incubation the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blot for procaspase 8 activation. As shown in Fig. 3A, the antibiotic augmented FLIP expression in the infected HUVEC. Exposure to canstatin resulted in procaspase 8 cleavage, suggesting that canstatin-induced apoptosis in HUVEC might indeed be mediated through Fas. Furthermore, procaspase 8 cleavage was evident in the absence of doxycycline but not in its presence, indicating that the process could be inhibited by FLIP. To determine whether the forced expression of FLIP was able to maintain the viability of canstatin-treated HUVEC, the adenovirus-infected HUVEC were cultured with or without doxycycline (300 ng/ml) for 24 h and then placed in medium containing ECGF (100 μg/ml) with or without canstatin (20 μg/ml) for 48 h, as described above. Spontaneously detached cells were combined with those removed by trypsinization and analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). As shown in Fig. 3B, exposure of the antibiotic-untreated HUVEC to canstatin doubled the number of PI-staining cells, whereas no increase in the number of PI-staining cells was observed in the antibiotic-pretreated HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 1, canstatin reduces FLIP expression and induces that of Fas ligand. To determine whether Fas-Fas ligand interactions might play a role in canstatin-induced activation of procaspase 8, HUVEC were placed in serum-supplemented medium containing canstatin with or without ECGF or a blocking anti-Fas antibody (ZB4, 1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Procaspase 8 activation was then assessed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4A, canstatin induced procaspase 8 cleavage independently of the presence of ECGF, and this cleavage was substantially blocked by the anti-Fas antibody. This anti-Fas antibody also reduced the number of PI-staining cells in both canstatin-treated and untreated cultures (Fig. 4B), implicating membrane Fas-Fas ligand interactions in both the spontaneous (background) apoptosis observed in HUVEC cultures and the augmented apoptosis induced by canstatin. Role of the Mitochondria in Canstatin-induced Apoptosis in HUVEC—To determine whether the mitochondria play a role in canstatin-induced apoptosis, HUVEC were first infected with the rTA and FLIP-tet adenoviruses as described above and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of doxycycline (300 ng/ml). The cells were then placed in medium containing ECGF (100 μg/ml) with or without canstatin (20 μg/ml) for 48 h. Spontaneously detached cells were combined with adherent cells removed by trypsinization, stained with the MitoSensor reagent, and analyzed by dual color flow cytometry for the presence of intramitochondrial dye aggregates (FL2-H) and intracytoplasmic monomers (FL1-H). Healthy cells with mitochondria that maintained a normal transmembrane potential (i.e. those with a high aggregate/monomer ratio) are depicted in the upper left quadrant of each panel in Fig. 5A, whereas those with lower ratios fall along a diagonal to the right. Cells with a high ratio appear more numerous in the lower two panels, which were generated with antibiotic-treated (FLIP-expressing) HUVEC than in the upper panels, which were generated with untreated HUVEC. In the absence of FLIP, canstatin exposure resulted in a thinning of this population, with an accumulation of the cells along a diagonal (cells with a lower aggregate/monomer ratio), whereas no such shift was observed in the doxycycline-treated cells. Exposure to canstatin reduced the mean aggregate/monomer ratio from 43 to 36 in HUVEC not treated with doxycycline but only from 43 to 42 in cells pretreated with the antibiotic. These data indicate that exposure of HUVEC to canstatin does reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and that this effect is blocked by forced expression of FLIP. A reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential is associated with the release of several mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator, and apoptosis-inducing factor, all of which participate in apoptosis (25Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar, 26Daugas E. Nochy D. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 27Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c released from the mitochondria binds to the adaptor protein Apaf-1, which activates procaspase 9. To determine whether the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by canstatin results in procaspase 9 activation, adenovirus-infected HUVEC, some of which had been pretreated with doxycycline to induce FLIP expression, were exposed to canstatin, and procaspase 9 cleavage was then assessed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5B, exposure to canstatin results in increased procaspase 9 cleavage, an effect nearly completely inhibited by forced FLIP expression. These data show that the Fas-dependent apoptotic signaling events triggered by canstatin are amplified in the mitochondria. Canstatin is a recently discovered, endogenously produced angiostatic peptide derived from the NC1 domain of the α2 chain of type IV collagen (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In our initial description of this novel inhibitor, we demonstrated that recombinant canstatin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro and suppressed the growth and vascularization of human tumor xenografts (4Kamphaus G.D. Colorado P.C. Panka D.J. Hopfer H. Ramchandran R. Torre A. Maeshima Y. Mier J.W. Sukhatme V.P. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1209-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We also showed that canstatin induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and reduced the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein FLIP but provided no additional information on the mechanism of FLIP down-modulation or its biological significance. In this report, we show that the disappearance of FLIP induced by canstatin is associated with reduced activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. We also demonstrate that FLIP down-modulation plays an essential permissive role in canstatin-induced apoptosis. The mechanism by which canstatin inhibits Akt activation in EC is unclear, but it may involve the disruption of signaling downstream of FAK, as has been proposed for endostatin (28Dixelius J. Croos M. Matsumoto T. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1944-1947PubMed Google Scholar) and tumstatin (29Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R. Science. 2002; 295: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, canstatin modestly increases basal FAK phosphorylation but completely blunts the inductive effect of ECGF. Similar results have been reported with endostatin, which increases basal FAK phosphorylation but inhibits the increase that would otherwise be induced by fibroblast growth factor (28Dixelius J. Croos M. Matsumoto T. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1944-1947PubMed Google Scholar). When recruited to the cytoplasmic domains of integrins clustered at focal adhesions, FAK directly interacts with the SH2 and SH3 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and activates Akt (22Chen H.C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). It is possible that canstatin interferes with some aspect of either integrin-dependent adhesion or downstream signaling. Tumstatin inhibits FAK activation by directly binding to the endothelial integrin αvβ3 (9Sudhakar A. Sugimoto H. Yang C. Lively J. Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 29Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23745-23750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is possible that canstatin functions similarly, although the binding of canstatin to an integrin has not yet been demonstrated. In addition to its transcriptional regulation by Akt, FLIP is also subject to post-transcriptional regulation. FLIP is rapidly degraded in the proteasome in response to such diverse stimuli as p53 activation (31Fukazawa T. Fujiwara T. Uno F. Teraishi F. Kadowaki Y. Itoshima T. Takata Y. Kagawa S. Roth J.A. Tschopp J. Tanaka N. Oncogene. 2001; 37: 5225-5231Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or exposure to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligands (32Kim Y. Suh N. Sporn M. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22320-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because of its rapid turnover, protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide markedly reduce FLIP levels (33Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14924-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The rapamycin analogue CCI-779, which inhibits protein synthesis by specifically blocking the Akt target mTOR (24Dancey J.E. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 16: 1101-1114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), has similar effects. 2D. J. Panka and J. W. Mier, unpublished observation. Tumstatin has been shown to inhibit Akt and mTOR, resulting in a decline in overall protein synthesis (29Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R. Science. 2002; 295: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In fact, this phenomenon has been invoked as an explanation for its angiostatic effects. Our data demonstrating that canstatin completely inhibits mTOR and its downstream targets 4E-BP1 and p70s6k suggest that canstatin may function in a similar manner. Therefore, it is likely that the nearly complete disappearance of FLIP from endothelial cells exposed to canstatin is caused by both reduced gene expression as a result of Akt inhibition and reduced FLIP protein synthesis due to mTOR inhibition. The activation of procaspase 8 induced in HUVEC by canstatin is associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of procaspase 9. This amplification is usually mediated through the cleavage of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3-domain-only Bcl-2 family member Bid, which, once cleaved, triggers the oligomerization of Bak or Bax and the release of mitochondrial proteins (34Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). Although we have been unable to detect Bid in HUVEC (data not shown), recent studies have indicated that this protein is not absolutely essential for apoptosis in response to procaspase 8 activation. Kandasamy et al. (35Kandasamy K. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E.S. Thompson C.B. Korsemeyer S.J. Bryant J.L. Srivastava R.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1712-1721PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that TRAIL induces apoptosis and the release from the mitochondria of cytochrome c (but not second mitochondria-derived activator) in Bid–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts as long as either Bak or Bax were present. Thus, canstatin seems to be able to reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and activate procaspase 9 in HUVEC despite limited Bid expression. The mechanism by which canstatin activates procaspase 8 and initiates an apoptotic signaling cascade is unclear. Stupack et al. (36Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the proenzyme is directly recruited to the cytoplasmic domains of unoccupied integrins and activated there in a manner similar to that induced by the multimerization of FADD. It is conceivable that canstatin functions by uncoupling endothelial integrins from the underlying matrix, as has been proposed for tumstatin and endostatin (9Sudhakar A. Sugimoto H. Yang C. Lively J. Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and that procaspase 8 is subsequently recruited to these unoccupied integrins and activated. Such a model, however, would not explain the ability of FLIP to block canstatin-induced procaspase 8 activation without invoking the prospect that FLIP might be similarly recruited to integrins. This model would also fail to explain the Fas dependence of canstatin- or disadhesion-induced apoptosis (i.e. anoikis) (37Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) unless one proposes that the initial procaspase 8 activation triggered by unoccupied integrins is later amplified by membrane Fas-Fas ligand interactions. Although our data do not exclude a contribution of integrin-mediated procaspase 8 activation, they indicate that Akt inhibition with the induction of Fas ligand, the down-modulation of FLIP, and the resulting interactions between Fas ligand and Fas at the cell membrane are the primary determinants of canstatin-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2006044886,"The G protein-coupled sst2 somatostatin receptor is a critical negative regulator of cell proliferation. sstII prevents growth factor-induced cell proliferation through activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 leading to induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. Here, we investigate the signaling molecules linking sst2 to p27Kip1. In Chinese hamster ovary-DG-44 cells stably expressing sst2 (CHO/sst2), the somatostatin analogue RC-160 transiently stimulates ERK2 activity and potentiates insulin-stimulated ERK2 activity. RC-160 also stimulates ERK2 activity in pancreatic acini isolated from normal mice, which endogenously express sst2, but has no effect in pancreatic acini derived from sst2 knock-out mice. RC-160-induced p27Kip1 up-regulation and inhibition of insulin-dependent cell proliferation are both prevented by pretreatment of CHO/sst2 cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. In addition, using dominant negative mutants, we show that sst2-mediated ERK2 stimulation is dependent on the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o protein, the tyrosine kinase Src, both small G proteins Ras and Rap1, and the MEK kinase B-Raf but is independent of Raf-1. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and both tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, are required upstream of Ras and Rap1. Taken together, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby a Gi/o protein-coupled receptor inhibits cell proliferation by stimulating ERK signaling via a SHP-1-SHP-2-PI3K/Ras-Rap1/B-Raf/MEK pathway.

Somatostatin is a widely distributed peptide that plays an important inhibitory role in several biological processes, including neurotransmission, exocrine and endocrine secretions, and cell proliferation. Somatostatin acts via a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase or ERK kinase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PTX, Bordetella pertusis toxin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; MEM, minimum essential medium; DN, dominant negative; RBD, Ras or Rap1 binding domain; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MBP, myelin basic protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. (sst1–sst5) that are variably expressed throughout numerous tissues ranging from the central nervous system to the endocrine and immune systems (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Somatostatin receptors regulate diverse signal transduction pathways such as adenylyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase inhibition, phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 stimulation, tyrosine phosphatase activation, or ionic conductance channels modulation (2Meyerhof W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 133: 55-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Somatostatin or its analogues promote growth inhibition of various normal and tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Somatostatin antiproliferative action results from inhibition of trophic or growth factors synthesis and/or secretion, or from inactivation of their related intracellular pathways (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 3Pollak M.N. Schally A.V. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Among the five somatostatin receptors, sst2 has been found to play a critical role in the negative control of normal and tumor cell growth and to act as a tumor suppressor gene for pancreatic cancer (4Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. AM O.C. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Benali N. Cordelier P. Calise D. Pages P. Rochaix P. Nagy A. Esteve J.P. Pour P.M. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9180-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways coupling sst2 receptor to cell growth inhibition have not been fully elucidated. Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-DG44 cells stably expressing sst2 (CHO/sst2), we have demonstrated that the somatostatin analogue, RC-160, promotes G1 cell cycle arrest of insulin-treated cells by a mechanism involving the stimulation of a tyrosine phosphatase we identified as SHP-1, and consequent up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p27Kip1 (6Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P. Schally A.V. Tkaczuk J. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Activation of the extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is generally related to growth promoting actions of growth factors, cytokines, and ligands for GPCR receptors (7Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, differentiation or growth inhibition may also be a consequence of ERK1/2 activation. For instance, nerve growth factor (NGF)- and hepatocyte growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 has been shown to result in NIH3T3 and HepG2 cell cycle arrest, respectively (8Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Activation of the cAMP pathway was reported to induce PC12 cell differentiation through sustained ERK1 activation (10Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β can block the proliferation of different cell lines through a rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2 (11Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological outcome of ERK1/2 activation is dependent on cell types, extracellular factors, and their receptors. ERK1/2 are serine/threonine protein kinases activated upon dual phosphorylation by the MAPK kinases (MAPKK) MEK1/2, which are themselves activated following phosphorylation by the MAPKK kinases of the Raf family. Raf kinases are activated after their interaction with the GTP-bound and, hence, active form of the proto-oncogene Ras. Once associated with the active form of Ras, Raf kinases translocate from the cytosol to the membrane and are activated by a complex multistep process yet incompletely elucidated (12Dhillon A.S. Kolch W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Raf kinases have also been described as a point of convergence of other receptor-triggered signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or protein kinase C pathway (13Sun H. King A.J. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Paruchuri S. Hallberg B. Juhas M. Larsson C. Sjolander A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). Although Raf-1 is generally considered as the classic upstream activator of MEK1/2, a novel pathway has been recently described. This pathway involves the activation of B-Raf, another member of the Raf family kinases, by the Ras-like small GTPase Rap1 (15Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Rap1 possesses an effector domain similar to that of Ras, indicating that both small GTPases might share common downstream effectors (16Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Rap1 can antagonize Ras-dependent ERK1/2 signaling by interacting with Raf-1 cystein-rich domain and preventing its activation (17Okada T. Hu C.D. Jin T.G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6057-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, Rap1 activation can also lead to ERK1/2 phosphorylation via B-Raf. For instance, activation of the Rap1-B-Raf cascade has been found to be involved in Ras-independent activation of ERK1/2 by cAMP and to cooperate with Ras in inducing ERK1/2 activation in response to NGF in PC12 cells (18Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 19York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 pathway is also elicited by somatostatin receptor activation, but its modulation and the biological outcome of its activation differ according to the receptor subtypes and the cellular environment. Indeed, when expressed in CHO-K1 cells, sst1 and sst4 activate the ERK1/2 pathway. However, sustained induction of ERK1/2 by sst4 leads to Ras-independent cell proliferation, whereas sst1 inhibits cell growth through Ras- and Raf-1-dependent transient activation of ERK1/2 (20Sellers L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24280-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Florio T. Yao H. Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Stork P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Conversely, sst5-mediated cell growth inhibition requires ERK inhibition, which is mediated by guanylyl cyclase and consequent cGMP-dependent protein kinase inactivation (22Cordelier P. Esteve J.P. Bousquet C. Delesque N. O'Carroll A.M. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9343-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The role of the ERK1/2 pathway in sst2-mediated cell growth inhibition and the mechanisms involved are not well established. In human SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, sst2-mediated inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation is associated with an inhibition of PDGF-induced cell proliferation, whereas in human U343 glioma cells, stimulation of sst2 only slightly affects epidermal growth factor (EGF)-promoted cell proliferation despite a strong inhibition of EGF-dependent ERK1/2 hyperphosphorylation (23Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Held-Feindt J. Forstreuter F. Pufe T. Mentlein R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In CHO-K1 cells expressing sst2, although somatostatin mediates a sustained activation of ERK1/2, CKI p21Cip1 induction was detected only following stimulation of both ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK (p38) phosphorylation, suggesting that ERK1/2 activation alone is necessary but not sufficient to mediate sst2 antiproliferative function (25Sellers L.A. Alderton F. Carruthers A.M. Schindler M. Humphrey P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5974-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of ERK1/2 pathway in sst2-mediated inhibition of mitogenic insulin signaling in CHO/sst2 cells. We show that sst2-mediated cell growth inhibition is a consequence of a strong and transient stimulation of ERK2 activity. In addition, the intracellular events leading to sst2-mediated ERK2 activation were identified. sst2-mediated ERK2 activation is dependent on a Ras-Rap1/B-Raf/MEK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, PI3K, SHP-1 and SHP-2 are required upstream of Ras and Rap1. Materials—The somatostatin analogue RC-160 was a generous gift from A. V. Schally (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA).

Cell Culture and Growth Assay—Chinese hamster ovary DG-44 (CHO) cells stably expressing sst2 (CHO/sst2) (6Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P. Schally A.V. Tkaczuk J. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), were routinely grown in αMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and Geneticin (400 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a water-saturated 10% CO2 atmosphere. For treatment, cells were plated in dishes of 100-mm diameter (8 × 105 cells/dish), grown for 24 h, and Geneticin- and serum-starved in αMEM for 18 h before inhibitor and/or peptide addition. All inhibitors were added 30 min prior to treatment except PTX (18 h). Control incubations were carried out to ensure that the vehicles (dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol), concentrated at less than 0.1%, had no side effect. For growth assay, cells were plated in six-well dishes (11 × 104 cells/dish). After a 7-h attachment phase, cells were serum-starved for 18 h to induce quiescence and then cultured for 24 h in αMEM alone or containing 10 nm insulin in the presence or absence of 1 nm RC-160. Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells with a Coulter counter model Z1 (Coulter Electronics) as described previously (4Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. AM O.C. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Animals—sst2 knock-out C57BL/129 mice (sst2 KO) were provided from J. M. Schaeffer (Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ) (26Zheng H. Bailey A. Jiang M.H. Honda K. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M.E. Van der Ploeg L.H. Schaeffer J.M. Leng G. Smith R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Corresponding wild-type mice (sst2 WT) were used as control. C57BL6-mev /mev (mev) mice were obtained by mating heterozygous C57BL6-mev /+ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) breeding pairs. Homozygous mev were screened by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction as described previously (27Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Mev were identifiable by 10 days of age, owing to the moth-eaten appearance of the skin. Preparation of Mouse Pancreatic Acini—sst2 KO or sst2 WT mice and mev mice or their unaffected littermates were sacrificed at 2 weeks of age, and pancreases were removed. Pancreatic acini were prepared using an oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.15 mg/ml collagenase, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, as described previously (6Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P. Schally A.V. Tkaczuk J. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After washing in the oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer, acinar cells were incubated, in the same buffer, in the presence or absence of inhibitors and/or RC-160 at 25 °C under gentle shaking, and then solubilized. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were used for immunoblotting as described below. Plasmids and Transfection—The plasmids encoding the dominant negative (DN) Ras mutant (pcDNA3/N17Ras), the activated Ras mutant (pcDNA3/V12Ras), the HA-tagged DN B-Raf mutant (pcDNA3/HA-NB-Raf) corresponding to the N-terminal region of quail B-raf (residues 1–443) or the pGEX plasmid for bacterial expression of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of RalGDS-Rap1 binding domain (GST-RalGDS-RBD) were described previously (28Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the Raf-1 minimal Ras binding domain fused to GST (GST-Raf-1-RBD) was a kind gift of F. R. McKenzie (Institute of Signaling, Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, Nice, France). The DN Rap1A mutant (pCEP4/N17Rap1) was generously provided by L. A. Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). The expression vector pUSEamp and that incorporating the kinase-inactive Src (K297R) mutant (pUSE/Src(K/R)) were from Upstate Biotechnology and were kindly donated by Dr. T. Florio (Advanced Biotechnology Center, Genova, Italy). The HA-tagged DN Raf-1 mutant (pcDNA3/HA-N-Raf-1), corresponding to the N-terminal region of human Raf-1 (residues 1–257) was obtained by subcloning the EcoRI-BstBI fragments of the HA-tagged wild-type Raf-1 into EcoRI-ClaI sites of pKS and inserting the EcoRI-ApaI fragments of pKS/N-Raf-1 back into EcoRI-ApaI sites of HA-pcDNA3. The catalytically inactive murine SHP-1 (C453S) mutant (pcDNA3/SHP-1(C/S)) was provided by M. L. Thomas (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and the catalytically inactive human SHP-2 (C459S) mutant (pcDNA3/SHP-2(C/S)) was provided by C. Nahmias (Institut Cochin de Génétique Moléculaire, Paris, France). The c-Myc-tagged version of the SHP-2 (C459S) mutant (pcDNA3/c-Myc-SHP-2(C/S)) was obtained by inserting a double-stranded c-Myc tag oligonucleotide into XmnI-EcoRI sites at the C-terminal end. For transient transfections, CHO/sst2 cells were grown to 50–60% confluency in dishes of 100-mm diameter in complete αMEM and transfected with 3–10 μg of the desired cDNAs using FuGENE 6 reagent as specified by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were then incubated for 24 h in complete medium before serum deprivation and treatment. Transient expression of proteins was confirmed 48 h post-transfection by immunoblot analysis as described below. Cells transfected with the appropriate empty vectors were used as control. Transfection efficiencies were determined by transfection of a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein in CHO cells. Expression was detected by fluorescence microscopy (image-analysis system Visio-Lab 2000, Biocom) and was observed in ∼34% of cells. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm leupeptin). Soluble lysates were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein content was measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were either dissolved in 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C for immunoblot analysis or submitted to immunoprecipitation. Protein immunoprecipitation from cell lysates was performed using specific antibodies (1 μg/sample) pre-coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, immunocomplexes were washed three times in HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The pellets were resuspended in HNTG buffer (in a total volume of 40 μl) and then either dissolved in 4× sample buffer for immunoblotting or utilized for kinase assays as described below. Immunocomplexes or total cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Life Sciences). Membranes were then subjected to immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) as described previously (6Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P.

Peroxidase activity was revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce). Quantitative analyses were carried out by using a Biocom apparatus. ERK and Raf Kinase Assays—Kinase activities were assayed using immunoprecipitated ERK2, Raf-1, or B-Raf, [γ-33P]ATP as a phosphate donor, and myelin basic protein (MBP) or a recombinant full-length MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as substrates. Kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 25 °C, under gentle shaking, by adding 10 μl of either 5× ERK buffer (50 mm magnesium acetate, 25 μm dithiothreitol (DTT), 25 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP/sample and 7.5 μg of MBP/sample, in HNTG buffer) or 5× Raf kinase buffer (50 mm magnesium acetate, 500 μm DTT, 100 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP/sample and 0.5 μg MEK1/sample, in HNTG buffer), to the 40 μl of immunoprecipitates. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Radiolabeled MBP or MEK1 were separated from the immunocomplexes by 10% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In all cases, immunoblots against ERK2, Raf-1, or B-Raf were performed for standardization. Ras and Rap1 Activation Assays—Raf-1-RBD or RalGDS-RBD GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3)) by induction with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 30 °C. Expressed fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads following bacterial lysis by sonication in TENGN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). GST-Raf-1-RBD or GST-RalGDS-RBD were then used to pull down activated Ras (Ras-GTP) or activated Rap1 (Rap1-GTP), respectively, using a protocol adapted from that of de Rooij and Bos (29de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in either Ras lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), or Rap1 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μm leupeptin). Equal amounts of soluble lysates were mixed with 30 μg of GST fusion protein pre-coupled to agarose beads per sample. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, beads were pelleted, washed twice with Ras or Rap1 lysis buffer, resuspended in 4× sample buffer, and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Precipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The amount of Ras-GTP or Rap1-GTP was determined by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies, as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test. p values < 0.05 indicate a statistically significant difference. RC-160 Induces a Rapid and Transient Activation of ERK2 in CHO/sst2 Cells—We first examined the action of RC-160, a stable analogue of somatostatin, on ERK2 activity in CHO cells stably expressing sst2. These cells have been widely characterized and used as model systems for the study of somatostatin signaling via the sst2 receptor (4Buscail L. Esteve J.P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. AM O.C. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Pages P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.P.

ERK2 activity was assessed by using an in vitro kinase assay, with MBP serving as a substrate, after immunoprecipitation of endogenous ERK2 from treated cells lysates. Treatment of CHO/sst2 cells with 1 nm RC-160 induced a time-dependent increase in ERK2 activity (Fig. 1A). An increment in ERK2 activity became apparent 3 min after RC-160 treatment, reached a maximum after 5 min (667 ± 119%), persisted up to 10 min, and rapidly decreased to basal levels thereafter. In contrast, RC-160 had no effect on ERK2 activity in wild-type CHO cells (data not shown). Previous reports demonstrated that sst2 and sst4 can also trigger a strong and sustained activation of p38 (30Alderton F. Humphrey P.P. Sellers L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether p38 activation was also affected by somatostatin in our cellular model, RC-160-treated CHO/sst2 cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody specific to the phosphorylated, and hence activated, form of p38. As shown in Fig. 1B (left panel), RC-160 had no effect on p38 activation throughout the entire time course. The anti-phospho-p38 antibodies specificity was confirmed on total cell extracts from C-6 glioma cells treated or not with p38 activator anisomycin (Fig. 1B, right panel). These results support a model in which RC-160 induces sst2-mediated rapid and transient increase in ERK2 activity but does not influence p38 activation. RC-160 Potentiates Insulin-stimulated ERK2 Activation in CHO/sst2 Cells—It is well known that insulin can induce ERK1/2 activation (31Ceresa B.P. Horvath C.M. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Exposure of CHO/sst2 cells, which express endogenous insulin receptors, to 10 nm insulin actually stimulates ERK2 activity (data not shown). Nevertheless, although RC-160-mediated ERK2 activity was monophasic (Fig. 1A), insulin-induced ERK2 activity exhibited a biphasic pattern. A transient increase in ERK2 activity peaking at 5 min was observed (588 ± 54% of control, data not shown), but at later time points, ERK2 activity was still found to be significantly elevated after 4 h of insulin treatment (352 ± 69% of control, data not shown). We next examined the action of RC-160 on insulin-stimulated ERK2 activity. Incubation of CHO/sst2 cells with RC-160 or insulin alone for 5 min similarly increased ERK2 activity (5-fold) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the level of ERK2 activity induced by RC-160 in the presence of insulin was greater than the sum of that obtained with each peptide alone (13-fold). However, RC-160 did not affect insulin-mediated increase in ERK2 activity after a 3-h co-treatment (data not shown). Similar results were obtained using a monoclonal antibody specific to active phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms (Fig. 1D), thus validating the use of this antibody to monitor ERK2 activity. Furthermore, a pretreatment of CHO/sst2 cells with the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) completely abolished RC-160-induced ERK2 activation (Fig. 1E) as well as potentiation of insulin-stimulated ERK2 activation (data not shown), indicating that RC-160 effects are MEK1/2-dependent.

https://openalex.org/W2089323144,"During the mating process of yeast cells, two Ca2+ influx pathways become activated. The resulting elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ activates downstream signaling factors that promote long term survival of unmated cells, but the roles of Ca2+ in conjugation have not been described. The high affinity Ca2+ influx system is composed of Cch1p and Mid1p and sensitive to feedback inhibition by calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase. To identify components and regulators of the low affinity Ca2+ influx system (LACS), we screened a collection of pheromone-responsive genes that when deleted lead to defects in LACS activity but not high affinity Ca2+ influx system activity. Numerous factors implicated in polarized morphogenesis and cell fusion (Fus1p, Fus2p, Rvs161p, Bni1p, Spa2p, and Pea2p) were found to be necessary for LACS activity. Each of these factors was also required for activation of the cell integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during the response to α-factor. Interestingly a polytopic plasma membrane protein, Fig1p, was required for LACS activity but not required for activation of Mpk1p mitogen-activated protein kinase. Mpk1p was not required for LACS activity, suggesting Mpk1p and Fig1p define two independent branches in the pheromone response pathways. Fig1p-deficient mutants exhibit defects in the cell-cell fusion step of mating, but unlike other fus1 and fus2 mutants the fusion defect of fig1 mutants can be largely suppressed by high Ca2+ conditions, which bypass the requirement for LACS. These findings suggest Fig1p is an important component or regulator of LACS and provide the first evidence for a role of Ca2+ signals in the cell fusion step of mating.

These findings suggest Fig1p is an important component or regulator of LACS and provide the first evidence for a role of Ca2+ signals in the cell fusion step of mating. Ca2+ ions are ubiquitously used by eukaryotic cells to signal information about their environment and physiological state as well as to regulate cellular processes. In most unstimulated cells, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] c) are typically maintained at low levels (∼100 nm) by the activity of pumps and transporters in both the plasma membrane and internal compartments. When combined with the stimulus-dependent opening of Ca2+ channels in these compartments, increases in [Ca2+] c can be generated with diverse spatial and temporal dynamics and decoded by cellular factors to control such processes as initiation of transcription, alterations in cell shape, hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, and membrane fusion. For example, binding of glycoprotein ligands to receptors on sperm leads to activation of T-type and TRPC-type Ca2+ channels, which elevate [Ca2+] c and trigger fusion of the acrosome with the plasma membrane to promote penetration of the egg extracellular matrix and fertilization (1Darszon A.

Haploid cells of each mating type (a- and α-cells) can differentiate into gametes and fuse pairwise to produce a diploid zygote (a/α-cells) capable of vegetative growth and meiosis. Haploid cells secrete peptide pheromones (a- and α-factor) that evoke a series of mating responses in cells of the opposite mating type. The earliest responses include induction of mating-specific genes and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Responsive cells can repolarize in a gradient of pheromones and eventually remodel the cell wall and extend a mating projection from the cell body toward the source. Increased rates of Ca2+ influx and elevated [Ca2+] c occur at about the same time as projection formation, beginning ∼45 min after exposure to pheromones (5Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13391-13399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10482-10486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Until now, these Ca2+ signals had no known roles in the conjugation process, although they are known to have essential roles in maintaining the viability of unmated cells during prolonged responses to pheromones (5Iida H.

A high affinity Ca2+ influx system (HACS) 1The abbreviations used are: HACS, high affinity Ca2+ influx system; LACS, low affinity Ca2+ influx system; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SC, synthetic complete; YPD, yeast extract peptone.1The abbreviations used are: HACS, high affinity Ca2+ influx system; LACS, low affinity Ca2+ influx system; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; SC, synthetic complete; YPD, yeast extract peptone. composed at least of Mid1p and Cch1p can be stimulated in the absence of pheromones upon the activation of the transcription factor Ste12p (7Iida H.

Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cch1p is homologous to the catalytic subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in animals, and Mid1p appears to function as a regulatory subunit in yeast (14Bonilla M. Nastase K.K. Cunningham K.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), although Mid1p can stimulate unidentified mechanosensitive channels when expressed in vertebrate cell lines (15Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In minimal medium, HACS is primarily responsible for generating Ca2+ signals during pheromone response. But in rich media, HACS is almost undetectable due to feedback inhibition by calcineurin, and a novel low affinity Ca2+ influx system (LACS) is strongly stimulated in response to pheromones (10Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bonilla, M., and Cunningham, K. W. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Except for Cch1p and Yvc1p, a vacuolar Ca2+ channel not involved in Ca2+ influx (17Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 18Palmer C.P.

This study identifies the first regulator or membrane component of LACS that is not required for activation of the cell integrity MAP kinase Mpk1p. The signal transduction cascades activated by mating pheromones have been characterized thoroughly. Binding of pheromones to serpentine receptors stimulates a heterotrimeric G-protein in which the Gβγ subunits activate a small Rho-type GTPase (Cdc42p), a p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) kinase homologue (Ste20p), and a scaffolded MAP kinase signaling module (Ste5p, Ste11p, Ste7p, and the MAP kinases Kss1p and Fus3p) (19Sprague Jr., G.F.

The MAP kinases phosphorylate the transcription factor Ste12p and two of its negative regulators Dig1p and Dig2p to stimulate expression of mating-specific genes (22Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Kron S.J.

Fus3p also phosphorylates and stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1p, which causes cell cycle arrest in G1 via direct inhibition of Cdc28p (22Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Kron S.J.

Far1p also participates in the polarized growth of the mating projection by scaffolding both the Gβγ subunits of the trimeric G-protein and the Cdc24p, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p (27Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Butty A.C. Pryciak P.M. Huang L.S. Herskowitz I. Peter M.

These events are thought to supply positional cues necessary for sensing a pheromone gradient. In addition to Far1p, several other proteins are delivered to the tip of the mating projection and are required for polarity establishment, cell fusion, and/or nuclear fusion. These proteins include a formin homologue Bni1p and its interacting proteins Spa2p and Pea2p, which regulate both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton and serve to locally organize multiple signaling proteins (30Valtz N.

Other participants in these events include Fus1p, a single pass transmembrane protein, which facilitates the localization of prezygotic vesicles thought to contain cell wall hydrolytic enzymes, plus Fus2p and Rvs161p, which interact with each other and also promote efficient removal of intervening cell wall material between mating pairs (36Trueheart J.

Here we screened for mutants deficient in LACS but not HACS and identified many of the factors involved in polarity establishment, projection formation, and cell fusion listed above. This screen also identified Fig1p, a pheromone-inducible plasma membrane protein with four predicted transmembrane helices (40Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Unlike the other mutants, fig1 mutants possess a cell fusion defect that can be suppressed by increasing Ca2+ in the medium to levels that increase [Ca2+] c independently of LACS. Although Fig1p does not resemble any known Ca2+ channels, we propose that it functions as a novel membrane subunit or regulator of LACS. Media, Yeast Strains, and Plasmids—Synthetic complete (SC) and complex (YPD) media were prepared and supplemented with 2% glucose as described previously (41Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) using reagents from Difco Inc. and Sigma. Synthetic growth media lacking calcium were prepared similarly using calcium-free yeast nitrogen base reagents (Bio 101 Inc.) and Noble agar (Difco Inc.). The α-factor mating pheromone was obtained from U.S. Biologicals. All yeast strains used in this study were derived from wild type yeast strains BY4741, BY4742, and W303-1A (42Brachmann C.B.

First FIG1 plus 500 base pairs upstream and downstream of the gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of yeast strain Y800 (46Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; : 1077-1105Google Scholar) using primers 5′-ATAGGATCCTGAACTGGTTGATA TTATTACTGG and 5′-ATAGTCGACGATTTCTGGATAGGGGTTATAATTAGCTTG, and then the product was subcloned into low dosage plasmid pRS315 (47Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after digestion with BamHI plus SalI to yield plasmid pSE98. A similar PCR product amplified from the FIG1-MYC yeast strain YSE218 was subcloned into pSE98 after digestion with HindIII plus SalI to yield plasmid pSE250. DNA corresponding to three repeats of the Myc epitope tag (63 amino acids in total length) was inserted just prior to the stop codon in the wild type FIG1 gene by a pop-in/pop-out strategy (48Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) using strain Y800. Primers used to amplify DNA corresponding to the epitope tag and selectable marker were 5′-TGTGCCCAAAATAGG TACAATAACTACTCTTCGGATTCATCTACATTGCATTCCAAAGTTAGGGAACAAAAGCTGG and 5′-AAAAATTGACATTCTGAAATATCCGCTCAAAACTTATATGTTTATTT GAGGATAAAACTACTATAGGGCGAATTGG. Both plasmids fully complemented the defective cell fusion and Ca2+ influx phenotypes of fig1 mutants. 45Ca2 + Accumulation Assays—Accumulation of 45Ca2+ into yeast cells growing in YPD media was measured as described previously (49Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In a standard experiment, log-phase cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium with tracer amounts of 45CaCl2 (Amersham Biosciences), and aliquots were treated with 20 μm α-factor with or without 1 μm FK506 for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by filtration onto GFF filters (Whatman), washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (5 mm Na-HEPES at pH 6.5, 10 mm CaCl2), dried, and processed for liquid scintillation counting. The specific activity of the culture medium was determined in each experiment and used to convert cpm into nmol of Ca2+. Cell number was determined by measurements of optical density at 600 nm (OD600). Screen data were obtained with 45Ca2+ accumulation assays performed in six batches on a total of 204 different gene knockout mutants in the BY4741 strain background (see Supplemental Table I). LACS and HACS activities were estimated for each strain by simply subtracting background Ca2+ accumulation (in the absence of α-factor treatment) from total Ca2+ accumulation in the presence of α-factor and subtracting background plus LACS from total Ca2+ accumulation in the presence of α-factor and FK506. To identify LACS-deficient mutants, the logarithm of the LACS/HACS ratio was determined, and then a Z-score representing the number of standard deviations away from the mean was calculated by subtracting the population mean and dividing the difference by the standard deviation of the population. Z-scores were determined separately for each of the six batches. Eleven mutants were found to have log ratios significantly lower than the mean (Z-score less than –2.0) and were analyzed in greater detail. β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast strains carrying MPK1-LacZ were grown at 30 °C in SC minus uracil medium to log phase, harvested, and resuspended in fresh SC minus uracil medium, supplemented with 20 μm α-factor, and shaken for2hat30 °Cin 24-well flat-bottomed dishes. β-Galactosidase assays were performed at room temperature using chloroform/SDS-permeabilized cells and colorimetric substrate as described previously (50Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Aequorin Luminescence Assays—Cells were grown to log phase in SC media lacking leucine, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in fresh medium at an OD600 of 10, and loaded with 25 μg/ml coelenterazine (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature. Loaded cells were raised in YPD to an OD600 of 0.250 and treated with 20 μm α-factor. Luminescence was monitored in a LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Wallac) and expressed as relative luminescence units. This procedure resulted in equivalent loading of different strains as judged by measuring total relative luminescence units after cell lysis with digitonin. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown overnight into log phase in SC-Leu media. Fixation was carried out in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) plus 4% formaldehyde in SC-Leu media for 1 h, then harvested, and reraised in 100 mm potassium phosphate plus 4% formaldehyde without media overnight. Spheroplasts were made by digesting cells with 45 μg/ml zymolase-100T for 30 min at room temperature in 1 ml of SHA buffer (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm sodium azide, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol), permeabilized with 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature in SHA buffer, washed twice with 1 ml of SHA buffer, and adhered to glass coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine. Coverslips with cells were blocked with WT buffer (0.5 mg/ml IgG-free bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm sodium azide) for 15 min and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the Myc epitope (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in WT buffer for 1 h. Coverslips were washed five times with WT buffer and incubated for 45 min with donkey anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with the fluor Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes), washed an additional five times with WT buffer, and mounted on standard glass microscope slides with 0.1% antifade (DABCO) in 90% glycerol. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with 100× objective after excitation at 488 nm. Images were acquired and deconvolved by the Applied Precision Deltavision algorithm for 15 iterations in conservative mode. Western Blots—Cells were grown to log phase in SC media lacking leucine, harvested, and extracted for membrane proteins as described previously (51Katzmann D.J. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2998-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1 OD600 unit of log-phase cells pretreated for the indicated time at 30 °C with 20 μm α-factor was lysed in breaking buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6)) with glass beads by vortexing at high speed for 30 s followed by incubation on ice for 30 s a total of four times. Extracted proteins were solubilized in sample buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 8 m urea, 15% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated at 37 °C for 1 min, centrifuged, fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore), and probed with 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies specific for the triple Myc epitope present in Fig1p-Myc. Cross-reacting proteins were then detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Analyses of Mating Cell Fusion—Cell-cell fusion abilities of strains were quantified essentially as described previously (40Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Strains were mated for 4 h on Noble agar plates containing calcium-free synthetic complete medium with the indicated supplements of CaCl2, fixed in formaldehyde, sonicated, stained, and imaged by epifluorescence microscopy. The frequency of mating pairs in which membrane and cell wall material were incompletely removed was determined for at least 100 mating pairs. Identification of New Mutants That Affect LACS Activity in Response to α-Factor—Previously in yeast we described the existence of LACS, a primary method for Ca2+ entry in wild type cells treated with α-factor (10Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further addition FK506 strongly increases Ca2+ influx by inhibiting calcineurin and permitting activation of a second Ca2+ influx system HACS (10Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We found that transcription via the mating-specific transcription factor Ste12p was necessary and sufficient for this strong activation of HACS in the presence of FK506 (10Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation and composition of LACS, we first tested whether the activation of Ste12p was also sufficient to stimulate LACS as shown previously for HACS. Mutants lacking both the Dig1p and Dig2p repressors of Ste12p exhibit maximum expression of most mating-specific genes (22Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Kron S.J. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2831-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Tedford K. Kim S. Sa D. Stevens K. Tyers M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 228-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Ca2+ from the growth medium was not significantly enhanced in a dig1 dig2 double mutant relative to wild type, but addition of α-factor stimulated Ca2+ accumulation to a similar degree in wild type and dig1 dig2 double mutants even in the absence of Cch1p and Mid1p (Fig. 1). However, mutants lacking Ste12p exhibit no LACS activity after treatment with α-factor (10Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, stimulation of LACS was independent of Dig1p and Dig2p but still dependent on Ste12p and signaling by upstream factors. To identify new components or regulators of LACS, a collection of 204 gene knockout mutants was assembled based on high Ste12p-dependent induction of these genes in response to α-factor (52Roberts C.J. Nelson B. Marton M.J. Stoughton R. Meyer M.R. Bennett H.A. He Y.D. Dai H. Walker W.L. Hughes T.R. Tyers M. Boone C. Friend S.H. Science. 2000; 287: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and directly screened for LACS and HACS activity using the 45Ca2+ accumulation assay. Eleven mutants were found to have a LACS/HACS ratio at least 2.0 standard deviations lower than the mean (Supplemental Table I). Two mutants (kre6 and bst1) exhibited elevated HACS activity, and one mutant (cik1) did not repro"

The IL-12 p40 gene product, expressed specifically in macrophages and dendritic cells, heterodimerizes with p35 to form bioactive IL-12, and heterodimerizes with p19 to comprise the cytokine IL-23. Regulation of the murine IL-12 p40 promoter is complex. Multiple cis-acting elements have been characterized that are involved in activation by bacterial products. However, molecular mechanisms through which interferon (IFN)-γ and bacterial products synergistically activate IL-12 p40 gene expression are less clear. In this study, a composite NFAT/ICSBP binding site at –68 to –54 is identified that is functionally important for p40 promoter activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS plus IFN-γ. DNA binding of NFAT and ICSBP is demonstrated on the endogenous promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. NFAT is required for ICSBP binding to this region. Overexpression of NFAT and ICSBP synergistically activates the p40 promoter. A dominant negative NFAT molecule attenuates LPS- and IFN-γ-activated endogenous IL-12 p40 mRNA expression. A physical association between NFAT and ICSBP in the absence of DNA is detected by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins. Three NFAT domains are required for ICSBP interaction. Finally, in LPS- and IFN-γ-activated RAW-264.7 cells, the association between NFAT and ICSBP is abrogated by IL-10 priming.

The key functions of IL-12 are the induction and maintenance of T-helper-1 (Th1) responses (1Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). As IL-12 is induced in macrophages and dendritic cells by bacteria and bacterial products, it is an important bridge between host innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to its functions in host immune defense against microorganisms, IL-12 is also involved in the pathogenesis of Th1-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders in mice and humans, such as diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (2Adorini L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1610-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the molecular events that lead to IL-12 gene expression may provide important insight into how a Th1 response is regulated in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Biologically active IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p40 and p35, which are encoded by two separate genes. The p35 gene is constitutively expressed in many cell types (3Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaut D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4143-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p40 gene is only detected in cells that produce bioactive IL-12 (3Gubler U. Chua A.O. Schoenhaut D.S. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Motyka R. Nabavi N. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4143-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and is strongly induced by intracellular bacteria and bacterial products that in vivo stimulate Th1 responses (4D'Andrea A. Rengaraju M. Valiante N.M. Chehimi J. Kubin M. Aste M. Chan S.H. Kobayashi M. Young D. Nickbarg E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IL-12 p40 subunit also may heterodimerize in vivo with a p19 subunit to form the cytokine IL-23. IL-23 influences Th1 development and cytokine secretion and has been demonstrated to have an important role in infectious and inflammatory disease in mice independent of IL-12 (5Oppmann B. Lesley R.

J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies of IL-12 transcriptional regulation have focused on the p40 promoter. An NF-κB site from –131 to –121 relative to the transcription start site in the murine IL-12 p40 promoter is necessary for induction of promoter activity by LPS (7Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human p40 promoter, a consensus Ets sequence from –211 and –207 that binds a multiprotein complex was implicated in promoter activation by LPS and IFN-γ (8Ma X. Gri G. Trinchieri G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 795: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We had initially reported a comprehensive functional analysis of the murine and human IL-12 p40 promoters in RAW 264.7 cells. Multiple control elements were involved in heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes- and LPS-activated transcription of the p40 gene. These elements include a C/EBP binding site between –96 and –88 (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and an AP-1 site from –81 to –75 (10Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, functional studies suggested that several other cis-acting elements may regulate promoter activation by bacteria and bacterial products (10Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although much has been learned about the IL-12 p40 promoter, many important biologic questions remain. For example, IFN-γ is required for optimal production of bioactive IL-12 by macrophages and dendritic cells. Mechanisms governing the IFN-γ transcriptional response in the IL-12 p40 promoter remain controversial (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, mice deficient in the interferon regulatory factors IRF-1, IRF-2, and ICSBP demonstrated a selective defect in IL-12 production (11McElligott D.L. Phillips J.A. Stillman C.A. Koch R.J. Mosier D.E. Hobbs M.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4180-4186PubMed Google Scholar, 12Scharton-Kersten T. Contursi C. Masumi A. Sher A. Ozato K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A molecular mechanism for this in vivo phenomenon was suggested when ICSBP was described to activate the IL-12 p40 promoter through the Ets element (13Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, functional analysis from this study demonstrated that other downstream elements may also mediate the effect of ICSBP. Similarly, IL-10 is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine that potently inhibits IL-12 p40 transcription. The effects of IL-10 on the IL-12 p40 promoter remain unknown (14Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, an important control region from –71 to –54 in the murine IL-12 p40 promoter is characterized. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that this region is important for promoter activation by LPS and IFN-γ. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and DNA affinity binding experiments demonstrate a multi-protein complex that binds to this region, of which NFAT (–61 to –54) and ICSBP (–71 to –62) are major components. DNA binding of ICSBP is dependent upon NFAT binding. These in vitro interactions are demonstrated on the endogenous promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. NFAT and ICSBP protein-protein interactions are also detected by co-immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of NFAT and ICSBP synergistically activates IL-12 p40 gene transcription. Expression of a dominant negative NFAT in RAW264.7 cells attenuates LPS- and IFN-γ-activated endogenous IL-12 p40 mRNA accumulation. IL-10 treatment of RAW264.7 cells prior to LPS and IFN-γ activation abrogates the NFAT-ICSBP interaction. Thus, NFAT-ICSBP may act as a downstream target for IL-10 inhibition of IL-12 p40 gene expression. Plasmid Constructs—The murine IL-12 p40 promoter from –101 to +55, or –355 to +55 (relative to the transcription start site), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter, and luciferase reporter plasmids have been previously described (10Zhu C.

The human ICSBP expression plasmid, the GST mammalian expression vector pEBG, and the human CD4 (hCD4) expression plasmid were provided by Curt Horvath, Patricia Cortes, and Adrian Ting, respectively. Cell Lines and Reagents—The RAW 264.7 murine macrophage line and the human 293T cell line were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Salmonella enteriditis LPS, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, and cyclosporin A were purchased from Sigma. Murine recombinant IFN-γ and IL-10 were from R&D Inc. Antibodies against NFATc1 (7A6), NFATc1 (K-18), NFATc2 (M-20), NFATc3 (M-75), NFATc4 (C-20), IRF-1 (M-20), IRF-2 (C-19), IRF-4 (M-17), ICSBP (C-19), NF-κB p50 (NLS), p65 (C-20), c-Rel (C), PU.1 (T-21), and STAT1 (E-23) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Transient transfections in 293T cells were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) per the provided protocol. After 36 h, the transfected cells were activated with 5 μg/ml LPS and 10 ng/ml IFN-γ (for RAW264.7 cells), or 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μm ionomycin (for 293T cells) as indicated under “Results.” Ten to 12 h after activation, the cells were harvested using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega).

EMSA—RAW 264.7 cell nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). For EMSA, 200 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dGTP and [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow, and purified with Quick Spin columns (Sephadex G-50) (Roche). Our numerical nomenclature of EMSA probes denotes the sequences spanned within the murine IL-12 p40 promoter with respect to the transcription start site. The sequence of the EMSA probe 77/46 is 5′-gatcTCAGTTTCTACTTTGGGTTTCCATCAGAAAGT, consensus NFAT probe is 5′-gatcGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTATTTCATA, and consensus IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) probe is 5′-gatcACTTTCAGTTTCAT. The sequence of the IL-18 p1 promoter EMSA probe is 5′-gatcTCAGTTGAAGTCTGGAAAGAGAAACTTAGTGAGA, and the murine inducible nitric-oxide synthetase probe is 5′-gatcACTGACACTGTCAATATTTCACTTTCATAATGGAAAAT. Other probes spanning the IL-12 p40 C/EBP site (112/78), NF-κB site (146/107), AP-1 element (88/63), and a consensus NF-κB DNA binding element have been described previously (9Plevy S.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Sequences for other mutant probes are available from the authors. EMSAs were performed as in previous publications (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Zhu C.

DNA Affinity Binding Assay—A biotinylated IL-12 p40 promoter from –101 to –36 was amplified by PCR using a 5′-biotin-labeled upstream primer, and conjugated to Dynabeads (M-280 streptavidin, Dynal®). The NFAT site mutant (from –62 to –57), ICSBP site mutant (–68 to –63), and AP-1 site mutant (–80 to –75) promoter sequences were also PCR amplified by the same method (mutant sequences are available from the authors). The experimental procedure has been described in previous studies (13Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the Technical Handbook for Dynal® with some modifications. 5′-Biotin-labeled promoters were conjugated with 200 μg of streptavidin beads in TE buffer (pH 7.9). The DNA-conjugated beads were blocked by 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TGED buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. 500 μg of nuclear extracts from IFN-γ and LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells were then added, and TGED was used to adjust the final volume to 500 μl with the final concentration of NaCl at 100 mm. The mixtures were subsequently incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h. Beads were extensively washed with TGED buffer, and DNA-binding proteins were eluted from the DNA affinity column using TGED with 1 m NaCl. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot detection with specific antibodies. Murine IL-12 p40 mRNA Expression—1.5 × 107 RAW 264.7 cells in 150-mm plates were transiently transfected with 15 μg of Dn-NFAT and 15 μg of human CD4 expression plasmids. As a control, 15 μgofthe empty expression plasmid pCDNA3 was used instead of Dn-NFAT. The plasmids were suspended in 2 ml of DMEM and mixed with 120 μl of Superfect® (Qiagen) at room temperature for 5–10 min, then added to PBS-washed RAW264.7 cells with an additional 13 ml of complete DMEM (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin) for 4 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, and 50 ml of complete DMEM was added. After 36 h, CD4-positive cells were selected using the CD4 Positive Isolation Kit (Dynal®). CD4-positive cells were cultured for an additional 12 h. Cells were then pretreated with 10 ng/ml murine IFN-γ for 1 h and activated with 5 μg/ml LPS for an additional 4 h. Total RNA was harvested using RNeasy® Mini Kits (Qiagen). Finally, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed to detect IL-12 p40 mRNA expression as previously described (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—RAW 264.7 cells were cultured to 90% confluence in 150-mm plates. IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) was then added 1 h before LPS (5 μg/ml) activation. In some experiments, IL-10 (10 ng/ml) was added 1 h before IFN-γ activation. Four hours later, cells were harvested for nuclear extract preparation, as previously described (10Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 500 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of antibody to ICSBP or NFATc1 in presence of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-Sepharose® (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for another 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were extensively washed with WCE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and boiled with 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot detection. GST Pull-down Experiments—For precipitation with GST-NFAT fusion proteins in mammalian cells, deleted NFATc1 cDNA constructs were subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pEBG in-frame. 293T cells were transfected with GST-NFATc1 fusion and ICSBP expression plasmids for 36 h and either left unactivated or activated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for another 4 h. Cells were harvested and suspended in WCE buffer for 10 min on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant containing 2 μg of total protein was incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose® beads (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 4 °C overnight. Beads were extensively washed with WCE buffer. Proteins were eluted with Elution Buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—These experiments were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), following the provided protocol with modifications. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium to 80% confluence. 2–5 × 106 cells (unactivated, activated with LPS, IFN-γ/LPS, or cyclosporin A (CsA)/IFN-γ/LPS) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature. CsA was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were washed with cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), then collected by centrifugation and resuspended into 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The cell lysate was sonicated to dissociate chromatin into 200–1000-base pair fragments. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted in Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Dilution Buffer containing protease inhibitors. One μg of DNA was used for immunoprecipitation with 4 μg of anti-ICSBP or anti-NFATc1 antibodies, and protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with Radioimmune Precipitation Assay Buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 SDS), Low Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer, High Salt Immune Complex Wash Buffer, LiCl Immune Complex Wash Buffer, and TE in sequence. DNA-protein complexes were eluted with 250 μl of Elution Buffer. DNA-protein cross-links were reversed at 65 °C in the presence of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl. Proteins were digested with proteinase K, and DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was utilized for PCR with primers spanning –146 to +40 of the murine IL-12 p40 promoter. Characterization of an NFAT Binding Site in the IL-12 p40 Promoter—Our previous studies demonstrated a functional control element around the –62 to –57 region of the murine IL-12 p40 promoter (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 10Zhu C. Gagnidze K. Gemberling J.H. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18519-18528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To better characterize this element, a series of 2-base pair substitution mutants from –73 to –54 was generated in the context of a minimal inducible IL-12 p40 promoter from –101 to +55, linked to a CAT reporter. Promoter activities were analyzed following transient transfection in unactivated and LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. Mutants from –71 to –60 reduced LPS-induced promoter activity up to 80% (Fig. 1A). Mutants downstream of –59 and upstream of –72 had minimal affects on promoter activity (Fig. 1A). A bioinformatic search for potential cis-regulatory domains suggested that this small region is relatively complex (18Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The sequence from –63 to –54 has strong homology to a consensus NFAT (for nuclear factor of activated T cells) DNA binding site ((T/A)GGAAAN) (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar), and the promoter region from –74 to –62 has weaker homology to an ISRE ((A/G)NGAAANNGAAACT) (20Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar), which is a binding site for interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members. As members of the IRF family are induced in macrophages by IFN-γ (13Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.H. Marks M.S. Levi B.Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu Rev Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar), this region of the IL-12 p40 promoter was next tested for functional significance upon activation with IFN-γ and LPS. We have previously demonstrated that IL-12 p40 promoter-CAT reporter plasmids are not induced by IFN-γ in RAW 264.7 cells (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Therefore, for this analysis, IL-12 p40 luciferase reporter plasmids that respond to IFN-γ (9Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) were utilized. When transfected into RAW 264.7 cells, the IL-12 p40 luciferase plasmid, –101 to +55, was activated by LPS, and strong synergistic activation was demonstrated when cells are stimulated with IFN-γ plus LPS (Fig. 1B). Mutants in the predicted NFAT binding element (–62/–57D) and ISRE (–68/–62D) diminished LPS-induced promoter activity. Significantly, mutants in either region markedly attenuated the synergistic promoter activation seen in cells treated with IFN-γ plus LPS (Fig. 1B). To characterize specific DNA-protein interactions in this region, EMSAs were performed. Two DNA-protein complexes, I and II, were observed when the probe 77/46 (–77 to –46 relative to p40 promoter transcription start site) was incubated with nuclear proteins prepared from RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2A). Complex II was slightly enhanced by LPS- or IFN-γ-activated nuclear extracts, and clearly enhanced by LPS and IFN-γ co-activation (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). Protein binding was eliminated when probe 77/46m, containing a mutated region from –62 to –57 that correlates with decreased functional activity in reporter assays, was used (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). Competition with unlabeled double stranded oligonucleotides containing a consensus NFAT binding site and the unlabeled probe 77/46 in 100-fold molar excess completely inhibited the formation of complex II in EMSAs (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a consensus NF-κB or an ISRE binding site did not inhibit the formation of complex II (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 5, 7, and 10). These results suggest that an NFAT binding site is located in the IL-12 p40 promoter roughly from –62 to –54, and NFAT DNA binding contributes to the formation of complex II in EMSAs. This experiment also suggested that the IL-12 p40 promoter sequence from –74 to –62, although homologous, is not a classical ISRE element (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 10). The significance of complex I is less clear. Complex I was not competed by unlabeled probe (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 9). However, this complex was not present when the mutant probe 77/46m (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8) was used for EMSA. These finding suggest that complex I represents an abundant protein in nuclear extracts whose identity is thus far unknown. To identify specific proteins that bind to this promoter region, supershift experiments were performed. Antibodies against NFATc1, -c2, and -c4, and an antibody recognizing NFAT family members c1, c2, c3, and c4 (αNFATc1; K18) strongly inhibited or supershifted complex II (Fig. 2C, lanes 8–10 and 12). Antibodies recognizing different IRF family members were also tested. Interestingly, an anti-ICSBP antibody strongly inhibited formation of complex II, and an antibody to IRF-4 attenuated this DNA-protein complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 7). Antibodies against IRF-1 and IRF-2 did not affect complex II formation (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). As the Rel family of transcription factors and NFAT share a similar DNA binding domain (19Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar), anti-c-Rel and p50 antibodies were tested and also did not affect complex II formation (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). The Ets family member PU.1 may recruit ICSBP/IRF-4 to PU.1/IRF composite elements (25Kim Y.M. Kang H.S. Paik S.G. Pyun K.H. Anderson K.L. Torbett B.E. Choi I. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, PU.1 is not a component of the DNA binding complex present at –77 to –46 of the p40 promoter (Fig. 2B, lane 13). A combination of antibodies for NFATc1 (or NFATc2 or NFATc4) and ICSBP further attenuated the binding of complex II. In contrast, antibodies to PU.1 and NFATc1 together did not have same effect (Fig. 2B, lanes 14–18). To test whether antibodies against IRF-1 and IRF-2 used in these experiments functioned properly in supershift, another EMSA was performed using a consensus ISRE probe. Both antibodies strongly supershifted a DNA binding complex (data not shown). Therefore, ICSBP and IRF-4 are the predominant IRF family members bound to this region. In summary, ICSBP/IRF-4 and NFAT are the two major transcription factor groups bound to the –77 to –46 region of the IL-12 p40 promoter. ICSBP Binding to p4"

The proteins encoded by the three genes were purified and characterized. All three proteins contain folate and flavin cofactors and have absorption peaks in the range of 350-500 nm. Only one of the three, VcPhr, is a photolyase specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. The other two are cryptochromes and were designated VcCry1 and VcCry2, respectively. Mutation of phr abolishes photoreactivation of UV-induced killing, whereas mutations in cry1 and cry2 do not affect photorepair activity. VcCry1 exhibits some unique features. Of all cryptochromes characterized to date, it is the only one that contains stoichiometric amounts of both chromophores and retains its flavin cofactor in the two-electron reduced FADH2 form. In addition, VcCry1 exhibits RNA binding activity and co-purifies with an RNA of 60-70 nucleotides in length.

In addition, VcCry1 exhibits RNA binding activity and co-purifies with an RNA of 60-70 nucleotides in length. The photolyase/cryptochrome family encompasses blue-light photoreceptors, which use near UV/blue-light photons as an energy source to either repair far UV (200-300 nm)-induced DNA lesions or to regulate growth and development in plants and synchronize the circadian clock with the daily light-dark cycles in animals (1Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 2Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In addition to their light-dependent functions, both photolyase and cryptochrome also carry out some light-independent functions important for cellular physiology (4Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 7715-7727Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Kavakli I.H. Sancar A. Mol. Interv. 2002; 8: 484-492Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar); photolyase stimulates excision of UV damage and certain chemical lesions by nucleotide excision repair (4Sancar G.B. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 7715-7727Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and cryptochromes inhibit transcription of several circadian clock genes (6Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R.

Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Despite their obvious selective advantages, photolyase and cryptochrome are not universally distributed in nature. Certain organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, contain photolyases for both major UV photoproducts, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (Pyr<>Pyr) and the (6-4) photoproduct (2Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and a cryptochrome (9Stanewsky R Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 69: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas others such as Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Caenorhabditis elegans possess neither a photolyase nor a cryptochrome (11Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 12Thompson C.L. Sancar A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9043-9056Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not possible to predict which organisms may or may not contain photolyase/cryptochrome family members based on phylogenetic and evolutionary considerations. In the last decade, genome sequencing projects have identified over 50 photolyase/cryptochrome candidate genes in various organisms including some animal viruses (2Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In some instances, these genes have been shown to encode photolyases or cryptochromes using biochemical and genetic approaches. In the majority of cases, the functions of these genes identified by genomics remain to be defined. We were particularly interested in the photolyase/cryptochrome genes uncovered by the Vibrio cholerae sequencing project (13Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). The sequence of V. cholerae El Tor N16961 revealed three genes belonging to this family. The authors suggested that the presence of three photolyase homologues, more than have been found in other bacterial species sequenced to date, may allow V. cholerae to photorepair the two major UV photoproducts, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and the (6-4) photoproduct, by readily available light energy (13Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). V. cholerae is an enteropathogen that is transmitted through contaminated water and food, and has a high likelihood of UV exposure during transit. Hence, it would be advantageous if the bacterium had an efficient photorepair system consisting of one or two photolyases for each of the major UV photoproducts. Indeed, it has been shown that, in V. cholerae, photoreactivation plays a much more important role in repair of UV damage compared with other enteropathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (14Chanda P.K. Chatterjee S.N. Can. J. Microbiol. 1976; 22: 1186-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 15Das G. Sil K. Das J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 655: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate the roles of these three photolyase homologues in UV survival of V. cholerae. Our biochemical analyses show that the proteins encoded by all three genes have the folate and flavin cofactors typical of the photolyase/cryptochrome family. However, genetic and biochemical data indicate that only one is a photolyase, specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer. We designate the corresponding gene and protein Vcphr and VcPhr, respectively. The other two, by convention (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Lin C.

Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), are designated cryptochromes and are named VcCry1 and VcCry2, respectively. Although cryptochromes are assumed to function as blue-light photoreceptors in organisms ranging from Arabidopsis thaliana (18Ahmad M. Cashmore A.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) to humans (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A.

Takahashi J.S. Sancar A. Science. 1998; 282: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), there are no photochemical and biochemical data to support the genetic evidence for such a function. In fact, because of a lack of biochemical data on a presumptive “cryptochrome photocycle,” the roles of cryptochromes as photoreceptors, in particular in animals, has been questioned (8Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Currently, the strongest evidence for a photoreceptor function for cryptochrome is its high sequence homology to photolyase and the presence of both folate and flavin cofactors in all characterized cryptochromes (3Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). However, the native photolyase contains the flavin cofactor in the two-electron reduced FADH2 (or FADH-) form, whereas all cryptochromes analyzed to date contain the flavin in the two-electron oxidized form (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2353-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This has led to a model whereby cryptochrome carries out its regulatory function by an ordinary light-independent flavin oxidoreductase mechanism (23Rutter J. Reick M. Mcknight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 303-331Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In fact, even though the active form of flavin in photolyases is FADH-, this cofactor becomes oxidized to either FADH° or FADox inactive forms during purification of most photolyases and must be reduced in vitro to activate the enzyme (24Sancar G.B. Jorns M.S. Payne G. Fluke D.J. Rupert C.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 492-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is conceivable that the flavin is in the FADH- form in cryptochromes and that the FADox found in isolated cryptochromes is a purification artifact. In that regard our analyses of the cofactors of VcPhr1, VcCry1, and VcCry2 are of special significance. Although VcPhr and VcCry2 do contain FADH° and FADox, the purified VcCry1 contains flavin in the two-electron reduced form. We consider this finding the strongest evidence to date that cryptochromes function in a manner analogous to photolyases, i.e. by photoinduced electron transfer. Furthermore, VcCry1 under mild purification conditions contains a 60-70-nucleotide RNA. The significance of this latter observation remains to be determined. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strain UNC523F′lacI6 (phr::kan uvrA::Tn10) was used as the host strain for expressing the V. cholerae photolyase/cryptochrome proteins (20Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Batschauer A. Dawut L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The V. cholerae 01 El Tor was obtained from Dr. Fıtnat Yıldız (University of California, Santa Cruz, CA). The E. coli pir-116 strain and the plasmid pGP704sacB-28 used for generating null mutants of V. cholerae have been described previously (25Yildiz F.H. Dolganov N.A. Schoolnik G.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1716-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Horton R.M. Cai Z L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector pMal-c2 was purchased from New England Biolabs. The bacterial strains were maintained at -80 °C in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani broth; MTHF, methenyltetrahydrofolate; kanR, kanamycinR; camR, chloramphenicolR; tetR, tetracyclineR; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MBP, maltose-binding protein; T(6-4)T, thymine-thymine (6-4) photoproduct. supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB unless specified otherwise. When antibiotics were used, they were included in culture media at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml; and tetracycline, 0.5 μg/ml. Cloning of V. cholerae phr Homologues into Expression and Gene Disruption Vectors—The V. cholerae phr homologues were amplified by PCR using primers based on published genomic sequence (13Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) and V. cholerae 01 El Tor genomic DNA, donated by Dr. Ronald Taylor (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), as template and the amplified genes were inserted into pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmids express the Vibrio proteins fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of maltose-binding protein encoded by the malE gene of pMal-c2. The plasmids were named pUNC2001 (MBP-VcPhr), pUNC2002 (MBP-VcCry1), and pUNC2003 (MBP-VcCry2). The cloned genes were completely sequenced to ensure that no mutation was introduced during PCR amplification. The V. cholerae phr homologues were disrupted by inserting a kanamycinR (kanR) cassette into Vcphr, a chloramphenicolR (camR) cassette into Vccry1, and a tetracyclineR (tetR) cassette into Vccry2. The kanR, camR, and tetR cassettes were amplified by PCR using pUCK, pNCH40, and pBR322 as templates, respectively. In the case of VcPhr, the gene was disrupted with kanR using overlapping PCR (26Horton R.M. Cai Z L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Using the appropriate primers, the kanR gene was flanked by 341 and 350 bp of VcPhr 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The construct was then introduced into the suicide vector pGP704SacB-28. For VcCry1 and VcCry2, the amplified camR and tetR genes were digested with the appropriate enzymes and inserted into pUNC2002, and pUNC2003, respectively. Then, new PCR primers were used to amplify the antibiotic markers along with 200-350 bp of phr homologous sequences on both sides. The resulting PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then inserted into the suicide vector pGP704SacB-28. The new constructs were named pUNC2004 (VcPhr), pUNC2005 (VcCry1), and pUNC2006 (VcCry2) and used to generate null mutants of the respective genes. Generation of Null Mutants of phr Homologues—Mutants were generated either by electroporation (vcphr1::kan) or mating (vccry1::cam and vccry2::tet). E. coli SM10 containing pUNC2004, -2005, or -2006 was mated with V. cholerae at cell densities of 1 × 108 cells/ml in LB. The mating mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with gentle shaking to allow for conjugation. Then, the cells were vortexed to interrupt conjugation, streptomycin was added to the culture to inhibit the growth of E. coli SM10, and the incubation continued for another 2 h. Cells were plated on LB agar containing streptomycin plus kanamycin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline to select for the exconjugants (25Yildiz F.H. Dolganov N.A. Schoolnik G.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1716-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Colonies were picked from these plates and grown in modified LB agar containing 5% NaCl and 5% sucrose to select for integration of the disrupted genes by homologous recombination (25Yildiz F.H. Dolganov N.A. Schoolnik G.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1716-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Colonies were picked from these plates and tested by PCR for disruption of phr homologues using primers of sequences flanking each of the three genes. Gene disruption was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products. Purification of V. cholerae Photolyase and Cryptochromes—To purify VcPhr, VcCry1, and VcCry2, we transferred pUNC2001, pUNC2002, and pUNC2003, respectively, into E. coli UNC523. To purify VcPhr, UNC523/pUNC2001 was grown in 10-liter LB at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.6, at which point isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 0.3 mm and the incubation was continued for an additional 16 h at 22 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell-free extract was prepared by sonication, followed by the removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation. The cell-free extract was applied to a 10-ml amylose resin column. Following extensive washing the protein was eluted with maltose as described by the manufacturer. Fractions containing MBP-VcPhr were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing photolyase were combined and dialyzed against storage buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Typical yield was 12 mg of MBP-VcPhr from a 10-liter culture. VcCry1 was purified in a similar manner. However, UNC523/pUNC2002 cells were grown at 25 °C before and after IPTG induction. Typical yield for MBP-VcCry1 was 150 mg/10-liter culture. FLAG-VcCry1 was also purified from V. cholerae transformed with pUNC2002-1 by a similar procedure. Initial attempts to purify MBP-VcCry2 under the same conditions were unsuccessful because most of the protein was lost in inclusion bodies. Therefore, UNC523/pUNC2003 cells were grown to A 600 = 0.5 at 37 °C, IPTG was added to 0.3 mm, and incubation was continued at 12 °C for an additional 24 h. The protein was purified by amylose affinity chromatography. Typical yield was 8 mg of MBP-VcCry2 from a 2-liter culture. Spectroscopic Analysis—The absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu RF5000 U spectrofluorometer, respectively. The concentrations of the apoproteins and the cofactors were calculated from their molar extinction coefficients. The theoretical molar extinction coefficients of the three apoenzymes at 280 nm are as follows: MBP-VcPhr = 205,785 m-1 cm-1, MBP-VcCry1 = 177,475 m-1 cm-1, and MBP-Vc-Cry2 = 200,335 m-1 cm-1. The molar extinction coefficient of methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) at 370-380 nm is 24,495 m-1 cm-1 (27Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Dancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the molar extinction coefficient of FADox at 440 nm is 11,300 m-1 cm-1. The protein concentration was obtained with relative accuracy from the absorption spectrum of the native enzyme. The concentration of MTHF was also calculated from the absorption of the native enzyme at 380 nm. However, there was considerable uncertainty in the MTHF concentration estimated from this value for VcPhr because the enzyme contains flavin in a mixture of reduced, one-electron, and two-electron oxidized state, and the latter two forms have significant absorbance at 380 nm. This was not a problem for VcCry1 and VcCry2. In VcCry1, essentially all of the flavin is in the two-electron reduced form that does not absorb at 380 nm at a significant level. In VcCry2, MTHF in most preparations is vastly substoichiometric relative to flavin and apoprotein, such that its presence could be ascertained only by florescence spectroscopy. To determine the flavin concentration, the holoproteins were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The absorption spectrum in the 300-700-nm range was recorded, and FAD concentration was calculated from 440 nm absorbance using a molar extinction coefficient of 11,300 m-1 cm-1. When MTHF is released from the enzyme, the 5-10 methenyl bridge responsible for the 380-nm absorption band is broken at neutral pH to generate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, which does not absorb at λ > 300 nm and hence does not contribute to the near UV spectrum of the cofactors (27Johnson J.L. Hamm-Alvarez S. Payne G. Dancar G.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Photoreactivation—Wild type V. cholerae N16961 and its mutant derivatives were grown in LB at 37 °C for 16 h. The titers of these stationary phase cultures were typically 3-5 × 109 cells/ml. Dilutions were made in phosphate-buffered saline and plated in triplicate for each UV or UV plus photoreactivation treatment. General Electric germicidal lamp GT5 emitting mainly at 254 nm was the UV source, and photoreactivation was carried out with a Sylvania F15T8/BLB black light emitting mainly 366 nm. The UV and black light fluences were measured using a UVX digital radiometer (Ultraviolet Products Inc.) fitted with the appropriate sensors. The plates were irradiated with UV fluences of 10, 20, and 40 J/m2 at a fluence rate of 0.5 J m-2 s-1. For photoreactivation the plates were covered with the plastic cover of the Petri dish and two layers of window glass to filter out radiation below 300 nm. Photoreactivation was carried out for 60 min at a fluence rate of 2.5 J m-2 s-1, a condition that empirically was determined to produce maximum photoreactivation. Photoreactivation experiments were done under General Electric “gold” fluorescent light to prevent uncontrolled photorepair. Following UV and photoreactivation treatments, the plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 16 h and then the colonies were counted and survivals relative to unirradiated controls were calculated. Photolyase Assays—Vibrio cell-free extract was tested for both cyclobutane photolyase and (6-4) photolyase by coupled enzyme assays. In the assay testing for cyclobutane photolyase activity, a radiolabeled substrate containing T<>T at the MseI restriction site (TTAA), and consequently refractory to cutting by the restriction enzyme, was first treated with the photolyase preparation and then the restriction enzyme. The fraction of the DNA cut by MseI following the photoreactivation treatment is a measure of the extent of photorepair (28Zhao X. Liu J. Hsu D.S. Zhao S. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32580-32590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The substrate used for this assay had the following sequence (only top strand is shown), and its preparation has been described previously (16Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T. Wei Y.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13871-13877Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar): CTGCGTCTAGATGCTTAAGGAAT<>TAAGGACGTGGCCTAGGGCGATC. In the assay for (6-4) photolyase activity, we took advantage of the fact that the (6-4) photoproduct inhibits 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic digestion by T4 DNA polymerase, and removal of this inhibition by photorepair can be used to measure photoenzymatic activity. In this assay a 46-bp duplex, which contains radiolabel at the fifth phosphodiester bond 5′ to T(6-4)T is used. Repair of the photolesion enables T4 DNA polymerase 3′ to 5′ exonuclease to digest the DNA past the site of the photolesion and release the radiolabel in the form of mononucleotide from which the extent of repair is calculated. The sequence of the duplex used in this assay is as follows (only the lesion-containing strand is shown): CTGCGTCTAGATGCTTAAGGTAT(6-4)TATGGACGTGGCCTAGGGCGATC-3′. For the photolyase assays, 2 fmol of either substrate was mixed with 100 μg of V. cholerae cell-free extract in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol (v/v). The reaction was either kept in the dark or was exposed to photoreactivating light (filtered through two glass plates) at 4 °C for 90 min. In the case of the cyclobutane photolyase assay, the DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in restriction enzyme buffer, and digested with 10 units of MseI for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and the level of repair was determined using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In the case of the (6-4) photolyase assay, following the photoreactivation treatment, the sample was extracted with phenol/chloroform, the aqueous phase was supplemented with 0.1 μg of HaeIII-digested [phis]X174 DNA, 2 units of T4 DNA polymerase was added, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 12 min, and the products were separated on a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The level of repair was determined by the intensity of radiolabeled mononucleotide using a PhosphorImager. Sequence Analysis of the Three “Photolyase Homologues” of V. cholerae—The sequences of the proteins encoded by the three phr-like genes of V. cholerae, which we designate VcPhr (protein identification code NP_232458), VcCry1 (protein identification code NP_231448), and VcCry2 (protein identification code NP_231036) are compared with representative members of the photolyase/cryptochrome family, including a cyclobutane photolyase, a (6-4) photolyase, a plant cryptochrome, and an animal cryptochrome in Fig. 1. Like all other members of this family, the Vibrio proteins exhibit high degree of sequence similarity in the FAD binding domain near the carboxyl terminus. In addition, VcPhr exhibits 53% sequence identity to E. coli photolyase using the GCG Wisconsin Package Program version 10.3, suggesting that this protein is likely to be a cyclobutane photolyase. In contrast, the sequences of VcCry1 and VcCry2 are not that revealing. These proteins exhibit sequence 28% sequence identity to one another and 21-40% identity to VcPhr, E. coli Phr, A. thaliana, and human cryptochromes, and to D. melanogaster (6-4) photolyase. Therefore, genetic and biochemical analyses were necessary to assign functions to these proteins. Purification of V. cholerae Photolyase/Cryptochrome Family Proteins—We cloned the three V. cholerae phr-like genes into the pMal-c2 vector to express the corresponding proteins in E. coli fused with MBP to aid in solubility and purification of the recombinant proteins. All three proteins were expressed at high levels, and VcPhr and VcCry1 were soluble and readily purified. However, VcCry2 was insoluble when cells were grown at >20 °C; therefore, preparative scale quantities could be obtained only when cells were grown at 12 °C, at which the majority of VcCry2 was soluble. Once soluble protein was obtained, all three proteins were readily purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin. Fig. 2 shows the overexpression and purification of the three proteins as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As apparent from these figures, after the affinity purification step, the proteins were >95% pure and therefore appropriate for spectroscopic and enzymatic analyses. Spectroscopic Properties—All members of photolyase/cryptochrome family characterized to date contain FAD as an essential cofactor; in addition, these proteins contain a second chromophore, which in the majority of organisms is methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) and in a limited number of species is 5-deazariboflavin (1Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 2Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). The folate class enzymes exhibit a major absorption peak at 375-410 nm caused by MTHF and either an additional peak at 440 nm caused by FADox or several peaks at 480, 580, and 625 nm, caused by flavin blue neutral radical, FADH° (3Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Often an enzyme preparation may contain a mixture of one- and two-electron oxidized species, giving rise to a complex spectrum in the near UV-visible region (29Jorns M.S. Baldwin E.T. Sancar G.B. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deazaflavin class enzymes exhibit a major peak at 440 nm as a result of deazaflavin and additional peaks in the visible region arising from FAD, as in the case of the folate class enzymes. When a deazaflavin class photolyase/cryptochrome is expressed in E. coli, the absorption spectrum reflects only the contribution of the FAD because E. coli does not synthesize deazaflavin (30Eker A.P.M. Kooiman P. Hessels J.K.J. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8009-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Malhotra K. Kim S.T. Walsh C. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15406-15411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectra of VcPhr, VcCry1, and VcCry2, respectively. The absorption spectrum of VcPhr exhibited a major peak at 380 nm, minor peaks at 440 and 480 nm, and a tail extending up to 600 nm (Fig. 3A). This spectrum is consistent with the presence of MTHF and a mixture of FADH° and FADox in this protein. The near-UV absorption spectrum of VcCry1 was dominated by a peak at 380 nm and, in this preparation, minor absorption beyond 400 nm ascribable to low levels of oxidized forms of flavin (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the absorption spectrum of VcCry2 showed a peak at 440 nm and a shoulder at 480 nm (Fig. 3C), consistent with a mixture of species containing FADox and FADH°. Although there was a minor shoulder in the 370-390 nm region, from this spectrum alone it cannot be claimed that VcCry2, in this particular preparation, contained MTHF. Further evi"

We have cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and functionally characterized this enzyme. CopB and its homologs are distinguished by a metal binding sequence Cys-Pro-His in their sixth transmembrane segment (H6) and a His-rich N-terminal metal binding domain (His-N-MBD). CopB is a thermophilic protein active at 75 °C and high ionic strength. It is activated by Cu2+ with high apparent affinity (K 1/2 = 0.28 μm) and partially by Cu+ and Ag+ (22 and 55%, respectively). The higher turnover was associated with a faster phosphorylation rate in the presence of Cu2+. A truncated CopB lacking the first 54 amino acids was constructed to characterize the His-N-MBD. This enzyme showed reduced ATPase activity (50% of wild type) but no changes in metal selectivity, ATP dependence, or phosphorylation levels. However, a slower rate of dephosphorylation of the E2P(Cu2+) form was observed for truncated CopB. The data suggest that the presence of the His residue in the putative transmembrane metal binding site of CopB determines a selectivity for this enzyme that is different for that observed in Cu+/Ag+-ATPases carrying a Cys-Pro-Cys sequence. The His-NMBD appears to have a regulatory role affecting the metal transport rate by controlling the metal release/dephosphorylation rates.

However, significant aspects of these heavy metal transport ATPases remain unclear. Among these and perhaps the most intriguing is how the specificity of these enzymes for different heavy metals is determined.PIB-type ATPases with different metal specificities have been described. For instance, Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA (8Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli CopA (7Fan B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The typical Cys-Pro-X sequences located in H6 are probably involved in metal coordination during transport. In support of this idea, the replacement of Cys in the Cys-Pro-Cys of E. coli CopA resulted in the loss of copper resistance, transport, and phosphoenzyme formation (7Fan B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46987-46992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similar replacements in A. fulgidus CopA produced inactive enzymes that bind the nucleotide but are unable to form the phosphorylated intermediary in the presence of Cu+ and ATP (22Argüello J.M. Mandal A.K. Mana-Capelli S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it is puzzling that enzymes transporting either monovalent (Cu+ and Ag+) or divalent (Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) metals all carry the Cys-Pro-Cys in their H6 transmembrane segment (7Fan B.

Similarly, it is difficult to understand how enzymes carrying Cys-Pro-His sequences might transport primarily Cu+ or Ag+ as those containing Cys-Pro-Cys (7Fan B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

To explain these findings, we recently proposed that residues in transmembranes H7 and H8 might also participate in determining the selectivity of these enzymes. 1Argüello, J. M. (2003) J. Membr. Biol., in press. After analyzing the conserved residues in H6, H7, and H8, we proposed that P1B-type ATPases could be subdivided into five subgroups (P1B-1-P1B-5) with defined conserved residues and therefore distinct metal selectivity. 1Argüello, J. M. (2003) J. Membr. Biol., in press. Among them, 16 enzymes in subgroup P1B-3 are characterized by singular invariant residues in the transmembrane region: Cys-Pro-His in H6, Tyr-Asn in H7, and MSXST in H8 (Fig. 1). In addition, these proteins have a His-rich N-terminal MBD (His-N-MBD). Considering the presence of His in these putative metal binding sites and the preference of imidazolium groups for Cu2+ (26Fraústro da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, New York2001Google Scholar), we proposed that these proteins are Cu2+-transporting ATPases (22Argüello J.M. Mandal A.K. Mana-Capelli S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Only one enzyme from this subgroup has been characterized, Enterococcus hirae CopB (27Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of E. hirae CopB using an E. hirae strain lacking the Cu+-ATPase CopA have proposed that CopB can drive the outward transport of Cu+ and Ag+ (14Solioz M. Odermatt A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9217-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). No Cu2+ transport was established in this system.The functional role of the His-N-MBD has not been explored. Most P1B-type ATPases carry one or more N-terminal metal binding domains characterized by a consensus sequence CXXC (Cys-N-MBD). Studies have shown that the Cys-N-MBDs are not essential for enzymatic activity and probably play a regulatory role (24Voskoboinik I. Strausak D. Greenough M. Brooks H. Petris M. Smith S. Mercer J.F.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have shown that the isolated Cys-N-MBDs from the Wilson protein interact with the isolated large cytoplasmic loop of the enzyme in a Cu+-dependent manner. We have observed that removal of the metal binding capacity from A. fulgidus CopA Cys-N-MBD leads to a reduction in the rate of metal release/dephosphorylation steps. 3Mandal, A. K., and Argüello, J. M. (2003) Biochemistry, in press.3Mandal, A. K., and Argüello, J. M. (2003) Biochemistry, in press. Based on these findings, we proposed that the Cys-N-MBDs regulate enzyme turnover by controlling these rate-limiting steps via its interaction with the large cytoplasmic loop. It is then tempting to speculate that the His-N-MBDs have a similar role in the P1B-3-type ATPases.In this work, we present the characterization of the thermophilic A. fulgidus CopB. This is a member of the P1B-3-subgroup with a Cys-Pro-His sequence in H6 and 17 His residues within the first 51 amino acids (Fig. 1). Similar to A. fulgidus CopA (8Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), 3Mandal, A. K., and Argüello, J. M. (2003) Biochemistry, in press. its expression in E. coli, suitable purification, and lack of background activity in membrane preparations (because most determinations are done at 75 °C) facilitate functional studies and allow a detailed examination of different partial reactions. Our studies show that (a) enzymes in the P1B-3-subgroup are Cu2+-ATPases and (b) their His-N-MBDs are regulatory domains that allow faster enzyme turnover by controlling the rate of metal release.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression—The gene AF0152 from the A. fulgidus genome (33Klenk H.

The resulting 2070-bp cDNA was cloned into the pBADTOPO/His vector (Invitrogen). This vector introduces a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and a V5-epitope suitable for immunodetection. In addition, a cDNA encoding for a truncated form of CopB lacking the N-terminal 54 amino acids was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length cDNA as template and as primers 5′-ATGGAGGACTTCAAGAAGCGATTCTA-3′ and 5′-CCGCAGCAATCTGGCATTAATGGCCAC-3′ and cloned into the pBADTOPO/His vector. The DNA sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. These constructs were introduced into E. coli Top10 cells (Invitrogen) carrying an extra plasmid encoding for rare tRNAs (tRNA argAGA/AGG and tRNA ileAUA) (34Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.-H. Biotech. Lett. 1988; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT medium (1.6% bacto-tryptone, 1% bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced with 0.002% l-arabinose. Cells were harvested at 3 h post-induction, washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and stored at -70 °C.Membrane Preparation—Membranes were prepared as described previously (8Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF) and disrupted by passing through French Press at 20,000 p.s.i. After addition of 0.02 mg/ml DNase I and 2 mm MgCl2, the homogenate was incubated for 30 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 163,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet washed with buffer A and centrifuged at 163,000 × g for 1 h. Membranes were resuspended in buffer A at a protein concentration of 10-15 mg of protein/ml and stored at -70 °C. All of the procedures were performed at 0-4 °C. Protein was measured in accordance to Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 10% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein bands were observed by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Heterologous protein was detected by electroblotting the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostaining with anti-(His)6-horseradish peroxidase monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To compare CopB and T-CopB expression levels, equal amounts of CopB and T-CopB membrane preparations were combined and the mixture was subjected to 1:2 serial dilutions. These were separated in a single gel, blotted, and immunostained as indicated.Everted Vesicles Preparation—Vesicle preparation was done in accordance with Tsai et al. (37Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 200 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgSO4 at a concentration of 5 mg protein/ml. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added, and the cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. Protoplasts were lysed by passing through French press at 10,000 p.s.i., and everted membranes were separated from the cell debris by centrifugations at 12,000 × g for 1 h. Finally, membranes were pelleted at 160,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 200 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgSO4.ATPase Assays—The ATPase assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris, pH 5.7(75 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, and 400 mm NaCl, 1 μm CuSO4, and 0.02 mg/ml membrane protein. In different experiments, these reagents were independently varied as indicated in the corresponding figures. 2.5 mm DTT was included in Cu+-containing assay mixture, and Cl- was replaced by NO 3- when Ag+ activation was tested. Buffers were prepared at room temperature, and pHs at different temperatures were calculated using a pK a/°C conversion factor of -0.031 for Tris (38Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured for 10 min at 75 °C. Released inorganic phosphate (Pi) was determined in accordance with Lanzetta et al. (39Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Background activity measured in the absence of transition metals was <5% in all of our determinations.Cu2+ Transport Assays—Cu2+ transport into the everted vesicles was measured using 64Cu (Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO). Membrane vesicles (1 mg of protein/ml) were assayed in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.7 (55 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, and 5 μm [64Cu]CuSO4 at 55 °C. pH at 55 °C was calculated using a pK a/°C conversion factor of -0.0116 for Bis-Tris. Tubes were preincubated at 55 °C for 1 min, and the reactions were started upon the addition of 3 mm ATP. Aliquots were taken at the specified times and filtered onto 0.2-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Millipore). Filters were washed with ice-cold 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 m KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm CuSO4, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter.Phosphorylation Assays—Enzyme phosphorylation with ATP were carried out in a medium containing 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.7 (37 °C), 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 400 mm NaCl, 20% Me2SO, 1 mg/ml protein, and 1 μm CuSO4. 2.5 mm DTT was included in Cu+-containing assay mixture. The reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and performed at 37 °C. At this temperature, enzyme turnover is minimum and, in the presence of ATP and outwardly transported ion, the enzyme is mainly arrested in a phosphorylated conformation. Phosphorylation was stopped with five volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm Pi. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in acidic SDS-PAGE-loading buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8 (20 °C), 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m DTT, 5% SDS, and 0.014% bromphenol blue). The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE in an 8% acidic gel (40Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and radioactivity was monitored in a PhosphorImager. Only the bands corresponding to CopB (molecular mass ≈80 kDa) and T-CopB (molecular mass ≈75 kDa) were quantified. Background phosphoenzyme measured in the presence of 5 mm EDTA during the phosphorylation was subtracted. This background accounted for 25-40% of the total phosphorylation. In dephosphorylation assays, 5 mm EDTA or 1 mm ATP were added to the medium after 60-s incubation instead of the acid-stopping solution and the samples were incubated further for 3, 6, or 9 s at 37 °C. The incubations were stopped with acid, centrifuged, and loaded in acidic gels as described.Data Analysis—Curves of ATPase activity versus Cu2+, Cu+, or ATP were fit to ν = V max L/(L + K 1/2), where L is the concentration of variable ligand. Data analysis was done using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy, Reading, PA). Experimental values are the mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate. The reported standard errors for V max and K m are asymptotic standard errors reported by the fitting program. Sequence analysis and percent identity (ClustalW method) were performed using LaserGene Software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The putative membrane topology of A. fulgidus CopB was obtained using the TMHMM, version 2.0, online server for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins (41Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Glasgow J. Littlejohn T. Major F. Lathrop R. Sankoff D. Sensen C. Proceedings of Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, June 28-July 1, 1998. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1998: 175-182Google Scholar).RESULTSAmong P1B-type ATPases, a subset of these enzymes is characterized by the Cys-Pro-His sequence in H6 and a long His-N-MBD (Fig. 1). This subgroup, termed P1B-3,1 includes 16 highly homologous sequences (Fig. 1A). Analysis of their transmembrane segment H6 shows that the Cys-Pro-His sequence is fully conserved as are the N(X)5GYN(X)4P consensus in H7 and the P(X)6MSXST(X)5N in H8 (Fig. 1B). Although they resemble those amino acids conserved in Cu+/Ag+-transporting enzymes (A. fulgidus CopA, E. coli CopA, Menkes and Wilson disease proteins, and so forth), the presence of His in H6 and an additional putative coordinating group in H8 suggests an alternative specificity for the P1B-3-subgroup of enzymes. 1Argüello, J. M. (2003) J. Membr. Biol., in press. To test this hypothesis, we chose to study the small (690 amino acids) thermophilic CopB from A. fulgidus (NCBI Protein Data Base accession number AAB91079 and Swiss Protein Data Base accession number O30085). This is a typical P1B-3-type ATPase with a high identity percent (38-70%) with other members of the group (Fig. 1A). CopB has eight probable transmembrane fragments, a large cytoplasmic loop between H6 and H7, and the characteristic His-N-MBD (Fig. 1C).A. fulgidus CopB was cloned into a suitable expression vector and expressed in E. coli. A protein (T-CopB) lacking the first 54 amino acids of CopB was also generated to study the role of the N-His-MBD. Fig. 2 shows the presence of these two proteins in the corresponding E. coli membrane preparations used to characterize these enzymes. CopB-ATPase in the presence of activating metals (see below) showed temperature, ionic strength, and pH dependence similar to A. fulgidus CopA, a thermophilic Cu+/Ag+-ATPase characterized previously (8Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, CopB showed maximum activity at pH 5.7, high ionic strength (400 mm NaCl), and at 70 °C-90 °C (Ea = 60.4 KJ/mol) (data not shown). Under these conditions where E. coli membrane ATPases are thermally inactivated, the background ATPase activity (in the absence of metals) was under 5%. Consequently, the functional characterization of CopB and T-CopB was feasible using E. coli membrane preparations.Fig. 2Expression of CopB and T-CopB from A. fulgidus in E. coli. Membrane fractions from untransformed E. coli (lanes 1 and 4) and membrane fractions of arabinose-induced E. coli transformed with pBAD/TOPO-CopB (lanes 2 and 5) or pBAD/TOPO-T-CopB (lanes 3 and 6) are shown. Lanes 1-3, Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel; lanes 4-6, blot immunostained with anti-(His)6-horseradish peroxidase antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Metal Selectivity of CopB—We hypothesized that CopB, as well as other homologous proteins having the Cys-Pro-His consensus in H6, would probably be activated by metals that are different from those transported by enzymes containing the Cys-Pro-Cys sequence in H6 (Cu+/Ag+ or Zn2+/Cd2+/Pb2+). To test this possibility, the activation of CopB by different metals was measured. Fig. 3 shows that CopB is activated mainly by Cu2+ and, to a lesser extent, Ag+ (55%) and Cu+ (25%). A small but detectable activity was observed in the presence of Cd2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. No further activation was observed at higher concentrations (up to 100 μm) of the tested metals. To verify the specificity of this activation and the absence of misleading artifacts, the effect of bicinchoninic acid (BCA) on the CopB activation was tested. As expected, BCA did not affect Cu2+ activation of CopB but removed all of the Cu+-driven activity (Fig. 3). We have previously shown that A. fulgidus Cu+/Ag+-ATPase CopA is activated by the presence Cys at millimolar concentrations (8Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of Cys was not observed when CopB was activated by either Cu2+ or Cu+ (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Activation of CopB-ATPase by metals. The ATPase activity was determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Final concentration of each tested metal ion was 1 μm, which is a saturating concentration for all of them. 2.5 mm DTT was included in Cu+-containing assay mixture. Bars indicate activity in the presence of each metal (white) upon the addition of BCA (gray) or 20 mm cysteine (striped). 100% = 5.0 μmol/mg/h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cu2+ Transport by CopB—Because ATPase activity determinations show that CopB is largely activated by Cu2+, it was pertinent to verify that the divalent metal was transported by this enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2074079253,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been shown to be oncogenic and tumor suppressive, respectively, on prostate epithelial cells. Here we show that IGF-I inhibits the ability of TGF-β to regulate expression of several genes in the non-tumorigenic rat prostatic epithelial line, NRP-152. In these cells, IGF-I also inhibits TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses, as shown by several promoter reporter constructs, suggesting that IGF-I intercepts an early step in TGF-β signaling. We show that IGF-I does not down-regulate TGF-β receptor levels, as determined by both receptor cross-linking and Western blot analyses. However, Western blot analysis reveals that IGF-I selectively inhibits the TGF-β-triggered activation Smad3 but not Smad2, while not altering expression of total Smads 2, 3, or 4. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY29004 reverses the ability of IGF-I to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses and the activation of Smad3, suggesting that the suppression of TGF-β signaling by IGF-I is mediated through activation of PI3K. Moreover, we show that enforced expression of dominant-negative PI3K (DN-p85α) or phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-phosphatase, PTEN, also reverse the suppressive effect of IGF-I on TGF-β-induced 3TP-luciferase reporter activity, whereas constitutively active PI3K (p110αCAAX) completely blocks TGF-β-induced 3TP-luciferase reporter activity. Further transfection experiments including expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative Akt and rapamycin treatment suggest that suppression of TGF-β signaling/Smad3 activation by IGF-I occurs downstream of Akt and through mammalian target of rapamycin activation. In summary, our data suggest that IGF-I inhibits TGF-β transcriptional responses through selective suppression of Smad3 activation via a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been shown to be oncogenic and tumor suppressive, respectively, on prostate epithelial cells. Here we show that IGF-I inhibits the ability of TGF-β to regulate expression of several genes in the non-tumorigenic rat prostatic epithelial line, NRP-152. In these cells, IGF-I also inhibits TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses, as shown by several promoter reporter constructs, suggesting that IGF-I intercepts an early step in TGF-β signaling. We show that IGF-I does not down-regulate TGF-β receptor levels, as determined by both receptor cross-linking and Western blot analyses. However, Western blot analysis reveals that IGF-I selectively inhibits the TGF-β-triggered activation Smad3 but not Smad2, while not altering expression of total Smads 2, 3, or 4. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY29004 reverses the ability of IGF-I to inhibit TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses and the activation of Smad3, suggesting that the suppression of TGF-β signaling by IGF-I is mediated through activation of PI3K.

Further transfection experiments including expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative Akt and rapamycin treatment suggest that suppression of TGF-β signaling/Smad3 activation by IGF-I occurs downstream of Akt and through mammalian target of rapamycin activation. In summary, our data suggest that IGF-I inhibits TGF-β transcriptional responses through selective suppression of Smad3 activation via a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway.

Our laboratory has reported previously that IGF-I is a potent inhibitor of the apoptosis of the NRP-152 rat prostate epithelial cell line induced by TGF-β but not by a variety of other apoptosis inducers (5Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that IGF-I blocks early TGF-β signals that lead to apoptosis. TGF-β1 signals mainly through a cooperative interaction with cell surface signaling receptors, TβRI, and TβRII (2Massague J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 first associates with TβRII, which recruits TβRI to form a ligand/receptor heteromeric complex. The constitutively active kinase domain of TβRII then activates TβRI by transphosphorylation of the GS box in the cytoplasmic domain (15Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The activated TβRI then transmits TGF-β signals by binding and activating Smads 2 and 3 through transphosphorylation of their C-terminal SSXS serines (16Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T.

IGF-I, which is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis, binds to and activates the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF-IR, a receptor shown to be essential for malignant transformation by a number of oncogenes (26Baserga R.

Elevated serum IGF-I is proposed to be a good predictor of prostate cancer and may be involved in the etiology of this malignancy (30Giovannucci E. Horm. Res.

Protein kinase B/Akt, which consists of a family of three mammalian isoforms, Akt-α, Akt-β, and Akt-γ, plays a critical role in mediating most, if not all, effects of IGF-I on tumor growth and inhibition of apoptosis (39Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). All three Akts have an N-terminal PH domain, a central kinase domain with an activation loop containing a Thr-308 phosphorylation site, and a regulatory Ser-473 near the C terminus (39Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Once activated either directly by receptor tyrosine kinases or indirectly via insulin-receptor substrate 1, PI3K adds a phosphate at the D-3 position of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to generate PI(3,4)P2, which is necessary for the membrane anchor of Akt through the PH domain. PDK1, also a PH domain protein that requires PI(3,4,5)P3 for membrane anchor, phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308, whereas a yet unidentified kinase (PDK2) phosphorylates Akt at Ser-473. Both PH domains require phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the D-3 position via PI3K, an SH2 domain protein that associates to activated receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly IGF-IR. How Akt stimulates growth and inhibit apoptosis has been complicated by its many targets involved in cell growth and apoptosis, including Bad, p70S6k, protein kinase C-α, protein kinase C-ζ, forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma, Raf, cAMP-response element-binding protein, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma, mTOR, and the androgen receptor (37Lin H.K.

PTEN, a recently identified tumor suppressor, is a membrane-associated FYVE finger phosphatase commonly inactivated in many cancers including prostate cancer (42Besson A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 43Li D.M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of PTEN causes elevation of PI(3,4)P2 leading to overactivation of Akt, along with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. In this report we provide the first evidence that IGF-I suppresses multiple TGF-β signals, using the NRP-152 epithelial cell line. We show that IGF-I receptor signaling selectively suppresses the ability of TGF-β to activate Smad3 but not Smad2. Our data suggest a role for PI3K and Akt in the mechanism by which IGF-I blocks TGF-β-induced transcription. PI3K inhibitor LY294002, dominant-negative PI3K (Δp85α), and the PI3P phosphatase, PTEN, can inhibit transcriptional activation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter construct, 3TP-luciferase. LY204002 also reverses the IGF-I-promoted inhibition of Smad3 activation by TGF-β1. Moreover, transfection of CA-Akt or CA-PI3K, but not wild-type Akt, mimics IGF-I in blocking TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses. Finally, DN-Akt or rapamycin inhibit the IGF-I-promoted suppression of TGF-β-induced 3TP-luciferase, suggesting that suppression by IGF-I is down-stream of Akt and mTOR.

Cell Culture—The NRP-152, NRP-154, and DP-153 prostatic epithelial cell lines were maintained in GM2 culture medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.1 μm dexamethasone) in Nunc 80-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cells were kept at 37 °C in a 95% air/5% CO2 environment and was passaged every 3–4 days (at subconfluence), plating at a seeding density of 1:40. All experiments were performed under low serum conditions, where cells were cultured in GM3 medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% calf serum, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 μm dexamethasone). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA purified from NRP-152 cells by the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen) was electrophoresed (5–10 μg/lane) through a 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and 0.7 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Equal loading and even transfer were assessed by visualization of the 18 and 28 S rRNAs. To enhance RNA transfer, gels following electrophoresis were soaked in 60 mm NaOH (20 min) and then 10 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (20 min). Total RNA was next transferred by capillary action to Nytran (0.45 micropore) (Schleicher & Schuell) for 16–20 h with 10× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA. Nytran membranes were cross-linked using UV irradiation and prehybridized, hybridized, and washed following the Church and Gilbert method (46Danielpour D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The presence of indicated mRNA was detected with cDNA probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using Prime® RmT Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene). Expression level of mRNA was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were plated overnight at a density of 4 × 105 cells/2 ml of GM3 medium/well in 6-well plates. LR3-IGF-I (2 nm) was added to cells 6 or 24 h before the addition of TGF-β1, and cells were incubated in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for up to 24 h. Following treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, Complete Mini-EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture™ (47Larisch-Bloch S.

Lysates were clarified at 14,500 rpm for 20 min (at 4 °C), and supernatants were quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For TGF-β receptor Western blots, clarified lysates were deglycosylated by incubation with peptide N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Deglycosylated (20 μg of protein) or non-deglycosylated (50 μg of protein) lysates were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, electrophoresed through 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% thimerosal and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory). Antibodies used were anti-p-AKT (Ser-473) (1:1000), anti-AKT (1:1000), anti-p-Smad2 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling), anti-Smad2 (1:1000) (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Smad4 (1:100,000), anti-Smad3 (1:1000), anti-cyclin D2 (1: 1000), anti-TβRI (1:1000), and anti-TβRII (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Anti-p-Smad3 (1:1000) was developed by Dr. Michael Reiss (44Liu C. Gaca M.D. Swenson E.S. Vellucci V.F. Reiss M. Wells R.G. J. Biol.

DNA Fragmentation Assay—Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected using the TACS™ apoptotic DNA laddering kit (Trevigen®). NRP-152 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/2 ml/well in 6-well plates with GM3 and incubated overnight for attachment. Cells were then treated with or without LR3-IGF-I for 24 h prior to TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) addition. After 24 h, cells were detached by trypsinization, cell pellets were suspended in 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and DNA was purified as described by the manufacturer. The nicked ends of 1 μg of DNA were labeled for 10 min at room temperature using 2.5 units of Klenow polymerase and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3 Ci/μmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One-third of the labeled DNA was electrophoresed through a 2.0% Trevigel™ 500 gel in standard 1× Tris/Acetate/EDTA solution at 70 V for 2 h. The gel was dried and directly exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—NRP-152, NRP-154, and DP-153 cells were plated overnight at a density of either 1 × 105 cells/1 ml/well or 2 × 105 cells/2 ml/well in 12- or 6-well dishes, respectively. Reporter constructs, 1–2 μg, were co-transfected with 12.5–25 ng of CMV-Renilla reporter construct using a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitate was washed away 3 h later, and cells were glycerol-shocked (15% glycerol in 1× HEPES-buffered saline) for 90 s. Cells were washed twice, allowed to recover overnight in GM3 medium, and then treated with LR3-IGF-I (2 nm) for 24 h followed by TGF-β1 for 24 h. For experiments using LY294002, cells were allowed to recover for 2 h after transfection and treated with either vehicle or LY294002 for 2 h, followed by vehicle or LR3-IGF-I for 6 h and then with TGF-β1 for 24 h before harvesting. Luciferase activity was measured using Promega's Dual luciferase assay kit and a ML3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer. Receptor Cross-linking Assay—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates with either 2 nm LR3-IGF-I or 1 μm insulin for 24 h and washed twice with cold binding buffer (bicarbonate-free minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and medium replaced with 1 ml of the above cold binding buffer containing 100 pm125I-TGF-β1 either without or with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 (48Danielpour D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 142: 29-37PubMed Google Scholar). A parallel set of plates treated identically but without isotope were used to determine cell number using a Coulter counter. The radiolabeled cells were then incubated on a rocking shaker (30 cycles/min) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed twice with 2 ml of cold wash Buffer 1 (binding buffer without bovine serum albumin), and treated with 1 ml of 300 μm disuccinimidyl suberate in Buffer 1. Cells were incubated on a rocking platform for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold wash Buffer 2 (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), and collected with a cell scraper in the presence of 0.7 ml of wash Buffer 2 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and transferred to a microfuge tube. Cells were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 min, resuspended in 80 μl of solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), extracted for 40 min at 4 °C on a shaker, clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and analyzed by autoradiography following electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gel. We have shown previously (5Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar) that TGF-β1 induces apoptosis of non-tumorigenic NRP-152 cells in vitro. Apoptosis of these cells is strictly dependent on culture conditions, because insulin and IGF-I specifically block whereas dexamethasone enhances the ability of TGF-β1 to induce their apoptosis (5Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of IGF-I that are independent of IGF-I-binding proteins, which are secreted by these cells, 2D. Danielpour and M. M. Rechler, unpublished data. we used an analogue of IGF-I (LR3-IGF-I) that binds to the IGF-I receptor with equivalent affinity as IGF-I but binds poorly to IGF-I-binding proteins. This analogue is about 500-fold more active than IGF-I in blocking TGF-β-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A) and can block apoptosis by >95% at all concentrations of TGF-β used (Fig. 1B). In contrast to previous reports, in NRP-152 cells LR3-IGF-I is unable to block apoptosis triggered by most inducers of apoptosis tested on these cells (5Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that IGF-I functions specifically by blocking early signals important to the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β. To test our hypothesis that IGF-I is able to inhibit TGF-β signaling, we determined whether IGF-I can also suppress the ability of TGF-β to regulate the expression of several genes in NRP-152 cells. We showed that LR3-IGF-I significantly blocked the down-regulation of the serpin Trespin (see Ref. 13Stewart L.V. Song K. Hsing A.Y. Danielpour D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 301-313Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A) and the up-regulation of thrombospondin-I (Fig. 2B) and fibronectin (data not shown) expression by TGF-β1 treatment. To better characterize how IGF-I intercepts TGF-β signaling in NRP-152 cells, we determined whether LR3-IGF-I affects the activity of TGF-β1 on TGF-β-responsive promoters. For this, NRP-152 cells were co-transfected with the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter reporter construct (3TP-luciferase) and a constitutive promoter construct, cmv-Renilla. TGF-β1 was added after overnight treatment with LR3-IGF-I, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h following TGF-β1 addition. When firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase to cancel differences in transfection efficiency and cell viability by these treatments, our results indicated that LR3-IGF-I significantly inhibits plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter activity induced by TGF-β1 in NRP-152 cells (Fig. 3A). We obtained similar results when this was examined in another IGF-I- and TGF-β-responsive rat prostatic cell line, DP-153 (Fig. 3B). The NRP-154 rat prostatic cell line that undergoes apoptosis by TGF-βs but that is not blocked by IGF-I (5Hsing A.Y. Kadomatsu K. Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5146-5149PubMed Google Scholar) was examined similarly. As expected, induction of 3TP-luciferase activity by TGF-β1 in NRP-154 cells was not blocked by LR3-IGF-I (Fig. 3C). We next investigated the effect of LR3-IGF-I on the activation by TGF-β1 of several minimal promoter response element (SBE, AP1, SRE, SRF, NF-κB) reporter constructs. Similar to 3TP-luciferase activity, LR3-IGF-I significantly blocked the activation by TGF-β of the Smad binding element construct, SBE4BV-luciferase (Fig. 3D), AP1-luciferase, SRF-luciferase, SRE-luciferase, and NF-κB-luciferase (Fig. 4, A–D).

We report the generation and characterization of Kv1.3-deficient (Kv1.3 –/–) mice. In contrast to wild-type cells, the majority of Kv1.3 –/– thymocytes had no detectable voltage-dependent potassium current, although RNA and protein for several potassium channel subunits were found in the thymocyte population. Surprisingly, the level of chloride current in the Kv1.3 –/– thymocytes was increased approximately 50-fold over that in wild-type cells. There were no abnormalities in lymphocyte types or absolute numbers in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes and no obvious defect in thymocyte apoptosis or T cell proliferation in the Kv1.3 –/– animals. The compensatory effects of the enhanced chloride current may account for the apparent lack of immune system defects in Kv1.3 –/–mice.

The voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.3, is expressed in B and T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages (for review, see Ref. 1Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev.

Likewise, Kv1.3-like currents, termed n-type currents, increase after mitogen stimulation of splenic and lymph node T cells from several mouse strains (7McKinnon D. Ceredig R. J. Exp.

Kv1.3-like (n-type) currents are differentially expressed in mouse thymocyte subsets and splenocytes, but there are some discrepancies in the literature. Very small n-type currents were reported for CD4–CD8– thymocytes in some studies (7McKinnon D. Ceredig R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1846-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8DeCoursey T.E.

Cahalan M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moderate currents were seen in CD4+CD8– thymocytes (7McKinnon D. Ceredig R. J. Exp.

A proposed common role for Kv1.3 in these functions is to maintain the conditions necessary for a sustained rise in intracellular Ca2+. Following stimulation of the T cell receptor, production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate causes a transient release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores followed by a sustained Ca2+ influx that is required for full activation (19Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 20Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Kv1.3 channels help to maintain a negative membrane potential (Nernst potential for K+ is about –85 mV) and a large driving force for Ca2+ entry through Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ channels (21Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). We have now generated Kv1.3-deficient (Kv1.3 –/–) mice to determine whether they have compromised thymocyte development or peripheral T cell activation. Despite an increase in levels of transcripts and protein for certain other potassium channel subunits (Kv1.1 and Kv1.4) in the total Kv1.3 –/– thymocyte population, deletion of the Kv1.3 gene results in the complete loss of voltage-dependent potassium current in the majority of thymocytes. Surprisingly, this is accompanied by an approximately 50-fold increase in chloride conductance. Because chloride channels would be expected to maintain negative membrane potentials in lymphocytes, this compensatory change in membrane permeability may account for the apparent absence of abnormalities in the immune responses of Kv1.3 –/– animals. Generation of Kv1.3-deficient Mice—The Kv1.3 gene was isolated from a lambda Fix II 129Sv/J library (Stratagene) using a 5′ region of the rat homologue (GenBank™ number m30441) as a probe. The identity of the clone was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The rat Kv1.3-coding sequence (GenBank™ number m30441) possesses particular PvuII and SacI sites that are unique among members of the Kv1 family, as well as ScaI (used in the targeting strategy), HincII, PstI, and SmaI sites. The targeted region spans an 8.2-kbp region between an upstream BamHI site and the 3′-end of the lambda Fix II genomic clone (see Fig. 1). The BamHI site was subsequently eliminated by Klenow polymerase end-filling and re-ligation. The construct was then linearized with XhoI by partial digestion, and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene cassette (22McKnight S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5949-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was inserted into the vector XhoI site at the 3′-end of the targeted region after Klenow end-filling. An XhoI/SalI neomycin resistance cassette from pMC1neopA (Stratagene) was then inserted into the XhoI site 5′ of Kv1.3 in the opposite orientation to Kv1.3. This regenerates the XhoI site downstream of the neomycin resistance cassette (see Fig. 1). The 1.8-kbp XhoI/ScaI region of Kv1.3 was then excised, and the construct was re-ligated after Klenow end-filling. The left and right arms of the targeting construct are 4.5 and 1.8 kbp, respectively. The targeting vector was linearized at a NotI site (see Fig. 1), and 25 μg was used to electroporate 107 W9.5 embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cells were then plated onto mitomycin C-treated embryonic fibroblasts, and drug selection was begun 24 h later with 2 μm gancyclovir (Syntex) and 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Embryonic stem cell clones and mice were screened by BamHI-digest Southern blot analysis with probes X and Y (see Fig. 1). Probe X is a 1.5-kbp EcoRI region, and probe Y is a 0.5-kbp HincII/SalI fragment at the 3′-end of the genomic clone. Homologous recombinant embryonic stem cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and chimeric males were bred to C57BL/6 females. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines. Fluorocytometry—Cells were recovered into 10 ml of Bruff's medium/5% fetal calf serum (FCS) 1The abbreviations used are: FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphatebuffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; 7-AAD, 7-amino actinomycin D; DiOC6, 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; NPPB, 4-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; TEA, tetraethylammonium; AgTx-2, agitoxin-2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RT, reverse transcription; SK, small-conductance k channel; ConA, concanavalin A. from thymus, spleen, and/or mesenteric lymph nodes by using the plunger of a syringe to tease the tissues between two pieces of 0.1-mm nylon mesh (Small Parts, Inc.). Splenocytes were centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, re-suspended in 2 ml of erythroid cell lysis buffer (Biofluids), and then made up to 10 ml with PBS. All cell suspensions were then filtered through the 0.1-mm nylon mesh and centrifuged at 1000 rpm in a bench top centrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min. Finally, cells were re-suspended in 10 ml of Bruff's/5% FCS for counting in a hemacytometer. Aliquots of 106 cells were made into 0.2 ml of PBS/1% FCS supplemented with 5 μg/ml FcBlock (BD Pharmingen). Samples were left on ice for 30 min before primary antibodies were added and left on ice in the dark for a further 1 h. Samples were washed in 1.2 ml of PBS/1% FCS before centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Secondary antibody incubation and washing were done as above. Four-color fluorocytometry employed a FACSCalibur with argon and helium-neon lasers (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with CellQuest software by first gating on lymphocytes/lymphoblasts, based on forward and side scatter. BD Pharmingen antibodies and other reagents used included anti-IgD (clone 11-26c.2a)-FITC, anti-αβ T cell receptor (clone H57-597)-biotin, anti-CD3e (clone 2C11)-FITC, anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5)-allophycocyanin, anti-CD8a (clone 53-6.7)-allophycocyanin, anti-CD24 (clone M1/69)-biotin, anti-CD44 (clone IM7)-Cy-Chrome, anti-CD45R (B220, clone RA3-6B2)-Cy-Chrome, anti-CD45R (B220, clone RA3-6B2)phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD62L (clone Mel-14)-PE, streptavidin-Cy-Chrome, streptavidin-PE, and annexin V-PE. Anti-mouse IgM (donkey polyclonal)-Cy5 was from Jackson Immunochemicals Inc. Apoptosis Assays—Thymocytes were prepared in Bruff's/5% FCS as above and used in two types of apoptosis assays. In one assay, aliquots of 106 cells/ml were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 2 μm staurosporine (Clontech), or medium alone in 24-well plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 6 h. Alternatively, aliquots were treated with 10 μg of immobilized anti-CD3 antibody (clone 2C11; grown in-house), 10 μg of immobilized anti-Fas antibody (clone Jo2; BD Pharmingen), or medium alone in 24-well plates for 24 h as above. Ultraviolet light treatment was for 5 min on a standard transilluminator followed by culturing for 24 h. Thymocytes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 0.1 ml of annexin V-staining buffer (BD Pharmingen) containing 1 μg/ml 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD, Calbiochem), 20 μg/ml annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen), and 20 μm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6, Molecular Probes). Samples were then left at room temperature in the dark for 20 min before being made up to 0.5 ml with annexin V-staining buffer for fluorocytometry, as above. Percentages of thymocytes that were “live” (7-AAD-low), annexin-V (Ann) positive or negative and DiOC6 positive or negative were then determined from the fluorocytometry data and represented as mean percentage of thymocytes ± S.D. from three mice per group. 7-AAD is a fluorescent DNA stain that allows discrimination of live cells from necrotic and late-apoptotic cells that have lost cell membrane integrity (23Schmid I. Uittenbogaart C.H. Keld B. Giorgi J.V. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine and as such is useful in fluorescent-conjugated forms for visualizing aberrant phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer cell membrane surface that occurs early in apoptosis (24Koopman G.

DiOC6 is a cationic, lipophilic fluorescent dye that is used to monitor changes in mitochondrial membrane integrity, which also constitutes an early event in apoptosis (26Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar). T Cell Stimulation Assays—Splenocytes were prepared in Bruff's/5% FCS as described above, and 0.2 ml of 5 × 105 cell aliquots was placed in 96-well plates. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator with or without 1–30 μg/ml concanavalin A (Roche Applied Science) or 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 (2C11). After 48 h, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well for a further 16 h. Thymidine incorporation was then determined with a Wallac plate cell harvester and scintillation counter. RT-PCR—RNA was prepared from thymocytes and brain using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNase I digestion (0.1 unit/ml, 15 min, 37 °C, Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate genomic contamination. First strand cDNA was synthesized as described (Amersham Biosciences) using an oligo(dT)-based primer. The cDNA was then used for PCR with gene-specific primers for several K+ and Cl– genes and the housekeeping gene, β-actin (see Table I for primer sequences and predicted product sizes; see also Ref. 6Khanna R.

Following a 20-min incubation on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (25 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: Kv1.1 (1:50 dilution), Kv1.3 (1:200), ClC-2 (1:150), and ClC-3 (1:200; all from Alomone Labs) and Kv1.4 (1:1000; see Ref. 27Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Kv4.2 (1:750; see Ref. 28Wickenden A.D. Tsushima R.G. Losito V.A. Kaprielian R. Backx P.H. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 9: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cedarlane Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Labeled proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) on XAR-2 film (Kodak) and signals were quantified by densitometry (Bio-Rad model GS-670). Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents for Western blotting were from Sigma. Chemicals and Solutions—All salts and buffers were purchased from Sigma, as were several ion-channel blockers: the Cl–-channel blockers, 4-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and the K+-channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). Agitoxin-2 (AgTx-2) was from Alomone Laboratories. Stock solutions of NPPB (500 mm) and DIDS (500 mm) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. When Me2SO was used as the solvent, the maximal final concentration in the bathing solution was about 0.2%. Thus, control recordings included 0.2% Me2SO in the bath solution. Stock solutions of AgTx-2 (1 μm) and charybdotoxin (50 μm) were made in standard bath medium (see below) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) to prevent adhesion to surfaces, and stored at –20 °C. Control recordings were done by adding 0.1% BSA to the bath solution. Patch-clamp Electrophysiology—Thymocytes were prepared as above and then washed five times in RPMI 1640/l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Invitrogen). Whole-cell currents were measured using an Axopatch 200 amplifier and pCLAMP version 6.04 software (both from Axon Instruments). Patch electrodes of resistance 8–12 MΩ were pulled from thick-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments). During data acquisition, capacitive currents were canceled by analog subtraction, and all currents were filtered at 2 kHz via the amplifier. Data analysis was performed using pCLAMP and Origin (version 5, Microcal Software), and curve fitting used the iterative Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm of non-linear regression. All recordings were made at room temperature (18–21 °C). All data were corrected for junction potentials between bath and pipette solutions. The standard bathing solution contained (mm): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4. The standard pipette solution contained (mm): 145 K aspartate, 1 K4BAPTA, 5 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 0.09 CaCl2, 2 K2ATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The resulting low Ca2+ (10 nm) pipette solution allowed Cl– currents and voltage-gated K+ currents to be monitored without contaminating Ca2+-activated currents. Fresh K2ATP (Sigma) was added to pipette solutions just before use to help maintain channel activity during whole-cell recording. Occasionally, to isolate K+ currents, Cl– currents were reduced by substituting aspartate for most of the Cl– in the bath. Generation of Kv1.3-deficient Mice—Mice deficient in Kv1.3 (Kv1.3 –/– mice) were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells using conventional techniques (Fig. 1). Our strategy deletes a 1.8-kbp region of Kv1.3 that includes the promoter/transcriptional start site and a 5′-region of the coding sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). Kv1.3 –/– mice were initially obtained by interbreeding Kv1.3 +/– mice. Kv1.3 –/– mice were born at a normal Mendelian ratio, and subsequent interbreeding of Kv1.3 –/– mice did not reveal any obvious lack of breeding or reduced litter sizes. Kv1.3 is expressed in certain regions of mouse brain (29Kues W.A. Wunder F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (see the introduction). To verify the loss of Kv1.3 transcription, RT-PCR was conducted with RNA from thymus and brain cortex of 3- to 6-week-old mice (Fig. 1C). Although a Kv1.3 RT-PCR product was easily demonstrable with RNA from Kv1.3 +/+ thymus and brain cortex, this product could not be generated with RNA from Kv1.3 –/– tissues (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D) and patch-clamping of Kv1.3 –/– thymocytes (see below) also confirmed the complete absence of Kv1.3. Whole-cell Currents in Kv1.3 + / + and Kv1.3 – / – Thymocytes—Thymocyte currents were recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration. Most recordings were expected to be from CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, because they represent ∼85% of thymocytes in both Kv1.3 +/+ mice and Kv1.3 –/– mice (see later and Table III below). Consistent with a previous report that CD4+CD8+ thymocytes in Kv1.3 +/+ mice have a large n-type current (11Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the predominant current in Kv1.3 +/+ thymocytes strongly resembled Kv1.3 (Fig. 2A). Biophysical features in common with Kv1.3 (1Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 30Chung I. Schlichter L.C. J. Membr.

Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 639-669Google Scholar) include time-dependent activation with depolarization at about –30 mV, inactivation during prolonged depolarizing steps, and use-dependent inactivation. Although we did not examine details of kinetics and voltage dependence of the Kv current, about 30% inactivation was seen (e.g. Fig. 2A) with voltage pulses of 200-ms duration (which are relatively short). Faster inactivation has been observed for the Kv1.3 current (formerly called “n”-type); e.g. a time constant of ∼100 ms (at +40 mV) in mouse thymocytes and ∼180 ms in human T cells (8DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, Kv1.3 inactivation is affected by many factors, including temperature, internal and external divalent ions, and the type of internal anion. In particular, intracellular fluoride was previously used (8DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 379-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this accelerates inactivation (33Pahapill P.A. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. 1992; 445: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) compared with aspartate, which we used in the present study. Also consistent with Kv1.3, there was complete block by AgTx-2, a scorpion toxin that blocks Kv1.3 at very low concentrations (Kd ∼ 4 pm (34Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Schmalhofer W. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 425-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)). We found that 2 nm (not shown) and 5 nm AgTx-2 (Fig. 2A, middle panel) blocked the time-dependent current completely. The current remaining after AgTx-2 treatment of Kv1.3 +/+ cells was only about 20% of control levels and was insensitive to the anion channel blocker, NPPB (0.1 mm) (Fig. 2A, lower panel). For Kv1.3 +/+ thymocytes, only two channels among those whose transcripts were found (see below) are apparently inhibited by AgTx-2 (34Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Koch R. Schmalhofer W. Slaughter R.S. Kaczorowski G.J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 425-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar): Kv1.3 (Kd ∼ 4 pm) and Kv1.6 (Kd ∼ 40 pm). Although Kv1.1 is also blocked (Kd ∼ 40 pm), it was not detected in Kv1.3 +/+ thymocytes. Because we used 2 or 5 nm AgTx-2, in principle, Kv1.6 expression could also contribute to the current in Kv1.3 +/+ thymocytes. One possibility is that Kv1.6 may not form functional channels on the cell surface of thymocytes, because Kv1.6 transcripts were also present in Kv1.3 –/– cells, but there was no Kv current (see below). Although we cannot rule out a difference in Kv1.6 activity in the two mice strains, the simplest interpretation is that Kv1.3 accounts for the AgTx-2-sensitive current in thymocytes from wild-type mice.Table IIINormal lymphocyte numbers and types in Kv1.3 –/– miceKv1.3+/+ miceKv1.3-/- miceTotal thymocytes (millions)173.3 ± 17.9165.0 ± 44.5CD4+ thymocytes (% of total)6.6 ± 0.37.7 ± 1.0CD8+ thymocytes (% of total)2.8 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.6CD4- CD8- thymocytes (% of total)2.3 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.3Total splenocytes (millions)96.7 ± 25.796.0 ± 14.0CD4+ splenocytes (% of total)20.5 ± 2.021.3 ± 2.2CD8+ splenocytes (% of total)12.5 ± 1.112.4 ± 2.1CD4+ CD44hi CD62Llo memory T cells (% of CD4+)13.9 ± 3.410.6 ± 3.5 Open table in a new tab In contrast to Kv1.3 +/+ cells, no AgTx-2-sensitive current could be detected in cells from Kv1.3 –/– mice. Instead, a substantial time-independent current appeared (Fig. 2B), the properties of which closely matched those of the small conductance chloride current in human T cells (35Schumacher P.A. Sakellaropoulos G. Phipps D.J. Schlichter L.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The current was blocked by 0.1 mm NPPB (Fig. 2B, middle panel), a well known blocker of whole-cell Cl– current in normal human T lymphocytes (35Schumacher P.A. Sakellaropoulos G. Phipps D.J.

https://openalex.org/W1979443248,"C3/C5 convertase is a serine protease that cleaves C3 and C5. In the present study we examined the C5 cleaving properties of classical pathway C3/C5 convertase either bound to the surface of sheep erythrocytes or in its free soluble form. Kinetic parameters revealed that the soluble form of the enzyme (C4b,C2a) cleaved C5 at a catalytic rate similar to that of the surface-bound form (EAC1,C4b,C2a). However, both forms of the enzyme exhibited a poor affinity for the substrate, C5, as indicated by a high Km (6–9 μm). Increasing the density of C4b on the cell surface from 8,000 to 172,000 C4b/cell did not influence the Km. Very high affinity C5 convertases were generated only when the low affinity C3/C5 convertases (EAC1,C4b,C2a) were allowed to deposit C3b by cleaving native C3. These C3b-containing C3/C5 convertases exhibited Km (0.0051 μm) well below the normal concentration of C5 in blood (0.37 μm). The data suggest that C3/C5 convertase assembled with either monomeric C4b or C4b-C4b complexes are inefficient in capturing C5 but cleave C3 opsonizing the cell surface with C3b for phagocytosis. Deposition of C3b converts the enzymes to high affinity C5 convertases, which cleave C5 in blood at catalytic rates approaching V max, thereby switching from C3 to C5 cleavage. Comparison of the kinetic parameters with those of the alternative pathway convertase indicates that the 6–9-fold greater catalytic rate of the classical pathway C5 convertase may compensate for the fewer numbers of C5 convertase sites generated upon activation of this pathway.

Activation of complement is essential to the innate and adaptive immune response of the body to infections. Complement helps fight infections and clear immune complexes in blood by generating products that have numerous biological activities (1Reid K.B.M. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1998: 68-86Google Scholar, 2Reid K.B.M. Rother K. Till G.O. Hänsch G.M. The Complement System.

Cleavage products, C3b 1The abbreviations used are: C3b, C4b, and C5b, the proteolytically activated form of C3, C4, and C5, respectively; EC, chicken erythrocytes; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; EA, antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes; CVF, cobra venom factor. and C4b, generated upon the activation of the third (C3) and fourth (C4) components of complement serve the important function of opsonizing foreign particles. Opsonized particles are recognized by C3/C4 receptors on macrophages, and upon attachment are cleared by phagocytosis. In addition, C3b and C4b form the noncatalytic subunits of the C3/C5 convertase. Cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase is the last enzymatic step in the complement activation cascade. The cleavage products of C5, C5a and C5b, initiate important defensive reactions. C5b, the larger fragment, initiates the formation of membrane attack complex (cytolytic C5b-9 complex) that helps destroy microorganisms. C5a, the smaller fragment, is a spasmogenic and chemotactic anaphylatoxin that mediates inflammatory responses at the site of injury (4Ember J.A. Jagels M.A. Hugli T.E. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M.

Analysis of C5 convertases has been difficult because the enzyme in its most active form is a multimeric complex that is formed on the surfaces of biological organisms. Earlier studies on C5 convertases examined the affinity (Kd) of C5 for the non-enzymatic subunits, C3b or C4b, in the fluid phase and on surfaces (11Vogt W. Schmidt G. Von Buttlar B. Dieminger L.

The bimolecular serine protease, C3b,Bb assembled with monomeric C3b, cleaves C5 without the help of a second C3b molecule at a catalytic rate similar to that of the surface-bound C5 convertase on zymosan particles (ZymC3b,Bb). The findings were unexpected because it was thought that activation of C5 by a C3 convertase occurred only in the presence of an additional C3b molecule. The natural surface-bound C5 convertases are formed from the simple bimolecular C3 convertases by attachment of additional C3b molecules (11Vogt W. Schmidt G. Von Buttlar B. Dieminger L.

Trans. 2002; 30: 1006-1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that high densities of C3b and C3b complexes increased the affinity for C5 up to a 1000-fold. In the present study we have determined the kinetic properties (Km and k cat) of the classical pathway C5 convertase by analyzing C5b,6 production under physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The data show that both soluble and surface-bound forms of the classical pathway C3/C5 convertase (C4b,C2a), assembled with C4b as the noncatalytic subunit, cleave C5 without the aid of an additional C3b molecule. In contrast to the formation of high affinity C5 convertases of the alternative pathway, high densities of the noncatalytic subunit (C4b), resulting in the generation of C4b-C4b complexes, did not form high affinity C5 sites via the classical pathway. The C4b-dependent convertases of the classical pathway because of their weak affinity for C5 primarily function as C3 convertases. As C3b deposition occurs, C3b-containing complexes are formed (C3b-C4b complexes). These complexes form high affinity C5 convertases (C3bC4b,C2a) of the classical pathway and mainly cleave C5 leading to a higher production of the cytolytic C5b-9 complex. Reagents—Chicken erythrocytes (EC) were isolated from chicken blood purchased from Colorado Serum Co. (Denver, CO). Nonidet P-40, a non-ionic detergent, Thimerosal, Tween 20, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Immobilon-P transfer membrane was purchased from Fisher. Veronal-buffered saline contained 5 mm barbital, 145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Gelatin veronal-buffered saline (GVB) was veronal-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin, and GVB2+ was GVB containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.15 mm CaCl2; GVBE was GVB containing 10 mm EDTA.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were all purified from normal human plasma as described in the references cited. C5 was purified from normal human plasma as described (33Tack B.F. Prahl J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4513-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) except that ceramic hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) was used instead of hydroxyapatite. Complement components C1, activated C1s, C4, and purified C5b,6 were obtained from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego). C4 was further purified over an anti-C3-Sepharose column to remove any traces of C3. All proteins were homogeneous by PAGE. The functional activity of various purified proteins, determined by densitometric analysis of the cleaved protein on SDS-PAGE, was observed to be greater than 95%. Protein concentrations of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C5b,6 were determined spectrophotometrically using 10.0, 11.0, 10.3, 11.0, 10.8, and 10.3, as the value for E280nm1&x0025; , respectively. All purified proteins were stored at –76 °C. M r values employed in the calculations were 204,000 for C4, 195,000 for C4b, 176,000 for C3b, 190,000 for C5, 179,000 for C5b, 120,000 for C6, 299,000 for C5b,6, 102,000 for C2, and 70,000 for C2a. Preparation of Monomeric C4b—Purification of C4 from human plasma resulted in about 20% activation of C4 to C4b. C4b generated this way was separated from C4 during the ion-exchange chromatography step of C4 purification on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The C4b, 95% monomeric in composition was separated from trace amounts of C4b-C4b dimers by gel filtration on G4000SW column (Tosohaas) employing fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The purified C4b monomers (>99% pure) as well as the separated C4b-C4b dimers (>99% pure) were then employed separately to generate soluble forms of classical pathway C5 convertase (C4b,C2a and C4bC4b,C2a). In addition, C4b purchased from a commercial source (Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego) was also employed to assemble soluble C5 convertase, C4b,C2a, after purification by gel filtration. Preparation of EAC1,C4b and EAC1,C3bC4b Cells—Antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) were prepared as described (34Harbeck R.J. Giclas P.C. Diagnostic Immunology Laboratory Manual. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 49Google Scholar). EA bearing C1 (EAC1) were prepared by incubating 85 μl of EA cells (at 6.8 × 108 cells/ml) with 85 μl of human C1 (0.2 mg/ml) for 20 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed with GVB2+ to remove unbound C1, resuspended in 60 μl of GVB2+, and incubated with an equal volume of C4 (either labeled with 125I or unlabeled) at 4 mg/ml for 20 min at 22 °C. The total number of C4b deposited on washed EAC1,C4b cells was determined by the uptake of radiolabeled C4 as C4b. The number of C4b deposited on EAC1 cells was adjusted by varying the amount of C4 given so as to obtain different densities ranging from ∼8,000 to 172,000 C4b/cell. EA cells were employed as controls for background C4b binding. EAC1,C4b cells were converted to EAC1,C3bC4b cells by incubating 0.62 × 108 cells with 1.0 μl of human C2 at 1.0 mg/ml and 20 μl of C3 (either labeled with 125I or unlabeled) at 0.74 mg/ml for 20 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed five times with GVB2+ to remove unbound C2 and C3. The total number of radiolabeled C3b molecules bound to EAC1,C3bC4b was determined by using 125I-C3 (35Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2416-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) as described for alternative pathway C5 convertases (16Rawal N. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16828-16835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EAC1,C3bC4b cells were washed, and the procedure was repeated until the desired numbers of C3b/EA were obtained. EA cells that had no C1 were employed as controls for background C3b binding. Formation and Assay of C5 Convertases, EAC1,C4b,C2a and EAC1,C3bC4b,C2a—Because formation of C5 convertase was found to require less than a minute, the convertase was formed in the same reaction mixture in which assays were done. Enzyme velocities were determined under saturating concentrations of C2 and C6 in 0.5 ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Assay mixtures contained varying concentrations of C5 (preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C to reduce freeze/thaw-generated background C5b,6-like activity), C2 (0.36 μg), C6 (2.5 μg), and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Reactions were started with the addition of EAC1,C4b or EAC1,C3bC4b. The concentration of cells was adjusted so as to have 0.5–3 ng of bound C2a in a final volume of 25 μl of GVB2+ resulting in 0.29–1.7 nm enzyme in the assays. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, further cleavage of C5 was prevented by transferring assay tubes to an ice bath and adding ice-cold GVBE. Appropriately diluted assay mixtures were titrated for C5b,6 formation by hemolytic assays using EC as described (16Rawal N. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16828-16835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Controls showed that the cold temperature and dilution were sufficient to reduce cleavage of C5 during subsequent steps to undetectable levels. For the soluble enzyme, C4b,C2a, limiting amounts of C4b were added to assay mixtures containing varying concentrations of C5, saturating concentrations of C2 (0.36 μg) and C6 (2.5 μg), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and activated C1s (4 ng). The reaction was started with the addition of C2, and the amount of C5b,6 formed in 10 min at 37 °C was determined as described below. Because of the short half-life of C5 convertases, excess C2 was added to allow enzyme reformation during assays. Constant levels of enzyme during the 10-min assays at 37 °C were demonstrated by showing that the amount of C5b,6 produced was constant at different time intervals during the assay. Quantitation of Reaction Products—C5b,6 was measured hemolytically by using chicken erythrocytes (EC), which are sensitive to reactive lysis by human C5b,6, as described (16Rawal N. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16828-16835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An aliquot of a diluted sample from C5 convertase assays, EC (1.2 × 107), and 5 μl of pooled normal human serum as a source of complement proteins C7–C9 were added in a final volume of 250 μl of GVBE. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation, and the amount of hemoglobin released was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 414 nm. To determine 100% lysis, EC were lysed in 2% Nonidet P-40. Controls, containing C5 and C6 but no C2, were subtracted as background. Controls, containing C5 convertase but no purified C5 or C6, were kept to ensure that C5b,6 was not formed from the C5 and C6 in the pooled normal human serum used as a source of C7–9 during the lysis of EC. C5b,6 concentration was quantitated from a standard curve using purified C5b,6 as described previously (16Rawal N. Pangburn M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16828-16835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Determination of the Number of C4b Molecules Bound Per Cell—C4b was deposited on cells by incubating EAC1 with radiolabeled C4 at 4.0 mg/ml (specific activity = 0.08 μCi/μg). The procedure was repeated to obtain cells bearing different densities of radiolabeled C4b ranging from 8,000 to 172,000 C4b/cell. The cells were washed and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 25 μl of GVB2+ after which they were diluted with 75 μl of GVB2+. Bound and free radiolabel were separated by layering 75 μl of the mixture on 250 μl of 20% sucrose in GVB2+ and centrifuging for 1 min at 10,000 × g at 22 °C. The amount of radiolabeled C4b bound to cells was measured by cutting the tube and counting the amount of radioactivity in the pellet (35Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2416-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Nonspecific background binding of radiolabeled C4 to EA cells was subtracted. Determination of the C5 Convertase Concentration—The number of C5 convertase sites formed on EAC1,C4b or EAC1,C3bC4b was determined by measuring only those C4b molecules that were capable of forming an enzyme with radiolabeled C2 under saturating conditions. Various amounts of 125I-C2 were incubated with EAC1,C4b or EAC1,C3bC4b cells for 10 min at 37 °C. Bound and free radiolabel were separated as described above. Distribution of radioactivity in the 70-kDa C2a and the 30-kDa C2b fragments was determined by SDS-PAGE of cleaved 125I-C2. The C2a fragment contained 90% of the label. From the specific C2a uptake, the C2a-specific activity, and the C2a molecular weight, the concentration of C5 convertase in the experiment was calculated. Specific C2a uptake was determined after subtracting nonspecific binding and contribution from 125I-labeled C4b and C3b if present in the experiment. Kinetic Measurements of Surface-bound C5 Convertase—Enzyme velocities were determined under saturating concentrations of C2 and C6 in 0.5-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Assay mixtures contained C2 (0.36 μg), C6 (2.5 μg), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of C5. The reaction was started by the addition of EAC1,C3bC4b or EAC1,C4b cells in a final volume of 25 μl of GVB so that 0.5–2 nm C5 convertases were present during the assay. Enzyme concentration was determined by measuring the number of C2a bound as described in the preceding paragraph. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, further cleavage of C5 was prevented by transferring the assay tubes to an ice bath and adding 225 μl of ice-cold GVBE. C5b,6 was titrated by hemolytic assays using EC and quantitated using standard curves generated with purified C5b,6. Kinetic Measurements of Fluid Phase C5 Convertase—The assays employed saturating amounts of C2 (0.36 μg), 20 ng of monomeric soluble C4b, and 0.5 mm MgCl2, varying concentrations of C5, excess C6 (2.5 μg), and GVB2+ in a final volume of 25 μl. The concentration of C5 convertase was assumed to be equivalent to the C4b concentration because preliminary experiments were used to determine the amounts of C2 and activated C1s needed to saturate C4b. Reactions were started with the addition of 4 ng of activated C1s. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by dilution with 200 μl of ice-cold GVBE, and the amount of C5b,6 formed was quantitated using EC. Data Analysis—The reaction velocity data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, ν = V max [S]/(Km + [S]). The results were fit to this equation using nonlinear regression analysis, and the kinetic parameters Km, V max, and k cat were determined using Grafit version 4.12 software (Erithacus Software, Staines, Middlesex, London, UK). Preparation of Radiolabeled Proteins—C2, C3, and C4 (100 μg) were radiolabeled with 125I for 30 min at 0 °C in a glass tube coated with IODO-GEN (Pierce). Free 125I was removed by centrifugal desalting (36Christopherson R.I. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specific activities of radiolabeled C2 ranged from 0.12 to 0.95 μCi/μg. Radiolabeled C3 and C4 were diluted with cold C3 or C4 to give specific activities of 0.01–0.06 μCi/μg. Measurement of the Formation and Decay of C5 Convertase—The rate of formation of surface-bound C5 convertases was determined by assembling the enzyme under saturating concentrations of C2 (0.36 μg) in GVB2+. The reaction was started with the addition of EAC1,C4b or EAC1,C3bC4b. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 min), and enzyme formation was stopped by addition of EDTA. A mixture of C5 (5 μg) and C6 (2.5 μg) was added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the amount of C5b,6 formed was quantitated hemolytically using EC. The rate of formation of the soluble C4b,C2a was determined similarly except that assay mixtures contained limited amounts of activated C1s (4 ng) and C4b (20 ng), and the reaction was started with the addition of C2. The half-life of C5 convertases was measured by pre-making the enzyme for 2 min with C2 (1.2 μg), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 μl of EAC1,C4b (0.38 × 109/ml) bearing 62,000 C4b/cell in a final volume of 100 μl of GVB2+. At zero time additional formation of enzyme was stopped with EDTA. At various time intervals, aliquots (19.5 μl) of the enzyme preparation were withdrawn and assayed for remaining C5 convertase activity by adding 3.5 μl containing C5 (10.6 μg) and C6 (1.94 μg). The amount of C5b,6 formed after 10 min at 37 °C was determined hemolytically using EC. The half-life of surface-bound C5 convertase assembled with C3b-containing complexes (EAC1,C3bC4b,C2a) was determined under assay conditions similar to those described above for EAC1,C4b,C2a, except that EAC1,C3bC4b bearing 55,000 C4b and 292,000 C3b per cell were employed for assembling the enzyme, and a lower amount of C5 (0.05 μg) was used. The rate of decay of soluble C4b,C2a was determined by pre-making the enzyme for 2 min at 37 °C with saturating concentrations of C2 (1.94 μg), 0.5 mm MgCl2, limited amount of activated C1s (0.16 μg), and C4 (0.4 μg) in a final volume of 135 μl of GVB. Additional formation of enzyme was stopped with the addition of EDTA, and the remaining C5 convertase activity was measured using C5 (3.4 μg) and C6 (2.5 μg). The amount of C5b,6 formed after 10 min at 37 °C was determined hemolytically using EC. Western Blot Analysis of C4b Complexes Formed on EAC1,C4b Cells—EAC1,C4b cells were prepared as described above. EA cells bearing C4b or no C4b (25 μl of 0.26 × 109 EA/ml) were lysed with water and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,621 × g. The ghost cells obtained were washed again with water, centrifuged, and suspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with and without 1 μl of 1.4 m dithiothreitol. Samples were boiled and applied on a SDS-PAGE gradient NOVEX gel (4–12%, Invitrogen). The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane for Western blotting. After blocking with blotto, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-human C4 1:5000 in T-TBS as the primary antibody for 30 min at 22 °C. The membrane was washed with T-TBS and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-rabbit anti-goat diluted 1:1000 in T-TBS for 30 min at 22 °C. The membrane was washed with T-TBS and then TBS and then incubated with substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma Fast Tablets, B 5655), to visualize bands. Soluble C4b and EA cells bearing no C4b were employed as controls. Formation and Decay of C5 Convertase—Rapid formation of enzyme during assays was necessary for accurate measurement of activity. Time courses of enzyme formation done under saturating concentrations of C2 (143 nm) at 0.5 mm MgCl2 demonstrated that maximum levels of cell-bound (EAC1,C4b,C2a or EAC1,C3bC4b,C2a) and fluid phase (C4b,C2a) enzymes were achieved in less than a minute under these conditions. The rate of decay of the three C5 convertases was also measured (Fig. 1A). The three C5 convertases decayed at similar rates as indicated by t ½ between 2 and 3 min at 37 °C (EAC1,C4b,C2a = 2 min, EAC1,C3bC4b,C2a = 2½, min and C4b,C2a = 3.0 min). Demonstration of Constant C5 Convertase Levels during Assays—Because C5 convertases have a short half-life of 2–3 min (Fig. 1A), the enzyme decays during an assay. Preliminary experiments were done to determine the concentrations of C2 required to maintain constant amounts of enzyme during a 10-min assay. Fig. 1B s"

The metalloprotease falcilysin has previously been identified as an important component of this catabolic process. Using random peptide substrate analysis, we confirm that recombinant falcilysin is highly active at acidic pH, consistent with its role in hemoglobin degradation. Unexpectedly, the enzyme is also robustly active at neutral pH, but with a substantially different substrate specificity. Imaging studies confirm the location of falcilysin in the food vacuole and reveal association with vesicular structures elsewhere within the parasite.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the deadliest form of human malaria. Each year 500 million infections and up to 2 million deaths are attributed to Plasmodium parasites (1Trigg P.A. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998Google Scholar). This disease is a major public health issue in many areas of the world where the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains underscores the need to identify new drug targets. Examination of the parasite's unique metabolic pathways, such as hemoglobin degradation, provides numerous attractive candidates for chemotherapeutic development. Plasmodium infects and develops within human erythrocytes where hemoglobin is degraded in a semi-ordered cascade of proteases to provide energy and nutrients to the growing parasite (2Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. Rosenthal P.J. Antimalarial Chemotherapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 43-63Google Scholar). Hemoglobin degradation occurs in the unique acidic environment of the food vacuole. A family of aspartic proteases, the plasmepsins, mediates the initial cleavage within a conserved hinge region of the hemoglobin alpha chains (3Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The temporal expression pattern of FLN is similar to that of other globinases yet differs by the absence of proteolytic processing during biosynthesis (11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FLN is a member of the M16 family of the clan ME zinc metalloproteases. This family is characterized by an inverted active site motif of HXXEH (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1360-1362Google Scholar), where the two histidines and a glutamic acid residue located 75–84 residues C-terminal to this motif are involved in coordinating the catalytic zinc ion. The M16 family is divided into subfamilies A and B. Subfamily B includes the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and the chloroplast stromal processing peptidase; both enzymes are involved in removing N-terminal targeting peptides (13Bohni P.

Nature. 1994; 372: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), insulin (18Shii K. Yokono K. Baba S. Roth R.A. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor α (19Gehm B.D. Rosner M.R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All of the subfamily A members are large enzymes (greater than 100 kDa) with the catalytic machinery located in the N terminus. The function of the C terminus remains unknown. In the current study we explore the substrate preferences of FLN. These studies reveal a bimodal pH optimum with starkly different substrate specificities for acidic and neutral pH conditions. Immunolocalization studies reveal a second location for FLN, outside of the acidic food vacuole. These data point to the possibility of an expanded role for this protease in Plasmodium falciparum biology. P. falciparum clone HB3 (Honduras, gift of W. Trager, Rockefeller University) was cultured using the methods of Trager and Jensen (20Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar) in serum-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute media supplemented with 0.5% Albumax (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Synchrony was maintained with sorbitol treatment (21Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified A1219T antibody was generated as previously described (11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For generation of 1624T, polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised (CoCalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA) against a synthetic eight-branch multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) peptide containing residues 603–612 of FLN (KKRIENFNEQ) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Infected RBCs at the trophozoite stage were prepared as previously described (22Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Samples were immunolabeled with rabbit anti-FLN (A1219T, 1:10, or 1624T, 1:1000), mouse anti-PM IV (13.9.2 1:10), rat anti-Bip (1:1000, MR4, J. H. Adams). Secondary antibodies used for detection included fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), Alexa 488 anti-rat IgG, and Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed using a Zeiss axioscope microscope at 1000× magnification. Both αFLN antibodies gave similar results. There was no difference in FLN distribution in trophozoites or schizonts. Infected RBCs were processed as described previously (22Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) except for the fixation, which used 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde, and the staining, which utilized 0.3% uranyl acetate/2% methyl cellulose. Immunolabeling used rabbit anti-FLN (1624T, 1:1000) and rat anti-Bip (1:1000) with species-specific 18- and 12-nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. Synchronized mid-stage trophozoite culture (∼5 × 108 parasites) was labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, parasites were harvested in a 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) with protease inhibitors. Parasites were disrupted via sonication and divided into equal portions, which were centrifuged for 1 h at 214,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml in one of several solutions: PBS, 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11), or 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Extraction proceeded for 1 h on ice followed by a second 214,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were retained. The pellets were solubilized with 1% SDS. Immunoprecipitations with antiserum A1219T (23Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and autoradiography followed. An N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal biotinylated random 10-mer peptide with an isokinetic mixture of 19 amino acids (except cysteine) was synthesized by Dr. Chistoph Turk (University of California, San Francisco). This library was used to determine the P′ motifs. Second generation libraries with fixed P′ positions and five random residues in the P positions were generated at the Tufts University protein core facility (Boston, MA). These libraries had free N termini and biotinylated C termini. The second generation libraries were used to predict preferred residues in the unprimed positions. The predicted optimal substrates were synthesized with DABCYL and EDANS modifications (24Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J.W. Science. 1990; 247: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA) for use in kinetic studies. To Determine the P′ motifs—50 pmol of purified recombinant FLN (11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was incubated with 100 nmol of N-terminally acetylated random 10-mer substrate in 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.2 (acidic conditions), or 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2 (neutral conditions), in 400 μl. Cleavage reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h; samples were then heated to 100 °C for 3 min. Cleavage products were analyzed by Edman degradation (Midwest Analytical, St. Louis, MO). Control pH titrations with the buffers used in these experiments showed insignificant buffer effects on enzyme activity. Amino acid preference for a single position was determined by subtracting a residue's raw abundance in the cleavage reaction from the abundance of the same residue in a control, enzyme-free reaction, which eliminates bias for amino acids eluting at positions with background interference. This corrected abundance was divided by the prevalence of that residue within the 10-mer library, to control for bias present within the library. These data were then normalized to an average amino acid abundance of 1. Similar results were obtained using incubations of 0.5 h and overnight. The data shown are the average of three incubations. To Determine the P motif—Each experiment with a second generation library used substrate incubated with purified rFLN (1000:1 molar ratio), as well as no-enzyme reactions. Incubations proceeded in 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.2 (acidic conditions), or 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2 (neutral conditions), at 37 °C overnight; samples were then heated to 100 °C for 3 min. The sample with enzyme and substrate, along with a substrate-only sample, were incubated with an excess of avidin-Sepharose (0.6 ml) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature to remove the C-terminal portion of the cleavage product along with any uncleaved substrate prior to N-terminal sequence analysis. The abundance of each amino acid was quantified for each position in the cleavage product by first subtracting the abundance of each residue from the library background (substrate only plus avidin). Next, the percent abundance of each corrected residue was divided by the abundance of the same corrected residue in the control, enzyme-free reaction without avidin pull-down. These data were also normalized to 1. There were three independent determinations of the unprimed motif. The data shown represents the average of these experiments. Single Substrate Kinetic Assays—3.5 nm purified rFLN was incubated with the quenched fluorogenic peptides (final concentrations ranging from 0.031 μm to 30 μm) in the presence of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.2, or 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.2, at 37 °C. Each concentration was tested in duplicate or triplicate. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 336 nm (slit width 5) and emission detection at 490 nm (slit width 8) was used to monitor the generation of cleavage products in real-time at 37 °C. The cleavage reaction was followed for 50 s. K m and V max were determined by measuring the initial velocities of product appearance. Apparent k cat values were calculated (k cat = V max/[E]) using the purified enzyme protein concentration (BCA, Pierce) as an estimate of active enzyme. Kinetic analyses were also performed with the optimized substrates over a range of pH conditions with overlapping buffers: pH 3.6–5, NaOAc; pH 5–7, bis-Tris; pH 7–10, Tris. Optimized substrates were compared with fluorogenic α74–75 (AHVD↓DFPN) (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a known FLN globin peptide substrate. rFLN exhibited poor activity (k cat/K m several fold lower than for α74–75) against a decameric version of this globin peptide. Determination of FLN optimal P′ Motifs—Random peptide libraries provide a facile tool to probe enzyme function and selectivity. Previous data indicated that FLN displayed good activity with globin peptide substrates at pH 5.2 but fared poorly with the same substrates at neutral pH (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, falcilysin globin substrates lack a strong consensus sequence (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We therefore pursued a strategy similar to that of Turk et al. (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) to refine FLN cleavage specificity at acidic pH and to investigate the possibility of activity and specificity at neutral pH. Experiments were carried out at pH 5.2 to mimic the pH of the food vacuole and at pH 7.2 to reflect conditions in the rest of the parasite. A random 10-mer library was utilized to determine the primed (P′) side motif of substrates, and a second generation library with fixed P′ positions was used to identify the unprimed (P) motif. As described under “Materials and Methods,” an N-terminal-acetylated, C-terminal-biotinylated random 10-mer library was used to identify residues preferred in the P′ positions. As shown in Fig. 1A, FLN strongly favors bulky hydrophobic amino acids in the P1′ position at both acidic and neutral pH. At P2′, FLN prefers hydrophobic residues at pH 5.2; at pH 7.2, these same residues are abundant but Arg is more strongly preferred. Hydrophobic residues, especially Met, predominate in the P3′ position at both pH conditions. At P4′ and P5′, there is a strong selection of acidic residues at pH 5.2. At neutral pH, the enzyme is much less selective at these positions. An optimal motif for FLN under acidic conditions is FFMEE and under neutral pH conditions is FRMRG. Second Generation Libraries Reveal the FLN P Motif—To determine a motif for the unprimed positions, a second generation C-terminal-biotinylated library was constructed using the P′ motifs and randomized amino acids in the P positions. As shown in Fig. 1B, FLN strongly favors Ser in the P1 position under both acidic and neutral conditions. At the P2 position, Met and His were the most abundant amino acids generated at acidic pH, whereas Asn and His were preferred at neutral pH. At the P3 position, acidic conditions yielded Glu and His; neutral conditions favored Arg and Gly. Asn was highly preferred at the P4 position at pH 5.2. In contrast, neutral pH conditions favored several residues, most prominently Lys. Tyr was the most abundant residue in the P5 position under acidic conditions while Met was highly preferred with neutral conditions. These experiments predict an optimal motif for acidic pH of YNEHS↓FFMEE. A substrate with the sequence MKRHS↓FRMRG should provide optimal cleavage at neutral pH. Kinetic Analysis of Optimized Substrates—Peptide library predictions can be evaluated by measuring the kinetic capabilities of optimized substrates. Our standard of comparison is the peptide α74–75, which is a sequence in the hemoglobin alpha chain recognized by FLN for cleavage (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution and overall importance of both the P and P′ portions of the optimized substrates, we synthesized substrates with a combinatorial approach. Our hypothesis, based on the published experience with other metalloproteases, was that the P motif would be the most important in determining overall catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, we predicted that a sequence optimized under one pH condition would not be as efficient at the opposite pH. The use of quenched fluorogenic substrates enabled us to kinetically assess each substrate by measuring the cleavage in real-time (Table I).Table IKinetic summary of optimized peptidespHKm μmkcat s-1k cat/K m m -1 s -1α74-755.211.5 ± 1.379.5 × 10-3824AHVD ↓ DFPN7.215.3 ± 53.3 × 10-321674-75/P′acid5.20.51 ± 0.052.31 × 10-34,529AHVD ↓ FFMEE7.21.7 ± 0.261.66 × 10-397074-75/P′neut5.24.1 ± 0.81.87 × 10-3457AHVD ↓ FRMRG7.20.81 ± 0.114.23 × 10-35,222Pacid/74-755.20.787 ± 0.11.67 × 10-221,224YNEHS ↓ DFPN7.22.09 ± 0.323.98 × 10-31,906Pneut/74-755.27.42 ± 28.9 × 10-31,200MKRHS ↓ DFPN7.21.07 ± 0.16.62 × 10-261,994Pacid/P′acid5.20.317 ± 0.054.69 × 10-2147,950YNEHS ↓ FFMEE7.20.169 ± 0.021.36 × 10-280,277Pacid/P′neut5.26.27 ± 12.7 × 10-143,242YNEHS ↓ FRMRG7.20.972 ± 0.13.01 × 10-1309,414Pneut/P′neut5.212.1 ± 24.1 × 10-23,371MKRHS ↓ FRMRG7.20.405 ± 0.042.16 × 10-1534,532Pneut/P′acid5.20.5811 ± 0.084.1 × 10-270,258MKRHS ↓ FFMEE7.20.8 ± 0.081.61 × 10-2202,130 Open table in a new tab Analysis of α74–75-based substrates optimized in the P′ positions revealed that manipulation of these C-terminal sequences alone can confer a significant increase in the overall catalytic efficiency. Optimization with the P′ acid sequence (74–75/P′acid) led to a 5.5-fold increase in k cat/K m at pH 5.2. The P′ neutral sequence (74–75/P′neut) bestowed a striking 24-fold increase in catalytic efficiency at pH 7.2. These increases arose mostly from a lower K m, because k cat values remained within the same range. When each substrate was tested at the opposite pH from which it was optimized, there was a decrease in k cat/K m as compared with the preferred pH (a 4.6-fold decrease for P′acid and an 11-fold decrease with P′neutral). Again, this was mostly attributed to differences in substrate binding. The 74–75/P′acid substrate at the disfavored pH 7.2 was still, however, much more efficient than α74–75 (k cat/K m of 970 versus 194). But α74–75 remained a better substrate than 74–75/P′neut at pH 5.2 (k cat/K m of 928 as compared with 457). These data suggest that the P′ region of FLN substrates contributes substantively to catalytic efficiency. Optimization in the P positions of 74–75-based substrates, however, argues that these residues are the greatest determinants of catalytic efficiency (Table I). Pacid/74–75 showed a 23-fold increase in k cat/K m at pH 5.2, as compared with α74–75. We observed a similar pattern with Pneut/74–75, which produced a 320-fold increase in k cat/K m at pH 7.2, as compared with α74–75. When each substrate was tested at the “disfavored” pH, we again observed decreases in catalytic efficiency. At pH 7.2, Pacid/74–75 produced an 11-fold decrease in k cat/K m but remained a better substrate than α74–75 at the same pH. The k cat/K m for Pneut/74–75 dropped 52-fold when the substrate was placed at pH 5.2. Interestingly, when compared with α74–75 at pH 5.2, Pneut/74–75 had a comparable efficiency (k cat/K m of 928 and 1200, respectively). The changes in k cat/K m for these substrates derive both from tighter binding and faster catalysis. Complete optimization in both the P and P′ positions for acidic pH yielded an 180-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared with α74–75. This was the result of a lower K m and a higher k cat. As expected, this substrate performed less efficiently at neutral pH (k cat/K m of 80,277 versus 147,949). This neutral value was still a 414-fold increase in k cat/K m compared with α74–75 at pH 7.2. The Pneut/P′neut peptide yielded a 2,755-fold increase in k cat/K m compared with α74–75 at neutral pH. This improvement was a result of tight substrate binding and faster catalysis. At pH 5.2, Pneut/P′neut yielded a 3.6-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared with α74–75, a 158-fold decrease from the optimal performance of the substrate at pH 7.2. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic efficiencies of Pacid/P′acid and Pneut/P′neut from pH 3.6 to 10. Pacid/P′acid had two peaks of catalytic efficiency, one at pH 5 and the other at pH 7. Pneut/P′neut was dramatically different, exhibiting one broad peak of catalytic efficiency from pH 7 to 8.5. When the Pacid or P′acid motif was joined to the P′neut or Pneut motif, respectively, catalytic efficiency was lower than the fully optimized substrates, as expected (Table I). Optimized substrates with an amino acid substitution were also tested, because sometimes there was more than one preferred residue for a given position (Table II). For the pH 5.2-optimized sequence, we synthesized substrates with a change at the P2 (H to N) and P3 (E to H) positions. For the pH 7.2-optimized sequence, we synthesized a substrate with a change at the P2 position (H to M). Each of these changes gave less than a 2-fold difference in k cat/K m. These substrates provided strong validation for the optimized sequence predictions generated from the peptide libraries.Table IIKinetic summary of substituted peptidespHKm μmkcat s-1k cat/K m m -1 s -1P acid/P'acid5.20.317 ± 0.054.69 × 10-2147,950YNEHS ↓ FFMEE7.20.169 ± 0.021.36 × 10-280,277P acid HΔN/P'acid5.20.253 ± 0.023.26 × 10-2128,587YNENS ↓ FFMEE7.20.239 ± 0.031.6 × 10-266,911P acid EΔH/P'acid5.20.255 ± 0.041.87 × 10-273,194YNHHS ↓ FFMEE7.20.09 ± 0.011.52 × 10-2169,593P neut/P'neut5.212.1 ± 24.1 × 10-23,371MKRHS ↓ FRMRG7.20.405 ± 0.042.16 × 10-1534,532PneutHΔM/P'neut5.214.81 ± 1.72.99 × 10-22,025MKRMS ↓ FRMRG7.21.28 ± 0.173.86 × 10-1301,752 Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescence Suggests Multiple Locations for FLN— FLN was originally purified from food vacuoles. Yet, in vitro, falcilysin displayed robust activity at neutral pH. This raised the question of whether FLN might be located in structures outside the acidic food vacuole. Two independent anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies were used to probe the subcellular distribution of falcilysin. An indirect immunofluorescence signal from the anti-FLN antibody could be detected in the food vacuoles of acetone-fixed cells (Fig. 3A), overlapping with the distribution of the food vacuole marker, plasmepsin IV. In addition, an FLN signal was found in vesicular structures within the parasite. Similar vesicular staining was seen with formaldehyde fixation, which would not permeabilize the food vacuole (Fig. 3B). The vesicular signal appeared to be specific, because Fig. 3B reveals that as little as 10 μg/ml of immunizing peptide was sufficient to block FLN staining. Staining with a second αFLN antiserum, 1624T, gave a pattern similar to that of A1219T. Pre-immune 1624 serum did not detect a signal by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Both antisera were monospecific by immunoblotting (data not shown). These data suggest that falcilysin resides in two locations within the parasite. Co-localization studies were carried out with BiP, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The distribution of FLN was largely distinct from that of BiP (Fig. 3C) and remained so even after treatment with Brefeldin A (data not shown). Furthermore, FLN was confined to the parasite body, because signal from LWL-1, a marker of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, surrounded the FLN staining (Fig. 3D). Cryo-immunoelectron microscopy (EM) corroborated the immunofluorescence data; by EM, FLN localized to the food vacuole (Fig. 4A) and other vesicular structures within the parasite (Fig. 4, B and C). Again, FLN and BiP had minimal overlap. FLN Is a Peripheral Membrane Protein—Membrane extraction experiments were performed using radiolabeled trophozoite sonicates (Fig. 5). With PBS and 0.5 m NaCl extractions, FLN remained associated with the pellet. However, extraction in pH 11 carbonate resulted in a shift of FLN into the soluble, or supernatant fraction. FLN was detected in the supernatant fraction after 1% Triton X-100 detergent lysis (data not shown). This stands in contrast to mature plasmepsin I, which in these studies (not shown) and previous work (23Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was detected in the supernatant fractions with all extraction conditions. These data indicate that FLN is peripherally associated with membranes. Prior to our current studies, all of the available data (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) pointed to falcilysin as a food vacuole enzyme involved exclusively in hemoglobin degradation. However, the dual specificity of FLN partners well with the dual localization data. Two independent and specific αFLN antisera, under a variety of fixation conditions, document falcilysin localization to membranous structures within the parasite, in addition to the food vacuole. We cannot be sure of the identity of these membranes; there are morphologic similarities to endoplasmic reticulum, yet we observed minimal overlap in the distribution of the ER marker, BiP, and FLN. FLN staining was confined to the parasite body, because it is internal to the signal of LWL-1, a resident protein of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane that delimits the parasite. It is possible that FLN, which lacks a signal peptide (11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and exhibits no change in localization after Brefeldin A treatment, is located in or traffics through the vesicles associated with the alternative secretory pathway characterized by Brefeldin A-independent secretion (26Lingelbach K. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Foley M. Tilley L. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 1671-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Shahabuddin M. Gunther K. Lingelbach K. Aikawa M. Schreiber M. Ridley R.G. Scaife J.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous work analyzing the biosynthesis of falcilysin indicates that the enzyme does not require proteolytic processing to be active (11Murata C.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data and the specificity studies suggest that FLN may be active along its targeting route or may have a resident function in these vesicles. The random peptide libraries document that FLN is indeed active at both pH 5.2 and 7.2. This is not unprecedented for proteases. The striking finding is the pH-dependent substrate selectivity of FLN. The consensus specificity at acidic pH ((Y/A)N(E/H)(N/H)S#(Y/F/L)(M/F)M(E/D)(E/D)) has stretches of neutral polar, bulky hydrophobic, and acidic residues. At neutral pH (MK(R/G)(H/M)(S/R)#(Y/F/L)RMRX) positively charged residues dominate. The pH-dependent switch in substrate specificity presumably is related to protonation changes within the active site, although distal changes leading to conformational differences are also possible. A crystal structure of FLN will likely be necessary to determine the substrate-switch mechanism. The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) is the only M16 metalloprotease with structural information available (29Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and it provides few clues for falcilysin. MPP and FLN share a low degree of homology (8Eggleson K.K. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and belong to different M16 subfamilies. Furthermore, MPP differs in that is a α/β heterodimer with the active site lying at the subunit interface (29Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of the optimized substrates validated the peptide library predictions, because catalytic efficiencies were dramatically improved compared with the standard substrate α74–75. The α74–75 peptide was originally chosen for assay development, because it was a site in globin recognized by food vacuole lysate and not characteristic for the specificity of other known globin-degrading enzymes. This peptide is cleaved successfully by FLN, but the optimized substrates determined by the peptide library analysis are three orders of magnitude better. Pacid/P′acid was recognized optimally by FLN at pH 5, but also had a smaller activity peak at pH 7. In contrast, Pneut/P′neut was a poor substrate at pH 5; it was optimal from pH 7 to 8. Thus, using some substrates one would conclude that this is an acid protease and with other substrates one would think FLN is a neutral protease. Some change in substrate preference with pH has been seen with other proteases (30Gillmor S.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but a bold switch like that of falcilysin has not been reported. FLN is virtually one protease at acidic pH and another at neutral/basic pH. Whether pH-dependent specificity is a general feature of metalloproteases remains to be seen. However, falcilysin has specificity similarities to other metalloproteases. Mitochondrial processing peptidase is the falcilysin family member most extensively characterized. MPP favors aromatic residues in the P1′ position (31Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as does FLN. Additionally, MPP substrates often carry an Arg in the P2 or P3 position (32Kojima K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2115-2121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Song M.C. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The FLN motif for pH 7.2 contains an Arg at P3 and His at P2. Non-related metalloproteases such as MMP-7 have a strong preference for Ser in the P1 position (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Ser is the clearly favored residue in P1 for falcilysin in both acidic and neutral pH. In the metalloproteases examined by Turk et al. (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), also via random peptide libraries, there is very little preference similarity elsewhere in the unprimed positions, but the primed positions do exhibit modest agreement with the FLN cleavage motifs. Leu is found in P1′ in every one of the six metalloproteases they analyzed (MMP-7, MMP1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-3, and MMP-14). Additionally, Arg is present in each of the proteases at the P2′ position, which concurs with the motif for FLN at pH 7.2. Finally, Met is found for three of the six metalloproteases in the P3′ position. Both FLN motifs carry a Met in this same position. Comparing the FLN cleavage residue abundance values to those determined by Turk et al. (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) reveals that, with the exception of P1, FLN exhibits a stronger, more robust preference for residues in all positions. Turk and colleagues used a similar library approach to determine their cleavage motifs and yet the majority of the preferred residues have abundance values less than 2.0. The bulk of the preferred residues of falcilysin have abundance values above 3 and ranging as high as 6 to 11, even at distal residues P5 and P5′. In other words, falcilysin appears to be a more specific enzyme. In summary, we present biochemical evidence that falcilysin is active at neutral pH and is found in non-food vacuole locations. This raises the possibility of an expanded role for FLN beyond globin catabolism. This notion is further supported by data that identify FLN as part of the Plasmodium sporozoite transcriptome (34Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J.K. Carruci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and proteome (35Florens L. Washburn M.P. Raine J.D. Anthony R.M. Grainger M. Haynes J.D. Moch J.K. Muster N. Sacci J.B. Tabb D.L. Witney A.A. Wolters D. Wu Y. Gardner M.J. Holder A.A. Sinden R.E. Yates J.R. Carucci D.J. Nature. 2002; 419: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin degradation does not occur in sporozoites, and falcilysin likely plays a more fundamental role in parasite biology. We are currently using our neutral pH specificity data to aid in the identification of non-globin FLN substrates. Biochemical and mutational analyses are also underway to dissect the mechanism of the specificity switch in this unusual protease.

One circulating subfraction, electronegative LDL (LDL(–)), which is increased in familial hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, is implicated in accelerated atherosclerosis. Cellular responses to LDL(–) remain poorly described. Here we demonstrate that LDL(–) increases tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)–induced inflammatory responses through NFκB and AP-1 activation with corresponding increases in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) expression. LDL receptor overexpression increased these effects. In contrast, exposing LDL(–) to the key lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) reversed these responses, inhibiting VCAM1 below levels seen with TNFα alone. LPL is known to act on lipoproteins to generate endogenous peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) ligand, thus limiting inflammation. These responses varied according to the lipoprotein substrate triglyceride content (very low density lipoprotein ≫ LDL > high density lipoprotein). The PPARα activation seen with LDL, however, was disproportionately high. We show here that MUT LDL activates PPARα to an extent proportional to its LDL(–) content. As compared with LDL(–) alone, LPL-treated LDL(–) increased PPARα activation 20-fold in either cell-based transfection or radioligand displacement assays. LPL-treated LDL(–) suppressed NFκB and AP-1 activation, increasing expression of the PPARα target gene IκBα, although only in the genetic presence of PPARα and with intact LPL hydrolysis. Mass spectrometry reveals that LPL-treatment of either LDL or LDL(–) releases hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), potent PPARα activators. These findings suggest LPL-mediated PPARα activation as an alternative catabolic pathway that may limit inflammatory responses to LDL(–).

This occurs in part through the induction of early atherogenic inflammatory responses, including the expression of adhesion molecules like VCAM1 by endothelial cells (ECs) (3Li H. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. Arterioscler.Thromb. 1993; 13: 197-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, increased dietary cholesterol rapidly induces atherosclerosis in animal models, with changes in VCAM1 expression seen within 2 weeks (3Li H. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. Arterioscler.Thromb. 1993; 13: 197-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LDL, a major carrier of cholesterol, circulates in several forms in vivo (5Sevanian A. Hwang J.

Blanco-Vaca F. Ordonez-Llanos J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 699-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most LDL pathogenicity becomes manifest after LDL oxidation (1Steinberg D. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). For example, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), but not native LDL, induces endothelial VCAM1 expression in the presence of TNFα (7Khan B. Parthasarathy S. Alexander R. Medford R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1262-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).More recently, a form of native LDL containing intermediately modified subfractions with higher electronegative charge, referred to as LDL(–), has been identified and characterized (8Cazzolato G. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Hodis H. Kramsch D. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Cazzolato G. Hwang J. Peterson H. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate LDL(–) as a particularly pro-atherogenic particle. Like oxLDL, LDL(–) has pro-inflammatory effects, e.g. inducing the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and cytokine interleukin-8 (10Sanchez-Quesada J. Camacho M. Anton R. Benitez S. Vila L. Ordonez-Llanos J. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 166: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), both of which are NFκB- and AP-1-regulated (11Roebuck K. Carpenter L. Lakshminarayanan V. Page S. Moy J. Thomas L. J.Leukoc.Biol. 1999; 65: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). LDL(–) is a significant component of more atherogenic small dense LDL subfractions (5Sevanian A. Hwang J. Hodis H. Cazzolato G. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Sanchez-Quesada J. Benitez S. Otal C. Franco M. Blanco-Vaca F. Ordonez-Llanos J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 699-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL(–) also appears to be enriched in conditions characterized by accelerated atherosclerosis, namely familial hypercholesterolemia (10Sanchez-Quesada J. Camacho M. Anton R. Benitez S. Vila L. Ordonez-Llanos J. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 166: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), diabetes (12Sanchez-Quesada J. Perez A. Caixas A. Ordonmez-Llanos J. Carreras G. Payes A. Gonzalez-Sastre F. de Leiva A. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and hemodialysis (13Ziouzenkova O. Asatryan L. Akmal M. Tetta C. Wratten M. Loseto-Wich G. Jurgens G. Heinecke J. Sevanian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18916-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Despite some similarities, native LDL, oxLDL, and LDL(–) have distinct characteristics that likely determine their biologic effects (14Ziouzenkova O. Sevanian A. Blood Purif. 2000; 18: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most fundamentally, these particles have unique compositional profiles. For example, LDL(–) contains fewer lipid peroxidation products than oxLDL, but more than native LDL (9Hodis H. Kramsch D. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Cazzolato G. Hwang J. Peterson H. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ziouzenkova O. Sevanian A. Blood Purif. 2000; 18: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These forms of LDL are also cleared from the circulation in different ways, potentially contributing to their unique roles in atherosclerosis. In contrast to both native LDL and LDL(–), which are taken up through the LDL receptor (LDLR) (15Avogaro P. Bon G. Cazzolato G. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 79-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), oxLDL is removed after binding to scavenger or Fc receptors (1Steinberg D. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Hydrolytic pathways for LDL particles also differ. For example, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the predominant enzyme in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism, can hydrolyze mildly oxidized LDL forms like LDL(–) (16Wang X. Greilberger J. Levak-Frank S. Zimmermann R. Zechner R. Jurgens G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although this ability may be limited as suggested by the higher content of both triglycerides (8Cazzolato G. Avogaro P. Bittolo-Bon G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the LPL inhibitor Apo CIII (17Vedie B. Jeunemaitre X. Megnien J.L. Myara I. Trebeden H. Simon A. Moatti N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1780-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in LDL(–) as compared with native LDL fractions.Recently, we reported LPL enzymatic action as a mechanism for generating endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) ligands (18Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L. Moller D.E. Rader D.J. Sevanian A. Zechner R. Hoefler G. Plutzky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This LPL/PPARα pathway replicated synthetic PPARα agonist effects, e.g. decreasing cytokine-induced VCAM1 expression (18Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L. Moller D.E. Rader D.J. Sevanian A. Zechner R. Hoefler G. Plutzky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in vitro and in vivo. The PPARα activation through LPL varied depending on the lipoprotein substrate; it was greatest with VLDL, less with LDL, and minimal with HDL, a series corresponding to triglyceride content (18Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L. Moller D.E. Rader D.J. Sevanian A. Zechner R. Hoefler G. Plutzky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although this pattern and the absolute requirement for intact enzymatic catalysis for LPL-mediated PPARα activation suggests fatty acid release accounted for the responses seen, LPL-treated LDL activated PPARα to a disproportionate extent. This suggested LPL might release different PPARα mediators from LDL as compared with VLDL. If so, this indicates that the transcriptional responses to LDL might vary depending on LPL action, LDL particle composition, or its mechanism of uptake.To pursue this hypothesis, we tested cellular responses, including PPARα activation, to different forms of native and oxidized LDL with and without LPL treatment. In the presence of TNFα, LDL(–) uptake by the LDLR induced VCAM1 through NFκB and AP-1 activation, a previously unreported pathogenic LDL(–) effect. In contrast, LPL treatment of LDL(–) reversed this response, decreasing VCAM1 expression in a PPARα-dependent manner. Further studies reveal that LPL hydrolysis of LDL(–) generated oxidized linoleic acid (hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid, or HODE) in concentrations likely to account for the PPARα activation and the subsequent anti-inflammatory effects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. All media were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, Maryland) and contained fungizone/penicillin/streptomycin. Human and murine TNFα were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minnesota).

Northern blotting was performed using cDNA probes obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed on proteins extracted from cells harvested in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer containing freshly added 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were isolated as before (19Marx N. Sukhova G. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). Electrophoresis was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes using semi-dry transfer (45min, 16V). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with 5% delipidated milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, 55 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Monoclonal antibody against PPARα was a gift from Dr. J. Woods (1:500, Merck), polyclonal antibody against IκBα (1:500) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 1:2000) was from Biodesign (Saco, Maine). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody.Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA (19Marx N. Sukhova G. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences for NFκB, AP-1, and PPRE were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Supershift was performed using antibodies for PPARα, PPARγ (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), p50, and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI·dC).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA was performed in 96-well plates on confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers (19Marx N. Sukhova G. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Treated cells were kept on ice for 10 min, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with human VCAM1 monoclonal antibodies (gift from Dr. M. Gimbrone), and visualized using alkaline phosphate secondary antibody (450 nm).Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed using confluent mouse ECs obtained from heart of PPARα+/+ and PPARα–/– mice. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by trypsinization, and incubated (1 h at 4 °C) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse VCAM1 antibody (BD PharMingen). The EC culture purity was examined using anti-mouse phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (BD PharMingen).

At least 20,000 viable cells per condition were analyzed.HPLC-MS—A stock standard solution containing hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic (HpODE) and hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids was prepared by diluting and combining solutions of standard mixtures obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Samples were extracted by the Folch method, reconstituted in isopropanol, and filtered (0.2-μm nylon). The samples and stock standard were serially diluted with 50:50 acetonitrile/H2O.The separation was performed using a Waters 2690 LC with photo-diode array (Waters 996) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) detection (Micromass LCT). The column used was a Luna C18 (2Scandinavian Simvastin Survival Study GroupLancet. 1994; 344: 1383-1389PubMed Google Scholar) 50 × 2 mm, 5 μm from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Mobile phases for the isocratic separation were 50% A, 4 mm ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) in H2O, and 50% B, acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) flowing at 0.5 ml/min. The separation was performed at 30 °C with a total run time of 5 min. UV absorption was acquired from 200–400 nm. MS was performed using electrospray ionization operating in negative ionization mode. The ionization parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3200V; sample cone, 37V; extraction cone, 4V; desolvation temperature, 300 °C; source temperature, 120 °C; and ion scanning m/z range, 100–1000. Extracted ion chromatograms were constructed for HODE and HpODE using m/z values of 295 and 293, respectively. When the signal-to-noise ratio was sufficient, samples were quantified using an external calibration curve. When the signal-to-noise ratio was too low, only semi-quantitative estimates were made.Transfection—Transfection was carried out in 24-well plates at 2.3 × 104 primary bovine aortic ECs (BAECs) (passage 3–6) per well using FuGENE (F. Hoffmann-La Roche). Cells were transfected 3 h after replating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% of delipidated fetal calf serum (for PPAR ligand binding domain (LBD) studies) or 1% Nutridoma SP (F. Hoffmann-La Roche) for VCAM1 promoter studies. Transfected cells were treated with the indicated compounds for at least 10 h. Constructs were generous gifts from T.

The catalytically inactive LPL mutant has a two-base pair difference (AGC/GCC) that replaces the active site serine 132 with alanine (18Ziouzenkova O. Perrey S. Asatryan L. Hwang J. MacNaul K.L.

Results are expressed as percent inhibition with a calculated inhibitory constant (Kis ).RESULTSLPL Decreases LDL(–)-mediated VCAM-1 Induction in a PPARα-dependent Manner—We compared the effect of native LDL and LDL(–) on TNFα-induced VCAM1 expression in human ECs. As expected, TNFα induced VCAM1 protein in ECs (8-fold, set as 100% induction) on ELISA (Fig. 1A). Although concomitant treatment with native LDL led to only a modest further increase in VCAM1 (20%), LDL(–) augmented VCAM1 levels by 70% relative to TNFα alone (14-fold as compared with basal untreated levels). The presence of LPL inhibited LDL(–)-mediated VCAM1 induction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). Similar effects were evident on Northern blotting (data not shown) and activation of the human VCAM1 promoter (Fig. 1B). Although LDL(–) treatment induced the VCAM1 promoter 120–180% in bovine aortic EC transfections, this same stimulation in the presence of LPL repressed this response by 60–80% as compared, in both cases, with TNFα alone (Fig. 1B). These effects of LPL/LDL(–) on TNFα-induced VCAM1 expression equaled those seen with synthetic PPARα ligands (Wy14163 or fenofibric acid, Fig. 1B).To test whether treatment of LDL(–) reduced VCAM1 expression in a PPARα-dependent manner, VCAM1 responses were examined using FACS analysis of PPARα+/+ and PPARα–/– microvascular ECs (Fig. 1C). Both TNFα and TNFα/LDL(–) stimulation of PPARα+/+ ECs markedly increased VCAM1 content on the EC surface. LPL-treated LDL(–) repressed this TNFα induction in the presence, but not the genetic absence, of PPARα with effects replicating those seen with the synthetic PPARα agonist WY14643. These data suggest that LPL action on LDL(–) limits inflammation through a PPARα mechanism.LPL Treatment of LDL(–) Decreases NFκB Binding—We and others have shown that PPARα ligands decrease cytokine-mediated VCAM1 expression through effects on NFκB signaling (19Marx N. Sukhova G. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 23Jackson S.M. Parhami F. Xi X.P. Berliner J.A. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Demer L.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2094-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Mechanisms involved reportedly include direct PPARα interaction with p65 and PPARα-dependent expression of IκBα, sequestering the inactive p65/p50 complex in the cytoplasm (24Delerive P. Gervois P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36703-36707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To explore how LPL negatively regulates LDL(–)/TNFα induction of the VCAM1 promoter, we performed an EMSA of EC nuclear extracts using NFκB and PPRE binding sites. As expected, TNFα induced NFκB binding, a response augmented in the presence of LDL(–) (Fig. 2A). In the presence of LPL, however, LDL(–) significantly decreased NFκB binding; Wy14163 had similar effects. This decrease in NFκB binding was paralleled by increased IκBα levels from the very same ECs (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the increase in AP-1 binding induced by LDL(–)/TNFα was decreased after LPL treatment (data not shown). In parallel with decreased NFκB binding, both LPL/LDL(–) and WY14643 markedly increased binding to a canonical PPRE (Fig. 2C). This response was much greater than that seen with LDL(–), TNFα, or their combination (Fig. 2C). PPRE binding involved PPARα as indicated by the supershift in the presence of PPARα but not the PPARγ antibody. These effects appear to be due to increases in PPARα activators and not PPARα itself, given the lack of significant differences in nuclear PPARα protein levels after treating cells with LDL(–), LPL, or their combination (Fig. 2D). Together, these data suggest that LPL treatment of LDL(–) exerts its effects through direct interaction of LDL-derived components with NFκB and AP-1 in a manner similar to that of synthetic PPARα ligands.Fig. 2LPL treated LDL(–) inhibits NFκB activation and increases IκBα expression while inducing PPRE binding. Confluent human ECs were pretreated with LPL (200 units/ml, 4 h) in the presence or absence of LDL(–) (10 μg/ml) and then stimulated with human TNFα (10 ng/ml, 1.5 h). Fenofibric acid (Feno; 100 μm) pre-treatment was used for comparison. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA using 5 μg of nuclear extracts and 100 ng of radiolabeled NFκB (A), AP-1 (data not shown), and PPRE (C) sequences (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Supershift analysis was performed to confirm the identity of PPARα and PPARγ as well as p65 and p50 (data not shown) using specific antibodies. Cytosolic fractions (25 μg protein) of the same cells were analyzed for IκBα expression (B), whereas nuclear fractions (25 μg protein) were studied for PPARα expression (D) using Western blotting. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression confirmed equal loading. Data shown are representative of one experiment from three with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LPL Lipolysis of LDL(–) Generates PPARα Ligands—We further examined PPARα ligand generation as a result of LPL treatment of LDL(–). The yeast Gal4/PPAR LBD hybrid assay is classically used to screen for PPARα ligand formation (25Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). LDL(–) stimulation led to a modest 3-fold PPARα LBD activation; in the presence of LPL and LDL(–), PPARα activation increased 30-fold (Fig. 3A). In addition to its catalytic activity, LPL can also promote the uptake of lipoproteins like LDL through non-enzymatic bridging of lipoproteins to receptors like the LDLR (26Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We investigated the contribution of LPL bridging to the effects reported above. Transient transfection of the LDLR into EC did not alter PPARα LBD activation by LDL(–)/LPL. In contrast, LDL(–) treatment of LDLR-transfected ECs markedly increased VCAM1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Divergent cellular responses to LDL(–) depend on mechanisms of lipoprotein uptake. LPL-mediated hydrolysis of LDL(–) activates PPARα LBD independent of LDLR expression.

Here we examined the effect of p53 on the expression of a human mitotic checkpoint protein, Mitosis Arrest Deficiency 1 (MAD1), in cultured human cells. The expression of MAD1 was reduced when the cells were overexpressing exogenously introduced wild-type p53. The same reduction was also observed when the cells were treated with anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin or were irradiated with UV. Consistently, MAD1 promoter activity diminished in a dose-dependent manner when induced by p53, indicating that p53 repressed MAD1 at a transcriptional level. Intriguingly, several tumor hot spot mutations in p53 (V143A, R175H, R248W, and R273H) did not abolish the ability of p53 to repress MAD1 expression. By serial truncation of the MAD1 promoter, we confined the p53-responsive element to a 38-bp region that represents a novel sequence distinct from the known p53 consensus binding site. Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, relieved the p53 transrepression activity on MAD1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that p53, histone deacetylase 1, and co-repressor mSin3a associated with the MAD1 promoter in vivo.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene takes part in cell cycle control, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis (1Levine A.J.

Its importance is underscored by the fact that p53 gene is frequently mutated in more than 50% of all human tumors. p53 acts as a transcription factor regulating numerous downstream target genes. It can transactivate genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, such as p21WAF1, MDM2, BCL2, and BAX (4Ko L.J. Prives C.

Transcriptional activation requires p53 binding to a consensus sequence containing two copies of the canonical site 5′-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3′ separated by 0–13 bp (7el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Most common mutation hot spots in p53 found in tumors are located within the p53 DNA-binding domain, and these mutants are defective in DNA binding (8Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). p53 is also known to repress a number of targets including DNA topoisomerase II, cyclin B, CDC2, MMP-1 and -13, presenilin-1, MAP-4, and stathmin genes (9Roperch J.P.

However, the repression mechanisms are relatively obscure. In some cases, DNA binding is required for repression such as α-fetoprotein and CDC2 (13Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol.

It appears that p53 binds to a site overlapping the consensus sequences of other more potent transactivators, thus displacing the more potent activators (13Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). On the other hand, p53 repression can also be achieved in a DNA binding-independent manner. It is likely that p53 interferes with the basal transcription machinery by interacting with upstream transcriptional activators, for instance TATA-binding protein (15Ragimov N. Krauskopf A. Navot N.

Several checkpoint components were initially identified in budding yeast, including MAD1, MAD2, MAD3, BUB1, BUB2, BUB3, and MPS1. Vertebrate homologs of MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, and BUB3 localize to kinetochores prior to chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate (19Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J.

MAD2 appears to be the critical component in the mitotic checkpoint pathway. Unattached kinetochores recruit MAD2 and other checkpoint proteins, thereby activating the checkpoint (18Musacchio A. Hardwick K.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). MAD2 is able to bind Cdc20, an activator of APC, and prevents Cdc20 from association with APC, resulting in APC inhibition (17Wassmann K. Benezra R. Curr. Opin.

The checkpoint ends with bipolar attachment at metaphase. Several checkpoint proteins including MAD2 move away from kinetochores, releasing Cdc20 to activate APC (26Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G.

Two main substrates for the APC are mitotic cyclins (A and B) and securin, and their destruction is required for the exit from mitosis and sister chromatid segregation, respectively (28den Elzen N.

They share a 10-residue MAD2-binding motif. It has been suggested that MAD1 acts as a positive regulator and a competitive inhibitor of the MAD2-Cdc20 complex (35Chung E. Chen R.H. Mol. Biol.

In a serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in human colorectal cancer cells expressing p53 versus the p53 non-expressing parental cells, MAD1 has been identified as one of the genes regulated by p53 (39Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). Here we attempted to investigate in depth the role of p53 in MAD1 expression. We show that wild-type and mutant p53 transcriptionally repress MAD1 in human primary cells and several cell lines including HepG2 and Hep3B. Moreover, we mapped the p53-responsive element in the MAD1 promoter. p53 repression activity on MAD1 is decreased upon addition of histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. Significantly, p53 and mSin3a as well as HDAC bind to the MAD1 promoter in vivo, consistent with a recently proposed model in which these three proteins form a repression complex targeting the p53-repressive genes. Notably, the binding of mSin3a and HDAC to the MAD1 promoter is p53-dependent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The MAD1 promoter containing 480 bp upstream of the exon 1 of MAD1 (designated as –428) was amplified from human genomic DNA (Novagen) using the primers 5′-AACTGCAGCCTGGCTTGCAGAGCACTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTACCTCAGCCGCTCGCAG-3′ (reverse). Four truncated the MAD1 promoters (–349, –311, –231, and –102) were amplified by PCR using –428 as template, with the following forward primers: for –349, 5′-AACTGCAGCGGATTGATTCAAGCTGA-3′; for –311, 5′-AACTGCAGGGAAGAGTCAACGGTGCAAGTT-3′; for –231, 5′-AACTGCAGCCTTAGTGGAAGCGCGTCCTGCGCAA-3′; for –102, 5′-AACTGCAGCCAGGATCAGCCGGTGCGCAGACT-3′; and with the same reverse primer as shown above for –428. PstI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined) were generated in all forward and reverse primers, respectively; and the amplified promoter fragments were cloned into CAT reporter plasmid pCAT-Basic lacking eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences (Promega).

Cells were maintained in at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. HepG2, HeLa, IMR-90, CNE2, MCF-7, and LoVo cells express wild-type p53, whereas Hep3B, PC-3, and SK-OV-3 cells are p53-deficient. Cells were cultured on 6-well plates for transient transfection. All cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except HepG2 cells which were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (44Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J.

For trichostatin A (TSA) treatment, cells were incubated in the presence of TSA during DNA transfection. For UV treatment, cells were irradiated with 50 J/m2 UV (UV-C) by CL-1000 Ultraviolet Cross-linker (UVP, Inc.) and harvested after 24 h. For p53 induction, anticancer drugs 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin were added to the culture medium directly, and the cells were incubated for 24 h before harvest. In the assay for p53-mediated MAD1 ubiquitination, proteasome inhibitors carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvalinal-H (MG-115) and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI; Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.) were separately added to final concentrations of 25 and 30 μm, respectively, to the culture media of cisplatin-treated cells for 5 h before harvest.Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assay—The procedure was carried out as described (45Gorman C.M.

After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, transfected cells were scraped and lysed in 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, by three cycles of freezing (at –80 °C) and thawing (at 37 °C), followed by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration of clarified lysates was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysates were mixed with 1 μCi of 14C-labeled chloramphenicol (Amersham Biosciences), 0.8 mm acetyl coenzyme A (Calbiochem), and 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for CAT reaction. CAT activities were detected using thin layer chromatography and quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Western Blotting—Harvested cells were lysed either by repeated freezing and thawing as described above or in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) using Hoefer SemiPhor semi-dry blotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked with 5% skim milk, followed by incubation with antibodies specific for human MAD1 (181d), p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (AC-40, Sigma), HDAC1 (H-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mSin3a (G-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The MAD1 181d antiserum was elicited in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 567–585 of human MAD1.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Hep3B cells were transfected with empty vector or p53-expression vector for 20 h. ChIP was performed as described previously (46Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), except that cells were resuspended in 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin for sonication. RNase A as well as proteinase K were added to the samples after cross-links were reversed (47Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation were p53 (Fl-393), HDAC1 (C-19), and mSin3a (AK-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated samples were resuspended in 50 μl of H2O and analyzed by PCR. Total input samples were resuspended in 100 μl of H2O and diluted 1:100 before PCR. 3 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin or 1:100 diluted total input sample was added to the PCR amplifying the MAD1 promoter. The PCR primers are 5′-AACTGCAGAGGTTACCATAATAATGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTTCGCCTCGCGCCGT-3′ (reverse). After 40 cycles of amplification, PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.Confocal Microscopy—Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as detailed elsewhere (22Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 48Jin D.Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

Detection of dual immunofluorescence was based on species-specific secondary antibodies differently conjugated to Cy5 and fluorescein. The anti-MAD1 antiserum 105 raised against a GST-MAD1 fusion protein has been described previously (22Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar).RESULTSDown-regulation of MAD1 Protein Expression by Wild-type p53—A genome-wide SAGE analysis revealed that human mitotic checkpoint gene MAD1 is induced by p53 in the colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1 (39Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). To understand further the role of p53 in regulating MAD1, we transiently transfected the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 with a CMV promoter-driven p53-expression plasmid pCMVp53. The expression of p53 and endogenous MAD1 was detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, the level of MAD1 protein decreased significantly when cells were transfected with a low dose of p53-expressing plasmid (0.1 μg, lane 2) compared with the mock-transfected control cells (lane 1). Notably, the MAD1 level decreased in a dose-dependent manner. When a relatively large quantity of p53 (12.5 μg) was added, endogenous MAD1 protein was minimally detected (lane 4). In control experiments, we first queried whether the expression vector alone without p53 could lead to the decrease of MAD1 expression. p53 was cloned previously into an expression vector carrying a CMV promoter (50Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Similar to Fig. 1A, HepG2 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of empty vector, pCMV (Fig. 1B). However, there were no apparent changes in the MAD1 levels even at high concentrations of vector (Fig. 1B, lane 4), suggesting that the repression of MAD1 is p53-specific. To verify the specificity of antiserum against MAD1, proteins from control cells without transfection with p53-expressing plasmid were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting separately with polyclonal anti-MAD1 antiserum 181d and the 181d serum preincubated with the MAD1 peptide that had been used to raise the antibody (Fig. 1C). MAD1 signal was strengthened with increasing amounts of cell lysates added (lanes 1 and 2), whereas pre-incubation of MAD1 peptide thoroughly blocked the MAD1-specific antibody from detecting the protein on the immunoblot (lane 3). These results indicate that p53 down-regulates the expression of MAD1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. The down-regulation of MAD1 was also observed in two p53-null cell lines, Hep3B (hepatocellular carcinoma) and PC-3 (metastatic prostate cancer), as well as in IMR-90 cells (normal embryonic lung fibroblast) with wild-type p53, when these cells were transfected with p53 (Fig. 1D). Hence, this repression was unlikely cell type-specific.To characterize further the p53 effect at the single cell level, we performed immunofluorescence studies using the aforementioned anti-MAD1 antiserum 181d. As a first step, we verified the specificity of the 181d antiserum in immunofluorescence staining. We transiently transfected HeLa cells with MAD1 expression plasmid and stained the cells with 181d antiserum (Fig. 2A, panel 1), and with a previously characterized antiserum 105 highly specific for human MAD1 (22Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Both antibodies specifically reacted with both the endogenous and the overexpressed MAD1 protein (Fig. 2A, compare cells with arrows to cells without arrows). This nuclear localization pattern with some concentration in the nuclear membrane was typical to human MAD1 (22Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 32Campbell M.S. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 953-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In further support of the specificity of the antiserum, pre-incubation of 181d with an excess of immunizing peptide abolished the nuclear staining (Fig. 2A, panel 3).Fig. 2Repression of MAD1 expression by p53 in HeLa cells. A, verification of antibody specificity. HeLa cells were transfected with MAD1 expression plasmid (22Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), fixed 42 h after transfection and stained with MAD1 antibodies 181d (panel 1), 105 (panel 2), and 181d preincubated with an excess amount (3 μg) of the immunizing peptide (panel 3, 181d + pep.). Arrows highlight transfected cells. Bar, 20 μm. B, p53 repression of MAD1 expression. HeLa cells were transfected with pCMVp53 (panels 1 and 2) or plasmid expressing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as negative control (panels 3 and 4). Cells were fixed and co-stained for p53 (panel 1) or Gal4 (panel 3) and MAD1 (panels 2 and 4). Arrows indicate transfected cells, and asterisks highlight untransfected cells. The same fields are shown in panels 1–4. Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we assessed the influence of p53 on MAD1 expression by transfecting HeLa cells with p53. We observed that the overexpression of p53 (Fig. 2B, panel 1) correlated with a dramatic reduction in the steady-state amount of MAD1 protein in HeLa cells (panel 2, cell with arrow), whereas an appreciable amount of MAD1 was retained in the nucleus with a low basal concentration of endogenous p53 (cell with asterisk). As a negative control, the overexpression of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4BD; Fig. 2B, panel 3) had no effect on the expression of MAD1 (panel 4). Thus, p53 repressed MAD1 expression specifically.Repression of MAD1 Expression upon Treatment with Chemotherapeutics in HepG2 Cells—Having observed that introduction of exogenous p53 into cells could repress the expression of MAD1, we were interested in examining whether such repression could be sustained in a physiological environment with an elevated amount of endogenous p53. Treatment of cells with chemotherapeutics such as DNA-damaging agents 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin has been documented to induce the expression of endogenous p53. These agents have been widely employed in the studies of cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (51Yoshikawa R. Kusunoki M. Yanagi H. Noda M. Furuyama J.I. Yamamura T. Hashimoto-Tamaoki T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1029-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 52McKay B.C. Becerril C. Ljungman M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6805-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Two human hepatocarcinoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B were treated with increasing concentrations of 5-FU and cisplatin, followed by analysis for the expression of MAD1 and p53 by Western blotting. Both 5-FU and cisplatin effectively induced endogenous p53 expression over the basal level in p53-expressing HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel, lanes 1–5). The induction of p53 by chemotherapeutics considerably repressed the expression of MAD1 in the cells. In both drug treatments, the down-regulation of MAD1 again followed a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the pattern observed in the cells transfected with p53-expression plasmids (Fig. 1). Here, p53-deficient Hep3B cells served as a negative control because a major portion of the p53 gene in Hep3B cells was found to be deleted, accompanied by the absence of p53 RNA transcripts and protein (42Bressac B. Galvin K.M. Liang T.J. Isselbacher K.J. Wands J.R. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 43Farshid M. Tabor E. J. Med. Virol. 1992; 38: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, no p53 protein was detected in Hep3B cells even in the presence of p53-inducing drugs (Fig. 3A, right panel, lanes 1–5). As a positive control, Hep3B cells were transfected with pCMVp53, and the p53 protein was detected in Western blotting (Fig. 3A, right panel, lane 6). Expression of the exogenously introduced p53 in Hep3B cells indicated that the undetectable level of endogenous p53 protein was not due to any defect in the expression machinery for the protein. Rather, it was a consequence of a major genomic alteration in Hep3B cells leading to deletion of a large portion of the p53 gene (41Simon D. Searls D.B. Cao Y. Sun K. Knowles B.B. Cytogenet.

The spliced leader is derived from substrate spliced leader RNA and joined to pre-mRNA by trans-splicing, thus providing mature mRNAs with an m7G cap and additional methylations referred to as cap 4. It was shown previously that mutations spanning nucleotides 10–39 of the spliced leader did not affect substrate spliced leader RNA transcription or trans-splicing in Leishmania tarentolae (Saito, R. M., Elgort, M. G., and Campbell, D. A. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 5460–5469). In this study we examined these sequences for a possible role in translation by assaying the association of mRNAs, which possess mutated spliced leaders, with polysomes. For the nt 28–39 mutated spliced leaders, both the substrate spliced leader RNA and the spliced leader demonstrated a wild-type methylation pattern; spliced nt 28–39 mRNA was found in polysomes. Thus, the nt 28–39 region conserved primary sequence is not a determinant of polysome association. An undermethylated cap 4 structure was present on substrate and mRNA spliced leaders in nt 20–29 mutated exons; nt 20–29 mRNA was not present in polysomes. A differential pattern of cap 4 methylation was seen between the nt 10–19 substrate spliced leader RNA and the nt 10–19 spliced leaders found in the poly(A)+ population of RNA; the nt 10–19 mRNA was not seen in polysomes. Undermethylated spliced leaders did not associate efficiently with polysomes, suggesting a requirement for the cap 4 and/or primary sequence of the spliced leader in translation. This is the first report demonstrating that the spliced leader contains critical structural or sequence determinants for association with polysomes and, hence, translation.

RNA is trans-spliced onto every nuclear messenger RNA (mRNA) in the kinetoplastid cell. Trans-splicing defines the 5′-end of each mRNA by providing polycistronically transcribed pre-mRNAs with an identical SL (1Boothroyd J.C. Cross G.A.M. Gene. 1982; 20: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The SL is conserved throughout the order Kinetoplastida (2Santana D.M. Luke J. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains a number of post-transcriptional modifications (3Zeiner G. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is a specialized 5′-cap structure comprised of m7G (4Lenardo M.J. Dorfman D.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9861-9879Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a pseudouridine at nt 28 (ψ28) (9Liang X.-H. Xu Y.-X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although m7G is likely required for mRNA stability, intracellular transport, and translation by analogy with other eukaryotic systems (10Shatkin A.J. Manley J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the exact functions of the extensive and unique cap 4 methylations and ψ28 are unknown.A possible role for the cap 4 structure may be in the interaction or recognition of the mRNA with the ribosome. Studies with mammalian Mononegavirales showed that cap 1 structures are better templates for translation than cap 0 structures in vitro (11Testa D. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1977; 24: 786-793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies in Xenopus have implicated the 2′-O-methyl cap 1 structure on mRNAs in translation of maternally inherited mRNA (12Kuge H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Base methylations and ψ in tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and ribosomal RNA are common in active sites and are thought to enhance the RNA-RNA interactions required of these molecules (13Maden B.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 241-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 14Gu J. Patton J.R. Shimba S. Reddy R. RNA. 1996; 2: 909-918PubMed Google Scholar), although the absence of a single modification does not generally have an adverse effect on cell viability (15Maden B.E.H. Hughes J.M.X. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).We have established a system with which to study the expression and function of SL RNA genes in vivo using episomal expression of mutated genes in the background of the complete chromosomal complement of wild-type SL RNA genes in Leishmania tarentolae (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transcription occurs efficiently when the conserved sequence elements in the nt 10–39 region of the SL exon are mutated, indicating that they are not necessary for transcription (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resultant m7G-capped mutated SL RNA substrate products show variable cap 4 methylation, an absence of ψ formation, and disruption of conserved sequence elements but are efficiently trans-spliced (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), implying that none of these features are necessary for trans-splicing. The trans-splicing of undermethylated SLs was also seen in Leptomonas collosoma, where, for example the SL-4 mutation was methylated with low efficiency and yet the second step of trans-splicing occurred with 54% efficiency relative to wild type (18Mandelboim M. Estraño C.L. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35210-35218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but not in Leptomonas seymouri (19Lücke S. Xu G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Given the importance of the 5′-end of mRNAs in translation (10Shatkin A.J. Manley J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), it is possible that the primary sequence of the SL may play a role in the association with ribosomes and translation initiation machinery. There is good evidence that mRNAs with SL are found on polysomes in Trypanosoma brucei (21Young J.R. Donelson J.E. Majiwa P.A. Shapiro S.Z. Williams R.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 803-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Aline R.F.J. Scholler J.K. Stuart K. Mol. Biochem.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); however, the nature of this association has not been addressed experimentally. It is not known whether this association is a direct or indirect effect, or whether it is dependent upon the primary sequence of the SL or its cap 4 structure. To query the role of the SL primary sequence and nucleotide modifications in translation, we examined mRNAs containing mutated SL sequences in the nt 10–19, 20–29, and 28–39 regions created as part of a linker scan series (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The nt 28–39 mutated SL mRNAs associated with polysomes, whereas the nt 10–19 and 20–29 mutated SL mRNAs did not, suggesting that the SL exon primary sequence, the cap 4 status, or both, are determinants of mRNA translation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The L. tarentolae cell lines used were LtUCA (wild-type), intron-tagged (+IT) exon mutant nt 20–29 (16Saito R.M.

All cells were grown in brain heart infusion medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin; transfectants carrying episomal mutated SL RNA genes were grown in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418 as described previously (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Polysome Preparation—The polysome purification protocol was adapted from that developed for T. brucei (24). L. tarentolae cells were grown in liquid culture to ∼5 × 106 cells/ml. 5 × 109 cells were used per gradient. Cells were incubated for 5 min in 5 ml of brain heart infusion medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, pelleted and resuspended twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and once in PRB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCL, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 40 units/ml RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences)). The cell pellet was resuspended in PRB and placed on ice. The cells were lysed by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted, the supernatant was transferred to a new microfuge tube, NaCl was added to 1.5 mm, and heparin was added to 2 μg/ml. The cell lysate was loaded on a 12-ml 15–50% sucrose gradient containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. The gradients were centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 2 h in a SW 41 rotor. 750- or 1200-μl fractions were collected with a manual fraction recovery system (Beckman), and RNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation.RNA Analysis—Formaldehyde-agarose RNA blots were performed as described previously (17Sturm N.R.

Ribosomal RNA was detected by hybridization with a 5-kb BglII fragment (25Orlando T.C. Rubio M.A.T. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Floeter-Winter L.M. Mem. Inst.

Membranes were washed with 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, followed by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences).Primer extension was performed on total cell RNA, polysome-fractionated mRNAs, and poly(A)+-purified (MicroPolyAPurist, Ambion) RNA populations using γ-32P-labeled SL RNA-specific oligonucleotides. Extension products were resolved in 6 or 20% sequencing gels with a cognate sequencing ladder. Oligonucleotides used for primer extension are as follows: nt 10–19 mut, 5′-AAAGT ACAGA AACTG ATTCC-3′; nt 20–29 mut, 5′-CAATA AAGTA TTCTT CGAGG-3′; nt 28–39 mut, 5′-ACTTC CTCGA GGCTG AA-3′; WT exon, 5′-CAATA AAGTA CAGAA ACTGA-3′; and SL intron, 5′-GTTCC GGAAG TTTCG CATAC-3′.RESULTSMutated SL Is Detectable in Poly(A) + mRNA—Previously, we assayed three SL exon mutations, nt 10–19, 20–29, and 28–39 (Fig. 1A) for effects on cap 4 formation and trans-splicing (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All studies were performed in vivo with stable transfectant L. tarentolae cell lines containing episomal copies of a mutated SL RNA gene (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All episomally derived mutated SL RNAs in these cell lines are in a background of endogenous SL RNA and can be readily distinguished from endogenous SL RNA by their individual mutation-specific sequence tags. Whereas all three mutated SL RNAs were stable (16Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and were trans-spliced as demonstrated by formaldehyde-agarose RNA blotting and reverse transcription PCR (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), only the nt 28–39 mutated SL was cap 4 methylated at levels indistinguishable from wild-type as determined by primer extension from whole cell RNA (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In these earlier experiments, the detection primer hybridized to a tag within the intron of SL RNA; thus, the primer extension assayed specifically the SL cap 4 status of substrate (i.e. unspliced) SL RNA and did not assay the cap 4 status of mRNAs containing mutated SL exons (i.e. spliced). Thus, it was possible that the undermethylated cap 4 status observed for the nt 10–19 and 20–29 mutated SL RNAs represented a pool of SL RNA molecules that could not be trans-spliced and that mutated SL on mRNAs may have different cap 4 structures. To address this possibility, primer extension was performed on mutated SL RNA from whole cell RNA and poly(A)+-purified mRNA using oligonucleotides specific to the mutations in the exons (shown schematically in Fig. 1B). As the extension oligos were placed within the SL itself, we controlled for both mRNA degradation and substrate SL RNA contamination. Thus, the stability of the mRNAs containing mutated spliced leaders was examined using an exon-specific primer, whereas the quality of the poly(A)+ preparation was controlled using the intron-specific primer to detect any unspliced substrate SL RNA contamination (Fig. 1F). The poly(A)+ extension profiles were compared with whole cell RNA extension profiles.A shift in the relative amount of mature cap 4 methylation products was detected between the SL RNA substrate population and the mRNA population in the nt 10–19 SL mutant (Fig. 1C). Control [dNTP] titration primer extensions eliminate cap 4 read-through as an explanation for this observed shift in the substrate and poly(A)+ mRNA SL populations (3Zeiner G. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An extension product corresponding to the cap 2 position was observed in whole cell RNA, whereas the most abundant stop in mRNA corresponded to the cap 1 position. The cap 4 product was present in both samples at 20–30%. This result differs with the profile previously observed for the unspliced substrate nt 10–19 mutated SL RNA (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The nt 10–19 SL RNAs used in these two studies differ in the inclusion of an intron tag (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); analysis of the intron tag-containing mutant showed that the majority species was unmethylated at cap 0 (>90%), and a minor proportion (<5%) of the population was modified to cap 4. Acquisition of cap 4 methylations in intron tag-containing mutants was later determined to be slowed by the presence of the intron tag (26Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but this retardation alone is not enough to account for the difference in methylation patterns between the differentially tagged SL RNAs.In contrast to the nt 10–19 results, the nt 20–29 mutated SL poly(A)+ mRNA population displayed the same cap 1/cap 2 methylation primer extension stops as the substrate molecule (Fig. 1D). The nt 20–29 poly(A)+-purified mRNA sample was also extended with the WT exon primer, which recognizes only endogenous SL RNA, to demonstrate that cap 4-containing mRNAs are present in this poly(A)+ purified sample. Because of sequence differences in the two primers used in Fig. 1D, the WT exon extension migrates slightly faster than the nt 20–29 mutant extension and, therefore, cannot be directly compared with the sequence ladder generated with the nt 20–29 mutant primer.Spliced and substrate nt 28–39 mutated SL (Fig. 1E) showed a minor relative increase of the cap 3 form in the poly(A)+ mRNA population. Wild-type SL showed a similar shift between the poly(A)+ mRNA and whole cell profiles (Fig. 1F, WT exon). This preparation was examined for the depletion of substrate SL RNA (SL intron) in the poly(A)+ mRNA preparation (Fig. 1F). The presence of some substrate SL RNA in the poly(A)+ fraction could be due to contamination of the preparation or the polyadenylation of substrate molecules (27Pellé R. Murphy N.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Lamontagne J. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Thus, the nt 10–19, 28–39, and 20–29 SL RNAs possessed substantial, minor, and no differences, respectively, in the cap 4 status of substrate SL and spliced SL populations. These results confirm, by a third assay in addition to RNA blotting and RT-PCR, that exon-mutated SL RNAs are trans-spliced (17Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The detection of an exon-specific signal with minimal substrate background in a population of mRNAs that possess intact 3′-ends demonstrates that these mRNAs are full-length products that are detectable in total steady-state mRNA.Polysome Analysis of mRNA Containing Mutated SL—To ascertain the translatability of our SL mutated mRNAs, we adapted a polysome fractionation protocol used successfully in T. brucei (24Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple ribosomes on mRNAs is highly suggestive of active translation, although polysome association is not a direct demonstration of translation. Cleared cell lysates generated in the presence of the ribosome-arresting drug cycloheximide were centrifuged through a sucrose gradient. An A 254 trace of the gradient demonstrated the presence of 80 S subunits (29Cross G.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 204: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) just above the center of the gradient and also multiple (∼8) smaller peaks, suggestive of polysomes, in the lower half of the gradient (Fig. 2A). A gradient from the same experiment was fractionated into nine 1.2-ml aliquots, and the RNA was purified for electrophoresis through a formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotting to a nylon membrane. Hybridization of the blot with a probe that covers the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit 1 (LSU1) portions of the ribosomal RNA gene (Fig. 2B) revealed the following: 1) no hybridization at the top of the gradient (fraction 1); 2) strong hybridization to fractions 3 and 4, which correspond to the 80 S peak; and 3) hybridization to fractions (6Freistadt M.S.

RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in the lower half of the gradient, consistent with the presence of polysomes. When 20 mm EDTA was included in the gradient to disrupt the ribosomes (24Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), hybridization of the resulting blot revealed the presence of small subunit and large subunit 1 ribosomal RNAs predominantly in the top four fractions of the gradient; substantially reduced or no hybridization was observed in the bottom four fractions of the gradient (Fig. 2B). Thus, the presence of multiple A 254 peaks and ribosomal RNA in fractions 6–9 of the gradient support the identification of polysomes in these denser fractions, as reported by other groups (24Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Cross G.A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

In these gradients, small RNAs (e.g. the SL ribonucleoprotein) remain at the top of the gradient (see Fig. 3C).Fig. 2Polysome analysis in L. tarentolae.

The gradient was divided into 12 fractions, with fraction 12 representing the fraction of highest density at the bottom of the gradient; the sample was layered onto the top of the gradient. Extension reactions were performed on templates purified from each fraction as well as on the starting material from the whole cells (WC); a mock extension performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase (–RT) was also included. Extension products were evaluated by size separation through a 6% acrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gel run alongside a sequencing ladder of the cognate plasmid clone.

The sucrose gradients were collected in 12 fractions, and extracted RNAs were subjected to primer extension with the corresponding mutation-specific oligonucleotides to query the presence of mutated SL mRNAs in the lower half of the gradient and the cap 4 status of these spliced SLs (see Fig. 1B for primer locations). The primer extension analysis for each mutant included a lane of whole cell RNA for comparison. The gradient fractions were controlled with a primer extension of additional primers, including oligonucleotides targeting the endogenous total SL (SL exon) as a positive control for the integrity of the gradient and the SL intron as a negative control for the detection of the SL RNA substrate (SL intron), which does not penetrate into the polysome fractions (see Fig. 5C). The interpretation of the primer extension analysis carries a caveat, i.e. termination of extension at 5 is not necessarily indicative of mature cap 4, because base or ribose methylation events produce the same primer extension product (31Maden B.E.

Substrate SL RNA was only present in fractions 1–3 at the top of the gradient as demonstrated by primer extension profiles using an SL intron primer (middle panel). Extension products with the nt 28–39 mut primer were obtained throughout the 11 fractions (bottom panel), mirroring the distribution of mRNA with wild-type SL. The presence of mutated SL in the lower half of the gradient suggests that it, like wild-type SL, is associated with polysomes. The presence of mRNA at the top of the gradient may be due to differential loading of mRNA with ribosomes as observed in Trypanosoma cruzi (33Ávila A.R. Yamada-Ogatta S.F. Monteiro V.D.S.

https://openalex.org/W1987031617,"The CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous transcription factor CHOP, also known as GADD153, is involved in DNA damage, growth arrest, and the induction of apoptosis after endoplasmic reticulum stress and nutrient deprivation. CHOP dimerizes with and inhibits the binding of C/EBP-related transcription factors to their consensus DNA target sequences and also forms novel complexes with other transcriptional proteins (e.g. c-Jun, c-Fos). The transcriptional activation of these complexes is modified by their phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of CHOP at serine 79 and serine 81 by p38-MAP kinase enhances its transcriptional activity. Here we show that an interactive association between CHOP and casein kinase II (CK2) results in the phosphorylation of its amino-terminal transactivation domain. Mapping of the functional domains of CHOP indicates that the region in CHOP required for association with CK2 differs from that required for its phosphorylation. Th binding of CK2 to CHOP requires only the carboxylterminal bZip domain of CHOP, whereas phosphorylation involves residues located in the amino-terminal domain. The presence of the bZip domain, however, facilitates the phosphorylation of CHOP. Analyses of the effect of point mutations of CHOP on its transcriptional activity and the effect of specific inhibitors of CK2 lead us to conclude that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of CHOP inhibits its transcriptional activity. Our findings suggest that inhibition of the proapoptotic functions of CHOP by CK2 may be a mechanism by which CK2 prevents apoptosis and promotes cellular proliferation.

Our findings suggest that inhibition of the proapoptotic functions of CHOP by CK2 may be a mechanism by which CK2 prevents apoptosis and promotes cellular proliferation. The transcription factor CHOP (GADD153), is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in proliferating cells. When cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, able to induce DNA damage and growth arrest, the expression of CHOP is remarkably increased. CHOP expression is particularly responsive to impaired protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (1Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell.

Cell cycle arrest and the induction of cell death by apoptosis are two responses to cellular stress in which CHOP actively participates (4Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D.

Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of CHOP functions as follows: 1) a dominant negative regulatory effect on gene transcription mediated by C/EBP transcription factors by inhibition of their binding to C/EBP binding sites in the promoters of genes (7Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar); 2) transactivation of distinct downstream genes (downstream of CHOP genes) by dimerization to C/EBP factors and binding to a new set of promoter regulatory sites (1Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); and 3) regulation of the activity of other bZip transcription factors that do not belong to the C/EBP family. This is the case for the AP1 transcription factors, JunD, c-Fos, and c-Jun (10Ubeda M. Vallejo M. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7589-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of CHOP is also regulated by the phosphorylation of its transcriptional activation domain at the serines 79 and 81 by the stress-activated protein kinase p38-MAP kinase (11Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Earlier observations indicate that the proapoptotic actions of CHOP are only partially dependent on the phosphorylation by p35-MAP kinase (6Maytin E.V. Ubeda M. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Based in these our earlier studies and a number of additional published and unpublished contradictory observations, we considered the possibility that additional regulatory protein kinases may have an impact on the transcription functions of CHOP. Here we report evidence that CHOP activity is regulated by phosphorylations catalyzed by the ubiquitously expressed casein kinase 2 (CK2). CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase required for the progression of the cell division cycle and cell viability (12Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The importance of CK2 in cellular functions is evident from the observations that it phosphorylates as much as 300 known proteins (13Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) and is highly conserved among organisms from different kingdoms such as yeast, plants, and animals. CK2 is a heterotetramer composed of two identical regulatory β-subunits and two catalytic α-subunits. In mammalian cells, two different CK2 α-subunits encoded by two different genes substitute for one another, whereas there is only a single β-subunit. As a consequence, combinations of complexes can be formed: ααββ, αα′ββ, and α′α′ββ, all of which are active kinase complexes although they may have different target specificity and mode of regulation (12Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Although the expression of CK2 is considered to be constitutive, levels of CK2 expression and/or activity increase after both growth factor stimulation and in conditions that result in cellular transformation (14Litchfield D.W. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast and mammalian cells, CK2 activity is required at multiple transition points of the cell cycle (G0/G1, G1/S, and G2/M) (12Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Excessive activity of CK2 is associated with experimental oncogenic transformation and the development of primary and metastatic tumors (12Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Constitutive overexpression of CK2 is associated with the leukemia-like lymphocytic proliferation that occurs in cattle infected with the parasite Theileria parva (15ole-MoiYoi O.K. Brown W.C. Iams K.P. Nayar A. Tsukamoto T. Macklin M.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another important function of CK2 is the prevention of cell death (12Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ARC by CK2 is required for its targeting to mitochondria and for its inhibitory role on the proapoptotic caspase-8 (16Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bid prevents its cleavage by caspase-8 and therefore its translocation to mitochondria where it triggers the induction of apoptosis (17Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Max by CK2 prevents down-regulation of the proliferative actions mediated by the Max/c-Myc transcription factors via inhibition of its degradation by a caspase-mediated mechanism (18Krippner-Heidenreich A. Talanian R.V. Sekul R. Kraft R. Thole H. Ottleben H. Luscher B. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here we report a new mechanism by which CK2 may prevent cell death. We find an association between CHOP and CK2 that results in the phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain of CHOP and down-regulation of its transcriptional activation functions. Because transcriptional activation by CHOP is involved in promoting cellular apoptosis, we suggest that the down-regulation of CHOP function provides an additional mechanism by which CK2 may exert antiapoptotic activity.

Point mutations in the CHOP-coding sequence were generated by site-directed mutagenesis through the use of the kit Quik-Change (Stratagene). A Gal4-CHOP expression plasmid was constructed by inserting in-frame the CHOP-coding sequence into the pM plasmid (Stratagene) already containing the sequence corresponding to the Gal4 binding domain. The integrity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing and Western blot detection of the corresponding protein after transfection. The luciferase reporter vector controlled by three Gal4 binding sites was described previously (7Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 11Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down and Kinase Assay—Cells or tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as previously described. The following protease and phosphatase inhibitors were also added: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), NaF (5 mm), and NaVO4 (1 mm). Protein extracts (200 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of the GST fusion proteins such as CHOP wild type and the indicated mutants for 1 h at 4 °C. The incubation buffer contained 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml). The samples were washed three times with the same buffer and used for kinase activity determination after two additional washes in kinase buffer. The in vitro kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. An equal volume of Laemmli loading buffer was added to stop the reaction, and samples were loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE after boiling for 5 min. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. Casein kinase 2-specific activity was determined by the use of a specific peptide substrate and reagents provided in the CK2 assay activity kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Transfection Experiments and Luciferase Assays—Transfection experiments were performed in HeLa cells by using the GenePorter system (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA) using 2 μg of the luciferase reporter and 0.5 μg of the expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was determined using a commercially available luciferase assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). All of the transfections were performed in duplicate at least in three different occasions. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test. CHOP Is Phosphorylated by a Ubiquitously Distributed Protein Kinase in Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—We reported earlier that the proapoptotic actions of CHOP are regulated by protein phosphorylation (6Maytin E.V. Ubeda M. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by p38-MAP kinase is only partially responsive for the apoptotic effect of CHOP, suggesting that other mechanisms including additional protein kinases may also participate in the regulation of the function of CHOP. To identify additional protein kinases involved in the regulation of CHOP, we investigated the presence of protein kinases with the capacity to phosphorylate CHOP in both nuclear and cytoplasmic preparations (Fig. 1A) (see “Materials and Methods”). In this protocol, protein kinases that associate with and phosphorylate CHOP were isolated by GST-CHOP fusion protein pull-down experiments followed by assay of the kinase activity on CHOP in the presence of radioactive [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1, B and C). A GST control protein without CHOP sequences and a deletion mutant of CHOP lacking its amino-terminal transactivation domain (GST-CHOP-(36–162)) were included (Fig. 1, B and C). Recombinant proteins were incubated in the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from the cell lines HeLa and NIH-3T3. Phosphorylation of CHOP was found in the presence of both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 1D). No phosphorylation of either the GST protein or the CHOP amino-terminal deletion mutant (lacking residues 1–36) was observed (Fig. 1D). CK2 Associates with and Phosphorylates CHOP—To identify the protein kinase that associates with and phosphorylates CHOP, we initially examined the amino acid sequence of the CHOP amino-terminal domain (1–36) for consensus phosphorylation sites. Two putative sequence motifs that fit the consensus, (S/T)XX(D/E), were identified as characteristic of those phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig. 2A). We then determined that purified CK2 binds and phosphorylates CHOP but not the GST control or the NH2-terminal truncated mutant CHOP-(36–168) proteins (Fig. 2B). To identify the specific sites in the NH2-terminal amino sequence of CHOP that are phosphorylated by CK2, we generated a CHOP mutant (MUT2A) in which the serine residues (amino acids 14–15 and 30–31) in the sequence 1–35 were substitutes by alanines (Fig. 2, C and D). The serine to alanine substituted site CHOP mutant was not phosphorylated by CK2, indicating that serines 14–15 and 30–31 of CHOP are the CK2 phosphoacceptor sites (Fig. 2E). Distinct Domains of CHOP Bind and Are Phosphorylated by CK2—The binding sites and phosphorylation sites of protein kinases on their substrate proteins are often separated by some distance in the amino acid sequence. We examined the possibility that the association of CK2 with CHOP may occur on a domain apart from the amino-terminal domain phosphorylated by CK2. We generated CHOP deletion mutants fused to GST (Fig. 3, A and B) and tested their capacity to associate with CK2 by pull-down experiments after incubation with purified CK2. The presence of CHOP-associated CK2 was detected at the end of the experiment by detection of kinase activity on a CK2-specific peptide test substrate (Fig. 3C). These experiments showed that deletion of either the leucine-zipper dimerization domain (GST-CHOP LZ-) or the DNA binding region (GST-CHOP ΔBR) result in a decrease of precipitated activity to background levels. However, the CHOP mutant containing only the basic region and leucine-zipper domains (GST-CHOP bZip) showed a high capacity to precipitate CK2, even higher than that of the wild type GST-CHOP. These experiments indicate that the association of CHOP with CK2 is mediated by the bZip domain of CHOP, whereas the phosphorylation of CHOP occurs at a more distant site within the amino-terminal domain. We further delineated the CK2 phosphorylation activity on CHOP by directly incubating CK2 with equal amounts of the mutant substrates and performing the kinase assay without previous pull-down precipitation. The results of this experiment show a decreased phosphorylation acting on the mutants CHOP-LZ- and CHOP-ΔBR (Fig. 3D), indicating that both the leucine-zipper domain and the basic region of CHOP are not only required for association with CK2 but these regions also enhance the kinase activity of CK2 on the phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain of CHOP. CK2-mediated Phosphorylation of CHOP Results in Down-regulation of Transcriptional Activity—To determine the role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation on the activity of CHOP, we conducted an experiment that minimizes the complexity of CHOP and CK2 interactions. A luciferase reporter-promoter construct under the control of three Gal4 binding elements was used (Fig. 4A). Expression constructs in which the CHOP or the mutant CHOP-MUT2A cannot be phosphorylated by CK2 (Fig. 4B) were cotransfected with the reporter gene in HeLa cells. We found that serine to alanine substitutions in the CK2 phosphorylation sites of CHOP results in an augmented transcriptional activation. This finding suggests the existence of an inhibitory effect of CK2 phosphorylation on CHOP transactivation (Fig. 4C). To corroborate these findings, we performed additional experiments in which the activity of CK2 is modified. Overexpression experiments were uninformative because constitutive CK2 expression and activity are high in all of the cells tested so that the transfection of a CK2 expression vector fails to induce a significant change of activity. Therefore, we carried out experiments in which the activity of CK2 could be decreased by using the compound DRB, a specific inhibitor of CK2. In these experiments, we found that the reporter activity of both the control and the CHOP mutants that are insensitive to CK2 were decreased by DRB and that the activity of CHOP was increased (Fig. 4D). The negative effect of DRB probably represents the inhibition of the already known positive effect of CK2 on the basal transcription machinery. The enhanced activity of CHOP in response to DRB is better appreciated when the effect of DRB is normalized to the effect of DRB on the control empty expression vector (Fig. 4E). We suggest that an inhibitory effect of CK2 on the transcriptional activation function of CHOP may contribute to the antiapoptotic and proproliferative roles of CK2 in mammalian cells (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Diagram depicting the relationship between CHOP and CK2 in relation to the growth conditions of the cells. The survival and proproliferative effects of CK2 are enhanced by maintaining a block on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. CK2 phosphorylation of CHOP and inhibition of its transcriptional activity assures this objective as well as the phosphorylation of Bid and ARC proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we describe the association of CHOP with the ubiquitously expressed protein kinase CK2. As a result of this association, CHOP is phosphorylated by CK2 in its transcriptional activation domain, resulting in an impairment of its transcriptional transactivational activity. This effect of CK2 on CHOP is consistent with the opposing roles that CHOP and CK2 exert on the control of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. CHOP exerts proapoptotic role under conditions of cellular stress induced by oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, and unfolded protein response and also endoplasmic reticulum stress (6Maytin E.V. Ubeda M. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, CK2 is known to have an antiapoptotic role that is achieved by regulating the function of several other proteins involved in the induction of apoptosis (16Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A.

For example, in type II cells, the induction of apoptosis by the Fas ligand requires a positive amplification loop exerted by the BH3 only protein Bid (17Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Cleavage and translocation of Bid to the mitochondria are required for this amplification, and CK2 phosphorylation of Bid at a site close to the site cleaved by caspase-8 blocks its cleavage (17Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Magnenat E. Vilbois F. Hochmann A. Journot L. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), thereby interrupting the apoptotic signaling that results in prevention of cell death. Inhibition of the proteolytic activity of caspase-8 by CK2 phosphorylation was also reported for the protein substrates Max (18Krippner-Heidenreich A. Talanian R.V. Sekul R. Kraft R. Thole H. Ottleben H. Luscher B. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), connexin-45.6 (20Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. Cell Commun. Adhesion. 2001; 8: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the hematopoietic-specific factor HS1 (21Ruzzene M. Penzo D. Pinna L.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The inhibition of apoptosis appears to be an important function of CK2. In fact, CK2 also inhibits apoptosis by a completely different mechanism that involves inhibition of caspases by the activation of the antiapoptotic protein ARC. In this instance, CK2 phosphorylation is required for ARC to exert its inhibitory effect on caspase-8 activity (16Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our findings identify CHOP as a target for CK2 and define a novel mechanism by which CK2 is able to inhibit apoptotic cell death. The association of CK2 with CHOP may also have implications for the regulatory activities of CK2 in general. It was reported previously that the α-subunit of CK2 binds to a promoter region of the gene coding for the β-subunit of CK2 and activates its transcription (22Robitzki A. Bodenbach L. Voss H. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5694-5702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that a complex of CK2 and CHOP may bind specific DNA regulatory elements and regulate gene expression. We are currently investigating this possibility. Because CHOP and CK2 exert antagonistic effects on cell cycle progression, we anticipate that the interactions of CK2 and CHOP that we observe may play a role in the molecular mechanism responsible for such functions. However, little information regarding the mechanisms by which CHOP and CK2 influence cell proliferation is available. It is possible that the negative effect of CK2 on CHOP transactivational function may have evolved to silence antiapoptotic and antiproliferative actions of any residual expression of CHOP in proliferating cells. An alternative or an additional possibility is that CK2 phosphorylation of CHOP may down-regulate CHOP actions in cells that have experienced stress stimulation and therefore express high levels of CHOP. The mechanism may be designed to bypass the stress-induced cell cycle checkpoint. At least one previous report supports this idea. Yeast cells arrested in G2/M because of the induction of DNA damage will eventually continue through the cell cycle, even if they are unable to repair the DNA damage (23Toczyski D.P. Galgoczy D.J. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 1097-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This process of overriding a cell cycle checkpoint, also called adaptation, requires the actions of CDC5 (polo-like kinase) and the yeast CKB2 gene, which encodes a subunit of the yeast CK2 (23Toczyski D.P. Galgoczy D.J. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 1097-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This process of adaptation is not unique to DNA damage but also occurs for the spindle checkpoint (24Wells W.A. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the cell morphology checkpoint (25Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We suggest that the phosphorylation of CHOP by CK2 may also be an important factor contributing to checkpoint adaptation or overriding mechanisms in mammalian cells. We thank Linda Fucci for excellent experimental assistance, Melissa Fannon for preparation of the paper, and Marion Matzilevich for improving this paper with many suggestions and helpful criticisms."

Nonenzymatic protein glycation by reducing sugars, such as glucose or ribose, is a complicated cascade of condensations, rearrangements, fragmentations, and oxidative modifications that lead to a plethora of compounds collectively called advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; ABAP, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; Ac-Pt, di-N-acetylpentosidine; AG, aminoguanidine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CML, N ϵ-carboxymethyllysine; diPM, dipyridoxylamine trihydrochloride; dmaPM, 6-dimethylaminopyridoxamine dihydrochloride; dmaPN, 6-dimethylaminopyridoxine hydrochloride (6-dimethylaminopyridoxol-HCl); DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; MW, molecular weight; o-PD, ortho-phenylenediamine; PM, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride; PN, pyridoxine hydrochloride (pyridoxol); RI, refractive index; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; Tx, Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; ABAP, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride; Ac-Pt, di-N-acetylpentosidine; AG, aminoguanidine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CML, N ϵ-carboxymethyllysine; diPM, dipyridoxylamine trihydrochloride; dmaPM, 6-dimethylaminopyridoxamine dihydrochloride; dmaPN, 6-dimethylaminopyridoxine hydrochloride (6-dimethylaminopyridoxol-HCl); DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; MW, molecular weight; o-PD, ortho-phenylenediamine; PM, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride; PN, pyridoxine hydrochloride (pyridoxol); RI, refractive index; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; Tx, Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.

AGE products slowly build up and contribute to the age-dependent chemical modification of long-lived tissue proteins. Once formed, AGE products may prevent normal protein function and recognition or stimulate potentially detrimental interactions in signaling pathways (2Bierhaus A. Hofmann M.A. Ziegler R. Nawroth P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 3Schmidt A.M. Yan S.D. Wautier J.-L. Stern D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Glycation reactions are believed to have a significant role in the progression of diabetic complications largely because of elevated levels of glucose. Indeed, the formation of AGE has been increasingly implicated in pathogenesis of diabetic complications, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (4Baynes J.W. Ikan R. The Maillard Reaction: Consequences for the Chemical and Life Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1996: 55-72Google Scholar, 5Uchida K. Free Radical Biol.

Inhibitors that act to reduce AGE formation may prove useful for limiting nonenzymatic protein modification associated in the pathology of these and other chronic agerelated diseases. The reaction of amino compounds, such as lysine, with reducing sugars is known as the Maillard reaction (7Degenhardt T.P. Brinkmann-Frye E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. O'Brein J. The Maillard Reaction in Foods and Medicine. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1998: 3-10Google Scholar, 8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The “classical” or Hodge pathway begins with reversible formation of a Schiff base aldimine adduct that undergoes rearrangement to a relatively irreversible ketoamine Amadori product (see supplemental material). This Amadori pathway has been considered the primary route to formation of AGE products in vivo (1Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Post-Amadori pathways proceed through direct rearrangement and fragmentation of the Amadori compound and probably form a variety of reactive dicarbonyl compounds, especially α-ketoaldehydes (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1744-1752PubMed Google Scholar). Autoxidation of the reducing sugar or Schiff's base adduct, the Wolff and Namiki pathways, respectively, can significantly complicate in vitro experiments designed to study AGE formation and inhibition (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Interrupted glycation methods have been developed by Booth et al. (1Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) that allow Amadori-rich proteins to be isolated. This method allows more detailed studies to be carried out, which may provide insight into the specific mechanisms involved in post-Amadori formation of AGEs. Generally, glycation alters protein physicochemical properties by forming a variety of cross-links, browning (nonfluorescent AGE), and fluorescent AGE products. Much research has focused on investigating AGE inhibitors by assessing these nonspecific physicochemical properties, but these procedures have been questioned (10Miyata T. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. Ueda Y. Ichimori K. Inagi R. Onogi H. Ishikawa N. Nangaku M. Kurokawa K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2478-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Two specific AGE products commonly analyzed in protein glycation are N ϵ-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) and pentosidine (10Miyata T. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. Ueda Y. Ichimori K. Inagi R. Onogi H.

Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2571-2585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Quantitatively, CML is believed to be the major chemically characterized oxidatively formed glycation (glycoxidation) product (12Dunn J.A. Patrick J.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9464-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The highly fluorescent lysine-arginine cross-linked product, pentosidine, is believed to be one of the major contributors to AGE related increases in blue (350–400 nm) fluorescence (13Dyer D.G. Blackledge J.A. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11654-11660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Odetti P. Fogarty J. Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 153-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific mechanisms for the late Maillard reaction conversion of the initial Amadori adducts to the irreversible formation of AGE involve complex sequential and parallel reactions that are not completely understood (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). AGE formation in vitro is typically accelerated by oxidative conditions (glycoxidation) using metal ions such as Fe3+ or Cu2+ (4Baynes J.W. Ikan R. The Maillard Reaction: Consequences for the Chemical and Life Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1996: 55-72Google Scholar, 15Mowri H.-O. Frei B. Keaney Jr., J.F. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that transition metal ions may play a role during AGE formation in vivo and that they are required to catalyze electron transfer from ene-diol (or enaminol) intermediates, which leads to the generation of superoxide and α-dicarbonyls (16Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Wolff S.P. Jiang Z.Y. Hunt J.V. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). For example, oxidative conditions are required for the formation of the dicarbonyl intermediate glyoxal, and nonoxidative conditions can significantly decrease the amount of the lysine-glyoxal-derived adduct CML (18Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

Pentosidine has also been considered to be an in vivo marker of glycoxidation that can reasonably be expected to arise from a 3-deoxyosone (hexose or pentose) precursor (20Grandhee S.K. Monnier V.M.

However, pentosidine formation during glycation of the pentose, arabinose, was comparable under both oxidative and nonoxidative conditions (18Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested a possible role for non–Metal-dependent intermolecular redox reactions during pentosidine formation. The mechanism by which pentosidine is formed from the unexpected ribose precursor N 6-(2-hydroxy-4,5-dioxo-pentyl)-l-lysinate has recently been elucidated (22Biemel K.M. Conrad J. Lederer M.O. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The generation of this novel dideoxyosone requires carbonyl shifts along the entire carbohydrate backbone and opens new possibilities in considering Amadori degradation (23Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Other research suggests that AGE intermediates may participate directly in redox chemistry to form free radicals without any requirement for transition metal ion catalysis. For example, enaminol intermediates have been proposed to provide “metal-free” formation of superoxide (24Mossine V.V. Linetsky M. Glinsky G.V. Ortwerth B.J. Feather M.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (although alternative interpretations have been suggested (25Baker J.R. Zyzak D.V. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Clin.

However, redox chemistry between two different AGE intermediates may also be involved in Maillard reaction pathways, especially under nonoxidative conditions (18Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Baker J.R. Zyzak D.V. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although a variety of AGE inhibitors have been identified, their mechanisms of action are not well understood (28Costantino L. Rastelli G. Vianello P. Cignarella G. Barlocco D. Med. Res. Rev. 1999; 19: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Thornalley P.J. Yurek-George A. Argirov O.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The most common feature among the AGE inhibitors known to date is the presence of a nucleophilic functionality, such as an amine or hydrazone, which can intercept reactive carbonyl compounds and prevent progression to AGE products (6Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 9Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1744-1752PubMed Google Scholar). Other classes of inhibitors, such as metal ion chelators (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)) and radical-trapping antioxidants (α-tocopherol and ascorbate) exhibit their activity by limiting oxidative acceleration of glycation (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The most reasonable point in the pathway to inhibit glycation from a pharmaceutical standpoint would be to block post-Amadori AGE formation. Inhibitors such as aminoguanidine (AG) were initially expected to block glycation at several points including direct reaction with reducing sugars, reactive dicarbonyls, Amadori products, and post-Amadori intermediates (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, by using interrupted glycation methods, Booth et al. (1Booth A.A. Khalifah R.G. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate that AG provided little inhibition of post-Amadori AGE formation, whereas pyridoxamine (PM) was identified as an effective post-Amadori AGE inhibitor. Other AGE inhibitors have primarily been compared with AG in uninterrupted glycation experiments in the presence of transition metal ions, which makes it difficult to determine the points of effective inhibition because of high sugar levels and the complicating Wolff and Namiki pathways (30Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In fact, it is difficult to discern in the literature whether some of the more promising AGE inhibitors owe their activities to carbonyl trapping or to metal ion chelation (30Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (Structure 1). Overall, the mechanism of action of AGE inhibitors is complex and dependent on the inhibitor. For example, PM has been reported to decrease the formation of fluorescent AGE products significantly and specifically to decrease the yield of CML. However, this inhibitor did not lower pentosidine cross-links (8Khalifah R.G. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The only AGE inhibitor reported to specifically reduce the formation of both CML and pentosidine has been OPB-9195 (31Miyata T. Ueda Y. Asahi K. Izuhara Y. Inagi R. Saito A. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. Kurokawa K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1719-1725PubMed Google Scholar). Both AG and PM are less active metal ion chelators than OPB-9195, and each of these compounds shows evidence for carbonyl trapping via formation of triazine, amide, or hydrazone adducts, respectively (30Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the use of strong carbonyl traps, such as AG and OPB-9195, to retard AGE formation opens up the risk of pyridoxal deficiency in vivo by indiscriminately trapping necessary carbonyl species (10Miyata T. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. Ueda Y. Ichimori K. Inagi R. Onogi H. Ishikawa N. Nangaku M. Kurokawa K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2478-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The present work describes a novel multifunctional AGE inhibitor designed to function as a carbonyl trap, metal ion chelator, and radical-trapping antioxidant and addresses the involvement of both reactive carbonyls and radical intermediates in the complex pathways of the Maillard reaction. Considering that the known carbonyl-trapping AGE inhibitor, PM, may be found bound to important post-Amadori intermediates (32Voziyan P.A. Metz T.O. Baynes J.W. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3397-3403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33Nagaraj R.H. Sarkar P. Mally A. Biemel K.M. Lederer M.O. Padayatti P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we suspected that the phenol functionality might serve as a local protective agent against radical AGE intermediates. However, PM has been reported to have only weak hydrogen atom donating (radical-trapping) ability, making it only a marginally effective antioxidant (34Onorato J.M. Jenkins A.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21177-21184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35DeLange R.J. Glazer A.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Electron-donating para-substituents lower phenolic O–H bond dissociation enthalpies, which enhances radical trapping rates. Unfortunately, such substituents also lower the ionization potential of the phenol and can do so to such an extent that, for example, 4-dimethylaminophenol (which should be an extremely good radical trap) is of no practical value as an antioxidant because it reacts directly with dioxygen. Pratt et al. (36Pratt D.A. DiLabio G.A. Brigati G. Pedulli G.F. Valgimigli L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 4625-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown that strong electron-donating groups (such as dimethylamino) para to the phenolic hydroxyl group of 3-pyridinols and 5-pyrimidinols decrease the O–H bond dissociation enthalpy and greatly increase radical trapping rates but do not lower the ionization potential to the point that there is a direct reaction with oxygen. Therefore, PM was modified by the addition of a 6-dimethylamino substituent (6-dimethylaminopyridoxamine, dmaPM) (59Culbertson S.M. Enright G.D. Ingold K.U. Organic Lett. 2003; 5: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A pyridoxine (PN) derivative (6-dimethylaminopyridoxine, dmaPN) was also tested to study the importance of the nucleophilic amine group during glycation reactions. Both dmaPM and dmaPN were found to be much better radical-trapping antioxidants than PM or PN (59Culbertson S.M. Enright G.D. Ingold K.U. Organic Lett. 2003; 5: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as evaluated by following the peroxyl radical-induced quenching of allophycocyanin fluorescence (37Nakagawa T. Yokozawa T. Terasawa K. Shu S. Juneja L.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Courderot-Masuyer C. Dalloz F. Maupoil V. Rochette L. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999; 13: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This new carbonyl group trapping and radical-trapping AGE inhibitor, dmaPM, and a number of other AGE inhibitors were tested in metal ion-containing (+M buffer) and metal ion-free (–M buffer) experiments. We present unexpected results that provide mechanistic insight into inhibiting post-Amadori AGE formation by comparing three different classes of AGE inhibitors: carbonyl group traps, metal ion chelators, and radical-trapping antioxidants. The results during ribose glycations show: 1) a counterintuitive increase in the yield of pentosidine in the presence of phenolic antioxidants, 2) significant formation of CML in the presence of strong metal ion chelators and radical-trapping antioxidants, which implies that there must be nonradical routes to CML, 3) prevention of intermolecular cross-links with radical-trapping inhibitors, and 4) that the novel carbonyl group and radical-trapping agent, dmaPM, shows multifunctional inhibition of AGE. Glucose glycations reveal the expected inhibition of pentosidine and CML with all compounds tested, but in a buffer free of trace metal ions the yield of CML in the presence of radical-trapping antioxidants was higher than in the metal ion-free control, although it was still lower than in the metal ion-containing control. Protein molecular weight analyses support the conclusion that Amadori decomposition pathways are limited by the presence of metal ion chelators and radical traps. Overall, our findings show a phenomenal impact of radical-trapping antioxidants on post-Amadori glycoxidation and challenge the current paradigms that: 1) AGE inhibitors will not increase the formation of any AGE product, 2) transition metal ions are required for oxidative formation of AGE, and 3) screening AGE inhibitors only in systems containing transition metal ions represents a valid estimate of potential in vivo mechanisms. Reagents—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. All water used in the experiments was deionized and treated with a Millipore Milli-Q plus system (18 mΩ). Monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate salts were SigmaUltra grade. Metal ion-containing buffer (+M buffer) was a 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with no treatment to remove trace levels of transition metal ions. Metal ion-free buffer (–M buffer) was a 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, which was stirred with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) for 24 h and then removed from the resin prior to the addition of the metal ion chelators DTPA (1 mm) and phytic acid (1 mm). Chelex-100-treated buffer (Chelex only) with no added chelating agents (DTPA or phytic acid) was also prepared and used for some dilutions or glycation experiments. All reaction buffers were filtered (0.45-μm Gelman GHP Acrodisk) before use. The buffers were tested for the presence of transition metal ion impurities by ascorbate autoxidation (266 nm) according to Buettner (39Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Ascorbate loss (15 min at room temperature) was typically ∼47% ± 9% for +M buffer and ∼0.7 ± 0.2% for –M buffer. Ascorbate test loss for Chelex only buffer was ∼2.8 ± 0.7% in 15 min. Dipyridoxylamine (diPM) was synthesized according to the methods of Ikawa (40Ikawa M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 118: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The novel vitamin B6 derivatives dmaPM and dmaPN were synthesized according to Culbertson et al. (59Culbertson S.M. Enright G.D. Ingold K.U. Organic Lett. 2003; 5: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The internal standard tetra-deuterio-CML was prepared according to the methods of Ahmed et al. (41Ahmed M.U. Brinkmann Frye E. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) with only minor modifications (see supplemental material). Di-N-acetyl-pentosidine (Ac-Pt) was synthesized by the reaction of N α-acetyllysine (6.2 mmol), ribose (6.2 mmol), and N α-acetylarginine (6.2 mmol) in 0.5 m phosphate buffer (62 ml), pH 9.0, for 48 h at 60 °C and purified by the methods of Dyer et al. (13Dyer D.G. Blackledge J.A. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11654-11660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with only minor modifications (see supplemental material). Uninterrupted Glycation—Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10 mg/ml) essentially free of fatty acids was glycated in +M buffer or –M buffer at 37 °C, under air, with either d(–)-ribose (50 mm, unless otherwise indicated) or d(+)-glucose (250 mm) in the absence or presence of inhibitors (0.2–25 mm). (Inhibitors were dissolved in Chelex only buffer and added to either –M buffer or +M buffer experiments. The amount of Chelex only buffer present (10% v/v) was kept constant for all experiments.) Toluene (1%, v/v) was added to prevent bacterial growth. Most experiments were performed in at least two side by side reactions; however, many experiments (typically, control and 5 mm inhibitor experiments) were performed on two or three separate occasions (see figure legends for the specific numbers of experiments). Aliquots were removed at various intervals (3–21 days) depending on the sugar and frozen at –75 °C until analyses. Interrupted Ribose Glycation—BSA (10 mg/ml) was preglycated, under air, by incubation with ribose (0.5 m) at 37 °C for 24 h in +M buffer, unless otherwise indicated. The portions were dialyzed (molecular weight cut-off, 12 kDa) against either +M buffer or –M buffer at 4 °C (4 buffer changes over 24 h). The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry as modified by Peterson (42Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7113) Google Scholar). Interrupted glycation experiments of preglycated, dialyzed BSA (5 mg/ml) in +M buffer ((+M)/+M buffer) or –M buffer ((+M)/–M) were incubated at 37 °C, under air, in the absence or presence of various inhibitors (5 mm) (the samples also contained toluene, 1% v/v). The aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 3.5, and 5 days and frozen at –75 °C until analyses. Pentosidine Analysis by HPLC—The samples from the incubation mixtures (50 μl) were prepared according to the methods of Miyata et al. (10Miyata T. Van Ypersele De Strihou C. Ueda Y. Ichimori K. Inagi R. Onogi H. Ishikawa N. Nangaku M. Kurokawa K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2478-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and dissolved in 0.2 m phosphate buffer (filtered 0.2 μm), pH 7.4 (400 or 100 μl for ribose or glucose glycation samples, respectively). Pentosidine was quantified by fluorescence detection (excitation/emission = 336/385 nm) on a Discovery C18 HPLC column (5 μm partide size, 25 cm length × 4.6 mm inner diameter; Supelco) using PN (excitation/emission = 305/395 nm) and Ac-Pt (excitation/emission = 336/385 nm) as internal standards (fluorescence detector, 370-nm emission cut-off; excitation/emission time program, 336/385 nm 0–15 min and 25–60 min; 305/395 nm 15–25 min). A gradient program was used to separate pentosidine"

By confocal microscopy, the cytokine receptor gp130 and Jak1, fused with either yellow (YFP) or cyan (CFP) fluorescent protein, were found to be colocalized predominantly at intracellular vesicular structures and at the plasma membrane. Quantitative fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis at the plasma membrane revealed equal mobilities for gp130-YFP and Jak1-YFP. Thus, Jak1-YFP diffuses like a transmembrane protein indicating that membrane-bound Jak1 does not exchange rapidly with cytosolic Jaks. Applying a novel dual-color FRAP approach we found that immobilization of gp130-CFP by a pair of monoclonal antibodies led to a corresponding immobilization of co-transfected Jak1-YFP. We conclude from these findings that Jak1, once bound to a gp130 molecule, does not exchange between different receptors at the plasma membrane neither via the cytoplasmic compartment nor via a membrane-associated state.

Among receptors that signal through activation of tyrosine kinases one can discriminate between receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. Receptor tyrosine kinases consist of a ligand binding ectodomain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic part that contains a tyrosine kinase domain (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors are built up similarly but they do not harbor an intrinsic kinase activity. Instead, they non-covalently associate with tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (Jak) 1The abbreviations used are: Jak, Janus kinase; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; id, internalization-deficient; kd, kinase-deficient; nb, non-binding; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ROI, region of interest; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are: Jak, Janus kinase; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; id, internalization-deficient; kd, kinase-deficient; nb, non-binding; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ROI, region of interest; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. family. While an increasing number of cytokine receptors has been characterized during the last years, only four Jaks are known, namely Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2 (2O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). According to structural properties, cytokine receptors are subdivided into class I cytokine receptors activated by hematopoietic cytokines and class II cytokine receptors engaged by interferons and cytokines of the IL-10 family (3Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Among the class I cytokine receptors, gp130 is the most promiscuous one since it serves as the common signal transducing receptor subunit for the IL-6-type cytokines comprising IL-6, IL-11, LIF, OSM, CNTF, CT-1 (4Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) and the more recently discovered NNT-1/BSF-3 (5Senaldi G. Varnum B.C. Sarmiento U. Starnes C. Lile J. Scully S. Guo J. Elliott G. McNinch J. Shaklee C.L. Freeman D. Manu F. Simonet W.S. Boone T. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IL-6 and IL-11, after binding to their specific α-receptor subunits IL-6Rα and IL-11Rα, respectively, signal via gp130 homodimers. The remaining IL-6-type cytokines induce the formation of a heterodimer of gp130 and a second signal transducing subunit, namely LIFR or OSMR (6Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gp130 associates with Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2 but not with Jak3 (7Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A.

Upon ligand binding the receptor-associated Jaks become activated by transphosphorylation. The activated Jaks phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic part of gp130. These phosphotyrosine residues serve as docking sites for the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT1. The STATs also become tyrosine phosphorylated, dimerize and translocate into the nucleus to induce target genes (7Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G.

Furthermore, a dileucine motif required for efficient, ligand-independent internalization is localized within the cytoplasmic part of gp130 (10Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). By mutagenesis studies, the membrane proximal box1/box2 region of cytokine receptors has been identified to be essential for Jak binding. This part is characterized by a proline-rich motif (box1) and a less conserved region dominated by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids followed by several charged amino acids (box2). For gp130 it has been demonstrated that box1 as well as the interbox1/2 region are most important for Jak binding (11Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D. Shaw A.S. J. Biol.

Gp130 not only mediates Jak association but also contributes to kinase activation: certain mutations (such as W652A) do not affect Jak binding but abrogate stimulation-dependent Jak activation (14Haan C. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Jaks are relatively large proteins of about 130 kDa that contain a kinase- and a kinase-like domain in their C-terminal region. By mutation of Lys907 to E in the kinase domain a kinase-deficient (kd) mutant (Jak1/kd) is generated that still associates with cytokine receptors (15Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D.

A mutagenesis study based on a molecular model of the F1 subdomain of Jak1 has highlighted its importance for the interaction with gp130. Exchange of Leu80-Tyr81 to alanines within the FERM domain leads to a Jak1 mutant (Jak1/nb) that does not bind (nb) to cytokine receptors (21Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H.

Here, the well characterized gp130/Jak1 interaction was used as a model system to study the dynamics of cytokine receptor/Jak association in living cells. For this purpose, gp130 and Jak1 were fused with the yellow (YFP) and cyan (CFP) variants of the green fluorescent protein. Both, fluorescent gp130 and fluorescent Jak1 were found to be predominantly associated with cellular membranes. The mobilities of the fusion proteins at the plasma membrane were measured by the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The data reveal that both gp130 and Jak1 have similar recovery kinetics that are typical for membrane-bound proteins. Furthermore, we show that gp130 and Jak1 are tightly bound to each other and that Jak1 does not exchange between different receptor proteins.

DMEM and antibiotics were obtained from Gibco Invitrogen Corporation (Auckland, UK) fetal calf serum was provided by Seromed (Berlin, Germany). [α-32P]DeoxyATP was purchased from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). Epo (220500 units/mg) was a kind gift from Roche Applied Science. The gp130 mAbs B-P4, B-P8, and B-S12-G7 (Diaclone, Besançon, France) were generated as described elsewhere (23Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Zong-Jiang G. Clement C. Klein B.

COS-7 simian monkey kidney cells and Jak1-deficient U4C cells (kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. To the medium of U4C cells 400 μg/ml G418 were added. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% CO2. U4C cells stably expressing Jak1 or Jak1-YFP were generated using the Flp-In™ T-Rex™ System from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The Flp-In™ target site vector that contains an integrated Flp recombination target (FRT) site was transfected into the Jak1-deficient U4C cells and integrants were selected. The plasmid pcDNA5/FRT/Jak1-YFP was generated by inserting the Jak1-YFP cDNA from pSVLJak1-YFP as a NotI/EcoRV fragment into pcDNA5/FRT/TO©. By co-transfecting pcDNA5/FRT/Jak1-YFP and the Flp recombinase expression vector into the Flp-In host cell line using Superfect (Qiagen), followed by selection for hygromycin resistance, stable clones expressing Jak1-YFP were obtained. Cloning of Expression Vectors—The vectors pEYFP-N1, pECFP-N1, and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) were used as templates for the amplification of cDNAs encoding fluorescent proteins. Applying standard PCR and cloning procedures, the cDNA encoding full-length (amino acids 1-918) human gp130 was fused with the cDNA encoding the respective fluorescent protein (amino acids 2-239) and ligated into the pSVL expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) yielding the plasmids pSVLgp130-YFP and pSVLgp130-CFP. The constructs pSVLgp130/id-YFP and pSVLgp130/id-CFP encode a truncated gp130 protein in which Pro668 of gp130 is immediately followed by Val2 of the fluorescent protein. In the construct gp130/nb-YFP the truncated gp130 described above lacks also the box 1 motif (Ile651-Pro658). pSVLEg-CFP was cloned by fusing the cDNA encoding CFP (amino acids 2-239) immediately downstream of the cDNA encoding the earlier described Epo-gp130 chimera (Eg) (25Schmitz J. Dahmen H. Grimm C. Gendo C. Müller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, pSVLJak1-CFP, pSVLJak1-YFP, and Jak1/kd-YFP (15Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were constructed by fusing the cDNA encoding full-length human Jak1 (amino acids 1-1142) with the gene encoding the respective fluorescent protein. Due to the cloning strategy Jak1 and the fluorescent protein are separated by a linker of nine amino acids. Applying the same approach, the earlier described Jak1/nb mutant (21Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was fused with YFP. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Characterization of gp130 Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—COS-7 cells were transfected with the expression vectors pSVLgp130-YFP, pSVLgp130/id-YFP, or pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) or empty pSVL vector in addition to pSVLJak1 using FuGene (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed using a Brij lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Brij-96, 50 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and immunoprecipitations were performed with a goat polyclonal GFP antibody (Rockland). After immunoblotting, Jak1 and gp130 fusion proteins were detected using a rabbit polyclonal Jak1 antibody (HR-785, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a monoclonal gp130 antibody (B-P4, Diaclone, Besançon, France), respectively. For assaying STAT activation mediated by the chimeric receptors, COS-7 cells were transfected with pSVLEg, pSVLEg-CFP, or empty pSVL-vector. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 7 units/ml Epo for 15 min. Subsequently, nuclear extracts were prepared and STAT DNA binding activity was determined in an EMSA using the m67SIE-probe as described previously (25Schmitz J. Dahmen H. Grimm C. Gendo C. Müller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Characterization of Jak1 Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with gp130-CFP and with expression vectors for the various Jak1-derivatives. After 48 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations with the gp130 antibody B-P8 (Diaclone) were performed. The immunoblot after SDS-PAGE was probed with the Jak1 antibody HR-785. After stripping, the membrane was reprobed with gp130 antibody B-P4 (Diaclone) to control for equal loading. Expression controls were performed with lysate blots detected with the same Jak1 and gp130 antibodies. Jak1-phosphorylation was detected using the antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal imaging was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an argon ion laser (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The argon ion laser was modulated by an acousto-optical modulator. For excitation of CFP imaging the 458 nm line was used. The beampath for CFP contained a 458 nm main dichroic mirror and a 480/20 nm bandpass filter for detection of the emitted fluorescence. This narrow filter excludes any fluorescence emerging from YFP that is also excited by the 458 nm laser beam. The beampath for YFP detection contained excitation at 514 nm and a main dichroic mirror of 514 nm. The emitted light was monitored with a 530 nm longpass filter. CFP is not excited by the 514 nm laser. For cells co-expressing CFP and YFP the multitrack function of the LSM 510 was used. Live cell imaging was carried out with COS-7 cells transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method. Transfected cells were grown on 18 mm glass coverslips. 48 h after transfection the coverslips were placed in a home built perfusion chamber and flushed with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. To maintain 37 °C during all image acquisition the perfusion chamber and the objective were thermostatted. For qualitative cell imaging a laser power of 35% of 25 milliwatts and 8% transmission was used. The images shown here represent 1-1.5-μm thick confocal slices of whole cells. FRAP Experiments—The general optical setup is described under Confocal Microscopy. A 63× water corrected immersion lens (numerical aperture 1.2) was used with a pinhole adjustment resulting in a 2-μm optical slice. After 10 prebleach scans (1 scan/second) of a circular region of interest (ROI 1) with a diameter of 1.3 μm, ROI 1 was bleached. Directly after bleaching the fluorescence recovery was sampled for 70 s once every second. In the antibody immobilization experiments the ROI fluorescence was recorded with 10 pre- and 40 postbleach scans (1 scan/2.2 s). An additional ROI on the plasma membrane (ROI 2) was monitored in parallel to ROI 1 but was not bleached in order to detect cellular movements and fluorescence fluctuations independent of bleaching. A third ROI (ROI 3) was placed outside the cell to measure background fluorescence. The settings for prebleach and recovery image scans were 100% of 25 milliwatts and 1% transmission for 458 nm (CFP excitation) and 100% of 25 milliwatts and 0.1% transmission for 514 nm (YFP excitation). Bleaching in ROI 1 was carried out with 200 scan iterations (3.7-3.8 s total bleach time) of 100% of 25 milliwatts and 100% transmission for 458 and 514 nm. During all scan and bleach-scan procedures the scan speed was set to maximum (pixel-time, 1.8 μs). The optical zoom factor of 3.5 led to a pixel size of 224 nm within the ROIs. For qualitative FRAP analysis, during the prebleach and recovery time periods the whole cell was scanned. For dual FRAP experiments in co-transfected cells, CFP and YFP were bleached simultaneously and images of CFP and YFP fluorescence were obtained frame by frame within one scanning procedure using the main dichroic mirror 458/514 for both channels and the multitracking function of the Zeiss LSM 510. Due to the low laser power and the short time of image acquisition the fluorescence intensity was not significantly influenced through 80 acquisitions. To determine the effects of antibodies against gp130 on the mobilities of the fluorescently labeled proteins, cells were incubated with BP-8 and BS-12-G7 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for each antibody. Evaluation of FRAP Data—Average fluorescence intensities within ROIs were measured under the same condition for each data set and exported into Microsoft Excel. The half-life of fluorescence recovery (t ½) was determined by curve fitting of experimental data using a mathematical model of fluorescence recovery by diffusion (26Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). The mobile fraction M f was calculated by the equation: M f = (F ∞ - F 0)/(F - - F 0) (22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) where F ∞ is the average fluorescence in the ROI after full recovery, F 0 is the fluorescence immediately after the bleach and F - is the average fluorescence before bleaching. Expression and Characterization of Fluorescent gp130 and Jak1 Fusion Proteins—In order to examine the subcellular localization and mobilites of gp130 and Jak1 in living cells by confocal microscopy and FRAP, fluorescent fusion proteins were generated. YFP and CFP were fused to the C terminus of full-length human gp130 resulting in the constructs gp130-YFP and gp130-CFP. Additionally, a truncated form of gp130 (amino acids 1-668) was C-terminally fused with fluorescent proteins leading to the constructs gp130/id-YFP and gp130/id-CFP. These constructs are internalization deficient (id) since they lack the dileucine motif (Leu786-Leu787) (10Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The confocal images of two transfected COS-7 cells in Fig. 1A show the typical expression patterns of the fusion proteins. As expected, gp130-YFP appears as a membrane-bound protein enriched at intracellular membranes and vesicles. Staining of the plasma membrane is also clearly visible. Gp130/id-YFP shows a similar distribution with a more pronounced staining of the plasma membrane due to reduced internalization of the receptor. The receptor constructs were analyzed with respect to Jak association and ligand-induced STAT activation. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding Jak1 and either gp130-YFP, gp130/id-YFP or YFP. Immunoprecipitation of the receptor fusion proteins with a GFP antibody led to the co-precipitation of Jak1 (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). In cells transfected with YFP and Jak1 or Jak1 alone, no co-precipitation of Jak1 was observed (lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, we conclude that both receptor constructs are associated with Jak1. Immunodetection of the precipitated gp130 fusion proteins revealed apparent molecular masses that are in agreement with the calculated molecular masses of 155 kDa and 125 kDa for gp130-YFP and gp130/id-YFP, respectively (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Next, the capability of fluorescent full-length gp130 to induce STAT activation upon cytokine stimulation was investigated. Since COS-7 cells endogenously express low levels of gp130 wild type the extracellular portion of gp130-CFP was replaced by the extracellular region of the EpoR. The resulting chimeric receptor Eg-CFP readily activates STAT1 in response to Epo stimulation (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6) similarly to the well established Epo-gp130 chimera (25Schmitz J. Dahmen H. Grimm C. Gendo C. Müller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (lanes 3 and 4) indicating that signaling is largely unaffected by the CFP fusion. Non-transfected COS-7 cells do not respond to Epo stimulation since they do not express the EpoR endogenously (lanes 1 and 2). Jak1-YFP, Jak1-CFP, Jak1/nb-YFP, and Jak1/kd-YFP were cloned by fusing the fluorescent proteins C-terminal to the kinase domain of Jak1 via a linker of nine amino acids. Jak1/nb is the L80AY81A mutant of Jak1 that does not bind (nb) to gp130 anymore (21Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Jak1/kd represents the kinase-deficient (kd) K907E mutant (15Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that fluorescent Jak1 has the ability to associate with the cytoplasmic region of gp130, co-precipitation experiments with gp130-CFP were performed. After expression in COS-7 cells both Jak1/kd-YFP and Jak1-YFP were co-precipitated with the receptor (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, Jak1/nb-YFP does not bind to the receptor (Fig. 1D, lane 3). In the loading and expression control panels fairly equivalent amounts of Jak proteins and receptors can be detected. Immunoprecipitation from cellular lysates reveals that overexpressed Jak1-YFP is constitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 1E, lane 3) while the kinase-deficient Jak1/kd-YFP is not (lane 2). Lateral Mobility of gp130-YFP Determined by FRAP—To determine the mobility of gp130 fusion proteins, small plasma membrane areas (regions of interest, ROIs) of living COS-7 cells expressing gp130-YFP were bleached using the 514 nm laser of the confocal microscope (Fig. 2A, upper images). Usually, bleaching down to 30-20% of the initial fluorescence intensity was achieved. Subsequently, the return of fluorescence into the bleached area was measured. In a typical experiment presented in the diagram in Fig. 2A, recovery of about 85% was observed. It is a well-known phenomenon of FRAP studies that no full recovery occurs (22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). The remainder of 15% is designated as “immobile fraction” since it is believed that it represents the portion of bleached gp130-YFP that is unable to diffuse freely and therefore cannot be replaced by non-bleached gp130-YFP. If the immobile fraction is generated by the energy input of the laser beam one would expect that consecutive bleaching leads to an increase in the immobile fraction. We observed that after two (Fig. 2B) or more rounds of bleaching and recovery of the same ROI, the immobile and mobile fractions remained constant. Therefore, the immobile fraction seems to be of biological significance rather than an artifact of the bleaching procedure. For quantitative FRAP measurements, two different ROIs on the plasma membrane with a diameter of 1.3 μm each were defined. One of these two ROIs was bleached and recovery of fluorescence was monitored. The other ROI remained unbleached and was used to monitor movements of the plasma membrane. Experiments in which changes in this control ROI occurred were not used for further evaluation. From the increase of fluorescence in the bleached ROI the half-life of fluorescence recovery was calculated by curve fitting (red graph in Fig. 2A) (26Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). The confocal images in Fig. 3 represent the distribution pattern of the co-expressed fusion proteins used in FRAP experiments. COS-7 cells were co-transfected either with gp130-YFP and Jak1-CFP (Fig. 3A), with gp130-CFP and Jak1-YFP (Fig. 3B) or with gp130-CFP and Jak1/kd-YFP (Fig. 3C). Images were taken from transfected living cells by confocal microscopy using the YFP- and CFP channels equipped in a way (see “Experimental Procedures”) that no cross-bleeding between the channels occurs. The intracellular distribution of Jak1-YFP (Fig. 3B) and Jak1/kd-YFP (Fig. 3C) is similar to the one observed for gp130-YFP (Fig. 3A); Jak1-YFP and Jak1/kd-YFP are localized at the plasma membrane and at intracellular membrane structures while there is little cytoplasmic staining. The diagram in Fig. 4A shows the half-lives for YFP fluorescence recovery obtained from COS-7 cells expressing gp130-YFP and Jak1-CFP (7 cells). From each cell 3-6 FRAP curves were obtained. The average half-lives range from 13.2-20.2 s for gp130-YFP. The overall mean value is 16.1 ± 2.1 s (Table I).Table ISummary of YFP fusion protein fluorescence recovery at 37 °CAnalysed fluorescent proteinCo-expressed fluorescent proteinNumber of cellst1/2Fluoresc. intensityMobile fractionnscounts%gp130-YFPJak1-CFP716.1 ± 2.11096 ± 45377.7 ± 4.1Jak1-YFPgp130-CFP1614.2 ± 3.01073 ± 36078.2 ± 4.2Jak1/kd-YFPgp130-CFP1015.7 ± 4.01053 ± 61976.3 ± 5.3 Open table in a new tab Since transiently transfected COS-7 cells were used for the experiments, expression levels of fluorescent fusion proteins varied from cell to cell. All experiments were performed under identical microscope settings for the laser energy input and the fluorescence detection. Therefore, the initial fluorescence intensities are a good measure for the expression levels of the fluorescent proteins. In Fig. 4B, the calculated half-lives of gp130-YFP fluorescence recovery from individual experiments are depicted as a function of fluorescence intensity of the ROIs before bleaching. No dependence on fluorescence intensity is observed indicating that the variable expression of the fusion proteins does not have any influence on the actual half-lives"
https://openalex.org/W2154799292,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) expression is a key mediator of ethanol-induced liver disease. Increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNFα expression in macrophages after chronic ethanol feeding is associated with a stabilization of TNFα mRNA (Kishore, R., McMullen, M. R., and Nagy, L. E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 41930–41937). Here we show that the 3′-UTR of murine TNFα mRNA was sufficient to mediate increased LPS-stimulated expression of a luciferase reporter in RAW 264.7 macrophages after chronic ethanol exposure. Further, we show that HuR, a nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling protein, which binds to TNFα mRNA, is required for increased expression of TNFα after chronic ethanol. In Kupffer cells, HuR was primarily localized to the nucleus and then translocated to the cytosol in response to LPS in both pair- and ethanol-fed rats. After chronic ethanol feeding, HuR quantity in the cytosol was greater, both at baseline and in response to LPS, compared with pair-fed controls. Using RNA gel shift assays, we found that LPS treatment increased HuR binding to the 65-nucleotide A + U-rich element of the TNFα 3′-UTR by 2-fold over baseline in Kupffer cells from pair-fed rats. After chronic ethanol feeding, HuR binding to the TNFα A + U-rich element was increased by more than 5-fold at baseline and in response to LPS, compared with pair-fed controls. Down-regulation of HuR expression by RNA interference prevented the chronic ethanol-induced increase in expression of luciferase reporters containing the TNFα 3′-UTR. Taken together, these data demonstrate that increased binding of HuR to the TNFα 3′-UTR contributes to increased LPS-stimulated TNFα expression in macrophages after chronic ethanol exposure.

For example, long term ethanol consumption results in an increased susceptibility to endotoxin-induced liver injury (14Honchel R. Ray M. Marsano L. Cohen D. Lee E. Shedlofsky S. McClain C.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LPS-stimulated TNFα production is increased in hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) after chronic ethanol feeding (15Aldred A. Nagy L.E. Am. J.

Enhanced secretion of TNFα by macrophages after chronic ethanol exposure is associated with increased accumulation of TNFα mRNA. This increase is associated with a chronic ethanol-induced stabilization of TNFα mRNA (17Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Modulation of mRNA stability is an important mechanism in the regulation of TNFα biosynthesis (19Hel Z. Skamene E. Radzioch D. Mol. Cell.

Stabilization of mRNAs contributes to the strong and rapid induction of genes in the inflammatory process. The TNFα mRNA, like other short-lived mRNAs, contains A + U-rich elements (ARE) in its 3′-untranslated region (UTR) that function as destabilizing elements, as demonstrated in transgenic mice in which the TNFα-ARE is deleted (21Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), as well as in various in vitro systems (19Hel Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition to the destabilizing activity of the TNFα 3′-UTR, the ARE elements in the 3′-UTR allow for stabilization of the TNFα mRNA in response to activation (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Brook M. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 2000; : 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Stability of the TNFα mRNA is controlled by trans-acting factors that bind to the TNFα mRNA. A large number of mRNA-binding proteins regulate both stabilization and destabilization (25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Of these, several proteins that bind to the TNFα mRNA, specifically to its 3′-UTR, have been identified; tristetraprolin (26Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HuR (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell.

Tristetraprolin is a zinc-finger protein induced by LPS in macrophages that acts to destabilize TNFα mRNA (26Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J.

In contrast, HuR, a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) family of RNA-binding proteins, primarily acts to stabilize the TNFα mRNA (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G.

Here we report that the TNFα 3′-UTR is sufficient to convey the effect of chronic ethanol on increasing LPS-stimulated luciferase reporter activity. Further, we show that chronic ethanol exposure enhances the LPS-dependent translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytosol, as well as increases the binding of HuR to the ARE in TNFα 3′-UTR, likely contributing to chronic ethanol-induced stabilization of TNFα mRNA. Materials—LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 026:B6 (tissue culture tested) was purchased from Sigma; all experiments were carried out with a single lot of LPS (lot number 111K401). Antibodies to HuR were a gift from H. Furneaux or from Molecular Probes, Eugene OR. Anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase (Fab fragments) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Low endotoxin plasmid preparation kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Luciferase reporter constructs have been described previously: pTNFα-LUC (containing –615-+1 nucleotide TNFα promoter in a luciferase reporter) was from N. Mackman, University of California, San Diego, CA (31Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar); pTNFα-5′-UTR-LUC (containing –993-+110 of the TNFα promoter and 5′-UTR in pGL2 vector) and pTNFα-5′-UTRLUC-3′-UTR (containing –993-+100 of the TNFα promoter and 5′-UTR, as well as the 833-base TNFα 3′-UTR in pGL2 vector) luciferase reporters were from D. Joyce, University of Western Australia (32Kroeger K.M. Carville K.S. Abraham L.J. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 33Steer J.H. Kroeger K.M. Abraham L.J.

Kruys (34Marchant A. Gueydan C. Houzet L. Amraoui Z. Sels A. Huez G. Goldman M. Kruys V. J. Inflamm. 1996; 46: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids used for synthesis of RNA probes, including 65-nucleotide TNFα ARE (1281–1350 in the 3′-UTR and the full-length TNFα 3′-UTR 1110–1627), were from P. Blackshear, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health. Animals and Chronic Ethanol Feeding Protocol—Adult male Wistar rats weighing 150 g were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and allowed free access to the Lieber DeCarli ethanol diet (ethanol-fed; Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) or pair-fed a control diet, which isocalorically substitutes maltose-dextrin for ethanol as described previously (17Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Board at Case Western Reserve University. Kupffer Cell Isolation and Culture—Kupffer cells were isolated as described previously (15Aldred A. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G98-G106PubMed Google Scholar) except that CMRL medium was used to isolate and culture Kupffer cells. Briefly, livers were perfused with 0.05% collagenase, and the resulting suspension of liver cells was treated with 0.02% Pronase for 15 min at 12 °C. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged three times at 50 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected after each centrifugation. The pooled supernatant was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 7 min to collect non-parenchymal cells. Kupffer cells were then purified by centrifugal elutriation (15Aldred A. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G98-G106PubMed Google Scholar). The yield and purity of isolated Kupffer cells did not differ between pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats (15Aldred A. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G98-G106PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated Kupffer cells were suspended in CMRL with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml and plated onto 6-well plates (2 ml/well). After 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration, and fresh media were supplied. Assays were carried out after 24 h in culture. Culture of RAW 264.7 Macrophages and Luciferase Assays—The RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cell line was cultured routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (18Shi L. Kishore R. McMullen M. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14777-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For luciferase reporter assays, RAW 264.7 macrophages were grown in 6-well plates to 60–70% confluency and then transiently transfected with control and expression vectors using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected with pTK-RL (Promega), an expression vector for Renilla luciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, as a control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were sub-cultured and seeded at 10.2 × 104/cm2 in 96-well plates. After 2 h, medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS with or without 25 mm ethanol. Control and ethanol-treated plates were wrapped with parafilm to prevent evaporation of ethanol; parafilm wrapping had no effect on the pH value of the cell culture media over the 48 h in culture (data not shown). The concentration of ethanol in media was measured by enzymatic assay (Sigma) and was within 80% of the starting concentration after 24 h (data not shown). After 48 h, media were removed, and cells were stimulated or not with LPS in DMEM/FBS. Cells were then extracted in lysis buffer after 4 h of stimulation with LPS, and luciferase activities were measured using the DUAL luciferase assay system (Promega). Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) from Kupffer cells isolated from ethanol- and pair-fed rats after stimulation with 0 or 100 ng/ml LPS for up to 3 h. Nuclear and cytosolic samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies to HuR by Western blot. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive protein quantity was assessed by scanning densitometry. Preparation of RNA Transcripts—Labeled RNA probes for RNA gel shift assays were prepared by in vitro transcription. The plasmids containing mTNFα 1281–1350 and mTNFα 110–1627 in Bluescript or pTRI-actin-mouse (Ambion), used as a non-relevant RNA control 300 nt in length, were linearized with XbaI to generate the DNA template for in vitro transcription. Template (1 μg) was incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP, CTP, and GTP and 32.5 μm UTP (containing 50 μCi of 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]UTP and 30 units of T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 10 min). Template DNA was removed, and the reaction was stopped by incubating the mixture with DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C and adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, respectively. Free nucleotide was then removed by gel filtration using a Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad). The fragment was then gel-purified on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and eluted overnight at 37 °C in 0.5 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS. RNA Gel Shift Assays—RNA gel shift assays were carried out as described by Dean et al. (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 10 μg of cytosolic extracts from Kupffer cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 20 fmol of labeled RNA probe. For antibody supershift experiments, 50 units/ml RNase T1 was included in the incubation buffer, and 4 μg of anti-HuR was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Heparin sulfate (5 mg/ml) was then added for 10 min at room temperature. Samples separated on 4 or 4–20% gradient acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 200 V at 4 °C. Gels were then fixed, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Immunohistochemistry—Isolated Kupffer cells were cultured overnight in LabTek chamber slides and then stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS for 0–120 min. Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were then quenched in 25 mm glycine in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min. Slides were then blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% fish gelatin in PBS and then incubated with antibody to HuR (20 μg/ml) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times for 15 min in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:300) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for1hin blocking buffer. Slides were finally washed three times for 15 min in PBS and then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Samples were blinded, and cells were examined with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope under a ×60 lens. Multiple cells from at least four separate preparations were examined. Nonspecific binding was assessed in cells incubated in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown). RNA Interference—RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated in 6-well plates and after 48 h, when cells were about 70% confluent, transfected with siRNA (2 μg) using the TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA directed against HuR (siRNA HuR) was targeted to positions 163–183 relative to the start codon of HuR. This sequence was based on previously published reports (35Kloss S. Furneaux H. Mulsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2377-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed by Qiagen. 2 μg of siRNA HuR or control (nonsilencing; Qiagen), along with 1.2 μg of pTNFα-5′-UTR-LUC-3′-UTR or LUC-3′-UTR (luciferase reporters) and 0.1 μg of pTK-RL (Renilla reporter), were diluted in 6.6 μl of Enhancer R (ratio of RNA/DNA to Enhancer R is 1:2) and 85 μl of Buffer EC-R (Qiagen). 8 μl of Transfection reagent was added after 5 min at room temperature. RAW 264.7 macrophages were washed twice with PBS and then the RNA/DNA transfection mixture, diluted to 800 μl of DMEM with FBS, added dropwise to the cells. Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 3 h and then media were changed to DMEM with FBS. Cells were subcultured to 96-well plates (for luciferase assays), LabTek chamber slides (for immunohistochemistry), or 24-well plates (for Western blotting) at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/ml, allowed to attach, and then treated with or without 25 mm ethanol for 48 h. Transfection efficiencies were determined by transfecting RAW 264.7 macrophages with a fluorescein-labeled control (non-silencing) siRNA (Qiagen), followed by immunohistochemistry after 2 h in culture and ranged from 35–45% efficiency. Statistical Analysis—Because of the limited number of Kupffer cells available from each animal, data from several feeding trials are presented in this paper; each trial consisted of six rats per feeding group. Values reported are means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by Student's t test or general linear models procedure (SAS, Carey, IN) using the least square means test to determine differences. Chronic exposure to ethanol, either in vivo during ethanol feeding or in vitro upon exposure to ethanol in culture, increases LPS-stimulated TNFα mRNA accumulation in isolated Kupffer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages, respectively (17Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increased LPS-stimulated TNFα mRNA accumulation after chronic ethanol is associated with a stabilization of TNFα mRNA (17Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we have asked whether sequences in the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of the TNFα mRNA are sufficient to increase LPS-stimulated expression of a heterologous luciferase reporter after chronic ethanol exposure. RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with constructs containing the TNFα promoter, 5′-UTR, and/or 3′-UTR and then cultured with or without 25 mm ethanol for 48 h and stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS. LPS-stimulated luciferase expression driven by the TNFα promoter alone was not affected by chronic ethanol exposure (Fig. 1) (18Shi L. Kishore R. McMullen M. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14777-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), consistent with data demonstrating that chronic ethanol exposure has no net effect on LPS-stimulated transcription of TNFα in macrophages (18Shi L. Kishore R. McMullen M. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14777-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, inclusion of the TNFα 5′-UTR did not convey a chronic ethanol-induced increase in LPS-stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 1). Inclusion of the TNFα 3′-UTR in this reporter construct decreased LPS-stimulated activity in control cells, consistent with mRNA instability elements within the TNFα 3′-UTR (21Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In contrast, after chronic ethanol exposure, LPS-stimulated luciferase activity was 4.4-fold higher when the TNFα 3′-UTR was included in the reporter construct compared with controls (Fig. 1). To test whether the 3′-UTR alone was sufficient to convey increased LPS-stimulated luciferase activity after chronic ethanol exposure, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing the TNFα 3′-UTR under the control of the SV40 promoter (SV40-LUC-TNFα 3′-UTR). Luciferase reporter constructs under the control of the SV40 promoter (SV40-LUC, pGL2), but without the TNFα 3′-UTR, did not respond to LPS stimulation (data not shown). Insertion of the TNFα 3′-UTR (SV40-LUC-TNFα 3′-UTR) conveyed LPS-stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 1) (33Steer J.H. Kroeger K.M. Abraham L.J. Joyce D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18432-18440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, including the TNFα 3′-UTR increased LPS-stimulated luciferase activity after chronic exposure to ethanol by 3.5-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 1). LPS stimulation of luciferase activity, as well as increased expression after chronic ethanol, were lost when the class II ARE was deleted from TNFα 3′-UTR, indicating a critical role for this ARE element in mediating responses to both LPS and chronic ethanol. We have reported previously that overexpression of a luciferase reporter construct containing the TNFα 3′-UTR under the control of the SV40 promoter was not sufficient to convey chronic ethanol-induced stabilization to luciferase mRNA (17Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41930-41937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To reconcile this previous result with the current data suggesting an essential role of the 3′-UTR in mediating the chronic effects of ethanol, we hypothesized that constitutive high levels of overexpression of the 3′-UTR might titrate out specific proteins required to mediate LPS and/or chronic ethanol-induced regulation of luciferase expression. To test this hypothesis, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with increasing quantities of the SV40-LUC-TNFα 3′-UTR reporter. At low levels of expression, stimulation with LPS increased luciferase activity, and this response was enhanced after chronic ethanol by 3.5-fold (Fig. 1B). However, at higher level of expression of the SV40-LUC-TNFα 3′-UTR reporter, basal luciferase activity increased. As basal expression of luciferase increased, the ability of LPS to stimulate luciferase activity over baseline was diminished from 5.6- and 10.8-fold over basal when 0.36 μg of DNA was transfected for control and ethanol-treated, respectively, to 3.5- and 2.9-fold when 4.8 μg of the SV40-LUC-3′-UTR was transfected in control and ethanol-treated cells, respectively. Furthermore, as the expression level of the reporter increased, the ability of chronic ethanol to enhance LPS-stimulated luciferase activity was diminished (Fig. 1B). This saturation in the enhancing effect of chronic ethanol on LPS-stimulated luciferase activity is consistent with our previous observations that chronic ethanol only enhances LPS-stimulated TNFα mRNA accumulation and peptide accumulation at sub-maximal LPS concentrations (15Aldred A. Nagy L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G98-G106PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kishore, R., McMullen, M. R., Cocuzzi, E., and Nagy, L. E. (2003) Comp. Hepatol., in press.Google Scholar). Because the TNFα 3′-UTR is sufficient to mediate increased LPS stimulation after chronic ethanol, we next investigated the role of the mRNA-binding protein, HuR, in mediating the effects of chronic ethanol. HuR is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling protein that stabilizes a number of short-lived mRNAs, including TNFα (23Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). HuR primarily resides in the nucleus in resting cells but exits to the cytoplasm in response to a number of stimuli, including exposure to LPS (25Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether chronic ethanol feeding disrupts the intracellular localization of HuR in isolated Kupffer cells from pair- and ethanol-fed rats. Isolated Kupffer cells were stimulated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS for 0–2 h. In Kupffer cells from both pair- and ethanol-fed rats, HuR was primarily localized to the nucleus at baseline (Fig. 2A). In response to LPS, HuR moved from the nucleus to punctate regions of the cell (Fig. 2A). This typical cytosolic/punctate distribution of HuR has been suggested to indicate a localization of HuR t"

We previously showed evidence for an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism for minus strand transfer. In the present study, we examined the major acceptor invasion initiation site using a minus strand transfer system in vitro, containing the 97-nucleotide full-length R region. A series of DNA oligonucleotides complementary to different regions of the cDNA was designed to interfere with transfer. Oligomers covering the region around the base of the TAR hairpin were most effective in inhibiting transfer, suggesting that the hairpin base is a preferred site for acceptor invasion. The strong pausing of reverse transcriptase at the base of the TAR and the concomitant RNase H cleavages 10–19 nucleotides behind the pause site correlated with the location of the invasion site. Oligomers closer to the 5′-end of R also inhibited transfer, though less effectively, presumably by blocking strand exchange and branch migration. We propose that pausing of reverse transcriptase at the base of TAR increases RNase H cleavages, creating gaps for acceptor invasion and transfer initiation. Strand exchange then propagates by branch migration, displacing the fragmented donor RNA, including the fragment at the 5′ terminus. The primer terminus switches to the acceptor, completing the transfer. Nucleocapsid (NC) protein stimulated transfer efficiency by 5–7-fold. NC enhanced RNase H cleavages close to the TAR base, creating more effective invasion sites for efficient transfer. Most likely, NC also stimulates transfer by promoting strand exchange invasion and branch migration. Minus strand strong stop transfer is obligatory for completion of HIV-1 minus strand synthesis.

In retrovirus replication, transfers of partially synthesized DNA strands from one template to another are obligatory for completion of reverse transcription and synthesis of integration-competent double-stranded viral DNA. The transfer process is mediated by the viral polymerase reverse transcriptase (RT), 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; NC, nucleocapsid; nt(s), nucleotide(s); R, repeat; –sssDNA, minus strand strong stop DNA.1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; NC, nucleocapsid; nt(s), nucleotide(s); R, repeat; –sssDNA, minus strand strong stop DNA. which can catalyze both RNA- and DNA-templated DNA synthesis. In HIV-1, minus strand DNA synthesis is primed from a tRNALys3 primer annealed to the primer binding site located near the 5′-end of the genome. Synthesis proceeds to the 5′-end of the genome, creating a DNA fragment called minus strand strong stop DNA (–sssDNA). The direct repeat sequences located at the ends of the genome enable the –sssDNA to transfer to the 3′-end of either the same or the copackaged RNA. This step, called minus strand transfer (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase.

Cold Spring Harbor Labortatory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar), occurs through both intermolecular and intramolecular pathways with similar probability (3Hu W.S. Temin H.M.

Virology. 1998; 244: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Failure to detect a significant amount of –sssDNA in the infected cell cytoplasm suggests that minus strand transfer is an efficient event in vivo (6Varmus H.E. Heasley S. Kung H.J. Oppermann H.

Mutational studies have shown that minus strand transfer mostly takes place after RT extends to the 5′-end of the genome, even though a small amount of premature transfer was also detected (8Lobel L.I.

Both active sites reside within the p66 subunit and are separated by a spatial distance of 18–19 nts. The RNase H active site can make a cut 18–19 nts behind the primer terminus on the RNA strand. Cleavage is most likely when the RT is transiently paused during synthesis (14DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both the polymerase and RNase H activities of the RT are essential for completion of minus strand synthesis. Viruses with defective RNase H activity fail to complete reverse transcription, especially at the minus strand transfer step, highlighting the important role of RNase H cleavage for transfer (16Luo G.X.

In minus strong stop transfer, the cDNA transfers to the 3′-end of either the same or the second RNA molecule based on the repeat (R) homology. In HIV-1 the R sequence is 97 nts long and includes all of the TAR hairpin and part of the poly(A) hairpin. Mutational and deletion studies have shown that the entire length of the R region is not required for minus strand transfer (22Berkhout B. van Wamel J. Klaver B. J. Mol.

In addition to the primary sequence, RNA secondary structure and cis-acting elements have been implicated in facilitating minus strand transfer (11Kulpa D. Topping R. Telesnitsky A.

HIV-1 NC coats the viral RNA genome in a sequence-independent mode, at a ratio of one NC to 7 nts (29Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder 2nd, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O.

The ability of NC to promote strand annealing, particularly as it applies to interaction between the –sssDNA and RNA in the 3′-R (34You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31491-31495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been implicated in minus strand transfer. Studies done in vitro also suggest that NC prevents the –sssDNA from forming foldback products (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Virology. 2001; 285: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which otherwise would result in dead-end transfer intermediates. In addition, NC has also been shown to facilitate strand transfer by stimulating RT RNase H activity (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We recently showed by analysis in vitro that minus strand transfer proceeds through an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A feature of this mechanism is that the first interactions of the –sssDNA with the acceptor RNA occur when the acceptor anneals to the cDNA donor well upstream of the DNA 3′-end. This is followed by a branch migration process in which expansion of the RNA-DNA hybrid region displaces the remaining RNA fragments, ultimately leading to the terminus transfer. In the present study we examine the location of invasions in a system of donor and acceptor RNAs that contain the full-length HIV-1 R region. Using a series of DNA oligomers designed to block invasion, we show that the region around the base of the TAR hairpin is a major acceptor invasion initiation site. The patterns of RT pausing and increased RNase H cleavage at the base of the TAR region support this conclusion. We also examine factors that influence the efficiency and location of the invasion step, including template homology and NC protein. Materials—Purified HIV-1 RT (20,000 units/mg) was generously provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and all other enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. The 32P isotope was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science. The pNL4-3 molecular clone (from Dr. Malcolm Martin) was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). HIV-1 NCp7 (72 amino acids) was prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis as described by de Rocquigny et al. (52de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Preparation of RNA Templates—The donor RNA template D199 and acceptor RNA templates A70h, A82h, and A97h were generated by run-off transcription in vitro, from the corresponding PCR-amplified double-stranded DNA products using the Ambion T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Austin, TX) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR primers were designed to contain the T7 promoter sequence. The 5′-end of the D199 donor template corresponded to the +1 position on the genomic RNA, whereas its 3′-end corresponded to position +199 (primer binding site 3′-end), respectively. The acceptors A70h, A82h, and A97h started from the U3 region (position +9056) and extended into the 3′-R region (positions +9145, +9157, +9172, respectively). The sequence of the forward PCR primer for D199 was 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACT ATAGGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGA, and the sequence of the reverse primer was 5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACTGCTAGAGTT. The sequence of the forward PCR primer for the acceptor template was 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCUGCUUUUUGCCU, and the sequences of the reverse primers were 5′-GGCTTAAGCAGTGGGTTCCCTAGTTAGCC (A70h), 5′-AAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAGCAGTGGGTTC (A82h), and 5′-TGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGC (A97h). All RNA templates used in the study were purified by denaturing PAGE and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA buffer. RNAs were quantitated using the Ribogreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Substrate Preparation—DNA primers were 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 (222 TBq) Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase. For transfer reactions, primer, donor, and acceptor were mixed at a 1.5:1:3 ratio, incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and slow cooled to room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For use in RNase H assays, RNA templates were first dephosphorylated by calf intestine phosphatase, 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 (222 TBq) Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase and purified by denaturing PAGE as described previously (53Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transfer Assay—Reactions were performed as described previously (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Final reactions contained 2.5 nm primer/template, 7.5 nm acceptor RNA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 32 nm HIV-1 RT. RT was allowed to pre-bind to substrate at 37 °C for 2 min before reactions were initiated with MgCl2 and dNTPs at a final concentration of 6 mm and 50 μm, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and terminated using 2× termination dye (10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide (v/v), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). For reactions performed in the presence of NC protein, an appropriate amount of NC was added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of RT. The amount of NC protein required for 200% coating of templates was determined from the length and amount of template used and assuming that one NC molecule covers 7 nts (29Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder 2nd, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reactions performed with the blocking oligomers, 75 nm oligomer was added to the reaction mixture immediately after initiating reactions with MgCl2 and dNTPs, as described previously (54Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4710-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All blocking oligomers were synthesized with 3′-phosphorylation to inhibit priming. In reactions designed to assess donor cleavage, donor RNA was 5′-end labeled. Sizes of DNA products were measured using a 10-bp DNA ladder, whereas sizes of RNA product were measured using ladders made by RNase T1 digestion and RNA hydrolysis. We have presented evidence previously for an acceptor invasion-initiated mechanism of minus strand strong stop transfer in HIV-1 (Fig. 1) (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By this mechanism, RNase H cleavages within the internal regions of the donor RNA during –sssDNA synthesis are crucial in facilitating the transfer. The homologous acceptor RNA anneals to the cDNA at short gaps created within the donor RNA template and initiates the transfer well behind the primer terminus. First contact of acceptor RNA and cDNA is called invasion because adjacent RNA segments are displaced to allow stable annealing. The acceptor RNA template strand then continues to displace the fragmented donor competitively. Strand exchange proceeds by a branch migration process, displacing the donor RNA fragments, including the one at the terminus. Transfer is eventually completed by the primer terminus switching to the genome 3′-end. A notable feature of this pathway is that it does not require extensive cleavages at the donor 5′-end to dissociate the primer terminus. In the present study we define the major site of acceptor invasion and factors that influence its use. Analysis of Minus Strand Transfer Using Templates with Full-length R Regions—In our previous study, we used a simplified donor-acceptor template system based on the HIV-1 R sequence to examine the mechanism of minus strong stop transfer in vitro. The donor and acceptor RNA templates shared a homology of 45 nts or less (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we extended the templates such that they shared homology lengths up to the entire R sequence (Fig. 2A), so that we could assess mechanism with a more natural length substrate. The 199-nt donor RNA template (D199) extended from the 5′-end of the genome to the primer binding site sequence. The three acceptor templates, A70h, A82h, and A97h, were derived from the 3′-end of the genome and initiated at position +9056 in the U3 of the genomic RNA. The acceptor templates differed at their 3′-ends such that they shared a homology of 70, 82, or 97 nts with the R region of the D199 donor. Because the 5′-ends of all three acceptor RNAs were identical, transfer products generated by each of them were also expected to be of the same size. Synthesis was primed from the primer binding site region on the donor template using an 18-nt DNA primer. Synthesis to the 5′-end of the donor RNA generated a 199-nt donor extension product (Fig. 2B). An additional 245-nt product was also observed. As described, this product is made because the donor extension product folds back on itself for additional self-primed synthesis (42Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the acceptor template, a 219-nt transfer product was observed, the result of primers completing synthesis on the acceptor after transfer. Transfer efficiency is defined as the ratio of transfer product to the sum of full-length extension product, self-priming product, and transfer product. At a 1:2 donor:acceptor ratio, a base level transfer efficiency of 4–5% was observed for all the three acceptors, irrespective of homology length. We next examined the effect of NC in the transfer reactions. Assuming one NC molecule/7 nt as 100% coating level (29Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder 2nd, R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess Jr., J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of NC was titrated to achieve from 12.5 to 200% coating of the substrates (Fig. 2B). NC did not alter the overall extension profile of the reaction but slightly decreased the overall intensity of the pause sites. However, increased levels of NC noticeably stimulated the transfer efficiency, as observed previously (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At 200% coating level, transfer efficiency increased to 25% for A70h, 36% for A82h, and 35% for A97h. The effect of NC was observable at as low as 12.5% NC coating. This was in contrast to the results from our previous study using templates with short homology, in which NC stimulation of transfers was not obvious below 200% coating (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulating transfer, NC also inhibited self-priming. This inhibition was more distinct with the longer templates than observed previously with the short templates (25Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8006-8017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At 200% NC coating level, self-priming product was greatly reduced from 25% (A70h and A97h) or 31% (A82h) to 3–5% on these templates. This suggests that the long homology system currently employed more effectively simulates the natural viral minus strand transfer. Blocking Oligomers Reveal Initiation Sites for Strand Transfer—To determine the positions and characteristics of the invasion initiation sites during minus strand transfer, a series of “blocking” DNA oligomers 20–30 nts in length was designed (Fig. 3A). These DNA oligomers had sequences representing specific sections of the RNA template and were therefore complementary to the –sssDNA. The rationale is that the DNA oligomer will compete with the acceptor for annealing to the cDNA at the invasion site. This should block initiation of transfers from that site and result in a drop in transfer efficiency. Of course an oligomer could potentially also block the branch migration or the primer terminus switch steps, so the action of specific oligomers requires careful interpretation. The oligomers were chosen to be complementary with the –sssDNA and not the donor or acceptor RNAs so that their presence would have minimal effects on the structures of RNA which are relevant to the transfer mechanism. Their effects on transfer should be exerted after the RNA-DNA hybrid is formed from the donor RNA, so that the region of invasion is largely double-stranded. They should displace fragments of the donor strand and take their place, protecting a specific invasion region. To test their effects under conditions highly favorable for transfer, the oligomers were added to the transfer reactions at a 200% NC coating level. Transfers were first examined using the full-length homology acceptor A97h (Fig. 3B). To prevent priming of synthesis, the oligomers were phosphorylated at their 3′-ends. Presence of the oligomers did not change the primer extension pattern except in one important way. An intense band was observed at position 130, 172, 164, 160, 142, or 127, depending on the oligonucleotide present in the reaction (Fig. 3B, shown by arrows). These products corresponded to cDNA strands that transferred to the oligomer, extending to a final length at the 5′-end of the oligomer. This is a favorable observation indicating that the oligomers annealed to the cDNA to block invasion by the acceptor. The transfer of some DNA to the oligomers should not affect the accuracy of our transfer efficiency measurements. This is because transfer efficiency is determined from the ratio of primers that have been extended past the blocking oligomer, to either transfer or complete extension to the end of the donor RNA. All of the blocking oligomers inhibited transfers to some extent compared with a control reaction lacking any blocking oligomer (Fig. 3B). In addition, the oligomers also inhibited cDNA self-priming. This was because annealing of the DNA oligomer prevents the cDNA from folding back on itself. This was especially true for oligomers 36–80 and 40–69, which were complementary to the cDNA around the base of the cTAR hairpin. Relative transfer efficiencies of reactions with blocking oligomers were plotted, with the efficiency of the unblocked transfer reaction set at 100% (Fig. 3C). The oligomers 36–80 and 40–69 were most effective in inhibiting transfer, causing a 60–70% inhibition. Each of these spanned a region that included about half of the TAR hairpin and half of the poly(A) hairpin. The effectiveness of these oligomers in blocking transfer when considered with their specific location suggested that these oligomers inhibited transfers by blocking invasion by the acceptor. Oligomers 28–57 and 1–30 were somewhat"
https://openalex.org/W2035730588,"Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein (SGT) is a ubiquitously expressed cochaperone of heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (Hsc70). SGT binds to the C terminus of Hsc70, a site used by several tetratricopeptide repeat-containing binding partners to recruit Hsc70 into complexes of diverse function. We describe here an isoform of SGT with 60% amino acid sequence identity that we name βSGT. In contrast to the previously published αSGT, βSGT is almost exclusively expressed in brain. Both isoforms of SGT possess similar binding properties toward Hsc70 and cysteine string protein, a synaptic vesicle-associated J-domain-containing protein. In addition, SGTs oligomerize without preferences among isoforms. The distribution of protein binding motifs on SGTs reveals a modular structure. The N-terminal domains mediate oligomerization. Binding to Hsc70 is impaired by mutations of basic residues within the central tetratricopeptide repeat domain of βSGT, indicating a two-carboxylate clamp as the binding mode. The tetratricopeptide repeats are also necessary for binding to the cysteine string protein. However, this binding mode is distinct from the two-carboxylate clamp that is involved in Hsc70 binding. The C-terminal regions of SGTs might constitute independent protein interaction domains. We conclude that βSGT is likely to cooperate with αSGT as co-chaperone of Hsc70 in the brain. The modular structure of SGTs allows them to recruit client proteins to Hsc70 and to direct the resulting complex toward downstream proteins that take over the respective client proteins.

This binding is stabilized in the ADP-bound and destabilized in the ATP-bound form of Hsc70. As a consequence, protein interactions of Hsc70 are transient and controlled by the cycle of ATP hydrolysis. This regulated chaperoning of hydrophobic patches enables Hsc70 to assist client proteins in folding, refolding, and unfolding (1Mayer M.P. Schröder H. Rüdiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).A large ensemble of accessory proteins supports the function of Hsc70. These co-chaperones mediate the presentation of client proteins, modulate the ATP hydrolysis cycle, induce the formation of larger chaperone complexes, recruit chaperone complexes to organelles, and change the fate of client proteins. Hsc70 provides independent docking sites for co-chaperones in its N-terminal domain and at its C terminus. Several conserved structural motifs that allow binding to Hsc70 have been identified in co-chaperones. A motif of about 70 amino acid residues that is named J-domain after the bacterial co-chaperone DnaJ mediates binding of co-chaperones that support the folding of client proteins to Hsc70 (2Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Binding of the J-domain protein auxilin for example recruits Hsc70 to assembled clathrin. Stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 by auxilin induces the disassembly of clathrin coats (3Zinsmaier K.E. Bronk P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A motif of about 110 amino acid residues named BAG domain is found in a distinct family of co-chaperones that stimulate ADP release from Hsc70 (4Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Several copies of a 34-amino acid residue motif named tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) combine to form a protein interaction domain that is involved in a large variety of protein-protein interactions (5Blatch G.L. Lässle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), including the binding of co-chaperones to Hsc70 (6Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L.

TPR domain containing co-chaperones of Hsc70 can bind either to internal sequences (7Irmer H. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or to the very C terminus of Hsc70 (8Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The functional context in which the C-terminal interactors of Hsc70 operate is only beginning to emerge. A common feature appears to be the recruitment of Hsc70 to protein complexes that then take over the handling of client proteins. Thus, the fate of a client protein would be partly determined by the TPR domain-containing protein that occupies the C terminus of Hsc70. Hsp70 and Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop) for example contain several TPR domains that mediate the simultaneous binding of Hsc70 and Hsp90 (10Frydman J. Höhfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Hop assembles a larger chaperone complex that facilitates the folding of client proteins. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) on the other hand harbors a TPR domain and an additional protein interaction domain, a U-box, which connects to the ubiquitin-conjugating system (11Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The complex formation of Hsc70 with a ubiquitin ligase leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of client proteins. Translocation machinery in the outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOM70) recruits Hsp70 and Hsp90 to the mitochondrial import channel and mediates the delivery of client proteins into mitochondria (12Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). There are several other potential-interacting partners of the C terminus of Hsc70 for which a functional role has not yet been identified (6Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 9Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J. Hu S.-M. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein (SGT) was originally identified due to its binding to the viral proteins NS1 of parovirus H-1 (13Cziepluch C. Kordes E. Poirey R. Grewenig A. Rommelaere J. Jauniaux J.-C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to Vpu and Gag of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (14Callahan M.A. Handley M.A. Lee Y.H. Talbot K.J. Harper J.W. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5189-5197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, SGT was found to interact with the C terminus of Hsc70 (9Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J. Hu S.-M. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rat SGT consists of 314 amino acid residues that are arranged in three domains of equal size: an N-terminal region, a central TPR domain, and a C-terminal region. The central TPR domain consists of three repeats, which are sufficient for binding to the C terminus of Hsc70 (9Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J. Hu S.-M. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of SGT shows sequence similarity to the TPR domains of Hop, CHIP, and TOM70 (6Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The crystal structure determination of the first TPR domain of Hop bound to a C-terminal peptide of Hsc70 revealed details of a general binding mechanism (6Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) that may differ slightly between different TPR-containing interactors of the C terminus of Hsc70 (15Wu S.-J. Liu F.-H. Hu S.-M. Wang C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Brinker A. Scheufler C. von der Mülbe F. Fleckenstein B. Herrmann C. Jung G. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19265-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Regions outside the TPR domain of SGT lack any defined protein interaction motifs. However, the N terminus contains a potential short coiled coil, and the C terminus is rich in glutamine residues and asparagine-proline repeats.Recently SGT was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the cysteine string protein (CSP; Ref. 17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). CSP is a small protein with a J-domain at its N terminus and a central string of 14 cysteine residues (18Buchner E. Gundersen C.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 223-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of the cysteines mediates the attachment of CSP to secretory and synaptic vesicles (19Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull. K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of the J-domain of CSP to Hsc70 could recruit the chaperone to these vesicles. Trimeric complexes of CSP·Hsc70·SGT were demonstrated on synaptic vesicles (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Both CSP and SGT can independently interact with Hsc70 via their J-domain and TPR domain, respectively (9Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J. Hu S.-M. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Stahl B. Tobaben S. Südhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The functional implication of the additional direct interaction between SGT and CSP within the trimeric complex remains to be elucidated, but the presence of the trimeric complex on synaptic vesicles suggests a specialized role in neuronal function.We report here the cloning of a rat protein with high similarity to SGT that is preferentially expressed in the brain. We provide a comparative analysis of the binding properties of the isoforms. As a step toward understanding SGT function on the basis of its structure, we determine the binding interfaces involved in its interactions. We describe a modular organization of SGT in which the N terminus mediates oligomerization, the central TPR domain mediates the interactions with both Hsc70 and CSP, and the C terminus represents an independent interaction module for which we present potential binding partners.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Enzymes for DNA manipulations were from Roche Applied Science or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), and nitrocellulose membranes (Protran) from Schleicher & Schuell. RNA blots were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from standard sources.Antibodies—A polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against rat βSGT was generated using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the full-length βSGT as antigen. A polyclonal antibody against rat αSGT was described previously (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-pentahistidine antibody was purchased from Qiagen, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies was from Bio-Rad.Cloning of Rat βSGT and Mutagenesis—A human expressed sequence tag (L01458499) with similarity to rat αSGT was obtained from the Resource Center and Primary Data base (Berlin, Germany) and used as probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library in λZapII (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) at low stringency. Positive clones were isolated, and rescued plasmids were sequenced by using the dideoxy chain termination method with dye terminators on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Several clones coding for the full-length coding regions of αSGT and βSGT were obtained. Sequences were submitted to GenBank™ (accession numbers AF368278 for rat αSGT and AF368280 for rat βSGT). For the generation of N-terminal GST-tagged or His6-tagged expression constructs, βSGT was amplified by PCR from a plasmid, introducing restriction sites, and subcloned in-frame into pGEX-KG (22Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) and pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively. Point mutations were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and cysteine string mutations by overlapping PCR strategies.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (23Augustin I. Betz A. Hermann C. Jo T. Brose N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult rats were anesthetized then decapitated, and the brains were taken out and immediately frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections (14 μm) were collected on pretreated glass slides, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and hybridized for 18 h with 35S-dATP-labeled oligonucleotides in hybridization solution. After extensive washing, the sections were exposed on Kodak Biomax films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 3 weeks. For each isoform, two different oligonucleotides gave exactly the same labeling pattern, which was completely abolished by preincubation with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. The antisense oligonucleotides used to detect the respective isoform mRNA corresponded to bp 226–270 and 612–656 of αSGT (GenBank™ accession number AJ222724) and bp 335–378 and 990–1034 of βSGT (GenBank™ accession number AF368280).Yeast Two-hybrid Screens and Related Methods—Yeast two-hybrid screens using αSGT or βSGT bait and a rat brain cDNA prey library in pVP16–3 were performed essentially as described (24Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For small scale yeast transformations, bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed by a lithium acetate method into Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 reporter strain, and colonies were tested for activation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene by filter assays (25Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). The signal intensities were categorized as strong (++), weak (+), or not detectable (–) according to color intensity and duration of color development.Immunoblotting—Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed by immunoblotting using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblot analysis of tissues, 20 μg of protein homogenate were loaded per lane.Cosedimentation Assays—Bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins was performed in Escherichia coli strain XL1-blue. GST fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-agarose matrix were used as an affinity matrix. For assays performed in parallel the respective GST fusion protein concentrations were adjusted by the addition of free glutathione-agarose. His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). For cosedimentation assays, 50 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein were incubated with 50 μg of His6-tagged protein in binding buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors; when indicated 0.1% Triton X-100 or 5 mm EDTA was added) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times with binding buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. All experiments were performed at 4 °C with freshly prepared proteins.RESULTSCharacterization of a New Isoform of SGT—We previously isolated a rat cDNA coding for SGT in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a brain library using CSP as bait (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The rat cDNA showed limited homology to a non-orthologous human expressed sequence tag (L014584, Resource Center and Primary Data base) that we used as the hybridization probe in subsequent screens of a rat brain cDNA library. We isolated a cDNA with 52% identity to SGT that codes for a protein with 60% amino acid identity to SGT (Fig. 1). The deduced protein has a predicted molecular mass of 34 kDa. The three TPRs and the glutamine-rich region are conserved in the predicted protein, indicating that the newly identified protein is an isoform of SGT. Unfortunately, the present nomenclature of SGTs is confusing. Cziepluch et al. (13Cziepluch C. Kordes E. Poirey R. Grewenig A. Rommelaere J. Jauniaux J.-C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) coined the name small glutamine-rich TPR-containing protein (SGT), describing the structure of SGT. Kitagawa et al. (26Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) use suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 (SGT1) as a name for a protein that, ironically, shares some basic features with SGT (the size is comparable, and both proteins harbor three TPRs) but does not belong to the same protein family because outside the TPRs the proteins share no similarities. As a consequence the SGT described by Cziepluch et al. (13Cziepluch C. Kordes E. Poirey R. Grewenig A. Rommelaere J. Jauniaux J.-C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) appears often as SGT2 in data bases, which is misleading. To avoid further confusion, we propose to use the Greek prefix β for the newly identified isoform (βSGT) and to rename SGT (13Cziepluch C. Kordes E. Poirey R. Grewenig A. Rommelaere J. Jauniaux J.-C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to αSGT.In Northern blot analyses of tissue samples, a strong signal for a βSGT mRNA of 4.6 kilobases was observed in brain (Fig. 2A). Longer exposure of the Northern blots revealed faint signals in heart, spleen, lung, and liver. This preferential expression in brain is in contrast to αSGT, which is strongly expressed in all tissues examined (17Tobaben S. Thakur P. Fernandez-Chacon R. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Stahl B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 987-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Analysis of the tissue distribution of SGT isoforms. A, analysis of βSGT mRNA expression in the indicated tissues. In the upper panel, a single band of 4.6 kilobases is visible only for brain in a 1-day exposure of a Northern blot. The lower panel shows additional bands for heart, lung, liver, and muscle as well as additional bands of smaller size for brain in a 3-day exposure. B, analysis of SGT protein expression in the indicated tissues. Immunoblots using isoform-specific antibodies demonstrate that αSGT is expressed at varying amounts in all tissues examined. In contrast, βSGT is strongly expressed only in brain. Very faint signals for βSGT are visible in lung and testis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We raised an antiserum against bacterially expressed, GST-tagged βSGT to examine the expression of the protein. In immunoblots, the antiserum recognized a band of 38 kDa in rat brain membranes, which is compatible with the predicted molecular mass of βSGT. Immunoblot analysis of tissue homogenates confirmed the results obtained for mRNA expression. βSGT was predominantly detected in brain, and only very faint signals were obtained for lung and testis (Fig. 2B). In comparison, αSGT was readily detected in all tissues examined (Fig. 2B). The regional expression of the SGT isoforms in brain was investigated by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). Both isoforms are strongly expressed throughout the cortex and in the hippocampus (pyramidal neurons of CA1-3 and dentate gyrus granule cells) and the intermediate and neural lobes of the pituitary gland as well as in the granular and mitral cell layers of the olfactory bulb and in the pontine gray. In comparison, αSGT mRNA is particularly abundant in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum, where βSGT mRNA expression is less pronounced. βSGT mRNA expression level is highest in the thalamus. The overall, rather uniform expression profile of the two SGT isoform mRNAs throughout the brain was confirmed at the protein level in immunoblots of samples from different brain regions (not shown).Fig. 3Analysis of the distribution of SGT isoforms in rat brain.

However, binding of full-length Hsc70 is difficult to detect in this assay (9Liu F.-H. Wu S.-J. Hu S.-M. Hsiao C.-D. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34425-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed in vitro binding assays using bacterially expressed full-length proteins. First, we compared the binding of αSGT and βSGT to Hsc70. GST-Hsc70 or GST were immobilized and incubated with His6-tagged αSGT or βSGT. Robust binding of both isoforms to GST-Hsc70 but not to GST was observed (Fig. 4A). The amount of βSGT retained by GST-Hsc70 was reproducibly lower compared with αSGT. Structural information about the interaction of Hsc70 with the first three TPRs of Hop implicated basic and polar residues located within all three TPRs in the binding mechanism, and the negative charges of the two carboxyl groups of the C-terminal aspartate residue of Hsc70 are directly or indirectly coordinated by these basic and polar side chains of the TPRs (6Scheufler C.

The relevant residues are conserved in both SGT isoforms. We mutated the corresponding residues in βSGT, lysine 89 and asparagine 93, located in the first TPR, and lysine154, located in the third TPR, to alanine, combined K89A and K154A as well as K89A,N93A and K154A to double or triple mutants, respectively, and tested for the effects of these mutations on binding efficiency in the cosedimentation assay (Fig. 4B). In comparison to wild type βSGT, all single, double, and triple mutants showed reduced binding to Hsc70. Residual binding to GST-Hsc70 was observed reliably for all mutants including the triple mutant βSGTK89A,N93A,K154A, whereas no binding to GST was observed (not shown). However, the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 to the wash buffer abolished residual binding of the mutant proteins and left binding of wild type βSGT intact. Binding of wild type and mutant βSGT to GST-CSP was abolished by Triton X-100 containing washes (not shown). Smith (28Smith D.F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported a dramatic reduction in binding of Hsc70 to Hop by mutations in an aspartate-proline repeat outside the TPR domains. Because βSGT contains three possibly homologous asparagine-proline motifs in the C terminus, we introduced an asparagine 234 to alanine mutation in the central motif. However, we found that βSGTN234A bound to Hsc70 under all conditions tested (Fig. 4B), and the amount of bound Hsc70 was even slightly increased compared with wild type βSGT. Introduction of the N234A mutation into βSGTK89A,N93A,K154A still led to residual binding of the quadruple mutant to GST-Hsc70 (not shown). Thus, the mutations K89A, N93A, and K154A in βSGT specifically impair the binding of βSGT to Hsc70, whereas the mutation N234A leaves binding intact. We conclude that βSGT binds to Hsc70 via a two-carboxylate clamp mechanism involving the TPR domain, similar to the mode reported for binding of Hop to the C terminus of Hsc70 (6Scheufler C.

In this paper we provide evidence that an up-regulation of lysosomal glycohydrolases (α-d-mannosidase, β-d-hexosaminidase, and β-d-galactosidase) takes place in skin fibroblasts from AD patients affected either by sporadic or familial forms and is detectable also in presymptomatic subjects carrying the above mutations but healthy at the time of skin biopsy. This increase of enzyme activity is consequent to a transcriptional up-regulation. The oncogene Ras appears to be involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity. A parallel increase of Ras transcript and Ras protein, without an increase of p44/p42 MAPK activation was revealed in the same AD fibroblasts. An activation of p38 MAPK already described to occur in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, was also found in fibroblasts derived from AD patients. High levels of expression of the constitutively active form of Ras in normal or AD fibroblasts induced glycohydrolases up-regulation. Overall results demonstrated that glycohydrolases up-regulation, as well as Ras up-regulation, are early markers of AD, detectable at peripheral level, and good candidates to be exploited for diagnostic purposes. These data also provide the first proof for a role of Ras in regulating lysosomal glycohydrolases expression."
https://openalex.org/W2045491115,"Members of the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMPs) family are dual regulators of extracellular matrix remodeling through direct degradation of extracellular matrix components and activation of other latent MMPs. However, the structural basis of this functional diversity remains poorly understood. In an attempt to dissect the structural determinants for MT-MMP function, we performed domain exchange experiments between MT1-MMP and its close relative MT3-MMP and analyzed the exchange chimeras for pro-MMP-2 activation and collagen degradation at the cellular level. Our results indicate that catalytic domains determine the pattern of pro-MMP-2 activation, whereas pexin-like domains modulate the level of activation. On the other hand, both the catalytic and pexin-like domains of MT1-MMP are required for strong collagenolysis because exchanging either domain with that of MT3-MMP yielded significantly lower activity, and the introduction of the MT1-MMP catalytic or pexin-like domain into MT3-MMP failed to generate any significant enhancement of collagenolytic activity compared with wild-type MT3-MMP. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP behaves as a negative regulator not only for MT1-MMP itself, but also for MT3-MMP in both pro-MMP-2 activation and collagenolysis, consistent with and extending our recent findings (Jiang, A., Lehti, K., Wang, X., Weiss, S.

Based on cellular localization, MMPs can be classified into two categories: secreted or membrane-bound (3Kang T. Yi J. Guo A. Wang X. Overall C.M. Jiang W. Elde R. Borregaard N. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In general, the secreted MMPs are synthesized and delivered to the extracellular milieu, where they mediate ECM destruction (4Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subgroup are anchored on the plasma membrane, presumably to mediate a more focused and dynamic attack on the ECM (5Nakahara H. Howard L.

Among the six known MT-MMPs, MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs form the first group with type I transmembrane domains, and MT4-MMP and MT6-MMP are members of the second group with apparent glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (6Sato H.

In fact, MT1-MMP has emerged as an important collagenolytic enzyme in vivo (14Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M.

Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), thus becoming an intensely active field of investigation in recent years. The archetypal MT1-MMP is by far the most studied and is widely considered a model system for the elucidation of MT-MMP functions (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 20Seiki M. APMIS. 1999; 107: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The first function described for MT1-MMP is its ability to activate pro-MMP-2, an enzyme implicated in many physiological and pathological conditions such as tumor invasion and metastasis (19Sato H. Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Subsequently, similar activity has been confirmed for the other type I transmembrane MT-MMPs, i.e. MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs (8Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 9Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C.

Interestingly, MT1-MMP knockout mice exhibit far more severe developmental defects than MMP-2 null mice, suggesting that MT1-MMP participates in other biological functions in addition to the activation of MMP-2 (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 14Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M.

Indeed, MT1-MMP has been previously shown to have intrinsic proteolytic activities against extracellular components, including type I collagen (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

The apparent failure of MT1-MMP null mice to develop normally has been linked to deficiencies in collagen metabolism in bone and the skeleton (14Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M.

A. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), confirming that type I collagen is an MT1-MMP substrate in vivo. In addition to collagen, fibrin has been identified as a likely substrate for MT1-MMP during angiogenesis (23Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J. Cell. 1998; 95: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Although the range of substrates for MT-MMPs may continue to expand, the structural basis of MT-MMP substrate specificity remains virtually unknown. The fact that MT-MMPs are anchored on the plasma membrane represents a formidable challenge to investigate their structure/function relationship at the cellular level. Consequently, most of the characterizations for MT-MMP activity have been performed mostly with purified enzymes in well buffered reaction conditions (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting the function of their catalytic domains or proteolytic potentials. Recently, one cellular approach has been adapted to analyze the structure/function of MT-MMPs. By substituting the pexin-like domain of MT4-MMP into the analogous position in MT1-MMP, Itoh et al. (24Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) concluded that the pexin-like domain of MT1-MMP is required for its ability to mediate pro-MMP-2 activation. Because MT4-MMP is not known to activate pro-MMP-2, this exchange experiment proves that the pexin-like domain of MT1-MMP plays a critical role in specifying its substrate specificity (24Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), demonstrating the utility of domain exchanging in analyzing the structure/function relationships among closely related members of multigene families such as the MT-MMP gene family. In this study, we constructed several chimeras to define the contributions of various domains in MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP to pro-MMP-2 activation and type I collagen degradation at the cellular level. Despite the well recognized contribution of the pexin-like domains to MMP substrate specificity (24Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), our data suggest that the catalytic domains of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP play a dominant role in defining their activities for biological substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP behaves as a negative regulator even when substituted into MT3-MMP. These results suggest that different domains of MT-MMPs could be targeted for potential drug developments.

Chimeras were generated using overlapping primers designed for recombining various domains of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP through a PCR strategy similar to the one described for MMP-11 (27Pei D. Weiss S.J.

The MT1-MMP/MT3-MMP exchange constructs (MT1/MT3-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, and -C1) were made with two or three MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP PCR fragments as illustrated in Fig. 1.

The stable clones were screened by Western analysis of the cell lysates with anti-MT1-MMP antibodies 502 and 879 and anti-MT3-MMP antibody and by zymographic analysis of pro-MMP-2 activation. Ten representative clones with similar levels of protein expression were selected for further studies: MT1-19-11, MT1/MT3-1-7-8, MT1/MT3-2-9-5, MT1/MT3-3-4-1, MT1/MT3-4-14-2, MT1/MT3-5-23-10, MT1/MT3-6-17-7, MT1/MT3-C1-5-5, MT3-9(FF4-7), and MT1ΔC16-17.

Briefly, cells were allowed to grow to confluence in 6-well plates, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and allowed to incubate in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 1 ml/well) with 5% fetal bovine serum (a source of pro-MMP-2). The synthetic MMP inhibitor BB94 (50 μm) was included in the medium as needed. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was harvested and cleared by centrifugation and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel impregnated with gelatin (1 mg/ml) as described (10Pei D. J. Biol.

The gels were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, stained with Coomassie Blue, and destained; and images were captured by scanning. The active species of MMP-2 and its total activity were quantified by densitometry using a Stratagene Eagle-Eye system. For Western blotting, cells grown in 6-well plates were lysed in 250 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm 5-p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm aprotinin) with 10 mm of EDTA. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to remove the cell debris and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MT1-MMP antibody 502 or 879 or anti-MT3-MMP antibody and developed as described (25Kang T.

Invasion of Type I Collagen by MDCK Cells Transfected with MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP, and Their Derivatives—Type I collagen (0.5 ml at 2.0 mg/ml; Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) was added to each well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to form a gel. Cells (2.4 × 103) were mixed with fresh medium containing 90% DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum and added to the top of the gel with care. The medium was renewed every 2 days. BB94 (50 μm) was added as indicated. After 7 days, the cells that had invaded the collagen were photographed (magnification ×200) with a video camera attached to a Nikon microscope at the University of Minnesota Bioimaging Processing Facility as described (25Kang T.

Growth of MDCK Cells and Derivatives in Three-dimensional Collagen Gel—Cells (1.2 × 103) were mixed with collagen solutions (1.5 ml at 2.5 mg/ml; Collaborative Research), which were allowed to gel at 37 °C in 6-well plates to give rise to three-dimensional collagen matrices. Fresh medium containing 90% DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the wells and changed every 2 days. BB94 (10 mm) was added as needed. After 11 days, the MDCK cells and derivatives on the three-dimensional collagen gel were photographed (magnification ×100) with a video camera and analyzed as described above. Multivariant Analysis: Hierarchical Clustering, K-means Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis—The percentages of MMP-2 activation from transient transfection or in the stable cell line and the average diameters of cell cysts in the collagen assay were analyzed by clustering principles. Because the scales and S.E. values are different among these measurements, the original data were transformed to standardized data (x′ = (x - x bar)/S.D.) before clustering analysis. All of the clustering analyses were done with J-Express Version 2.1 (Molmine Bioinformatics Software Solutions). Euclidean was chosen as the distance measure for both hierarchical and K-means clustering. For hierarchical clustering, all four cluster similarity methods available in J-Express were used, including single linkage, unweighted average linkage (UPGMA), weighted average linkage (WPGMA), and complete linkage. For K-means clustering, the number of clusters was designed as 4, and the maximum iteration number was chosen as 200. The initialization method was the most widely used one: random. For principal component analysis, the repeated information among different characters was removed from analysis. The high dimensional data were transformed into lower dimensional data when the most variance information was retained. The lower dimensional data became obvious for visualization. Construction of MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP Chimeras—The type I transmembrane MMPs, MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and 5-MMPs, share the same domain structure with extensive homology, suggesting that they perform similar biological functions in vivo. Indeed, all have been shown to be able to activate pro-MMP-2 at the cellular level (6Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Yet, recent in vivo evidence suggests that these enzymes may perform different functions both developmentally and pathologically (14Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M.

We hypothesize that the functional differences of MT-MMPs are encoded in their structural domains, which specify unique enzymatic properties against specific substrates. To ascertain the functional difference between analogous domains among MT-MMPs, we paired MT1-MMP with MT3-MMP in a domain exchange approach. In the phylogenetic tree of MT-MMPs constructed by similarities between their catalytic domains, MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP are most closely related, MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP are in the same sub-branch, and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored MT-MMPs, MT4-MMP and MT6-MMP, compose the last group (Fig. 1A). It is predicted that there is a functional difference between the MT1-MMP/MT2-MMP subgroup and the MT3-MMP/MT5-MMP subgroup. Furthermore, we anticipate that a comparison between MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP should yield informative data on the functional differences between the MT-MMPs. Despite their structural similarities, MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP differ functionally in at least two areas: 1) activation of pro-MMP-2 into distinct patterns and 2) degradation of type I collagen efficiency. We hypothesize that the functional differences between the MT-MMPs are determined by both the catalytic and pexin-like domains. In an effort to address the structural basis of these functional differences, we constructed chimeras by shuffling domains between these two genes: (a) exchanging the ectoenzymes at the end of the pexin-like domain, (b) exchanging the hinge/pexin-like domains, and (c) exchanging the pro-catalytic domains. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, these constructs were made by a two-step PCR strategy and confirmed by sequencing as described (27Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Specifically, the constructs contain the following detailed sequences from MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP: MT1/MT3-1 with MT1-MMP-(1-508) and MT3-MMP-(533-607); MT1/MT3-2 with MT3-MMP-(1-532) and MT1-MMP-(509-582); MT1/MT3-3 with MT1-MMP-(1-284), MT3-MMP-(392-532), and MT1-MMP-(509-582); MT1/MT3-4 with MT3-MMP-(1-291), MT1-MMP-(284-532), and MT3-MMP-(533-607); MT1/MT3-5 with MT1-MMP-(1-284) and MT3-MMP-(392-607); MT1/MT3-6 with MT3-MMP-(1-291) and MT1-MMP-(284-582); MT1/MT3-C1 with MT3-MMP-(1-587) and MT1-MMP-(563-582); and MT1ΔC with MT1-MMP-(1-562). Segregation of Pro-MMP-2 Activation Pattern with Only the Catalytic Domain—Upon confirmation of all constructs to be error-free and configured as designed, we transiently transfected these constructs into MDCK cells and monitored their expression by Western blotting and their ability to activate pro-MMP-2 by zymography. The constructs expressed protein species as expected as judged by Western blotting using two anti-MT1-MMP antibodies (Fig. 2, C and D) and one anti-MT3-MMP antibody (Fig. 2E). In addition to the specific protein species, there were nonspecific bands cross-reacting with anti-MT1-MMP antibody 879 and anti-MT3-MMP antibody (Fig. 2, D and E, lane 1). Some of the specific species may represent different glycosylation forms as described previously for MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP (e.g. species in Fig. 2E, lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10) (25Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was analyzed for pro-MMP-2 activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP activated pro-MMP-2 with different patterns (lane 2 versus lane 10). Specifically, MT1-MMP converted more MMP-2 into the final active species compared with MT3-MMP such that the ratio between active and intermediate MMP-2 converted by MT1-MMP was significantly greater than that converted by MT3-MMP (Fig. 2A, lane 2 versus lane 10). Given the purported role of the pexin domains in mediating pro-MMP-2 activation (24Itoh Y. Takamura A. Ito N. Maru Y. Sato H. Suenaga N. Aoki T. Seiki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4782-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we anticipated that the observed difference in pro-MMP-2 activation mediated by MT1-MMP and MT3-MMP would segregate with their respective pexin domains. Surprisingly, when all chimeras were compared for their pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-11), a trend emerged to suggest that the patterns of pro-MMP-2 activation segregate only with the catalytic domain of each MT-MMP. The rest of the domains appear to play a very small role in determining the ratio between active and intermediate MMP-2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-11). Because transient transfection may generate an abnormally high level of protein for each construct, the observed results in Fig. 2 may not be reflective of the activities under more stable conditions such as those in vivo. Therefore, it is imperative to validate the findings in stable cell lines as shown in Fig. 2. We generated stable cell lines from each construct as described previously (10Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, we picked 24 clones from each construct and screened these clones for pro-MMP-2 activation by zymography and MT1-MMP/MT3-MMP protein expression by Western blotting as described in the legend to Fig. 2. On average, we obtained at least six stable clones expressing varying amounts of recombinant protein on Western blots that mediated corresponding levels of pro-MMP-2 activation (data not shown). To analyze these constructs in the same experimental settings, we selected one representative clone from each construct that expressed similar levels of recombinant proteins upon Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3 (C-E), we determined the amounts of the recombinant proteins in those selected stable cell lines. The stable lines harboring MT1-MMP, MT1/MT3-1 to MT1/MT3-6, MT1/MT3-C1, and MT3-MMP appeared to express the recombinant proteins at comparable levels (Fig. 3, C-E, lanes 2-10). The only exception is the one expressing MT1ΔC, with about twice as much protein as the rest of the constructs (Fig. 3C, lane 11 versus lanes 2, 3, 5, 7). As shown in Fig. 2 (C-E), there were multiple species observed, presumably representing different"
https://openalex.org/W2012460321,"The plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) from enteroaggregative <i>Escherichia coli</i> is a cytopathic serine protease, which is prototypical of a large family of bacterial autotransporter toxins. To further elucidate the structure-function relationships of this toxin, we employed transposon-based scanning linker mutagenesis. A subset of insertions throughout the Pet mature toxin (passenger) domain reduced secretion to the extracellular space. Many of these mutants were undetectable, but secretion of a subset of mutants with insertions in the N-terminal half of the toxin could be restored to wild type secretion levels if cultured in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Secretion of two mutants with insertions at the extreme C terminus was partially restored when co-expressed with a minimal clone of EspP, a related autotransporter protein. Several well secreted mutants with insertions in the N-terminal third of the molecule reduced protease activity over 20-fold, suggesting that the protease domain is located within this N-terminal region of Pet. We have also identified two insertional mutants in the middle of the passenger domain that were proteolytic but no longer cytopathic; these mutants displayed decreased binding and internalization upon incubation with HEp-2 cells. Our data suggest the existence of separate functional domains mediating Pet proteolysis, secretion, and cell interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2064841932,"Aclacinomycin methylesterase (RdmC) is one of the tailoring enzymes that modify the aklavinone skeleton in the biosynthesis of anthracyclines in Streptomyces species. The crystal structures of this enzyme from Streptomyces purpurascens in complex with the product analogues 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin T and 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin A were determined to nominal resolutions of 1.45 and 1.95 Å, respectively.

The active site and substrate binding pocket are located at the interface between the two domains. Decarboxymethylaclacinomycin T and decarboxymethylaclacinomycin A bind close to the catalytic triad (Ser102-His276-Asp248) in a hydrophobic pocket, with the sugar moieties located at the surface of the enzyme. The binding of the ligands is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and specificity appears to be controlled mainly by the shape of the binding pocket rather than through specific hydrogen bonds. Mechanistic key features consistent with the structure of complexes of RdmC with product analogues are Ser102 acting as nucleophile and transition state stabilization by an oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amides of residues Gly32 and Met103.

Anthracyclines are aromatic polyketide antibiotics that are synthesized by Streptomyces species. They were recognized as early as 1939 for their antibacterial properties (1Krassilnikov N.A. Koreniako A.J. Mikrobiologiya. 1939; : 673-675Google Scholar) and have been used as important anti-tumor drugs in chemotherapy for more than three decades (2di Marco A. Gaetani M. Orezzi P. Scarpinato B.M. Silvestrini R. Soldati M. Dasdia T. Valentini L. Nature. 1964; 201: 706-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Their mode of action is not yet fully understood, but there is evidence that their cytotoxic activity is at least in part because of inhibition of topoisomerase II (3Booser D.J. Hortobagyi G.N. Drugs. 1994; 47: 223-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, anthracyclines exhibit severe cardiotoxic side effects that limit their long-term use in the clinic (4Myers C.E. Mimnaugh G.C. Yeh G.C. Sinha B.K. Lown J.W. Anthracycline and Anthracenedione-based Anticancer Agents. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 527-569Google Scholar). Because of their complex composition and structure, these compounds are difficult to synthesize chemically. The search for novel derivatives with less toxic side effects has therefore been limited so far to the hybrid antibiotic approach that rests on gene transfer of a particular set of genes from one Streptomyces species to another, resulting in production of novel anthracycline metabolites (5Niemi J. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Pärssinen R. Kopio A. Mäntsälä P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Kieser H.M. Ikeda H. Duncan J. Fujii I. Rudd B.A. Floss H.G. Omura S. Nature. 1985; 314: 642-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Alternative routes to non-natural anthracyclines could be based on knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Mechanistic and structural information can be fed into the redesign of these enzymes, which may be used for the biosynthesis of anthracyclines with improved or novel toxicological activities. Most anthracyclines consist of a 7,8,9,10-tetrahydrotetracene-5,12-quinone skeleton, which is glycosylated at position C-7 or C-10 (Fig. 1A). Variations in the modifications of the aglycone skeleton or the type of carbohydrate attached lead to considerable chemical diversity, and several hundreds of these natural products are known to date (7Hutchinson C.R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2525-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis starts with the polyketide pathway, where the carbon chain is built up by repeated Claisen condensations from acyl and malonate carbonyl units by the large polyketide synthase complex (8Hopwood D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2465-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These condensation steps are followed by a final cyclization to give the aglycone polyketide skeleton (9Ye J. Dickens M.L. Plater R. Li Y. Lawrence J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclized product is then further modified by a series of tailoring enzymes leading to, for example, glycosylation, hydroxylation, methylester hydrolysis, and decarboxylation (10Connors N.C. Bartel P.L. Strohl W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1895-1898Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Niemi J. Wang Y. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys.

In Streptomyces purpurascens, the rdm operon contains several genes that code for tailoring enzymes of rhodomycin biosynthesis (5Niemi J. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Pärssinen R. Kopio A. Mäntsälä P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2942-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes encoded by this gene cluster include RdmA, an aklanonic acid methylester cyclase, and aklavinone-11-hydroxylase RdmE, which converts aklavinone to ϵ-rhodomycinone (11Niemi J. Wang Y. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that rdmB and rdmC code for two enzymes that catalyze the steps leading from ϵ-rhodomycinone glycoside to β-rhodomycinone glycoside (16Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2942-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that these two enzymes can also catalyze the conversion of aclacinomycin to 10-hydroxy-10-decarboxymethylaklavin (14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).

Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) catalyzes removal of the methoxy group at the C-15 position of aclacinomycin T and aclacinomycin A (Fig. 1). The polypeptide chain contains 298 amino acids, and the enzyme is monomeric in solution (14Wang Y. Niemi J. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mäntsälä P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RdmC shows about 50% sequence identity to related enzymes from other Streptomyces species, for instance DnrP from Streptomyces peucetius and DauP from Streptomyces sp strain C5 (17Madduri K. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dickens M.L. Ye J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze similar reactions, hydrolyzing 10-carbomethoxy-13-deoxycarminomycin to 10-carboxy-13-deoxycarminomycin (12Dickens M.L. Priestley N.D. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Madduri K. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They all contain the same sequence motif G-X-S-X-G, typical for a serine hydrolase active site (18Dickens M.L. Ye J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structures of RdmC with the bound product analogues 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin T (DcmaT) and 10-decarboxymethylaclacinomycin A (DcmaA) at molecular resolution. The enzyme contains the α/β hydrolase fold with a catalytic triad common to this enzyme family. Modeling of the substrate complex based on these structures suggests that the catalytic serine residue is perfectly located to act as nucleophile during hydrolysis and that the negative charge developing in the transition state and the tetrahedral intermediate could be stabilized by an oxyanion hole consisting of the main chain nitrogens of residues Gly32 and Met103. Protein Purification and Crystallization—RdmC from S. purpurascens was expressed in Streptomyces lividans and purified as previously described (11Niemi J. Wang Y. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AcmT was produced from AcmA (Calbiochem) by partial hydrolysis as previously described (5Niemi J. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Pärssinen R. Kopio A. Mäntsälä P. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crystallization of the enzyme complexes was achieved by adding 1.2 mm AcmA or 1.2 mm AcmT, respectively, to 10 mg/ml protein solution in 50 mm TRIS-HCl buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The complex was crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging drops with ammonium sulfate as precipitant at pH 7.5. Details of the crystallization protocol are described elsewhere (19Jansson A. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. Schneider G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1637-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An isomorphous platinum derivative was obtained by soaking the native crystals for 45 min in 5 mm K2PtNO3 dissolved in water. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—Native diffraction data for the AcmT and AcmA complexes were collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), beamline X11, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg to a resolution of 1.45 and 1.95 Å, respectively. The data were collected at cryogenic temperature using 20% PEG400 as a cryoprotectant and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S.

Subsequent rounds of refinement included energy minimization and B-factor refinement, followed by manual adjustment of the model using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The bound ligand could be fitted straightforwardly into the electron density map, and water molecules were identified using PEAKMAX and WATPEAK (22Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr.

Structure comparisons were done with TOP (32Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the lsq option in O (26Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Quality of the Electron Density Map and the Model—RdmC was crystallized as a complex with AcmA or AcmT, and the three-dimensional structures of these complexes were determined to 1.45 and 1.95 Å, respectively, using single isomorphous replacement, including anomalous scattering based on a platinum derivative as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The electron density is well defined for all 298 amino acid residues except for the N-terminal methionine, which is removed by the cloning host (11Niemi J. Wang Y. Airas K. Ylihonko K. Hakala J. Mantsala P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and one loop, comprising residues 166-169, where the side chains are not visible. This presumably reflects disorder of this loop, which is at the surface of the enzyme. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of substrate, and the electron density maps clearly show a bound ligand in the active site (Fig. 2). However, there is no electron density for the carboxymethyl group at position C-10 of the product. The loss of the C-15 methyl group was expected, because the enzyme is active at the pH of crystallization. However, the product of the RdmC reaction, 15-demethoxyaclacinomycin, is unstable in water and slowly undergoes decarboxylation in solution (35Tanaka H. Yoshioka T. Yoshimoto A. Shimauchi Y. Ishikura T. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. 1983; 36: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The electron density is consistent with the bound product analogues 10-decarboxymethyl aclacinomycin DcmaA or DcmaT, respectively, and thus suggests that decarboxylation has occurred during the crystallization process. The final models of the protein consist of 297 amino acids, 406 water molecules, one sulfate ion, one PEG400 molecule, and a DcmaA or DcmaT molecule. They also contain three residues with double conformations and Pro254 in cis conformation. The models have an R work of 16.3% (DcmaT) and 15.7% (DcmaA) and an R free of 18.7% (DcmaT) and 18.5% (DcmaA). The overall structures of the polypeptide chain in the two complexes as well as interaction of the bound ligands with the enzyme are very similar. Unless otherwise noted, in the remainder of this report we discuss the structure of the RdmC·DcmaT complex because of its higher resolution and superior electron density maps. Fold—The RdmC monomer, with overall dimensions of ∼35 Å × 40 Å × 45 Å, is built up of two domains. The core of the larger domain (residues 2-132 and 223-298) contains an eight-stranded β-sheet (β1-8) flanked by six helices (A, B, C, D, E, and F) where helix D is a 310 helix (Fig. 3). The sheet is highly twisted and forms a half-barrel, with strand β2 antiparallel to the rest of the sheet and strand order 12435678. The first and the last strands are arranged almost perpendicular to each other. Helices B, C, D, and E are flanking the concave side, and helices A and F are found at the convex side of the β-sheet. A second, α-helical domain is formed by residues 133-222, which extend from β-strand 6 of the α/β domain and fold into five helices, D′1-D′5 (D′5 is a 310 helix). The chain enters the α/β domain again with helix D packing against the β-sheet (Fig. 3). This smaller domain forms a lid over the α/β sheet and participates in the formation of the substrate binding pocket. RdmC belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily (36Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), and despite non-detectable or low sequence homology, structural comparisons show similarities to other members of this family of esterases, hydrolases, proteases, and lipases. A search of the Protein Data Base for structures related to RdmC using the program TOP (32Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) revealed that the enzymes structurally most similar to RdmC are haloperoxidases. These enzymes catalyze the halogenation of organic compounds in the presence of halide ions and peroxides such as H2O2 (37Hofmann B. Tolzer S. Pelletier I. Altenbuchner J. van Pee K.H. Hecht H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Structures of bromoperoxidase from Streptomyces aureofaciens (38Hecht H.J. Sobek H. Haag T. Pfeifer O. van Pee K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and chloroperoxidases from S. lividans, S. aureofaciens and Pseudomonas fluorescens (37Hofmann B. Tolzer S. Pelletier I. Altenbuchner J. van Pee K.H. Hecht H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) are known. They all show ∼22% sequence identity to RdmC, and their three-dimensional structures superimpose well for their α/β domains. Superposition of bromoperoxidase with RdmC gives 176 equivalent residues with a root mean square deviation of 1.73 Å; a similar value is obtained for the structural alignment of chloroperoxidase with RdmC (159 equivalent residues with a root mean square deviation of 1.63 Å). However, the haloperoxidases differ from RdmC in the structure of the helical domain in the number and orientation of the D′-helices. A search of the Protein Data Base with only the helical domain (residues 133-222) of RdmC did not result in any other similar structures except uteroglobin, which had been noted earlier (39Callebaut I. Poupon A. Bally R. Demaret J.P. Housset D. Delettre J. Hossenlopp P. Mornon J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 90-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Active Site and Substrate Binding—The active site and substrate binding pocket of RdmC is located at the interface between the two domains. Residues from helices D′1, D′2, D′5, β6, and αC form the predominantly hydrophobic substrate binding pocket, and the catalytic triad is located at the end of this deep pocket (Fig. 3A). Ser102 is located in a strand-turn-helix motif at the so-called nucleophilic elbow and is a central residue in the very sharp turn between strand five and helix C. The nucleophilic elbow is the most conserved structure within the α/β hydrolase fold and includes the conserved motif G-X-S-X-G (40Heikinheimo P. Goldman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D.L. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: R141-R146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Asp248 is found in a loop between strand seven and helix E (in some enzymes of the α/β hydrolase family, it could also be found after strand six; Ref. 36Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), and His276 is located between strand eight and helix F. The product analogue, DcmaT, is bound to the enzyme with the hydrophobic aklavinone part extending into this deep pocket and the carbohydrate moiety located at the entrance of the cavity (Fig. 4A). The high resolution of the electron density map allows a precise modeling of the bound product analogue. The electron density is consistent with planar conformations for rings B, C, and D and half-chair conformation of ring A. The configuration in ring A is 7S, 9R with O-7 and O-9 in axial positions and C-13 equatorial. The stereochemistry of the bound aglycone moiety is thus consistent with the x-ray structure of aklavinone (41Arora S.K. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 1788-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The interactions of the aglycone moiety of DcmaT with enzyme residues are predominantly hydrophobic, which is not surprising given the aromatic, hydrophobic character of this molecule. Residues Met103, Thr106, Leu126, Phe134, Gly127, Gly128, Phe158, Leu224, Ile250, and Ala251 of the hydrophobic binding pocket are within van der Waals distance (3.9 Å) of the aglycone moiety (Fig. 4B). The side chain of Phe134 forms a stacking interaction with ring C of DcmaT. Of the six possible hydrogen bond donors and/or acceptors of the aglycone moiety, only one is actually involved in such an interaction. The oxygen atom O-4 of the aglycone skeleton forms a hydrogen bond to a bound water molecule, which in turn is within hydrogen bond distance to the main chain oxygen atom of Ile132. In addition to van der Waals interactions of residues Met103, His219, Tyr220, and Leu222 with the primary amino sugar, a hydrogen bond is formed between the nitrogen group (N3*) of the sugar moiety to the side chain oxygen atoms of Asp135. The presence of only one hydrogen bond between enzyme and the aglycone moiety suggests that hydrogen bonds are not the major determinant of substrate binding in RdmC. Substrate recognition therefore appears to be controlled predominantly by the shape of the binding pocket, defined by the lining hydrophobic amino acid residues. The importance of the shape and hydrophobicity of the binding pocket for substrate binding has recently been demonstrated for another tailoring enzyme in anthracycline biosynthesis, ActVA-Orf6, a monooxygenase structurally and functionally unrelated to RdmC (42Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federice L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the RdmC·DcmaA complex, the density for the aglycone and the first carbohydrate moiety is well defined in the electron density map. This part of DcmaA binds to RdmC in a manner indistinguishable from that of DcmaT. The additional carbohydrate moieties of DcmaA extend out of the binding pocket into the bulk solution (Fig. 4A) and form only one interaction with an enzyme residue, a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom O-12 of the second sugar unit and the main chain oxygen atom of Tyr220. As a result, these two carbohydrate units are less well defined in the electron density map. This mode of binding, on the other hand, explains why both compounds are recognized as substrates by RdmC and why there is only modest discrimination between the mono- and triglycosylated anthracyclines (43Wang Y. Niemi J. Mäntsälä P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyethylene Glycol Binding—Strong difference density was found in a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the active site. The shape and size of the electron density suggested a bound polyethylene glycol molecule consisting of 10 carbons and 6 oxygens (C10H20O6) (Fig. 2). PEG400 had been used in the crystallization liquor and was also used as cryoprotectant. The electron density suggests that a fraction of the bound polyethylene glycol molecules is covalently attached via the terminal aldehyde group to the catalytic Ser102, thereby mimicking the covalent acyl-enzyme complex. Refinement of such a model, however, shows that the fraction of the covalently linked PEG molecules is rather small. The polyethylene molecule forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain oxygens of Tyr198 and Glu202 and two water molecules. The PEG binding pocket is accessible from the outside solution via a small opening (Fig. 4A) lined mostly by hydrophobic residues such as Val212, Pro216, Gly63, Ala209, Thr62, Leu213, and Ile206. A similar pocket is found both in chloroperoxidase and bromoxidase, but in these enzymes the pocket is smaller in size. It has been suggested that this pocket may be used for transport of reactants/products such as peroxides, halides, and water molecules in bromoperoxidase (38Hecht H.J. Sobek H. Haag T. Pfeifer O. van Pee K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and may be utilized in a similar manner in RdmC. Mechanistic Implications—RdmC is an esterase that removes the methoxy side chain at carbon 15 of AcmA or AcmT. In the structures of both complexes, obtained at pH 7.5, we observe the demethylated and decarboxylated product analogues, DcmaA and DcmaT, respectively. These structures allow the modeling of the AcmT substrate into the active site pocket, thus providing a picture of the enzyme-substrate interactions before the reaction takes place (Fig. 5). In this model, the side chain of the nucleophile, Ser102, is placed about 3 Å away from the C-15 carbon atom of the carboxymethyl group of AcmT. The side chain of His276 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl group of Ser102, suitable for proton abstraction and activation of the nucleophile. His276, in turn, forms hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate group of Asp248, which can stabilize the positive charge of the imidazolium ring during catalysis. Residues in the turns between strand 5 and helix C and strand 3 and helix A very likely participate in the stabilization of the negative charge building up at the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate during turnover. Backbone amides of residues Gly32 and Met103 point into a small cavity that harbors the carbonyl oxygen atom of the bound substrate. The oxygen atom is close to the main chain nitrogen of residue Met103 (4 Å) and forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen of Gly32. The negative charge building up at this carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate in the transition state could therefore be stabilized by this oxyanion hole, similar to other enzymes of this family (36Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The nitrogen atom (Nδ2) of His276 is also close to the oxygen atom of the methyl ester (∼3.5 Å) and is suitably positioned to protonate the leaving methoxy group. There are several water molecules in the vicinity of the catalytic serine residue that could act as nucleophiles in the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. The three-dimensional structure thus supports a mechanism of ester hydrolysis by RdmC similar to that of related enzymes in the α/β hydrolase family. RdmC Is a Representative of a Class of Esterases in Anthracycline Biosynthesis—The highest sequence similarity of RdmC is to esterases from other Streptomyces species. DnrP from Streptomyces peucetius and DauP from Streptomyces sp. C5 exhibit sequence identities to RdmC of 51 and 53%, respectively (12Dickens M.L. Priestley N.D. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2641-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Madduri K. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DnrP and DauP have both been proposed to act as 10-carbomethoxy-13-deoxycarminomycin esterases on anthracycline substrates removing the carboxymethyl side chain at the C-10 position of, for example, the rhodomycin D aglycones (DauP) (18Dickens M.L. Ye J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodomycin D is one of the precursors in the production of daunorubicin and doxorubicin, both clinically important anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents. In the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor (44Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H. Harper D. Bateman A. Brown S.

Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), we found a putative hydrolase gene with 40% sequence identity to RdmC. Sequence alignments show that the catalytic triad for these four esterases overlaps well (Fig. 6), including the G-X-S-X-G nucleophile motif. The only difference is seen in S. coelicolor, where the acid is glutamate instead of aspartate. Whereas in the putative hydrolase from S. coelicolor only a few of the substrate binding residues are conserved, DnrP and DauP contain most of the residues involved in binding the substrate in RdmC. Most of the substitutions that do occur are conservative, and the size and the hydrophobic character of the binding pocket is conserved (Fig. 6). The differences in the chemical structure of the substrates of these enzymes are small; the substrates of DauP/DnrP have a primary amino group (NH2) at the N3* position of the primary sugar, whereas AcmT contains a tertiary amino group (N(CH3)2). The natural substrates of both RdmC and DauP/DnrP are presumed to be hydroxylated at the C-11 position of the aglycone. The part of the substrate binding pocket that accommodates the C-11 hydroxyl group is very conserved in these enzymes and lacks polar residues capable of forming a specific hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group. In conclusion, RdmC is a member of a group of esterases involved in the biosynthesis of anthracyclines in Streptomyces. The crystal structure determination of RdmC provides a structural framework for these enzymes and shows that they are members of the large superfamily of α/β hydrolases. The binding of the substrate is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and specificity appears to be controlled by the shape of the binding pocket rather than through specific hydrogen bonds. Mechanistic key features suggested by the structure of complexes of RdmC with product analogues are the catalytic Ser-His-Asp triad and transition state stabilization by an oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amides of residues Gly32 and Met103.

https://openalex.org/W2101225372,"Phosphoinositides play important roles as signaling molecules in different cell compartments by regulating the localization and activity of proteins through their interaction with specific domains. The activity of these lipids depends on which sites on the inositol ring are phosphorylated. Signaling pathways dependent on phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the D3 position of this ring (3-phosphoinositides) are negatively regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-specific phosphatases that include PTEN and myotubularin. Using the conserved PTEN catalytic core motif, we have identified a new protein in the Dictyostelium genome called phospholipid-inositol phosphatase (PLIP), which defines a new subfamily of phosphoinositide phosphatases clearly distinct from PTEN or other closely related proteins. We show that PLIP is able to dephosphorylate a broad spectrum of phosphoinositides, including 3-phosphoinositides. In contrast to previously characterized phosphoinositide phosphatases, PLIP has a preference for phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, a newly discovered phosphoinositide. We found that PLIP is localized in the Golgi, with its phosphatase domain facing the cytoplasmic compartment. PLIP null cells created via homologous recombination are unable to effectively aggregate to form multicellular organisms at low cell densities. The presence of PLIP in the Golgi suggests that it may be involved in membrane trafficking.

Furthermore, PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 were identified more recently as naturally occurring phosphoinositides and have been proposed to act as signaling molecules through a mechanism yet to be discovered (16Schaletzky J.

Although most of the efforts have been dedicated to the identification of kinases involved in the synthesis of these phospholipids, the identity and regulation of the lipid phosphatases involved in their turnover are not well understood. Two families of phosphatases have been implicated in the dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositides: the tumor suppressor PTEN and myotubularin (MTMR) phosphatases display the signature motif CX 5R characteristic of the dual specificity protein phosphatase family, but in vivo dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3)P/PI(3,5)P2, respectively (16Schaletzky J.

The catalytic domain of the PTEN and myotubularin (MTMR) phosphatases is unrelated to one of the characterized 5-phosphoinositide phosphatases that is composed of two signature motifs: (F/I)WXGDXN(F/Y)R and (R/N)XP(S/A)(W/Y)(C/T) DR(I/V)(L/I) (22Majerus P.W.

Mutations in PTEN are associated with a wide variety of human tumors and are linked to the development of Cowden's disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (23Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev.

The crystal structure of PTEN indicates that the conserved basic amino acids (Lys125 and Lys128) present in the PTEN catalytic loop (CKXXKXR) define the specificity of PTEN for PI(3,4,5)P3 (27Lee J.O.

Using this information, we screened the Dictyostelium genomic data base for open reading frames containing a catalytic loop similar to that of PTEN. We identified a new phosphoinositide phosphatase we call phospholipid-inositol phosphatase (PLIP), which, along with related proteins in metazoans, define a new family of phosphoinositide phosphatases distinct from PTEN and conserved in eukaryotes. Unexpectedly, PLIP prefers PI(5)P as substrate in vitro. PLIP has a transmembrane domain and localizes to the Golgi, suggesting that it may have a role in protein sorting or membrane trafficking. Cloning and Sequence Analysis—PLIP cDNA was cloned by screening 1 × 106 plaque-forming units of a Dictyostelium cDNA library using, as a probe, a PCR fragment corresponding to the catalytic domain of PLIP. Among the five clones identified, the one containing the longest insert (900 bp) was converted to a plasmid (pBS-PLIP) and sequenced. Sequence analysis and alignment were done using the BLAST and ClustalW programs. PLIP tagged by the HA epitope was obtained by PCR amplification of the PLIP coding sequence from pBS-PLIP using primers 5′-TTTGGATCCATGAATGAAAATGAAGGAATA-3′ and 5′-TTTTTTCTCGAGTTTTTATTAAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAGATCTCAATTGATGTTGTTGAATTAATATTAC-3′. The PLIP(D136A)-HA mutant was obtained by PCR using mutagenic primers 5′-TGGTTCGAAATGAGC AACCACTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCCAGTGGTTGCTCATTTCGAACCA-3′. PCR products were cloned as BamHI/XhoI fragments into the DIPJ vector (28Gaskins C. Clark A.M. Aubry L. Segall J.E. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GFP was fused at the C terminus of PLIP (PLIP-GFP) by PCR using primers 5′-TTTGGATCCATGATTGAAAATGAAGGAATA-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCAGATCTAATTGATGTTGTTGAATTAAT-3′. The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and BglII and fused to GFP to make a translation fusion into the DIPJ vector. The sequences of the constructs were verified by sequencing. N-terminally GFP-tagged golvesin (GFP-golvesin) and C-terminally GFP-tagged golvesin (golvesin-GFP) constructs (29Schneider N. Schwartz J.M. Kohler J. Becker M. Schwarz H. Gerisch G. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were provided by Günther Gerisch (Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsreid, Germany). These constructs were introduced into Dictyostelium by electroporation, and stable transformants were selected on G418. Immunofluorescence Study—For immunofluorescence localization of the proteins, cells attached to a coverslip were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The coverslips were incubated with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-α-tubulin antibody DM1A (Sigma) were diluted 200 times. Antibody 1/39-16 was obtained from P. Cosson (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) and was diluted 10 times. Coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h under the conditions described above with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC (Sigma). During the second incubation, Hoechst dye was added (0.001% final concentration) to stain the nuclei. Slides were observed using a Nikon fluorescent microscope equipped with a ×60 objective. Pictures were captured with a CDD digital camera and processed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Protein Extraction, Fractionation, and Trypsin Digest—Log phase cells (2–4 × 106 cells/ml) were washed once with 12 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin). Cells were disrupted by passage through two layers of 3-μm Nuclepore membrane. The lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and then fractionated into soluble and insoluble (pellet) fractions by 1 h of centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The precleared lysate was incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of NaCl, Na2CO3, or Triton X-100 before fractionation. For the trypsin digest, the precleared cell lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min with trypsin at a protein/trypsin ratio from 1:5 to 1:20 (w/w). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer. Phosphatase Assay—Dictyostelium PLIP was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose beads, followed by separation on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphatase assays were conducted using the malachite green reagent as previously reported (24Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N. Mueller B. Liu X. Wu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assays were carried out in a final concentration of 0.5 mm phosphatidylserine (C18; Sigma) and 0.1 mm d-myo-phosphatidylinositol substrate (Echelon Biosciences). Ten μg of partially purified PLIP was used in each assay for various time points at 37 °C and pH 5.5. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate activities were examined as previously reported (30Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Creation of the PLIP Null Mutant—A 1.6-kb genomic sequence emphasizing the PLIP coding sequence was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-AAAAACTCGAGAAAAATCTATTTCTCTCGC-3′ and 5′-CGACTTAAGCTTCTAAAGCACCTGATCCACC-3′ from wild-type KAx-3 DNA and cloned as a HindIII/XhoI fragment into the pSP71 vector (Promega). The BsaBI restriction site located in the PLIP coding sequence was used to insert the blasticidin resistance cassette (31Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This construct was transformed into KAx-3 cells, and clones resistant to blasticidin were randomly selected. PLIP knockout mutants were selected by Southern blot analysis. PLIP expression was analyzed by Northern blot analysis using total RNA (6 μg) extracted from vegetative cells (no starvation) and from cells starved for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h on phosphate buffer plates to induce development. For PLIP knockout cell lines, we used RNA extracted from vegetative cells. α-Mannosidase and β-Glucosidase Processing Assay—[35S]Met labeling of Dictyostelium cells and immunoprecipitation of α-mannosidase and β-glucosidase were done as described previously (32Temesvari L.A. Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Bush J.M. Zhang L. Cardelli J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1479-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Cells were pulsed for 20 min with 750 μCi/ml [35S]Met. Cells were spun down and resuspended in HL5 medium containing 10 and 8.5 mm unlabeled Met and Cys, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against α-mannosidase (clone 2H9) and β-glucosidase (clone 2F5) were a gift from James A. Cardelli. Identification of a PTEN-related Gene in D. discoideum—To identify potential homologs of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase PTEN in Dictyostelium, we screened the Dictyostelium genome using the BLAST program with the human PTEN P-loop as bait. In addition to the previously identified Dictyostelium homolog of mammalian PTEN (33Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 34Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), we identified a predicted protein (GenBank™ accession number AA052139) containing a domain with high sequence homology to the human PTEN P-loop catalytic domain. Because of this homology to PTEN in the catalytic domain, we designated this protein PLIP for phospholipid-inositol phosphatase. A PCR product containing this domain was used to screen a cDNA library. The sequence of the longest clone (pBS-PLIP) revealed an open reading frame of 232 amino acids starting with an ATG codon in a good context for translation initiation in Dictyostelium. The deduced sequence of PLIP was identical to the predicted protein AA052139. The PLIP phosphatase signature motif is more closely related to the P-loop of PTEN (Fig. 1A) than to other members of this family of phosphatases, which includes protein-tyrosine phosphatases. This domain includes two conserved basic amino acids, Lys167 and Arg170, in PLIP, corresponding to Lys125 and Lys128 in human PTEN. These two lysines give to the catalytic pocket a basic character compatible with the negative charge of the phospholipids, and Lys128 makes contact with the phosphate group at the 5′-position of the inositol ring and is therefore a key determinant of the PTEN specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3. Substitution of Arg for Lys128 in human PTEN does not affect the catalytic activity of PTEN for PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 in vitro (27Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Lys-to-Arg substitution in PLIP may not affect substrate specificity of the enzyme. Asp136 and His137 in PLIP correspond to Asp92 and His93 in human PTEN, which are also important for human PTEN catalytic activity and substrate specificity. These features suggest that PLIP could be a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase. Besides this conserved catalytic loop, the catalytic domain of PLIP is clearly distinct from that of PTEN (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, PTEN and the closely related proteins PTEN2, TPIP, and TPEP (35Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Leslie N.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Wu Y.

Jousson O. Scamuffa N. Mas C. Rossier C. Hutter P. Meda P. Lyle R. Reymond A. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have a C2 domain in their C termini that it supposed to bind lipids. PLIP does not contain a C2 lipid-interacting domain. However, PLIP has a hydrophobic stretch of 23 amino acids at its N terminus (Fig. 2A) that is predicted to be a transmembrane helical domain (TMHMM Version 2.0), suggesting that PLIP may be an integral membrane protein. This analysis of the PLIP sequence indicates that PLIP is only weakly related to PTEN and therefore is not a Dictyostelium homolog of PTEN2, TPIP, or TPEP. Screening of available data bases has identified PLIP homologs in plants and metazoans, including humans, but no clear homolog has been found in yeast (Fig. 1B). We propose that PLIP defines a previously unidentified family of phosphatidylinositol phosphatases (see below). These proteins share a catalytic loop very homologous to that of PLIP and homology throughout their sequence, including an invariant LGAXP motif upstream of the CX 5R active site (Fig. 2), the function of which is not known. The putative N-terminal transmembrane domain is not a conserved feature of this family because human and mouse members of this family do not contain any putative transmembrane domain. Although a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain was identified in the homologs from Arabidopsis and zebrafish, its precise location within these proteins is not conserved, and there are no data to demonstrate that this is a transmembrane domain. PLIP Localizes in the Golgi System—In unstimulated cells, PTEN localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is involved in the dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3/PI(3,4)P2 (33Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 34Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), whereas PTEN2 localizes to the Golgi, and TPIPα localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (35Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Leslie N.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Pisabarro M.T. Dillard-Telm L. Koeppen H. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21745-21753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We investigated the intracellular localization of PLIP by indirect immunofluorescence using cells expressing HA-tagged PLIP. Fig. 3 shows that PLIP-HA localized in patch-like structures in the cell. We did not observe any plasma membrane staining in growing or chemotaxis-competent cells before or after chemoattractant stimulation (data not shown). The same subcellular localization was observed using C-terminally GFP-tagged PLIP (PLIP-GFP) (data not shown). Co-staining of PLIP-HA and nuclei revealed that the region of PLIP staining was always closely associated with the nucleus. In multinucleate cells, which comprise a low percentage of cells in axenically grown Dictyostelium cell populations, each nucleus was associated with a similar PLIP-staining region. These observations suggest that PLIP localizes to the Golgi system. As shown in Fig. 3, this conclusion was confirmed by co-immunostaining of PLIP-HA and the Golgi marker antibody 1/39 (38Graf R. Daunderer C. Schliwa M. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or golvesin-GFP (29Schneider N. Schwartz J.M. Kohler J. Becker M. Schwarz H. Gerisch G. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, as in mammalian cells, the Golgi system is closely linked to the microtubule organization center (39Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A. Durand G. Pous C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 40Ma S. Trivinos-Lagos L. Graf R. Chisholm R.L. J.

Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); and the drug nocodazole, which induces microtubule depolymerization, promotes the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus into smaller, scattered structures (39Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A. Durand G. Pous C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 40Ma S. Trivinos-Lagos L. Graf R. Chisholm R.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Co-labeling experiments with anti-α-tubulin antibody indicated that PLIP-HA co-localized with the microtubule organization center (Fig. 3). After a 1-h treatment with 10 μm nocodazole, the microtubule network had disappeared, whereas the microtubule organization center remained intact. In these nocodazole-treated cells, PLIP-HA associated with smaller, patched structures linked to the microtubule organization center that scattered throughout the cytoplasm. These structures probably represent smaller, dispersed Golgi vesicles. These data are consistent with PLIP being a Golgi protein. PLIP Topology—The presence of a putative transmembrane domain suggests that PLIP is an integral membrane protein of the Golgi system. To test this model, cells expressing PLIP-HA and PLIP-GFP were mechanically lysed, and the particulate fraction was isolated by high speed centrifugation. Western blot analyses demonstrated that PLIP-HA was detected only in the particulate fraction (Fig. 4A). It was not solubilized by 1 m NaCl, 100 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.5–11), or 5% Triton X-100. Treatment of this cell fraction with 500 mm NaCl and 2.5% Triton X-100 led to PLIP-HA solubilization. PLIP-GFP exhibited identical properties (data not shown), consistent with PLIP being an integral membrane protein. To examine whether the PLIP catalytic domain is in the cytoplasmic or luminal compartment, we treated a crude cell lysate expressing PLIP-GFP with the non-membrane-permeant protease trypsin (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, we used golvesin fused to GFP at either the N or C terminus as an internal control (29Schneider N. Schwartz J.M. Kohler J. Becker M. Schwarz H. Gerisch G. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Golvesin is a Golgi protein that contains a short N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a long C-terminal domain. PLIP-GFP is rapidly degraded by trypsin, producing a band corresponding to GFP, which is resistant to trypsin digestion (44Chiang C.F. Okou D.T. Griffin T.B. Verret C.R. Williams M.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GFP-golvesin is also rapidly digested by trypsin, producing a GFP-sized fragment. In contrast, the treatment of golvesin-GFP with trypsin resulted in the formation of two slightly shorter peptides recognized by anti-GFP antibody, consistent with only the short N-terminal domain of golvesin being accessible to the protease. These results support a spatial model in which the C terminus of PLIP containing the phosphatase domain faces the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas the C terminus of golvesin is luminal (Fig. 4C). PLIP Has Phosphatidylinositol Phosphatase Activity—Based on primary sequence similarity between PLIP and known phosphoinositide phosphatases related to PTEN in the putative P-loop region, we predicted that PLIP would exhibit phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. To test this, full-length glutathione S-transferase-PLIP was expressed in E. coli, purified to near homogeneity, and tested for phosphoinositide phosphatase activity in vitro against a panel of di-C8-phosphoinositide substrates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the overall specific activity of PLIP was significantly lower than that of other known phosphoinositide phosphatases, PLIP was able to dephosphorylate each phosphoinositide substrate, including 3-phosphoinositides (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, PLIP exhibited a preference for PI(5)P. Furthermore, incubation of PLIP with 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide, a thiol-modifying reagent known to react with the active-site cysteine nucleophile of protein tyrosine phosphatases (20Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), reduced the activity of PLIP for PI(5)P by ∼10-fold. Although we have not analyzed many potential proteinaceous substrates, the ability of an enzyme to act as a protein phosphatase in vivo is often accurately reflected by its ability to utilize p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (30Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B shows that the in vitro p-nitrophenyl phosphate activity of PLIP is 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of laforin, a known protein phosphatase, supporting the hypothesis that PLIP acts as a phosphoinositide phosphatase rather than a protein phosphatase in vivo. Phenotype of PLIP Null Cells—To access the role of PLIP in vivo, two independent PLIP knockout mutants were created by homologous recombination and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) (data not shown). RNA blot analysis revealed that PLIP mRNA, which is expressed in vegetative cells and throughout development, was not detectable in either PLIP null strain (Fig. 6A). When PLIP null cells were plated for multicellular development on non-nutrient phosphate-buffered agar at a standard cell density (8 × 105 cells/cm2), we observed no difference between the null strain and the parental wild-type control strain (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W1991955198,"Both hypoxia and insulin induce common target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factors and several glycolytic enzymes. However, these two signals eventually trigger quite different metabolic pathways. Hypoxia induces glycolysis, resulting in anaerobic ATP production, while insulin increases glycolysis for energy storage. Hypoxia-induced gene expression is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) that consists of HIF-1α and the aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt). Hypoxia-induced gene expression is initiated by the stabilization of the HIF-1α subunit. Here we investigated whether insulin-induced gene expression also requires stabilization of HIF-1α. Our results indicate that hypoxia but not insulin stabilizes HIF-1α protein levels, whereas both insulin- and hypoxia-induced gene expression require the presence of the Arnt protein. Insulin treatment fails to inactivate proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α, which triggers recruitment of the von Hippel-Lindau protein and oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α. Insulin-induced gene expression is inhibited by the presence of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, whereas hypoxia-induced gene expression is not. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of H2O2, reduces insulin-induced gene expression but not hypoxia-induced gene expression. Although both hypoxia and insulin induce the expression of common target genes through a hypoxia-responsive element- and Arnt-dependent mechanism, insulin cannot stabilize the HIF-1α protein. We believe that insulin activates other putative partner proteins for Arnt in PI 3-kinase- and H2O2-dependent pathways. Both hypoxia and insulin induce common target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factors and several glycolytic enzymes. However, these two signals eventually trigger quite different metabolic pathways.

Insulin treatment fails to inactivate proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α, which triggers recruitment of the von Hippel-Lindau protein and oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α. Insulin-induced gene expression is inhibited by the presence of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, whereas hypoxia-induced gene expression is not. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of H2O2, reduces insulin-induced gene expression but not hypoxia-induced gene expression. Although both hypoxia and insulin induce the expression of common target genes through a hypoxia-responsive element- and Arnt-dependent mechanism, insulin cannot stabilize the HIF-1α protein. We believe that insulin activates other putative partner proteins for Arnt in PI 3-kinase- and H2O2-dependent pathways. As oxygen levels decrease, cells generate ATP mainly from anaerobic glycolysis in the cytoplasm since the lack of oxygen diminishes the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in mitochondria. The hypoxic cells enhance glucose utilization by increasing transcription of glucose transporter proteins (Glut-1 and -3) 1The abbreviations used are: Glut-1, glucose transporter-1; Arnt, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; bHLH, basic-helix-loophelix; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; HRE, hypoxia-responsive element; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PAS, Period/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor/Single-minded; PGK-1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1; PI, phosphoinositide; PDTC, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; Sim, Single-minded; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TOR, target of rapamycin; IPAS, inhibitory PAS domain protein and several glycolytic enzymes. Other genes involved in systemic responses to prolonged hypoxic stress include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces blood vessel formation at hypoxic sites; erythropoietin, which elevates the production of red blood cells; and inducible nitricoxide synthase, which induces vasodilation (1Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). These diverse target genes are induced by a common transactivator, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and Arnt, both of which contain a basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and Per, Arnt, AhR, Sim (PAS) domains. Recent studies demonstrated that hydroxylation of HIF-1α at the 564 proline residue is catalyzed by HIF-1α proline hydroxylase using molecular oxygen as the substrate. The tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein specifically interacts with hydroxylated HIF-1α and mediates the assembly of a complex that activates a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome. Ubiquitinated HIF-1α is degraded by the proteasome. When cells lack oxygen, proline is not hydroxylated, and therefore HIF-1α protein is accumulated (2Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L.

Stabilized HIF-1α protein translocates into nuclei and makes a heterodimer with its partner Arnt. The HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimer specifically contacts the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs: -ANACGTGC-), recruits their coactivator p300/CBP, and increases transcription of their target genes. It is expected that the basic region of Arnt contacts CGTG sequences, whereas HIF-1α determines the half-site specificity of HRE (6Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Besides hypoxia, the nutritional state and hormones of the cell also regulate transcription of many glycolytic enzymes required for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Insulin plays a central role in regulating the metabolic pathways associated with energy storage and utilization. It triggers the conversion of glucose into glycogen and triglycerides and inhibits gluconeogenesis. Insulin has been known to modulate cellular metabolism by modifying the activity or changing the cellular location of preexisting enzymes. Recently the regulation of gene expression by insulin has been recognized as a major function of this hormone (7O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Insulin increases the transcription of fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA synthetase, both of which are involved in lipogenesis. Insulin also increases the transcription of Glut-1 and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK-1), proteins involved in glucose uptake and glycolysis. However, insulin inhibits de novo synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate kinase, enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis (8Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27320-27324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Some of these genes direct the synthesis of enzymes that have a well established metabolic connection to insulin, while others do not even though they are up-regulated by insulin. These genes represent major secretory proteins, such as VEGFs (9Miele C. Rochford J.J. Filippa N. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Obberghen E.V. J. Biol.

Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to other hormone response elements, consensus cis-acting elements and their unique trans-acting factors have not been discovered among these diverse genes affected by insulin. Strikingly most hypoxia-inducible genes are also induced by insulin. These genes include VEGF, erythropoietin, enothelin-1 (14Yamashita K. Discher D.J. Hu J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) demonstrated that insulin increases the transcription of these target genes through an HRE by inducing the formation of an HRE-protein complex. Arnt is required for both insulin- and hypoxia-induced gene expression. Although hypoxia and insulin share common target genes, they have opposite effects on metabolism: energy consumption versus energy conservation (1Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar, 16Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol.

In this study, we investigated how two stimuli, hypoxia and insulin, share signaling pathways to induce the same set of target genes. Our results demonstrate that the phosphoinositol (PI) 3-kinase pathway and reactive oxygen species are involved in insulin- but not in hypoxia-induced gene expression. Insulin treatment induces HRE-dependent gene expression without increasing levels of the HIF-1α protein, implying that insulin-induced HRE-responsive transcription functions independently of HIF-1α. Materials and Plasmids—The anti-HIF-1α antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (H72320). The immunogenic region of this antibody is located within amino acids 610–727 of human HIF-1α. The anti-Arnt antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. The p(HRE)4-luc reporter plasmid contains four copies of the erythropoietin hypoxia-responsive element (5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′, nucleotides 3449–3470), the SV40 promoter, and the firefly luciferase gene (18Ema M.

CoCl2 and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were obtained from Sigma. Cell Cultures and Treatments—Wild-type mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells and Arnt-defective Hepa1c1c7 cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human breast carcinoma cells MCF7, human kidney cells 293, human hepatoma cells SK-Hep1, SNU368 cells, and mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM containing non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum. Hep3B cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Arnt-defective Hepa1c1c7 cells infected with retrovirus expressing full-length Arnt were kindly provided by Dr. James P. Whitlock, Jr. (20Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.J.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to hypoxia (0.1% O2) by incubating them in an anaerobic incubator (Model 1029, Forma Scientific, Inc.) in 5% CO2, 10% H2, and 85% N2 at 37 °C. Hypoxia was also induced chemically by treating cells with 100 μm CoCl2 (Sigma). Western Analysis of HIF-1α and Arnt—Cells were serum-starved by incubation in α-MEM or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 40–48 h before treatment with insulin and/or hypoxia. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of each protein sample (30 or 50 μg) was resolved using SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol) onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). After blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk, blots were probed with the suitable antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 1 h. Blots were washed, and bound antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and Northern Analysis—Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence on 100-mm tissue culture plates. Cells were serum-starved for 16–24 h with 0.5% fetal bovine serum prior to stimulation. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy spin column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Inc.). Total RNA was resolved by electrophoresis through a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane. Blots were hybridized with α-32P-labeled cDNA, washed, dried, and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate. 18 h later, transfection was carried out using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 20–24 h prior to hypoxic treatment, transfected cells were serum-starved with medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed with a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB9501) using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for total protein concentration as determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The transfection efficiency was monitored by measuring cotransfection of the β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid (pCHO110) and β-galactosidase activity. In Vitro HIF-1α-VHL Interaction Assay—HeLa cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then treated with insulin (100 nm) and hypoxia (0.1% oxygen) for 4 h prior to lysate preparation. Treated HeLa cells were harvested, collected by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). To make the S-100 cytoplasmic fraction, the cell pellet was resuspended at 108 cells/0.6 ml of hypotonic buffer. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were disrupted by homogenizing 15 times in a Wheaton Dounce homogenizer using a type B pestle. The lysates were centrifuged at 3,300 × g. 110 volume of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (0.3 m Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 1.4 m KCl, 0.03 m MgCl2) was added to the supernatant cytoplasmic fractions. This cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h (21Dignam J.D. Leboviz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant, the S-100 cytoplasmic fraction, was used for the following in vitro hydroxylation reaction. [35S]Methionine-labeled VHL protein was synthesized using an in vitro transcription and translation kit according to the instruction manual (Promega, catalog number L1170). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIF-1α-(401–603) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione uniflow resin according to the instruction manual (Clontech). In the presence of 2 mm ascorbic acid, 100 μm FeCl2, and 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, resin-bound GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) was preincubated with 200 μl of the S-100 cytoplasmic fraction (1,000 μg of total proteins) for 90 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and washed with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The resin-bound GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) was mixed with 10 μl of 35S-labeled VHL. After 2 h at 4 °C, resin-containing GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) was washed three times. Proteins were eluted in 3× SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Reactions in hypoxia were performed in a 0.1% oxygen, 5% CO2, 85% N2, and 10% H2 atmosphere created using a work station within the anaerobic incubator (Model 1029, Forma Scientific, Inc.). All buffers and reagents, S-100 cytoplasmic fraction, GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) were preincubated in this hypoxic atmosphere for 16–18 h on ice. 35S-Labeled in vitro translated VHL was preincubated in a hypoxic atmosphere for 4 h on ice prior to the hydroxylation reaction (3Epstein A.C.

Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were serum-starved by incubation in α-MEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 40–48 h and then incubated in 0.1% O2 for 6 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (45Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). 70% confluent cells in 100-mm tissue culture plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Subsequently the cells were homogenized by 15 strokes with a Dounce type B pestle. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 2 packed nuclei volumes of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 450 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4). The suspensions were incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were frozen at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides for W18 (sense, 5′-agcttGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCAg-3′; antisense, 5′-aattcTGAGACAGCACGTAGGGCa-3′) were annealed and labeled (1.75 pmol) with [α-32P]dATP and Klenow. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration over a Sephadex G-25 column. Nuclear extracts were preincubated with polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (500 ng) in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) for 5 min. The labeled W18 probe (5 × 105 cpm) was incubated with nuclear extract (8 or 10 μg) for 40 min at room temperature. The reactions were separated by 5% PAGE at 250 V in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. For competition assays, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide W18 (70 pmol; sense, 5′-agcttGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCag-3′; antisense, 5′-aattcTGAGACAGCACGTAGGGCa-3′) or M18 (70 pmol; sense, 5′-agcttGCCCTAAAAGCTGTCTCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-aattcTGAGACAGCTTTTAGGGCA-3′) was also added to the reaction mixture. Insulin and Hypoxia Share Common Target Genes—Both insulin and hypoxia are known to increase the de novo synthesis of several glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter proteins, and VEGF in various cells. Our Northern analysis confirmed that both stimuli increase the expression of a common set of target genes in human Hep3B cells and preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. In these cells, hypoxia increases the mRNA level of VEGF, PGK-1, and Glut-1 as indicated in Fig. 1A. Similarly insulin stimulates the expression of the same target genes. The same intensities of 18 S/28 S rRNA in each lane confirmed that the same amount of RNA was loaded for each sample. Hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA was identified as multiple bands that represent different size mRNAs of VEGF isomers, whereas insulin increases the mRNA of only the largest isomer. Hypoxia is also known to increase the mRNA level of VEGF by stimulating transcription and increasing the stability of VEGF mRNA. Hypoxia-inducible gene expression is mediated by common cis-acting elements, HREs located in the regulatory region of several hypoxia-inducible genes. To confirm whether the HRE is also able to mediate insulin-induced gene expression, we transiently transfected Hep3B cells with HRE-driven reporter plasmids and then treated these cells with hypoxia and/or insulin (Fig. 1B). Our findings indicate that insulin and hypoxia significantly increase expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Dual treatment with insulin (100 nm) and hypoxia (0.1% O2) synergistically increases the expression of HRE-driven luciferase. In contrast, dual treatment with insulin (100 nm) and hypoxia (0.1% O2) fails to show an additive effect on induction of the endogenous target genes. Our finding that insulin and hypoxia synergistically increase HRE activity implies that the two stimuli activate HRE via different pathways. Hypoxia Stabilizes the HIF-1α Protein but Insulin Does Not—Hypoxia-induced gene expression is mediated by the HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimeric transcription activator, which specifically binds to its cognitive cis-acting element, HRE. The responsiveness of the HIF-1 complex is due to the hypoxia-induced stabilization of the HIF-1α protein, which is otherwise degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome under normoxic conditions. We investigated whether insulin also stabilizes the HIF-1α protein as does hypoxia. Western analyses demonstrated that hypoxia or CoCl2 increases the protein level of HIF-1α in various human liver cells (including HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1, and SNU368), the human breast cancer cell line (MCF7 cells), and the human kidney cell line (293 cells) (Fig. 2). In contrast, the protein levels of Arnt remain unchanged after treatment with either hypoxia or insulin. To test whether insulin increases the level of HIF-1α proteins, we treated Hep3B cells with different doses of insulin for various times. We could not detect stabilized HIF-1α in either Hep3B cells or any other cell lines that were treated with insulin (Fig. 2B). We confirmed that insulin (100 nm, 6 h) activates a down-stream protein kinase by demonstrating phosphorylation of the Akt kinase in 293 cells (Fig. 2D). Our results suggest that hypoxia induces target genes, including VEGF, PGK-1, and Glut-1, by stabilizing HIF-1α but that insulin does not require the stabilization of HIF-1α for the induction of the same set of target genes. Hypoxia but Not Insulin Reduces the Interaction between VHL and HIF-1α—Since degradation of HIF-1α is triggered by hydroxylation of its proline residue (Pro-564) and interaction with VHL, we investigated whether proline hydroxylation of HIF-1α decreases in insulin-treated cells. We prepared cell lysates that contain proline hydroxylation activity from insulin- (100 nm, 4 h) or hypoxia (0.1% oxygen, 4 h)-treated cells. We expressed and purified the GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) fusion protein that encodes the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α-(401–603) fused with GST. Incubation of GST-HIF-1α-(401–603) fusion protein with lysates from insulin-treated cells increased recruitment of 35S-labeled VHL protein, which indicates hydroxylation of HIF-1α at Pro-564 (Fig. 3). Our results indicate that insulin signaling cannot inactivate HIF-1α proline hydroxylase. The proline hydroxylation activity of lysates from hypoxic cells remains unchanged. When the reactions using these lysates were performed under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2), the interaction between treated HIF-1α and VHL was reduced, indicating that proline hydroxylation activities from all three lysates were inhibited upon exposure to a hypoxic atmosphere. The presence of insulin in the reaction could not inhibit the in vitro interaction between HIF-1α and VHL. Our results indicate that the activity of proline hydroxylase is not persistently inhibited by pretreatment with either hypoxia or insulin but that it instantly loses its activity in the absence of its oxygen substrate (3Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Insulin usually induces covalent modification of its target enzymes through intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. Our results rule out the possibility that insulin induces covalent modification of HIF-1α proline hydroxylase leading to persistent repression of its activity. Arnt Is Required for the Induction of Genes by Both Hypoxia and Insulin—To test whether Arnt is also required for insulin-induced gene expression, we used variant Hapa1c1c7 cells that are defective in Arnt expression. Arnt-defective cells had been reconstituted with Arnt by retroviral infection using pMFG retroviral vector that has no selective antibiotic resistance gene (20Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.J.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thereby these reconstituted cells have heterogenous populations in terms of Arnt protein expression. Although the collective expression level of Arnt protein in the reconstituted cells is greater than that of wild-type cells, the individual cell has a different expression level of Arnt (Fig. 4A). For this reason, we suspect that these reconstituted cells could not demonstrate the exact expression profile of the wild-type cells. We treated three types of cells with either hypoxia or insulin and then measured the expression level of several genes by Northern analysis. The results shown in Fig. 4B indicate that the absence of Arnt significantly reduces hypoxia- and insulin-induced expression of VEGF and PGK-1. The intensity of 18 S/28 S rRNA was equivalent in all lanes. However, Arnt addition in Arnt-defective cells restored hypoxia- and insulin-induced expression of VEGF and PGK-1 in part (Fig. 4B). Our findings emphasize that Arnt is essential for both hypoxia- and insulin-induced gene expression. To confirm that Arnt is essential for both hypoxia- and insulin-induced activity of HRE, we transiently transfected three types of Hepa1c1c7 cells with the HRE reporter plasmid (Fig. 4C). The results indicate that the presence of Arnt is required for both hypoxia- and insulin-induced HRE activity.

Microfibrils are characterized as beaded filamentous structures with a variable axial periodicity (average 56 nm in the untensioned state); however, the basis of their elasticity remains unknown. This study used a combination of small angle x-ray scattering and Raman microscopy to investigate further the packing of microfibrils within the intact tissue and to determine the role of molecular reorganization in the elasticity of these microfibrils. The application of relatively small strains produced no overall change in either molecular or macromolecular microfibrillar structure. In contrast, the application of larger tissue extensions (up to 150%) resulted in a markedly different structure, as observed by both Raman microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering. These changes occurred at different levels of architecture and are interpreted as ranging from alterations in peptide bond conformation to domain rearrangement. This study demonstrates the importance of molecular elasticity in the mechanical properties of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in the intact tissue.

Microfibrils are essential structural components of the extracellular matrix and are widely distributed in both vertebrate and invertebrate tissue, where they impart elastic properties on all dynamic connective tissues (1Thurmond F.A.

Electron microscopy has revealed that microfibrils are macromolecular structures with a regular beaded appearance and a diameter of 10–14 nm. The average periodicity of these beaded microfibrils when isolated and in the untensioned state is ∼56 nm, although a range of periodicities (33–165 nm) has been observed (4Baldock C. Koster A.J.

A fundamental axial periodicity of 56 nm was also observed by small angle x-ray scattering techniques, which revealed dominant 3rd and 6th orders. This is consistent with the presence of a regular array of microfibrils with a relative stagger of 56/3 nm and indicates a higher level of order in microfibrillar assembly (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P.

A number of multidisciplinary studies have been conducted that investigated the structure-function relationship of fibrillin-rich microfibrils (4Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J.

Biol. 1999; 202: 3011-3020PubMed Google Scholar). Despite extensive investigation, however, the precise molecular arrangement (and consequently the basis of elasticity) of these microfibrils remains unknown. In the model described by Baldock et al. (4Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a series of molecular folding events are proposed to occur during the assembly of fibrillin-rich microfibrils. These folds are believed to provide a basis for both the appearance and elasticity of microfibrils. This model is discussed in more detail below. This study utilized the techniques of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) 1The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; cbEGF, calcium-binding epidermal growth factor; TB, transforming growth factor-β-binding protein-like domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor. combined with parallel Raman microspectroscopy to monitor changes in both the supramolecular and molecular structure of fibrillin-rich microfibrils (contained within the zonular filaments of ovine eye) under a variety of different conditions. The aim of this combined approach was to obtain greater insight into the basis of fibrillin elasticity. Small angle x-ray scattering was utilized to characterize any changes in the supramolecular architecture of fibrillin-rich microfibrils following tissue extension. Any alteration in the periodicity of arrays of laterally aligned microfibrils can be easily monitored in this way. SAXS is a particularly useful technique as it allows the analysis of intact tissue samples in the fully hydrated state. Previous studies (10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that the application of relatively low stresses produced only minor differences in periodicity. In contrast, further extension of the tissue resulted in a higher periodicity. This study aimed to characterize this phenomenon further by monitoring structural changes that occur during extension up to the limits of tissue extensibility. Previous work in this area was limited somewhat by the power of x-ray source available and by a low spatial resolution. In this study, the high brilliance beamline ID02 at the third generation synchrotron European Synchrotron Radiation Facility was utilized, which combines a highly collimated and parallel x-ray beam with a high resolution detector and low signal to noise level. The improved resolution and the intensity of X-rays available at this state-of-the-art beamline facilitated the investigation of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, both by enabling the detection of structures with a higher periodicity than previously seen and by allowing a vastly improved sample throughput. In addition to this small angle x-ray scattering work was an investigation into possible parallel changes in molecular configuration. Raman spectroscopy is widely used in the study of protein structure and measures the inelastic scattering of light dependent upon internal molecular vibrations (12Miura T. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biswas B.B. Roy S. Subcellular Chemistry. Vol. 24. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 55-99Google Scholar). Particular molecular groupings give rise to specific frequency shifts, generating characteristic spectra that provide information on protein conformation. Raman spectroscopy can be used to monitor protein secondary structure, domain-domain configurations, and the local environment of interacting side chains. This technique allowed examination of any changes in molecular conformation that arose upon the application of stress to the tissue. Furthermore, any specific change in molecular configuration (induced for example by temperature changes, covalent modification or intermolecular interaction) can be detected by shifts in Raman band position. Raman spectroscopy is particularly useful for the analysis of aqueous systems as water generates very weak Raman scattering, thus producing little interference with the macromolecular signal. Raman spectroscopy was thus seen as an ideal method for investigating the role of molecular conformation on the elasticity of arrays of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in excised tissue. The main molecular constituent of fibrillin-rich microfibrils is the glycoprotein fibrillin, although other molecules are also known to be associated (including microfibril-associated glycoprotein 1 and 2, latent transforming binding proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) (13Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was anticipated that any alteration in protein conformation upon extension of these zonular filaments would produce an alteration in Raman spectra. These changes may indicate the levels of architecture that determine the elastic response. Sample Preparation—Zonular filaments were dissected from ovine eye tissue as described previously for bovine tissue (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, eyes were obtained within 24 h post-mortem from a local abattoir. Dissection of the posterior chamber of the eye produced an intact preparation of ciliary body, lens, and vitreous humor. Zonular filaments within this preparation were mounted securely on small aluminum frames (∼1 × 0.5 cm, with a window of ∼0.7 × 0.3 cm) using cyanoacrylate. Samples were kept hydrated using Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.2). Previous work was conducted using either phosphate-buffered saline (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or Tris-buffered saline (9Wess T.J. Kielty C.M. Purslow P.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). No difference has been found in sample behavior using either of these two buffers. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Small angle x-ray scattering of ovine zonular filaments was carried out on ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using a 10 m sample to detector distance. Images were collected over 0.5 s on a Thomson x-ray Intensifier (TH 49–427) lens coupled to a FReLoN CCD camera (2048 × 2048 pixels). This detector has an active area of size 180 mm and a frame rate of 14 images (1024 × 1024 pixels) per second with a 14 bit nominal dynamic range. The wavelength of X-rays used was 0.09958 nm and the beam size at the sample was 300 × 300 μm. Three samples were analyzed and all exhibited similar properties. Images were obtained following a variety of different tissue extensions, which were estimated from the overall extension of the macroscopic tissue sample as described by Wess et al. (10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ends of each tissue sample were fixed and then separated by a distance proportional to the original rest length. Extensions were at ∼0, 50 (data not shown), 100 (data not shown), and 150%. Images were also obtained following tissue relaxation back to the original rest length. These particular levels were chosen in order to analyze changes in microfibrillar structure that arise at the limits of tissue extension, immediately prior to tissue failure. Each sample was preconditioned before analysis to ensure that all had stable base-line mechanical properties. The level of pre-strain within each sample was estimated from the extent of arcing of the meridional and equatorial Bragg reflections. The rest length in this study was defined as the length at which the microfibrils could be seen to align and hence are taking up the macroscopic strain applied to the sample. Tissue extensions were determined subsequent to the measurement of this rest length. Samples were maintained in a hydrated state using Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and analyzed between thin mica sheets. No beam damage was observed during these very short exposure times. X-ray Data Analysis—X-ray diffraction two-dimensional images were calibrated using rat tail tendon collagen (which indexes on a 1/67 nm–1 meridional periodicity) and analyzed using in-house software that has been used previously to interpret type I collagen diffraction data. An empty cell background has been subtracted from each image. Typical diffraction images can be seen in Fig. 1. Integration of meridional intensities was carried out using FIT2D (14Hammersley, A. O. (1993) ESRF Internal Report EXP/AH/93-02, ESRF Information Office, Grenoble, FranceGoogle Scholar). Raman Microscopy—Raman microscopy measurements of ovine zonular filaments were performed on a Labram Infinity dual-laser spectrograph (Jobin-Yvon, Horiba, Lille, France) equipped with a Peltier cooled CCD detector. The measurements were carried out using a 532-nm frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (100 milliwatts), a ×100 objective, and a 600 g/mm grating resulting in a spectral resolution of ∼13 cm–1. The spectra of a spot size of ∼4 μm in diameter were acquired using an integration time of 60 s. Tissue extensions were performed as described for small angle x-ray scattering. Spectra of tissue in the native state were collected, following extension to 150% and after relaxation to the rest length. Spectra are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The spectra of intensities were normalized to make direct comparison easier. The quality of the data and the low level of background noise made background correction unnecessary.Fig. 3Difference spectra of Raman results (native and extended for each sample). A number of peaks and troughs are evident and common to all three difference spectra (A–C), corresponding to structural differences between the extended and native tissue. These features have been labeled with the appropriate wave number. Positive features are indicated by numbers at the top of the spectra, negative features are indicated by numbers at the bottom.

The diffraction patterns obtained from the native tissue (see Fig. 1A) correspond to those reported previously for bovine eye tissue and exhibit a 1st order accompanied by a prominent 3rd order in the meridional series (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Wess T.J. Kielty C.M. Purslow P.P. J.

Following tissue extension to ∼150%, however, a significantly different image was produced (see Fig. 1B). In this case the meridional series was truncated and the positioning of the 1st order moved to a smaller angle. Differences were also produced in the equatorial series, with the extended tissue exhibiting an increased sharpness and indexing on a higher angle. There was also a decrease in arcing of both the meridional and equatorial peaks upon extension. Following relaxation of the tissue back to the rest length, however, there was an immediate return to the characteristic, albeit weaker, diffraction pattern, with first and 3rd orders visible (see Fig. 1C). This indicates that the extensibility of the tissue was reversible to this limit. Extension to higher levels resulted in tissue failure. Each of these findings and their implications are discussed in more detail below. Raman Microscopy—Raman microscopy was performed on ovine zonular filaments in the native, extended, and relaxed states. The spectra obtained were highly reproducible from sample to sample, and representative spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The major peaks have been labeled with the appropriate wave number, and the structural features to which they correspond are detailed in Tables I and II (12Miura T. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biswas B.B.

The spectra of the native and relaxed tissue showed a high degree of homology to each other. This implies that changes in protein conformation, which are induced by tissue extension, are widely reversible upon relaxation. This also correlates with the findings from small angle x-ray scattering, which demonstrated a similar supramolecular arrangement within fibrillin-rich microfibrils in the native and the relaxed states.Table IProvisional assignment of Raman peaks in Figs. 2 and 3WavenumberFeatureChange in intensity (Native-extended)cm-1815↑831Tyrosine, phenylalanine↓855Non-aromatics (Ile), tyrosine↑880Non-aromatics (Ile, Val, Thr), tryptophan, tyrosine921↑939CC deformation, non-aromatics (Lys, Val, Leu)↑1004Phenylalanine↓1032Phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan↑1065CC stretch1085CC stretch, non-aromatics (Lys, Gln, Ser), phenylalanine↓1128CC stretch, non-aromatics (Ile, Val, Leu, Gln, Ser), tryptophan↓1160Non-aromatics (Ile, Val)1177Tyrosine, phenylalanine1208Tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan1246Amide III (irregular/β-structures)↑1271Amide III, tyrosine1298Amide III (α helices), CH deformations↓1319CH2 deformations↑1343CH2, CH3 deformations, non-aromatics (Lys, Gln, Ser, Thr), tryptophan, tyrosine1390Aliphatic, tryptophan, tyrosine↑1428CH2, CH3 deformations, non-aromatic (Gln), tryptophan1440Aliphatic, tryptophan, tyrosine↓1452CH2, CH3 deformations, non-aromatics (Lys, Ile, Leu)1465CH2 deformations, non-aromatics (Ala, Ile, Val, Leu), tryptophan, tyrosine1555Tryptophan1580Tryptophan↓1607Phenylalanine, tyrosine↓1638↑1654Amide I (α-helices)↓1663Amide I (irregular/β-structures)↑ Open table in a new tab Table IILocations of the amide I and III regionsSampleAmide I wavenumberFeatureAmide III wavenumberFeaturecm-1cm-1Native1663Irregular/β-sheet1246IrregularExtended1654α-Helices1298α-HelicesRelaxed1663Irregular/β-sheet1246Irregular Open table in a new tab Spectra produced by zonular filaments extended to 150% of the rest length, however, were significantly different from those derived from either the native or the relaxed tissue (see Fig. 2). Accurate identification of spectral changes that arose upon tissue extension was achieved by the generation of difference spectra. These were produced by subtracting the intensities of the extended samples from the intensities of the native samples. Peaks and troughs on the difference spectra correspond to regions where spectral changes have occurred and also allow visualization of the magnitude of these changes. These difference spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and the peaks of interest have again been labeled. A number of alterations in Raman spectra occur upon extension of ovine zonular filaments. Changes occur at wave numbers 815, 831, 855, 921, 939, 1004, 1032, 1085, 1128, 1246, 1298, 1319, 1390, 1440, 1580, 1607, 1638, 1654, and 1663 cm–1 (see Figs. 2 and 3 and Tables I and II). Of particular note are differences in the amide I and III regions (which reflect protein secondary structure) and in the aromatic and aliphatic regions (which provide information on protein main chain structure and domain environments). Each of the changes in Raman spectra and their relationship to the model of molecular packing within fibrillin-rich microfibrils will now be considered in turn. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Previous studies (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Wess T.J. Kielty C.M. Purslow P.P. J.

Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) into the small angle x-ray scattering of zonular filaments were conducted using bovine ocular tissue. Legislation within the UK restricting the availability of bovine central nervous tissue has, however, more recently been extended to also include ocular tissue. Therefore, this study was carried out using ovine tissue as an alternative source of mammalian zonular filaments. The x-ray diffraction patterns obtained were remarkably similar to those observed using zonular filaments extracted from bovine eye. Three samples were analyzed, and representative images are shown here. The images obtained from the native tissue (Fig. 1A) displayed a series of meridional Bragg peaks, which index on an average fundamental axial periodicity of 55.4 nm. The patterns exhibited a strong 3rd order at 18.5 nm, which correlates with previous findings (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Wess T.J. Kielty C.M. Purslow P.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and suggests the staggering of adjacent microfibrils at a periodicity of one-third of the axial unit cell length. Following tissue extension of 50%, no significant difference was observed in the three-dimensional organization of the microfibrils, as observed from the diffraction pattern (data not shown). This also corresponds to previous work that documented only minor changes in the axial periodicity of fibrillin-rich microfibrils upon tissue extension of up to 40 or 50% of the rest length (10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the application of greater strains produced markedly different diffraction patterns. Tissue extension to 150% led to a truncation of the meridional series, with the 3rd order no longer visible (see Fig. 1B). The loss of a discernible 3rd order suggests that the existing supramolecular third staggered array of fibrillin-rich microfibrils has been disrupted in the 150% extended state. Extension also produced an increase in the fundamental axial periodicity of the microfibrils as indicated by a shift in the positioning of the 1st order (corresponding to 103.6 nm). This corresponds to a change of 87% in axial periodicity for a tissue extension of 150% and represents a non-linear extension of macroscopic and nanoscopic features of fibrillin-rich microfibrils. This finding was also similar to that reported by Wess et al. (10Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), where extension to 100% resulted in a shift to an 80-nm periodicity. In this study, tissue extension to around 100% resulted in a periodicity of ∼82.5 nm (data not shown). Equatorial reflections in the extended tissue exhibited an increased sharpness and extended to a higher angle (see Fig. 1B), indicating a decreased lateral spacing between individual microfibrils under applied strain. Furthermore, both the meridional and equatorial peaks became less arced upon extension. This indicates that the microfibrils within the zonular tissue are becoming increasingly aligned along the axis of the applied force. Relaxation of the tissue back to the rest length re-established weak reflections in the meridional series, similar to those in the native tissue. A 1st order is visible above the background, indexing on 53.9 nm. A 3rd order is also apparent, occurring at 18.2 nm (see Fig. 1C). The recoverable nature of the x-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the characteristic 3rd staggered array of fibrillin-rich microfibrils can be re-established. This indicates that any supramolecular disruption that arises upon tissue extension is reversible and the tissue is elastic within the range studied. These findings correspond with previous reports on the reversibility of the structural changes that arise following extension of fibrillin-rich tissues (8Wess T.J. Purslow P.P. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Wess T.J. Kielty C.M. Purslow P.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Wess T.J.

Biol. 1998; 122: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it was reported that the characteristic 56-nm periodicity could be re-established following relaxation of tissues extended to 100%. The work presented in this current study demonstrates that following extension to even larger levels (150%), the original pattern can also be recovered. This provides further support to the role of this tissue reorganization in microfibrillar elasticity. Furthermore, studies performed on isolated microfibrils reported similar limits of extensibility to those found here (4Baldock C. Koster A.J. Ziese U. Rock M.J. Sherratt M.J. Kadler K.E.

Similar results were reported in Eriksen et al. (5Eriksen T.A. Wright D.M. Purslow P.P. Duance V.C. Proteins. 2001; 45: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), who also observed two major stable populations of microfibrils within samples extracted from tissue. The first population had a periodicity of ∼60 nm, whereas the second population was found in “highly stretched material” and had a periodicity of 140–150 nm. It was concluded from these studies that microfibrils were reversibly extensible in the range of ∼56 to 100 nm and that irreversible deformation occurred at higher periodicities (i.e. in the microfibrils of 140–150-nm periodicity) (4Baldock C.

Structural and mutagenesis data have indicated that the interaction of basic residues of the heparin-binding exosite of protein C with the acidic residues of TM4 is partially responsible for the efficient activation of the substrate by the thrombin-TM456 complex. Similar to protein C, PCI has a basic exosite (H-helix) that constitutes the heparin-binding site of the serpin. To determine whether TM accelerates the reactivity of thrombin with PCI by providing a binding site for the H-helix of the serpin, an antithrombin (AT) mutant was constructed in which the H-helix of the serpin was replaced with the same region of PCI (AT-PCIH-helix). Unlike PCI, the H-helix of AT is negatively charged. It was discovered that TM456 slightly (<2-fold) impaired the reactivity of AT with thrombin; however, it enhanced the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with the protease by an order of magnitude. Further studies revealed that the substitution of Arg35 of thrombin with an Ala also resulted in an order of magnitude enhancement in reactivity of the protease with both PCI and AT-PCIH-helix independent of TM. We conclude that TM enhances the reactivity of PCI with thrombin by providing both a binding site for the serpin and a conformational modulation of the extended binding pocket of thrombin. Thrombomodulin (TM), or its epidermal growth factor-like domains 456 (TM456), enhances the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward both protein C and protein C inhibitor (PCI) by 2–3 orders of magnitude. Structural and mutagenesis data have indicated that the interaction of basic residues of the heparin-binding exosite of protein C with the acidic residues of TM4 is partially responsible for the efficient activation of the substrate by the thrombin-TM456 complex.

Protein C inhibitor (PCI) 1The abbreviations used are: PCI, protein C inhibitor; AT, anti-thrombin; TM, thrombomodulin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; SI, inhibition stoichiometry; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is an inhibitor of the serpin superfamily that can react with most coagulation proteases in plasma (1Suzuki K.

It has been named PCI because it was initially thought that its main target in plasma is activated protein C. However, several years ago we demonstrated that the main plasma target protease for PCI is the thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) complex (5Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This was evidenced by the observation that TM enhanced the reactivity of thrombin with PCI by two orders of magnitude. The cofactor effect of TM in promoting the reactivity of PCI with thrombin was because of protein-protein interactions, because the epidermal growth factor-like domains 456 (TM456) of the cofactor, which is devoid of the heparin-like chondroitin sulfate moiety accelerated the reaction to a similar extent (5Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). TM456 is the minimal functional fragment of the cofactor that is capable of switching the specificity of thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant enzyme (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Kurosawa S. Stearns D.J. Jackson K.W. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TM456 binds to exosite-1 of thrombin and competitively inhibits the binding of procoagulant ligands such as fibrinogen, PAR1, and procofactors V and VIII to this site of thrombin (8Fenton II, J.W.

Moreover, TM456 dramatically improves the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward protein C, thereby initiating the anticoagulant pathway by rapidly activating the substrate to activated protein C (6Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Activated protein C down-regulates the coagulation cascade by degrading both factors Va and VIIIa by limited proteolysis (14Walker F.J. Fay P.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, TM also improves the catalytic efficiency of thrombin toward the thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (15Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Activated thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor is a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme that can down-regulate fibrinolysis by cleaving carboxyl-terminal basic residues of fibrin. Thus, plasma PCI may play an important role in the regulation of both coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways (16Mosnier L.O. Elisen M.G.L.M. Bouma B.N. Mejers J.C.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TM modulates the interaction of thrombin with different target plasma proteins is not known. In the case of protein C activation, molecular modeling based on the structure of the thrombin-TM456 complex indicated that the binding of the TM5 domain of the cofactor to exosite-1 of thrombin orients the TM4 domain in such a way that a negatively charged region in this domain contacts a basic exosite of protein C in the ternary activation complex (17Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The basic residues of this exosite are known to constitute a heparin-binding exosite in both protein C and activated protein C (18Rezaie A.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 4572-4580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rezaie A.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 13: 8-15Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged residues of this exosite of protein C and the TM4 domain of the cofactor in the activation complex facilitate a proper docking of the substrate into the catalytic pocket of thrombin (17Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we recently used a compensatory charge reversal mutagenesis approach and demonstrated that the TM4 domain provides a binding site for interaction with the heparin-binding exosite of the substrate in the ternary thrombin-TM456-protein C complex (20Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PCI is a heparin-binding serpin the structure of which, similar to other serpins, is comprised of three β-sheets and nine α-helices (21Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 22Huntington J.A. Kjellberg M. Stenflo J. Structure. 2003; 11: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other heparin-binding serpins which interact with the polysaccharide via their basic residues of the D-helix, in the case of PCI the basic H-helix constitutes the heparin-binding exosite of the serpin (23Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that similar to the TM-mediated activation of protein C by thrombin, the H-helix of PCI may interact with TM4 of the cofactor, thereby improving the efficiency of the complex formation between the two proteins. To test this hypothesis, we exploited the unique properties of the serpin antithrombin (AT) which, unlike PCI, has a negatively charged H-helix, and the reactivity of thrombin with AT is independent of TM456. Thus, we prepared an AT mutant in which the H-helix of the serpin was replaced with the corresponding region of PCI (AT-PCIH-helix). Characterization of the inhibitory properties of the AT mutant toward thrombin in both the absence and presence of TM456 indicated that AT-PCIH-helix inhibits thrombin 7- and 92-fold faster than wild type AT in the absence and presence of TM456, respectively. The TM-mediated enhancement in the reactivity of both PCI and the AT mutant with thrombin was significantly diminished if certain TM4 charge reversal mutants of TM456 replaced the wild type cofactor in the inhibition reactions. Further studies revealed that the reactivity of both PCI and AT-PCIH-helix with the Arg35 → Ala mutant of thrombin was also improved by an order of magnitude independent of TM. These results suggest that TM accelerates the PCI inhibition of thrombin by providing both a binding site for the H-helix of the serpin and an allosteric modulation of the 39-loop of thrombin. Construction and Expression of the Recombinant Proteins—The expression of wild type AT by the RSV-PL4 mammalian expression/purification vector system in HEK293 cells has been described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The chimeric AT-PCIH-helix mutant in which the sequence of the H-helix (305Gln-Glu-Trp-Leu-Asp-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Met314) of AT was replaced with the corresponding sequence of PCI (269Arg-Lys-Trp-Leu-Lys-Met-Phe-Lys-Lys-Arg278) (residues 274–283 in the α1-antitrypsin numbering system for both serpins (21Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar)) was constructed by PCR mutagenesis methods as described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another AT mutant in which the acidic residues Asp309, Glu310, Glu312, and Glu313 of the serpin were replaced with the isosteric residues Asn and Gln (AT-NeuH-helix) was also constructed in the same vector system. Following confirmation of the accuracy of mutations by DNA sequencing, the mutant proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity by an immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4, followed by a HiTrap-heparin (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography with a gradient elution from 0.1 to 2.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the AT derivatives were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700 M–1 cm–1 and by stoichiometric titration of the serpins with calibrated heparin as monitored from changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence as described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The wild type, Arg35 → Ala (R35A), and Glu39 → Gln (E39Q) substitution mutants of prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking the Gla and the first kringle domain) were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and activated to thrombin as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentrations of recombinant thrombin derivatives were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, assuming a molecular mass of 36.6 kDa and absorption coefficient (ϵ1cm1&x0025;) of 17.1 (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentrations of active enzymes were also determined by the stoichiometric titration of thrombins with a known concentration of antithrombin as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These values were within 90–100% of the values calculated based on their absorbance at 280 nm. The wild type and charge reversal mutants of TM456 including Asp349 (D349K), Glu346/Asp349 (E346R/D349K), Glu357 (E357K), Glu374 (E374K), Glu382 (E382K), Arg385 (R385E), Asp398 (D398K), and Asp400 (D400K) were prepared by PCR methods and expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli using the pIN-III-pelB expression/purification vector system as described (20Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant PCI was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity as described (26Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inhibition Assays—The rate of inhibition of thrombin derivatives, free or in complex with TM456, by PCI or AT derivatives was measured under pseudo first-order conditions by a discontinuous assay as described previously (5Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the absence of TM456, wild type and mutant thrombins (1 nm) were incubated with wild type or mutant serpins (25–250 nm) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 30 s to 15 min. All reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene assay plates at room temperature. The inactivation reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme TH (0.2 mm final concentration), and the remaining enzyme activity was measured with a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 405 nm as described (5Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the AT mutants with thrombin and factor Xa was also examined in the presence of the active AT-binding pentasaccharide. The experimental conditions in the presence of pentasaccharide were the same as those described above except that the protease inhibition reactions contained a saturating concentration of the cofactor (1 μm). The observed pseudo first-order inactivation rate constants (k obs) were determined by fitting the time-dependent change of the protease activity to a first-order rate equation. Second-order rate constants (k 2) were obtained from the slopes of linear plots of k obs versus the concentrations of serpins as described (5Rezaie A.R. Cooper S.T. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For the inactivation studies in the presence of TM456, the cofactor concentration dependence of thrombin inactivation by serpins was studied by incubating 1 nm wild type or mutant thrombin with 25 nm PCI or AT-PCIH-helix and 0–100 nm TM456 at room temperature in 50-μl reactions in the same TBS buffer system described above. At the end of the incubation times (20 s to 12 min), 50 μl of chromogenic substrate was added, and the k obs values at different concentrations of TM456 were determined as described above. The k 2 values in the presence of a saturating concentration of TM456 (250 nm) were then determined by incubating each thrombin (1 nm) with varying concentrations of the serpins (25–250 nm) for 20 s to 2 min as described above. We previously showed that the TM456 mutants interact with thrombin with apparent dissociation constants of 5–15 nm (20Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, for the inactivation studies in the presence of the TM456 mutants, PCI or AT-PCIH-helix (50 nm) was incubated with wild type thrombin (1 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of each TM456 mutant (500 nm) for 20 s to 20 min at room temperature. The k 2 values were determined as described above. Determination of Inhibition Stoichiometry (SI)—The SI values for the inhibition of thrombin by the serpins were determined by titration of 20 nm thrombin, alone or in complex with 250 nm TM456 with increasing concentrations of each serpin corresponding to serpin/thrombin molar ratios of 0:2. The residual amidolytic activity of thrombin was monitored for up to 8 h at room temperature by the hydrolysis of Spectrozyme TH as described above. After completion of the inhibition reactions, the serpin/thrombin ratios were plotted versus the residual activity of the enzyme, and the SI values were determined from the x-intercept of the linear regression fit of the inhibition data as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild type and the H-helix mutants of AT were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity by a combination of immunoaffinity and HiTrap-heparin chromatography as described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following chromatography on the heparin column, the purified proteins were reapplied to the Ca2+-dependent HPC4 immunoaffinity column, washed with high salt, and eluted with EDTA as described (24Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second immunoaffinity chromatography was performed to eliminate possible traces of heparin contamination in the protein preparations. Identical thrombin inhibition rate constants in both the absence and presence of Polybrene suggested that the purified proteins were devoid of heparin. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that recombinant proteins have been purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1). Both the wild type and H-helix mutant serpins migrated at the expected molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. The amino acid residues forming the H-helices of PCI and AT mutants are presented in Fig. 1. The expression and purification of TM456 derivatives in which the charges of basic (Arg385) and acidic residues of TM4 (Asp349, Glu346, Asp349, Glu357, Glu374, Glu382, Asp398, and Asp400) were reversed by their substitutions with a Glu or Arg/Lys, respectively, were described previously (20Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The R35A and E39Q thrombin mutants were prepared as described (27Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previous characterization of both mutants of thrombin has indicated that mutagenesis of neither Arg35 (27Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) nor Glu39 (28Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) adversely affects the catalytic pocket of thrombin. The purity of all recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. Similar to wild type, the H-helix mutants of AT formed high molecular weight complexes with both thrombin and the thrombin-TM456 complex as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Inhibition of Thrombin in the Absence and Presence of TM456 —The concentration dependence of the observed pseudo first-order rate constants (k obs) for the wild type AT inhibition of thrombin and the thrombin-TM456 complex is presented in Fig. 2A. TM456 slightly impaired the reactivity of AT with thrombin. However, the reactivity of the AT-PCIH-helix mutant with thrombin was markedly improved both in the absence and presence of TM456. As shown in Fig. 2B, AT-PCIH-helix inhibited thrombin ∼7-fold better than wild type AT in the absence of the cofactor (Table I). TM456 further improved the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin by an order of magnitude (Fig. 2B). Thus, relative to the second-order rate constant (k 2) for the thrombin-TM456-AT reaction (6.3 × 103m–1 s–1), the corresponding value for the reaction with AT-PCIH-helix (5.8 × 105m–1 s–1) was elevated 92-fold (Table I). This value is only ∼2-fold lower than the corresponding value for the PCI inhibition of the thrombin-TM456 complex. On the other hand, the reactivity of AT-NeuH-helix with thrombin was improved 2.5-fold, and TM456 accelerated the reaction less than 2-fold (Fig. 2C, Table I). These results suggest that electrostatic interactions between TM and basic residues of the H-helix may account for the improvement in the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin in the ternary complex. It should be noted that both AT and PCI inhibited wild type and mutant thrombins with a similar SI value of ∼1.0–1.1 in both the absence and presence of TM456. However, the SI value for the AT-PCIH-helix with both wild type and mutant thrombins was elevated to ∼1.4–1.5 in both the absence and presence of TM456. The slight increase in the rate of the substrate pathway of the mutant serpin with thrombin was not included in the calculation of the overall rate constants presented in Table I.Table ISecond-order inhibition rate constants (in m-1 s-1) for the reaction of wild type, R35A, and E39Q thrombins with the wild type and mutant serpins in the absence and presence of TM456No cofactor+TM456+TM/-TMThrombinAT(8.4 ± 0.9) × 103(6.3 ± 0.6) × 1030.75PCI(3.3 ± 0.3) × 104(1.3 ± 0.2) × 10639.4AT-PCIH-helix(6.1 ± 0.7) × 104(5.8 ± 0.3) × 1059.5AT-NeuH-helix(2.0 ± 0.1) × 104(3.5 ± 0.1) × 1041.75R35A thrombinAT(1.7 ± 0.4) × 104(1.1 ± 0.1) × 1040.65PCI(4.2 ± 0.1) × 105(2.6 ± 0.3) × 1066.2AT-PCIH-helix(2.7 ± 0.3) × 105(2.0 ± 0.1) × 1067.4E39Q thrombinAT(1.4 ± 0.1) × 104(1.5 ± 0.1) × 1041.1PCI(8.1 ± 0.8) × 104(1.3 ± 0.1) × 10616.0AT-PCIH-helix(7.1 ± 0.5) × 104(4.7 ± 0.2) × 1056.6 Open table in a new tab Based on the structural data (17Fuentes-Prior P.

To determine whether the interaction of same acidic residues of TM4 are also responsible for the cofactor-mediated enhancement in the reactivity of thrombin with PCI and the AT-PCIH-helix mutant, k 2 values for thrombin inhibition by both serpins were determined in the presence of saturating concentrations of TM456 mutants (500 nm) in which charges of the basic and acidic residues of TM4 have been reversed by recombinant DNA methods (20Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with the hypothesis that the basic residues of the H-helix of PCI and the AT mutant interact with the acidic residues of TM4 in the complex, the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin in complex with the acidic → basic charge reversal mutants of TM456 was impaired (Fig. 3A). As expected, the k 2 values for the PCI inhibition of thrombin in complex with the same TM456 derivatives were also mirror images of the values obtained for the AT-PCIH-helix mutant (Fig. 3B). In this case, however, the reactivity of PCI with thrombin in complex with the Arg385 → Glu mutant of TM456 was improved ∼2-fold. The observation that the reactivities of both PCI and AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin in complex with the E357K mutant of TM456 were the most impaired suggests that this residue makes the greatest contribution to the binding energy of the interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the H-helix of PCI interacts with TM4 of the thrombin-TM456 complex. Previous studies have indicated that the amino acid residues of the 39-loop are critical for determining the P′-binding specificity of serine proteases (28Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 779-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This loop of thrombin has two basic (Arg35 and Lys36) and one acidic residue (Glu39). Lys36 is one of the exosite-1 residues of thrombin which interacts with TM; however, Arg35 makes ionic interactions with Glu39, and it extends toward the active site pocket of thrombin (31Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Because PCI has an Arg at the P3′ position of the reactive site loop, we examined the reactivity of Arg35 → Ala (R35A) and Glu39 → Gln (E39Q) mutants of thrombin with the mutant and wild type serpins in the absence and presence of TM456. In the presence of TM456, first the optimal concentrations of TM456 in the inactivation reactions were determined for mutant thrombins. TM456 accelerated the inactivation of both wild type and E39Q thrombins by both AT-PCIH-helix and PCI with an identical apparent dissociation constant of ∼5 nm (Fig. 4, shown for AT-PCIH-helix only). This value, however, was increased to ∼15 nm for R35A thrombin. This result is consistent with the literature (27Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was interesting to discover that the reactivity of the R35A thrombin with AT, PCI, and AT-PCIH-helix in the absence of TM456 was improved ∼2-, 13-, and 4-fold, respectively. Similar to the reaction of thrombin with wild type AT, TM456 (250 nm) slightly impaired the reactivity of R35A thrombin with the serpin (Table I). However, unlike differences in the rate-accelerating effect of TM456 on the reaction of thrombin with PCI and AT-PCIH-helix, the cofactor promoted the rate of R35A thrombin with both serpins to a similar extent (6–7-fold, Table I). The reactivity of E39Q thrombin with both AT and PCI was also improved ∼2-fold in the absence but not in the presence of TM456 (Table I). However, no significant change in the reactivity of E39Q thrombin with AT-PCIH-helix was observed in either the absence or presence of the cofactor (Table I). The results of this study suggest that differences in the sequences of H-helices between PCI and AT (Fig. 1) are primarily responsible for their differential reactivity with thrombin in both the absence and presence of TM. This is evidenced by the observation that PCI and AT-PCIH-helix inhibited thrombin at approximately the same rate in both the absence and presence of TM456 (Table I). Thus, the interaction of basic residues of the H-helix of PCI with the acidic residues of TM4 in the ternary thrombin-TM-PCI complex appears to be responsible for the improved reactivity of the protease with the serpin. However, unlike an ∼40-fold TM-mediated enhancement in the reactivity of PCI with thrombin, there was an ∼10-fold enhancement in the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin in the presence of TM456 (Table I). This may partly be because of the observation that the reactivity of the AT-PCIH-helix mutant with thrombin was significantly improved independent of TM. Two questions must be addressed here. First, what is the molecular basis for the enhanced reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin in the absence of the cofactor? Second, if TM functions by providing a binding site for the serpin in the complex, why did it not then enhance the reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin to a similar extent? At least two possibilities may account for the TM-independent improvement in the reactivity of thrombin with AT-PCIH-helix. First, because the reactive site loop of AT is trapped in a partially loop-inserted inactive conformation (33Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), one possibility is that the substitution of the H-helix of AT with the H-helix of PCI has resulted in the activation of the mutant serpin, thereby improving its reactivity with thrombin. To test this possibility, k 2 values for the AT-PCIH-helix inhibition of factor Xa were determined in both the absence and presence of a distinct pentasaccharide fragment of heparin which is known to bind and activate AT, thereby improving the reactivity of the serpin with factor Xa 200–300-fold (34Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that both wild type AT and AT-PCIH-helix inhibited factor Xa with identical k 2 values in both the absence (2.7 × 103m–1 s–1) and presence of the pentasaccharide (8.2 × 105m–1 s–1), which suggested that the loop swapping did not lead to the activation of the serpin. The second possibility is that the acidic residues in the H-helix of AT are involved in repulsive interactions with an unknown site of thrombin and that the neutralization or the reversal of their charges eliminates the inhibitory interactions between the two proteins. The validity of this hypothesis cannot be determined at the present time. At least two possibilities may account for differences in the extent of the cofactor effect of TM in accelerating the protease inhibition reactions by two serpins. First, it is possible that the binding of TM to the H-helix of PCI is also associated with a conformational change in the reactive site loop of the serpin that is not realized in the reactive site loop of the AT-PCIH-helix mutant. A noticeable difference between the P3–P3′ residues of the reactive site loop of PCI (Thr-Phe-Arg-Ser-Ala-Arg) and AT (Ala-Gly-Arg-Ser-Leu-Asn) is the occurrence of a favorable Arg at the P3′ position of PCI. It is known that Glu39 of thrombin is critical for determining the P3′-binding specificity of thrombin. Nevertheless, previous PCI reactive site loop mutagenesis studies have indicated that the substitution of the P3′-Arg of PCI with an Ala or an Asp minimally alters the reactivity of mutant serpins with thrombin (23Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Subsequent molecular modeling of the thrombin-PCI interaction has revealed that the P3′-Arg may not interact with Glu39 of thrombin, because it is directed toward the body of PCI (23Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that the interaction of the H-helix with TM in PCI alters the conformation of the P3′-Arg of the serpin, thereby improving its reactivity with thrombin. However, a similar wild type reactivity of E39Q thrombin with PCI in the presence of TM456 (1.3 × 106m–1 s–1) did not support this hypothesis. It should be noted that the P2 residues also play an important role in determining the serpin specificity of thrombin and other coagulation proteases (35Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7437-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Djie M Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C.R. Hipler K. Stone S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thrombin prefers a Pro at the P2 position, and thus the P2 residues of both serpins are non-optimal for interaction with thrombin. It appears, therefore, that the apparent differences in the sequence of the reactive site loops of two serpins do not significantly contribute to their differential reactivity with thrombin. This may not be surprising because an important reactive site loop structural feature that is critical for the reaction with thrombin has been conserved in both serpins. The reactive site loop of both serpins has an insertion of three residues (Arg-Val-Thr in AT and Ser-Gln-Arg in PCI (21Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar)). We previously showed that whereas a longer reactive site loop is inhibitory for the AT interaction with factor Xa, it is required for the optimal reaction of the serpin with thrombin (37Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1235-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in the H-helices of two serpins appear to be primarily responsible for their differential reactivity with thrombin in both the absence and presence of TM. The alternative possibility is that TM induces conformational changes in the substrate-binding pocket of thrombin, thereby differentially influencing the reactivity of the protease with the two serpins. One of the surface loops in thrombin that may be the target for an allosteric modulation by TM is Arg35 on the 35–39-loop. Structural and mutagenesis data suggest that the guanidyl group of Arg35 contacts Glu39 and points toward the active site pocket of thrombin (31Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), which can potentially impede the access of the active site pocket of thrombin by PCI and other target macromolecules. To test the possibility that the TM modulation of the 35–39-loop of thrombin accounts for the differences in the cofactor activity of TM, the reactivity of PCI and AT-PCIH-helix was examined with R35A thrombin in both the absence and presence of TM456. Interestingly, it was discovered that the reactivity of PCI with R35A thrombin was improved ∼13-fold independent of TM (Table I). The reactivity of AT-PCIH-helix with the mutant thrombin was improved ∼4-fold under the same conditions. Moreover, instead of a 2-fold higher reactivity for AT-PCIH-helix with thrombin, there was a 2-fold higher reactivity for PCI with R35A thrombin in the absence of TM. Thus, R35A thrombin reacted with both PCI and AT-PCIH-helix with similar k 2 values in the presence of TM (Table I). These results suggest that TM allosterically modulates the 35–39-loop of thrombin. Thus, the difference in the extent of the cofactor effect of TM with the two serpins is because of the difference in the extent of the cofactor effect of TM on thrombin through an allosteric mechanism. In summary, in this study we demonstrated that the H-helix of PCI interacts with TM4 of the thrombin-TM456 complex. This interaction appears to account for an order of magnitude improvement in the reactivity of the serpin with the anticoagulant thrombin. A TM-mediated conformational change in the 35–39-loop of thrombin appears to lead to another order of magnitude enhancement in the reactivity of PCI with thrombin. Thus, TM accelerates the PCI inhibition of thrombin by both modulation of the extended binding pocket of thrombin and by a “substrate presentation” mechanism. Both mechanisms appear to make equal contributions to the acceleration of thrombin inhibition by the serpin. TM also enhances protein C activation by thrombin by similar mechanisms. Thus, these may be common mechanisms by which cofactors modulate the inhibitor and substrate specificity of coagulation proteases. We thank Audrey Rezaie for proofreading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2071194189,"Vibrio cholerae hemolysin (HlyA) is a pore-forming toxin that exists in two stable forms: a hemolytically active water-soluble monomer with a native molecular weight of 65,000 and a hemolytically inactive SDS-stable heptamer with the configuration of a transmembrane diffusion channel. Transformation of the monomer into the oligomer is spontaneous but very slow in the absence of interaction with specific membrane components like cholesterol and sphingolipids. In this report, we show that mild disruption of the native tertiary structure of HlyA by 1.75 m urea triggered rapid and quantitative conversion of the monomer to an oligomer. Furthermore, the HlyA monomer when unfolded in 8 m urea refolded and reconstituted on renaturation into the oligomer biochemically and functionally similar to the heptamer formed in target lipid bilayer, suggesting that the HlyA polypeptide had a strong propensity to adopt the oligomer as the stable native state in preference to the monomer. On the basis of our results, we propose that (a) the hemolytically active HlyA monomer represents a quasi-stable conformation corresponding to a local free energy minimum and the transmembrane heptameric pore represents a stable conformation corresponding to an absolute free energy minimum and (b) any perturbation of the native tertiary structure of the HlyA monomer causing relaxation of conformational constraints tends to promote self-assembly to the oligomer with membrane components playing at most an accessory role.

Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These proteins are commonly known as pore-forming toxins (PFTs) (6Wilson M. McNab R. Henderson B. Bacterial Disease Mechanisms: An Introduction to Cellular Microbiology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2002: 466-513Google Scholar) for their ability to lyse target eucaryotic cells by punching holes in the plasma membrane and are released as water-soluble monomeric proteins by a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. PFTs interact with specific target membrane components and self-assemble by noncovalent interactions involving oligomerization domains into exceptionally stable and rigid β-barrel oligomers that eventually insert into the membrane by using amphiphilic β-hairpins as anchors to the nonpolar core of the lipid bilayer (5Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Montoya M. Gouaux E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). High resolution structural data are available for only two of the PFTs, viz. Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (8Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) and aerolysin of Aeromonas hydrophila (9Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K.V. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the mode of action of PFTs is inadequate in at least two aspects: the driving force for self-assembly of the toxin monomer and the precise role of membrane components in triggering this transition. HlyA is synthesized as an 82-kDa preprohemolysin by V. cholerae El Tor O1 and non-O1 strains and exported to the culture medium as the 79-kDa prohemolysin (proHlyA) (10Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Nakata A. Iwanaga M. Honda T. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4106-4116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic removal of the 132-residue N-terminal stretch (Pro-region) generates the mature 65-kDa HlyA with a specific hemolytic activity of approximate 100 pm toward rabbit erythrocytes (11Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Naka A. Matsuyama J. Miwatani T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4655-4658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HlyA transforms itself in contact with target biomembranes and synthetic lipid vesicles containing cholesterol into water-filled transmembrane heptameric channels of internal diameter of 1.5 nm (3Zitzer A. Zitzer O. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Harris J.R. Bhakdi S. Meissner U. Scheffler D. Bittman R. Li G. Zitzer A. Palmer M. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, Harris et al. (4Harris J.R. Bhakdi S. Meissner U. Scheffler D. Bittman R. Li G. Zitzer A. Palmer M. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown by transmission electron micrographic study that HlyA interacts with cholesterol and forms oligomers at the interface of cholesterol microcrystals and water. Despite its apparent solubility in water, the HlyA monomer is strongly amphiphilic and partitions nonspecifically to lipid-water interface (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There is considerable disruption in the tertiary structure of the HlyA monomer in the lipid-water interface (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), caused apparently by low solvent polarity (13Bychkova V.E. Ptitsyn O.B. Chemtracts Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 4: 133-163Google Scholar) and moderately by acid pH (14Van der Goot F.G. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the unfolding of HlyA plays any role in the reconstitution of the monomer into an oligomer. Significantly, we observed slow conversion of the HlyA monomer to the oligomer in water even in complete absence of membrane components, suggesting that self-assembly is basically a spontaneous event guided by the greater thermodynamic stability of the oligomer (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to its pore-forming activity, HlyA binds specifically to β1-galactosyl-terminated complex glycoconjugates (15Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) through a C-terminal region related to the sugar-binding domain of the plant lectin ricin (16Olson R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that perturbation of the tertiary structure of HlyA was sufficient to induce complete and rapid conversion to the oligomer. Our data suggest that the oligomer might be the unique final structure to which the HlyA polypeptide is committed with the apparently stable monomer representing a conformation corresponding to a local free energy minimum or trap. To strengthen our hypothesis that self-assembly of HlyA is driven by a search for stability, we needed to demonstrate that a protein closely similar to HlyA in amino acid sequence and tertiary structure but lacking oligomerization activity tends to switch over to an oligomeric state in suitable conditions. We show that proHlyA is such a protein, and by including it in the present study, we evaluate the contributions of the oligomerization domain and global conformational characteristics of the monomer toward self-assembly. Protein Purification, Assay of Hemolytic Activity, Preparation of Lipid Vesicles, and Binding to Glycoconjugates—Purification of both HlyA and proHlyA was based on their high affinity binding to the hydrophobic matrix, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), and elution of the bound toxins by a linear 0–80% ethylene glycol gradient (15Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HlyA was isolated from the culture supernatant of a non-O1 V. cholerae strain V2 grown for 6 h at 37 °C with shaking in Brain Heart Infusion (BD Biosciences) broth. ProHlyA was isolated by following exactly the same procedure with care being taken to avoid proteolytic maturation of the protoxin to HlyA by including in the culture medium and buffer 1 mm EGTA. The HlyA oligomer was prepared by keeping purified HlyA in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 3 mm sodium azide, pH 7.2 (Buffer A), for approximately 30 days at 4 °C followed by separation of the oligomer from the monomer by size-exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel A-0.5m (50 × 2.5 cm). ProHlyA and the HlyA oligomer were stable indefinitely in aqueous suspension at 4 °C; however, the HlyA monomer was stored in 50% ethylene glycol to prevent slow conversion to the oligomer (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the modified Folin-Cio-calteu method by using bovine serum albumin as a standard (17Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Beilur L.L. Tolbert N.E Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Because the HlyA oligomer preserved its structural integrity in SDS at 60 °C (15Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the HlyA monomer, proHlyA, and the HlyA oligomer were treated with 1% SDS at 50 °C for 15 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) to check homogeneity and also to monitor conversion of the monomeric toxin to the oligomer. Hemolysis was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the release of hemoglobin at 541 nm, and the specific activity was defined as the protein concentration causing 50% lysis of a 1% (v/v) suspension of rabbit erythrocytes in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.20 (phosphate-buffered saline). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared with pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Sigma) or a mixture of 50% PC and 50% cholesterol (Sigma) by sonication of an aqueous suspension of lipid followed by size-exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B (19Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2150-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of proHlyA and HlyA with asialofetuin, a glycoprotein with multiple terminal β1-galactosyl moieties, was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere (15Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Spectrofluorimetric Study—Fluorescence measurements were made at 25 °C with Hitachi 4500 spectrofluorimeter (Tokyo, Japan). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded by exciting the sample at 295 nm. For monitoring the unfolding of the proteins in urea or guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), samples were incubated in various concentrations of the denaturant for >14 h at 25 °C to ensure equilibration. To monitor exposure of tryptophan to water with increasing urea concentration, fluorescence data were expressed as the ratio of the emission intensity at 350 nm to that at 320 nm (I350/I320) with the wavelengths corresponding to the fluorescence emission maxima of free tryptophan in water and in hexane, respectively (20Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. OIRL Press, New York1997: 261-297Google Scholar). Insertion of the toxin in lipid bilayer was studied by monitoring kinetically the fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophan in the protein to dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) incorporated in PC-cholesterol vesicles. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 512 nm, respectively (19Ikigai H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2150-2165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physicochemical Analysis of proHlyA—In primary structure, proHlyA differs from the mature toxin in having a 15-kDa polypeptide appendage at the amino terminus and it is reasonable to expect some degree of resemblance in solution and biochemical properties between the two. During phase partitioning with Triton X-114 (21Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proHlyA was localized exclusively in the detergent-rich phase (data not shown), indicating that it was similar to HlyA in possessing a strongly amphipathic surface (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of proHlyA and HlyA overlapped completely (data not shown), indicating similar microenvironments for indolyl residues scattered throughout the length of the polypeptide chains (10Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Nakata A. Iwanaga M. Honda T. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4106-4116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a coincidence is strongly suggestive of a close similarity in global conformations for the two proteins. Incubation of proHlyA with PC and PC-cholesterol vesicles induced a massive change in the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of the protein that included a red shift in the emission wavelength maximum from 330 to 340 nm (Fig. 1). This indicates a strong interaction of the protoxin with lipid vesicles as well as its partial unfolding in the lipid-water interface, similar to that reported for HlyA (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast to HlyA, however, proHlyA failed to form SDS-stable oligomer in PC-cholesterol vesicles (Fig. 2, lane 2) and was not capable of inserting in the lipid bilayer as indicated by the absence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the protein to the dansyl moiety embedded in the core of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 3). Following trypsinization, proHlyA regained the ability to form SDS-stable oligomer (Fig. 2, lane 4) with an insertion-competent configuration (Fig. 3). ProHlyA did not bind to immobilized asialofetuin, indicating that the precursor toxin had no lectin-like affinity for specific sugars (data not shown). Although proHlyA failed to oligomerize in synthetic lipid vesicles, it was hemolytically active toward rabbit erythrocytes with a specific activity of 1.6 nm. This could be attributed to a partial conversion of proHlyA to HlyA by erythrocyte membrane proteases as seen in Western immunoblot (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) analysis of the protoxin incubated with rabbit erythrocytes (data not shown).Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of proHlyA to detect self-assembly in lipid vesicles.

Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we studied whether reconstitution of the toxin into a more stable structure could be promoted by releasing the polypeptide from the configurational constraints maintaining the native conformation by incubation in urea. The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the HlyA monomer in 0, 2, 3, 3.5, and 8 m urea are shown in Fig. 4A. Appreciable perturbation of the native tertiary structure was observed at urea concentrations of 3 m and above. However, in place of the expected shift in wavelength from 330 to 345 nm on complete unfolding (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), fluorescence intensity remained virtually constant in this wavelength region, suggesting that considerable heterogeneity in tryptophan environments persisted in 8 m urea. To have a better indication of unfolding, fluorescence emission data were plotted in terms of the ratio of the emission intensity at 350 to that at 320 nm (I350/I320), the increase of which correlates with exposure of tryptophan residues to water (Fig. 4B). There was a slow, almost linear increase in the ratio I350/I320 from 0.9 to 1.8 in the urea concentration range of 3–8 m with no indication of an all-or-none type of transition to a specific thermodynamic state like the molten globule or unfolded polypeptide (23Ptitsyn O.B. Bychkova V.E. Uversky V.N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1995; 348: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since the I350/I320 ratio approached a value of 1.8 in comparison to a value of 2.6 for free tryptophan in water (24Cantor C.R. Timasheff S.N. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 145-306Crossref Google Scholar), it seems that a significant fraction of indolyl residues remained shielded in apolar environment even in 8 m urea. Notably, the I350/I320 for the HlyA oligomer remained essentially unchanged at approximately 1.0 (Fig. 4B), indicating that the heptamer was too stable and rigid a structure to be disrupted by urea. To explain the persistence of ordered structure even in 8 m urea, we subjected the toxin monomer to transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis, a technique that allowed us to visualize species with altered conformations and constitutions (25Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the HlyA monomer self-assembled at ∼1.75 m urea and the conversion was essentially complete at ∼2.5 m urea (Fig. 5A), a condition that normally promotes dissociation of multimeric protein complexes. The HlyA monomer and oligomer had the same I350/I320 value (Fig. 4B), and oligomerization could be detected by its characteristic slow mobility in urea gel electrophoresis. Concomitant with the change in tryptophan fluorescence at approximately 3.5 m urea (Fig. 4B), an additional component with intermediate electrophoretic mobility appeared and increased in relative intensity with increasing urea concentration (Fig. 5A). By combining the electrophoretic and spectrofluorimetric data, we identified the new component as the unfolded polypeptide. Because the increase in I350/I320 ratio was contributed solely by the unfolded polypeptide, the values were weight averages of fluorescence emission contributions of tryptophan buried in the nonpolar core of the oligomer and those exposed to water in the fully unfolded polypeptide, allowing us to calculate the relative amount of the HlyA oligomer in the urea concentration range from 2.5 to 8 m (Fig. 4B, inset). It seems that limited unfolding of the HlyA monomer in the urea concentration range of 1.75 to 3 m triggered quantitative conversion to the oligomer. However, at higher urea concentrations, self-assembly of the toxin had to compete with complete unfolding but remained significant even in strongly dissociating condition at 8 m urea. The HlyA monomer, equilibrated with urea in the concentration range from 1.75 to 8 m, renatured upon removal of urea by dialysis to an SDS-stable (Fig. 6, lane 2) hemolytically inactive oligomer with strong carbohydrate-dependent hemagglutinating activity toward rabbit erythrocytes. The HlyA oligomers generated by prolonged exposure of the monomer to water, by limited unfolding in urea, and by contact with target lipid vesicles were indistinguishable in stoichiometry, stability in SDS (Fig. 6), affinity and specificity for sugars, action on target cells, and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum (data not shown).Fig. 6SDS-PAGE analysis of renatured HlyA and proHlyA. Proteins (200 μg/ml) were incubated in presence of 4 m urea in buffer A for 15 h at 25 °C, and then urea was removed by dialysis against buffer A at 25 °C. HlyA renatured as SDS-stable oligomer (lane 2), whereas proHlyA renatured to the native monomer (lane 1). HlyA oligomer formed in PC-cholesterol liposome was included for comparison (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If reconstitution of the HlyA monomer into the SDS-stable oligomer were motivated primarily by the gain in thermodynamic stability, the process should in principle be independent of the method used to perturb the native conformation of the toxin. To test this hypothesis, we monitored conformational and constitutional alteration in the HlyA monomer equilibrated with various concentrations of GdmCl, LiCl, and ethanol. The variation of I350/I320 with GdmCl concentration (Fig. 7A) resembled closely the corresponding curve (Fig. 4B) in urea. Because it was not possible to visualize oligomerization of HlyA in GdmCl by electrophoresis, we quantified self-assembly of the toxin to the heptamer (Fig. 7B) by disappearance of hemolytic activity and also by SDS-PAGE of the mixture following removal of the denaturant by dialysis. It is seen that 0.75 m GdmCl triggered quantitative conversion of the monomer to the oligomer with increasing denaturant concentrations favoring complete unfolding. However, 5 m LiCl and 20% ethanol unfolded HlyA without inducing significant oligomerization at these or lower concentrations of the denaturants (data not shown). These data suggest that although HlyA with a disrupted tertiary structure never renatured to the hemolytically active monomer, the conditions for reconstitution into the heptamer were somewhat stringent. Unfolding and Oligomerization of proHlyA—We examined next how far self-assembly of PFTs was motivated by interactions involving oligomerization domains and global conformational characteristics of the toxin monomer. To do this, we repeated the urea-unfolding experiment described above for HlyA with proHlyA, the HlyA precursor that was incapable of self-assembly but resembled the mature toxin in amphipathicity and conformation. Perturbation of the native tertiary structure by urea at a concentration as low as 1 m induced complete conversion of the monomer to the oligomer (Fig. 5B), suggesting that proHlyA was intrinsically as prone to undergo self-assembly as the mature toxin. As evident from the transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5B) and implied in the rapid increase of I350/I320 with increasing urea concentration (Fig. 4B), the efficiency of protoxin self-assembly decreased rapidly with increasing urea concentration and was effectively zero at 8 m urea, suggesting that the oligomerization domain of proHlyA existed in an active conformation in a relatively narrow range of urea concentration, reverting to the dormant or unfolded configuration at lower or higher urea concentrations, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that the tendency to self-assemble was intrinsic and dictated primarily by global conformational characteristics of the protein with the oligomerization domain playing a key role in attainment of the stable quaternary structure. In this communication, we show that a relatively mild disruption of the native HlyA tertiary structure by urea at a concentration as low as 1.75 m triggered conversion of the toxin monomer to a species that was biochemically and functionally similar to the oligomer generated in lipid vesicles. Self-assembly of the HlyA monomer was quantitative and irreversible and faster by several orders of magnitude than spontaneous oligomerization of the toxin observed in water. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the reconstitution of a PFT monomer into an oligomer without assistance of any of the biophysical or biochemical attributes of a membrane lipid bilayer. Delinking of oligomerization of the HlyA monomer from interaction of the toxin with cell surface molecules might provide us with new insights into the mechanism of transformation of this intriguing class of proteins from one native state to another. Exceptional stability and rigidity of oligomeric pores created by PFTs in target membrane (26Lesieur C. Frutiger S. Hughes G. Kellner R. Pattus F. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36722-36728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), together with our observation that the purified HlyA monomer converted irreversibly to the oligomer when kept in water for days (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), led us to speculate whether the oligomer was the most stable configuration for the HlyA polypeptide with the monomer representing an alternative arrangement that corresponded to a local free energy minimum or trap and was stable enough to survive for a sufficient length of time. If this is so, a mild perturbation of the native HlyA structure might enable the protein to scale the energy barrier separating the two minima by relaxing the conformational constraints that contribute to the height of the barrier and thereby trigger its reconstitution into the energetically more favorable heptameric state. To test this hypothesis, we incubated HlyA with urea and observed a dramatic transition to the oligomer at approximately 1.75 m urea (Fig. 5A). A relatively mild disruption in tertiary structure caused by urea in the concentration range from 1.75 to 3 m was enough and indeed most effective in inducing oligomerization of HlyA. The tendency of HlyA to refold and reconstitute into the oligomer was so great that the monomer converted to roughly a 50:50 mixture of the oligomer and the unfolded polypeptide even in 8 m urea, a condition that strongly promotes unfolding of proteins to random coil configuration and dissociation of protein complexes. Because GdmCl unfolds protein more efficiently than urea, it is no surprise that the above observations were reproduced at substantially lower concentrations of the denaturant (Fig. 7, A and B). These data, together with the fact that renaturation of the unfolded polypeptide led to its recovery exclusively as the SDS-stable oligomer, established that HlyA could fold and reconstitute autonomously into the oligomer without assistance of any protein, lipid, or carbohydrate component of the target membrane. The irreversible denaturation of HlyA induced by ethanol and LiCl with absence of oligomerization might be attributed to several factors. Although it did not contradict the view that the native monomer was not the energetically favored conformation, it suggested that self-assembly of the toxin as distinct from nonstoichiometric association of partially or completely unfolded polypeptides depended on persistence of critical elements of tertiary structure of the native HlyA in the denaturant-induced disrupted state of the toxin and therefore on the mode of denaturation. This is plausible because the HlyA monomer and oligomer had similar global conformations (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and also is supported by our data that the efficiency of self-assembly relative to complete unfolding was reduced in high concentrations of urea and GdmCl. It is also possible that polarity and ionic strength of the medium affected efficiency of oligomerization for integrity of the heptameric assembly depended ultimately on the strength of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between protomers. We next evaluate how far the preceding observations were pertinent to the self-assembly of HlyA in water or at the target cell surface. Although renaturation of urea-unfolded HlyA to SDS-stable β1-galactosyl-specific hemagglutinating oligomer did not reflect nonspecific aggregation of random coil polypeptides, it is not clear whether refolding and self-assembly in urea followed a pathway essentially similar to that involved in oligomerization of the toxin in water or lipid-water interface. There are no data in this work that provide a categorical answer to this question. However, the striking difference in stability of the urea-induced HlyA and proHlyA oligomer in high concentrations of urea as well as water suggested that the oligomerization domain played a key role in self-assembly of HlyA in urea. Because the oligomerization domain plays a critical role in functional interaction of a PFT with the target membrane (5Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the pathways of urea and lipid-induced oligomerization might differ in details but converge at key points. In connection with the differential behavior of urea-unfolded HlyA and proHlyA in renaturation experiments, it is worth recalling the previous observations of Nagamune et al. (27Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Honda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1338-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They reported that GdmCl-unfolded proHlyA renatured to the native state but HlyA failed to regain hemolytic activity in a similar experiment. We note that there is no contradiction between these early findings and the present data and interpret the failure of unfolded HlyA to renature as a reflection of the fact that the hemolytically active conformation did not represent the minimum energy configuration. On the other hand, proHlyA renatured successfully because the minimum energy arrangement was inaccessible by blockage of oligomerization domain in the native state. Previous work on the mechanism of membrane permeabilization by HlyA established a critical role for cholesterol and related sterols in triggering oligomerization of the toxin at the target membrane surface (4Harris J.R. Bhakdi S. Meissner U. Scheffler D. Bittman R. Li G. Zitzer A. Palmer M. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Is the role of cholesterol compatible with the present data, suggesting that a relatively mild disruption in tertiary structure might be instrumental in inducing irreversible self-assembly? Because the precise nature and magnitude of conformational changes in HlyA in response to various perturbants were not defined, it is difficult to speculate a straightforward answer. A corollary of the proposition that self-assembly of HlyA was driven by the tendency of the system to attain a minimum energy configuration is that the process was intrinsically spontaneous and would be promoted by any factor that reduced the height of the barrier separating the relative and absolute energy minima. Therefore, it is not unlikely that there might exist several pathways of promoting oligomerization of HlyA, all of which might not be relevant to the process taking place at the membrane surface. There is indeed considerable disruption in the native HlyA structure in the lipid-water interface, although the conformational change seems to be inadequate to trigger by itself its rapid reconstitution into the oligomer as indicated by slow oligomerization observed in phospholipid vesicles devoid of cholesterol (12Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Specific affinity of the toxin for cholesterol would cause sequestration of the protein at the lipid-water interface, and the massive increase in local concentration would augment the kinetics and equilibrium of oligomerization of the partially unfolded HlyA by several orders of magnitude. Extension of the present study to other PFTs, preferably those with known three-dimensional structures, would enable us to explore whether transition of the hydrophilic monomer to a transmembrane oligomeric pore is basically guided by the propensity of the protein to adopt the most stable configuration with the membrane components playing at most a secondary role.

Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors are relatively well understood. Positively regulated genes contain thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), which preferentially bind heterodimers of TR with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In these elements the receptors act as repressors in the absence of ligand and as ligand-dependent activators upon binding of thyroid hormone (T3). This is based on an exchange of corepressor complexes for coactivator complexes in response to the ligand (2McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coactivator recruitment depends on a highly conserved motif in the C-terminal α-helix of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), referred to as AF2 (4Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This helix extends away from the LBD in the unliganded receptor but upon ligand is tightly packed against the body of the LBD, creating together with residues located in helices 3, 5, and 6 a surface that facilitates coactivator interactions (5Moras D.

In addition, other complexes appear to act more directly on the transcriptional apparatus, suggesting that activation of gene expression by the receptors involves both chromatin modifications and direct recruitment of basal transcription factors to the regulated promoter (2McKenna N.J.

Transcriptional silencing by corepressor complexes also involves changes in histone acetylation. The corepressors SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) (9Chen J.D.

Recruitment of deacetylases is believed to cause chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression. In addition to stimulate transcription, TRs can also repress gene expression in a ligand-dependent manner. In some instances, this repressive effect is secondary to transcriptional antagonism with other transduction pathways or transcription factors (16Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R.

A rather common finding is that on nTREs the unoccupied receptor increases transcription and the ligand reverses this stimulation (18Bigler J. Eisenman R.N.

Yang W.M. Seto E. Yen P.M. Howard B.H. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Repression of gene expression by nuclear receptors can also occur due to competition for DNA sites with other transactivators. Particularly, several examples of repression of gene activity by competitive binding at the TATA box have been described previously (24Meyer T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Starr D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30709-30714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Meyer T. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J.

J. 1996; 318: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In these cases, the overlap or close location of binding sites for the receptors and the TATA box suggests that repression results from competition between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the receptors. This could lead to the inhibition of formation of a functional preinitiation complex (PIC) by displacement of transcription factor IID (TFIID) from the TATA box. In contrast, TRs can directly interact with TBP (27Fondell J.D. Brunel F. Hisatake K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in transient transfection assays ligand-dependent transactivation of simple promoters consisting of a hormone response element and a TATA box by other nuclear receptors can be enhanced in response to over-expression of TBP (28Berkenstam A. Ruiz M.M. Barettino D. Horikoshi M. Stunnenberg H.G. Cell. 1992; 69: 401-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Sadovsky Y. Webb P. Lopez G. Baxter J.D. Fitzpatrick P.M. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Cavailles V. Parker M.G. Kushner P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat growth hormone (GH) gene transcription is strongly stimulated by T3 in pituitary cells. The GH promoter contains a positive TRE located at –167 to –190 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which appears to mediate the stimulation by T3 and retinoic acid (30Glass C.K. Franco R. Weinberger C. Albert V.R. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 329: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Bedo G. Santisteban P. Aranda A. Nature. 1989; 339: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition to the stimulation of GH promoter constructs containing the positive hormone response elements, T3 inhibits the activity of constructs containing only the proximal GH promoter sequences (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The unliganded TR causes a strong activation of the core GH promoter, which is reversed after ligand addition, and this inhibitory effect of T3 appears to be mediated by a nTRE adjacent to the TATA box (33Crone D.E. Kim H.S. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This nTRE could play a role in repressing GH promoter activity in non-pituitary cells. In the present study we show by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that the nTRE is responsible for binding of TR to the GH promoter in non-pituitary cells, whereas the distal element is dispensable. Unliganded TR binds to the promoter and causes transactivation, and T3 releases the receptor from the promoter and represses activation. In addition, occupancy by TR causes an increase of binding of acetylated histone H3, and the release of receptor from the GH promoter upon ligand binding is concomitant with a reduction on the levels of acetylated histone bound. These results demonstrate the important role of histone acetylation on regulation of the core GH promoter by TR. Despite the location of the nTRE overlapping the TATA box, TR does not exclude binding of TBP. Furthermore, TBP strongly potentiates ligand-independent activation of the GH promoter by TR in transient transfection assays. The synergistic effect of TBP with the receptors does not require the AF2 domain. In contrast, mutants with reduced ability to bind corepressors do not display constitutive activity and do not cooperate with TBP, suggesting the involvement of corepressors on ligand-independent activation. Plasmids—The constructs –39GH-CAT, –145GH-CAT, and –530GH-CAT containing 5′-flanking sequence of the rat GH promoter cloned into the polylinker region of the pUC8 vector in which an AP-1 site has been deleted, and TATA-CAT containing a consensus TATA box in the same vector have been described previously (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). –530mutGH-CAT was generated with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the oligonucleotide 5′-GGAAAACCGGTTGGGTATAAAACGGGTATGCAAGGG-3′. This mutation removes the proximal nTRE located between nucleotides –34 and –18. Expression vectors for TRα and TRβ contain the cDNA sequences of α chick TR and the β isoform of human TRβ, respectively. Chimeras between v-erbA and TRα, as well expression vectors for the mutants chick TRα E401Q, E401K, and K232I were described previously (4Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the AHT receptor 3 residues in helix 1 of the LBD of TRβ have been mutated (10Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and CAT Assays—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with calcium phosphate with 5 μg of the reporter plasmid as described previously (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of the TBP vector and/or 1.5 μg of TR or the TR mutants. The amounts of other expression vectors used are shown in the legends to the corresponding figures. The total amount of DNA from each transfection was kept equal by the addition of the corresponding empty expression vectors. Treatments with 100 nm T3 were administered in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% AG1 × 8 resin-charcoal stripped newborn calf serum. After 48 h, CAT activity was determined and quantified. Each experiment was performed with triplicate cultures and was repeated at least twice with similar relative differences in regulated expression. The data are expressed relative to the CAT values obtained in control untreated cells and represent mean ± S.D. values. Mobility Shift Assays—Gel retardation assays were carried out with highly purified preparations of TR/RXR obtained from vaccinia infection of HeLa cells, and with recombinant TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (34Kretzschmar M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3927-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As probes we used an oligonucleotide corresponding to –39/+12 bp of the rat GH promoter (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide 5′-GTGACGACTTATAAAACCCCAGGG-3′ containing the consensus TATA box of the Hsp70 gene. Mobility assay conditions were optimized for simultaneous binding of the receptors and TBP. For this purpose the poly(dI-dC) was replaced by poly(dG-dC), and 10 mm MgCl2 was used in the binding buffer. For the binding assays the purified proteins were incubated on ice for 15 min in a buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.4, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol) containing 500 ng poly(dG·dC) and then for 20–30 min at room temperature with ∼30,000 cpm double-stranded oligonucleotide end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. DNA·protein complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Protein-Protein Interactions—Wild type and mutants TRα cloned in pSG5 were used for in vitro transcription and translation following the manufacturer's recommendations of the TNT7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Reactions were performed in the presence of 40 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). TBP and TBP deletions mutants fused to GST (35Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) were expressed in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3). They were grown at 37 °C in LB until the absorbance reached 0.6. Then the induction was performed at 30 °C for 2h with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST and GST fusion proteins were purified by standard techniques following the recommendations of Pharmacia. The expression of correctly sized proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. GST pull-down assays were performed with 5 μl of the in vitro translated l-[35S]methionine-labeled receptors as described previously (36Palomino T. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Peña P. Aranda A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These proteins were incubated with 1 μg of the GST fusion protein, or with the same amount of GST as a control, immobilized in glutathione-Sepharose beads. The reaction with the beads was performed for 1 h at 4 °C in a binding buffer containing 25 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.9, 1% glycerol, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Free proteins were washed from the beads with a buffer containing increasing concentrations (100, 200, and 500 mm) of KCl, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmids –530GH-CAT, –530mutGH-CAT, or –145GH-CAT, and expression vectors for TRα (1.5 μg) and/or TPB (0.5 μg) as indicated in the corresponding figures. ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously (17Méndez-Pertuz M. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Aranda A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3102-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against TRα (FL-408, Santa Cruz), TBP (SC-273, Santa Cruz), or acetylated histone H3 (C#06–599, Upstate Biotechnology) (1 μg/sample). An equivalent amount of anti-GFP antibody (SC-8334) was used as a negative control. The precipitated DNA was quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR Green. A 230-bp fragment of the rat GH gene was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGAAAATCTCG-3′. PCR signals were always corrected for the PCR signal obtained with the total DNA IP input. Expression of the receptor or TBP did not alter results obtained with the negative control GFP antibody. The ratio obtained with the corresponding antibody in untreated cells was arbitrarily set as 1. Binding to the nTRE Is Required for Regulation of GH Promoter Activity by TR—In non-pituitary HeLa cells, which express low TR levels, treatment with T3 did not affect the activity of a reporter plasmid containing the fragment –530 to +8of the GH promoter. However, and in agreement with our previous observations (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), when this plasmid was transfected along with an expression vector for TRα, a ligand-independent stimulation of transcription, which was reversed by T3, was observed (Fig. 1A). To analyze the contribution of the positive TRE located at –167/–190 and the nTRE that overlaps the TATA box to this regulation, a plasmid in which the proximal element was mutated was also used. Interestingly, TR stimulated only weakly activity of the mutated promoter, suggesting that the proximal element is mostly responsible for the observed regulation. This was confirmed with the construct –145GH-CAT, which contains only the nTRE, which was induced by the unliganded receptor and repressed by T3 to a similar extent as the plasmid containing both DNA elements. To analyze whether binding to DNA was required for activation of the minimal GH promoter, the influence of a TRα mutant in a cysteine of the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain was also analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, whereas the unliganded wild type receptor significantly increased basal promoter activity, the mutant receptor C51G that does not bind DNA was unable to increase CAT activity. As a consequence, a ligand-dependent repression was not observed either. These results indicate that binding of the receptor to the nTRE is necessary for ligand-independent stimulation, as well as for negative regulation by T3. In Vivo Binding of TR to the GH Promoter—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-TRα antibody were performed in HeLa cells transfected with different GH promoter plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2, upon expression of TRα, a significant binding to the construct that contains both TREs was found. Promoter occupancy by the receptor paralleled transcriptional activity and, accordingly, TRα binding to the promoter was reversed by T3. In addition, no binding of the receptor to the promoter fragment in which the nTRE has been mutated was observed. This is also in agreement with the transactivation data shown in Fig. 1A and suggests again that the nTRE is responsible for receptor binding and regulation of GH promoter activity in non-pituitary cells. This was confirmed by the finding that TRα bound strongly to the minimal GH promoter that contains only the nTRE. Again, promoter occupancy was observed only with the unliganded receptor, and T3 inhibited binding. Unliganded TRα Causes Recruitment of Acetylated Histone H3 to the Minimal GH Promoter—It has been proposed that ligand-independent transcriptional stimulation by TR is associated with increased histone acetylation (22Tagami T. Park Y. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that ligand-induced recruitment of a HDAC is involved in negative regulation by T3 (23Sasaki S. Lesoon-Wood L.A. Dey A. Kuwata T. Weintraub B.D. Humphrey G. Yang W.M. Seto E. Yen P.M. Howard B.H. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of histone acetylation on TR-mediated regulation of the minimal GH promoter, the cells were incubated in the presence of inhibitors of HDACs or transfected with an expression vector for HDAC1. Incubation with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) at a 25 nm concentration did not alter basal activity but, as shown in Fig. 3A, increased significantly the promoter response to unliganded TRα. Incubation with a 200 nm concentration of TSA resulted in basal promoter stimulation and also in a significantly reduced response to T3 (Fig. 3A). Although this difference is better observed at this high concentration of TSA, T3-dependent repression was also partially inhibited with 25 nm TSA. Similar results were obtained with butyrate, another deacetylase inhibitor (data not shown). In addition, expression of HDAC1 decreased strongly stimulation by the unoccupied receptor, and consequently also reduced T3-dependent repression (Fig. 3B). This effect appears to be specific, because expression of the deacetylase did not affect basal promoter activity. These results strongly suggest that histone acetylation is involved in stimulation of transcription by the unliganded receptor and inhibition by T3. To directly analyze in vivo binding of acetylated histones to the minimal GH promoter, ChIP assays were performed with an antibody recognizing acetylated histone H3. As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of TRα caused a significant increase in the amount of acetylated histone H3 bound to the promoter, which was strongly inhibited in the presence of T3. This inhibition was rapid, and acetylated H3 was already reduced after 30 min of incubation with T3, and was maximal after 4 h. Binding of acetylated histone H3 paralleled promoter occupancy by the receptor. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4B, TRα was released from the promoter with the same kinetics after incubation with T3. Binding of TR and TBP to the Proximal GH Promoter— Because the nTRE overlaps the TATA box, we were interested in investigating whether the receptors affect binding of TBP to the GH promoter. For this purpose, binding of recombinant TBP in the presence and absence of purified receptors to a probe spanning nucleotides –39/+1 of the GH gene was analyzed by gel retardation assays. The nTRE is located between nucleotides –34 and –18, and we have shown that this element binds preferentially TR/RXR heterodimers (19Palomino T. Barettino D. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5A, both the receptor heterodimer and TBP bound independently to this promoter causing the appearance of retarded complexes. In addition, when TR/RXR and TBP were mixed, the formation of a new complex with a slower mobility was observed (lane 5). Binding was slightly decreased in the presence of T3 (lane 6). The presence of TBP and the receptors in this complex was analyzed by competition with specific binding sites and by incubation with antibodies against both components (data not shown). The super-retarded complex, whose abundance increased as the concentration of the heterodimer in the assay augmented (lanes 8-10), was not formed when a consensus TATA box corresponding to the human Hsp70 gene was used (lanes 12 and 13). The affinity of the protein-DNA complexes was assessed by off-rate experiments challenging the performed complexes with an excess of the unlabeled GH promoter fragment. As shown in Fig. 5B, binding of the receptor heterodimer was rather stable, with a significant binding being still observed after 30 min of incubation with the oligonucleotide. In addition, the slow mobility complex formed in the presence of TBP was inhibited with the same kinetics as TR/RXR alone, showing that the interaction with TBP does not alter the apparent affinity of binding of these factors to the promoter. Together, these results suggest that binding of receptor heterodimers to the nTRE does not exclude binding of TBP to the overlapping T"

The inward whole-cell current attributable to rENaC activity ran down when these cells were dialyzed with an ATP-free pipette solution in the conventional whole-cell voltage-clamping technique. This run down was prevented by 2 mm ATP (but not by AMP or ADP) in the pipette solution or by the poorly or non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP (adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate) in both cell lines, suggesting that protection from run down was mediated through non-hydrolytic nucleotide binding.

Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R.C. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The activity of ENaC is tightly regulated not only by various hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin but also by intracellular factors via mechanisms that are not yet fully understood (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). A mechanism by which the activity of ENaC is regulated in native Na+-transporting epithelia is called the “feedback inhibition,” which is defined as channel down-regulation due to the transport of Na+ across the apical membrane and its accumulation intracellularly (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). This mechanism would allow cells to adjust optimal Na+ movement across the apical membrane, thereby protecting themselves from Na+ load and the energy consumption required to maintain Na+ transport. Previous patch clamp studies in native Na+-absorptive epithelia have shown that the feedback inhibition involves changes in intracellular factors, including membrane potential, cytosolic pH, Ca2+, and Na+ concentrations, and cell metabolism (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in recent studies using both molecular biological and electrophysiological techniques, cytosolic pH, Na+, and/or Ca2+ concentration have been also shown to affect the activity of the cloned rENaC when expressed in different heterologous expression systems (15Kellenberger S.

(Lond.). 1999; 516: 31-43Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Focusing on the relationship between cell metabolism and Na+ channel activity, Palmer et al. (21Palmer L.G. Edelman I.S. Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 57: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Garty et al. (22Garty H. Edelman I.S. Lindemann B. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 74: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed that inhibition of cell metabolism decreased the apical membrane Na+ permeability in the toad urinary bladder, although it is not known whether metabolites such as ATP were responsible for this effect. Frindt et al. (23Frindt G. Silver R.B. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F480-F489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested a role for metabolic changes in mediating negative feedback regulation of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels in rat cortical collecting tubules; they found that increasing Na+ entry into cells by the addition of cAMP led to a decrease in channel activity in cell-attached patches, where the channels were apparently protected from the stimulatory effects of the nucleotide, and that inhibition of the Na+-K+-ATPase by ouabain prevented the inhibition of channel activity. The authors concluded that accumulation or depletion of metabolic substrates could play at least a partial role in regulating Na+ channels, especially during times of metabolic stress. In accord, an earlier study had demonstrated decreased amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport across bronchial epithelia following metabolic poisoning, which presumably caused ATP depletion (24Stutts M.J. Gatzy J.T. Boucher R.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 64: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, Chraïbi et al. (25Chraïbi A. Verdumo C. Mérillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. Hummler E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have identified a novel N-terminal splice variant, which deletes 49 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the αENaC. When co-expressed with the β- and γENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes, the corresponding N-terminal deletion mutant of the αENaC produces significantly smaller amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents than those with the wild type subunit. This smaller current was most likely attributable to a decrease in the overall open probability of active channels but not in single channel conductance or in surface expression of the channel (25Chraïbi A. Verdumo C. Mérillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. Hummler E. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal region contains a consensus nucleotide-binding motif (GXGXG motif), these observations together with those on native tissues have led us to hypothesize that a direct binding of cytosolic nucleotides such as ATP to the αENaC may be involved in a regulation of the channel activity. By using patch clamp techniques, we have shown here for the first time that rENaC heterologously expressed in both NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and MDCK epithelial cells are regulated by cytosolic ATP, which is likely mediated by non-hydrolyzable nucleotide binding to rENaC itself (most likely directly) rather than by a hydrolytic mechanism. rENaC Expressing NIH-3T3 and MDCK Cells—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (3T3 cells) expressing heterologous rat αβγENaC (rENaC, untagged) were previously generated by stably transfecting cells with a retrovirus expression vector (10Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). MDCK cells ectopically expressing untagged rENaC were described previously (10Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 16Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably expressing HA-tagged αrENaC were described earlier (26Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and those expressing all-tagged ENaC (αHAβmyc.TγFLAG-ENaC) have been described recently (27Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutant HA-tagged αrENaC (Δ2NB) bearing Gly to Ala mutations in all glycines of the 2 putative nucleotide-binding motifs (GLGKG→ ALAKA at the N terminus, and GRGARG→ ARAARA at the C terminus) was generated using a QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The HA-αrENaC(Δ2NB) mutant was then stably transfected into MDCK cells, as described earlier for the HA-αrENaC(WT) cell line (26Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Expression of the untagged ENaC subunits was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the metabolically labeled channel using antibodies directed against each subunit (10Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) 2O. Staub and D. Rotin, unpublished data. and of the tagged ENaC was confirmed using the appropriate anti-tag antibodies in a Western blot. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), G418 (0.3 mg/ml), and amiloride (10 μm) as described elsewhere (10Stutts M.J.

For patch clamp experiments, cells were seeded at low density on a cover glass, grown for 2–4 days. The 3T3 cells were induced with 2 mm butyrate (overnight), and the untagged rENaC-expressing MDCK cells with 1 μm dexamethasone and 2 mm butyrate (overnight) prior to patching, as described previously (10Stutts M.J.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, the HA-tagged αrENaC-expressing MDCK cells were induced with 1 μm dexamethasone (overnight) and the all-tagged rENaC-expressing MDCK cells with 1 μm dexamethasone and 2 mm butyrate (overnight) prior to the experiments. Patch Clamp Analyses—Cells grown on cover glass were rinsed with an appropriate NaCl-rich bath solution (see below), and then were transferred to a chamber mounted on an inverted microscope. Current recordings were made from 3T3 cells and MDCK cells using the standard whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). The patch clamp pipettes, which were pulled from glass capillaries (LG16, Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) using a horizontal puller (model P-97, Sutter Instrument, San Rafael, CA) or a vertical puller (model PP-830, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), had resistances of ∼2–3 megohms when filled with a standard cesium glutamate-rich solution described below. An Axopatch-1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used to measure whole-cell and single channel currents. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl electrode, which was connected to the bath via an agar bridge (10 mg/ml) filled with a NaCl-rich bathing solution. The amplifier was driven by pClamp 6 software to allow the delivery of voltage step protocols with concomitant digitization of the whole-cell currents. The whole-cell currents were filtered through an internal four-pole Bessel filter at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. Current-voltage (I-V) relations were studied using 10-mV voltage pulses, each of 400-ms duration, delivered at voltages ranging between –180 and +50 mV, and voltage pulses were separated by 3–10 s during which the cell potential was held at either –40 or 0 mV. Steady-state whole-cell currents were measured at 350 ms from the start of each voltage pulse. For kinetic analysis of the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents, most relaxations were fitted with a single exponential using a least squares method as described elsewhere (16Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As an alternative to voltage steps, voltage ramps were applied in the whole-cell experiments where the time course of changes in the current was examined. Typically, the command voltage was varied from –180 to –0 mV or from –140 to either 0 or +40 mV over a duration of 800 ms every 10 or 30 s as described in the text. We used this protocol to monitor rENaC activity because it was easily possible to identify any appearance of other conductances. Subsequently, we used two criteria to reject cells as having an abnormally large leakage conductance after whole-cell dialysis: (i) linear instantaneous I-V relation, and (ii) the reversal potential of the current was close to zero. In experiments with MDCK cells, the command voltage was varied from –100 to +20 mV over a duration of 400 ms every 30 s. Amiloride-sensitive currents were estimated under each condition by subtraction of currents measured under identical conditions except for the addition of 10 μm amiloride. The capacitance transient current in most experiments was compensated by using the Axopatch-1D amplifier. The cell capacitance was 42.6 ± 1.2 pF (n = 222). The series resistance (Rs) in these studies, which was 11.9 ± 0.4 megohms (n = 222), was not compensated. The pipette potential was corrected for the liquid junction potentials between the pipette solution and the external solution and between the external solution and the agar bridge, as described by Barry and Lynch (29Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Single channel activity was recorded in the outside-out patch configuration (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.S. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). By convention, for outside-out patches, the intracellular potential corresponds to the pipette potential, and downward single channel currents (carried by Li+ in the present study) correspond to Li+ flux from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the membrane. Single channel currents were filtered at 50–100 Hz with an internal four-pole Bessel filter, sampled at 1–2 kHz, and stored directly into the computer's hard disk through the TL-1 DMA interface or Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Subsequent current analysis was performed using programs supplied with both pClamp 6 and Axograph 3 softwares (Axon Instruments). Because all patches studied in the present study contained multiple channels (up to several tens of channels), we calculated the NP o product (N = number of channels, P o = open probability) as: NP o = IENaC/i where IENaC is the current resulting from ENaC (= total current minus current with no channel open, which was evaluated in the presence of 10 μm amiloride in the external solution) averaged over a recording period (every 0.5 min), divided by the unitary current (i) measured as the peak-to-peak intervals in the amplitude histogram or estimated as the mean of each current transition. This product could be calculated without making any assumptions about the total N in a patch or the P o of a single channel. In our preliminary experiments, we could not routinely observe reliable channel activities in excised inside-out patches from 3T3 cells; hence, single channel recording using this configuration was not pursued. The composition of the standard pipette and bath solutions was as follows. The pipette solution (pH 7.4) contained (in mm) cesium glutamate (100 or 120), CsCl (10), MgCl2 (1), HEPES (10), EGTA (1 or 10), and adenosine nucleotide (Na2-ATP) (0–10). In some experiments, ATP was replaced by equimolar ATP analogues (ATPγS or AMP-PNP) or by other nucleotides (UTP, GTP, AMP, and ADP). The pH of the solution was adjusted with CsOH at pH 7.4. The cells were initially immersed in a bath solution (pH 7.4) containing (in mm): NaCl (140), KCl (4.3), MgCl2 (1), and HEPES (10). Before the establishment of whole-cell configuration, the bath solution was changed to the one (pH 7.4) containing (in mm) sodium glutamate, lithium glutamate, or potassium glutamate (145), MgCl2 (1), and HEPES (10). The pH of the solution was adjusted with NaOH, LiOH, or KOH, respectively. All chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). Bath solution changes were accomplished by gravity feed from reservoirs. The results were reported as means ± S.E. of several experiments (n), and n refers to the number of cells patched in the different plate. Statistical significance was evaluated by using the two-tailed paired and unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. ATP-binding Experiments—For binding (pull down) experiments, MDCK cells expressing HA-αrENaC (WT or the Δ2NB mutant) or all-tagged rENaC (αHAβmyc.TγFlag-ENaC) were induced to express the ENaC subunits overnight and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 or 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Lysates were then diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (containing also 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm NaVO4) to reduce Triton X-100 concentration to 0.15–0.20%. Equal concentrations (unless otherwise indicated) of ATP or AMP conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) were then incubated with the diluted lysate for 1.5 h (4 °C) and then beads washed (3 times) with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol,) and phosphate-buffered saline (1 time). Proteins were then separated on a 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect αrENaC. Electrophysiological Properties of rENaC Heterologously Expressed in NIH-3T3 Cells—A previous study has shown that αβγrENaC-expressing 3T3 cells, but not untransfected 3T3 cells, exhibit an amiloride-sensitive conductance (10Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 11Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). By using the conventional whole-cell configuration with the standard cesium glutamate-rich pipette solution containing 2 mm ATP and lithium glutamate-rich bath solution, we first characterized in detail amiloride-sensitive macroscopic currents mediated by rENaC in this heterologous expression system. Fig. 1A-c shows the traces of the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell current obtained by digitally subtracting the whole-cell currents recorded in the presence of amiloride (10 μm) (Fig. 1A-b) from those in its absence (Fig. 1A-a) and indicates that an activation of the whole-cell current associated with membrane hyperpolarization was truly mediated by amiloride-sensitive conductance. Although the activation time constant did not change significantly at voltages between –184 and –104 mV (Fig. 1B: the values at –184 and –104 mV were 105.7 ± 13.9 ms (n = 11) and 114.4 ± 22.4 ms (n = 10), respectively), the relative amiloride-sensitive current amplitude was slightly voltage-dependent, so that the relative value was 1.37 ± 0.09 (n = 11) at –184 mV and 1.18 ± 0.06 (n = 10) at –104 mV (p < 0.002) (Fig. 1C). We next examined the relative conductance sequence for various cations of the whole-cell currents. In these experiments, whole-cell currents were recorded in the presence of 150 mm Na+, K+, or Li+ as the glutamate salt in the bathing solution. Fig. 1D summarizes these results. When the amiloride-sensitive Li+ and Na+ or Li+ and K+ currents were measured in the same cells, the corresponding currents at a command voltage of –100 mV were –1.54 ± 0.33 nA (n = 8) and –0.81 ± 0.17 nA (n = 8) or –1.35 ± 0.20 nA (n = 9) and 0.05 ± 0.03 nA (n = 9), respectively. The ratio of the amiloride-sensitive K+ or Na+ to Li+ current at –100 mV was calculated to be –0.04 ± 0.02 (n = 9) or 0.55 ± 0.07 (n = 8). These results indicate that the amiloride-sensitive conductance is permeable to Li+ and Na+ but not to K+. We also characterized single channel conductance of rENaC expressed in NIH-3T3 cells in outside-out patches, which could be responsible for the amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents. The patch pipette was filled with a cesium glutamate solution, and the bath contained lithium glutamate-rich solution as in the whole-cell experiments. Fig. 2A shows an example of such experiments, demonstrating the presence of amiloride-sensitive single channel currents in an outside-out patch. In this patch, single channel current transitions with up to seven open levels could be observed, and application of amiloride (10 μm) reversibly abolished channel activity. Under these conditions, the single channel conductance for Li+ or Na+ was estimated to be 7.9 ± 0.5 pS (n = 8) or 3.9 ± 0.1 pS (n = 3), respectively. Consistent with the whole-cell experiments, we could not detect any current transition when K+ was substituted for Li+ (n = 7, data not shown) in the presence of 1 or 10 mm BaCl2 in the bath solution. We also verified that the blocker did not affect the single channel conductance when Li+ was used as a charge carrier (data not shown). In single channel experiments, we also confirmed the observation in the whole-cell patch clamp experiments (Fig. 1), demonstrating that channel activity is increased upon membrane hyperpolarization. Fig. 2, B and C, shows an example of such experiments and a summary of the results of 7 different experiments, respectively. Although the absolute value of NP o was variable between each experiment, it was consistently increased upon membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 2C). When NP o value was normalized to a value of 1 at –24 mV, the relative NP o was 2.54 ± 0.68 (n = 6) (p < 0.01) at –84 mV. Together, these results extend previous electrophysiological characterizations of rENaC stably expressed in 3T3 cells (10Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C.

Run Down of Whole-cell Na + Conductance in rENaC-expressing 3T3 Cells—In the course of our experiments, we noticed that the whole-cell currents attributable to rENaC activity exhibited a run down when the cells were dialyzed with a standard cesium glutamate-rich solution with no ATP. We first realized this phenomenon due to the small amiloride-sensitive whole-cell conductance detected in 3T3 cells expressing rENaC. Because in our initial experiments the measurement of whole-cell currents was started at least a few minutes after whole-cell dialysis, we thus performed a systematic time course experiment to examine if the Na+ channel activity would run down during whole-cell dialysis. An example of such experiments is shown in Fig. 3A. Ramp command voltages were applied between –184 and –4 mV from a holding potential of –44 mV ev"

TERP modulates the transcriptional activity of ERα but has no independent effect on transcription of estrogen-response element-containing promoters. At low concentrations, TERP stimulates ERα transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays. At TERP concentrations equal to or greater than full-length ERα, TERP forms dimers with ERα and reduces both ligand-dependent and -independent transcription. A dimerization mutant of TERP, TERP L509R, stimulated ERα transcription at all concentrations. We hypothesized that TERP stimulates ERα transcriptional activity by titrating suppressors of ERα activity. We found that repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA), originally isolated from human breast cancer cells, is present in mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell lines. Levels of REA vary slightly throughout the rat reproductive cycle, but TERP mRNA and protein vary much more dramatically. In transfection experiments, REA suppressed ERα transcriptional activity, and TERP L509R was able to alleviate transcriptional suppression by REA. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, TERP bound to REA more efficiently than did ERα at equivalent concentrations, suggesting that REA will preferentially bind to TERP.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) consists of 12 conserved helices. It contains the ligand-dependent activation function-2 (AF-2) and is also important in heat-shock protein binding, nuclear localization, and dimerization of the receptor (7Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both AF-1 and AF-2 domains contribute to the transcription activation of ER. The most conserved domain is the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which has two zinc fingers and recognizes specific DNA sequences, or estrogen-response elements (EREs), on hormone-responsive genes. The hinge region links the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains and allows rotation of the DBD (7Gronemeyer H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor by ligand requires a conformational change in the LBD in which helix 12 moves toward helix 3 and helix 4, forming a hydrophobic pocket and a surface that allows interaction with coactivators and other regulatory proteins (5Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar, 8Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.

There are two subtypes of the estrogen receptor, ERα and ERβ, which are encoded by separate genes (2Nilsson S. Makela S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E. Pettersson K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1535-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The DBD is nearly identical and the LBD is similar, but the N-terminal regions of the receptor subtypes are different both in structure and in function. The AF-1 domain of ERα is very active in stimulation of transcription in different cell types, whereas the AF-1 activity of ERβ is negligible under the same conditions (9Cowley S.M. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the pituitary, ERα is the predominant isoform, and the AF-2 domain is the most important region for transcriptional activation (10Schreihofer D.A. Stoler M.H. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Schreihofer D.A. Rowe D.F. Rissman E.F. Scordalakes E.M. Gustafsson J.J. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4196-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Nuclear receptor activity is regulated by binding of ligands and coregulator proteins and the formation of heterodimers with other receptors. Coregulatory proteins may either enhance or suppress ER-dependent activity. Coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) interact with nuclear receptors in an agonist- and AF-2-dependent manner (8Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W.

Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). These coactivators have been shown to activate nuclear receptors by chromatin remodeling via histone acetyltransferase activities or through direct interaction with the basal transcription machinery (12Aranda A.

The nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid X receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) suppress the transcriptional activity of unliganded nuclear receptors and ER bound to antagonists or selective estrogen receptor modulators through recruitment of histone deacetylase-containing protein complexes (13McKenna N.J.

A recently identified ERα-associated protein, template-activating factor-1β (TAF-1β), binds to the DBD and has been shown to inhibit acetylation of histones and ERα, resulting in the suppression of transcription (17Loven M.A. Muster N. Yates J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Examples of repressor molecules that do not act directly through histone deacetylases include repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity (18Norris J.D. Fan D. Sherk A. McDonnell D.P. Mol.

REA is the only ER-specific repressor protein known to date and was identified in an MCF-7 human breast cancer cell cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screening. REA interacts with the ERα or ERβ LBD in the presence of both agonists and antagonists (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

It does not have intrinsic transcription-repression activity and is thought to compete with SRC-1 binding to ER via the LXXLL motif at its N terminus (24Delage-Mourroux R. Martini P.G. Choi I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35848-35856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).ER transcriptional activity can also be modulated by the formation of heterodimers. For example, ERβ influences overall ER activity in two ways. It may competitively bind to EREs and prevent ERα binding, or it may form ERα/ERβ heterodimers with lower transcriptional activity than ERα homodimers, possibly because of the less active N-terminal domain of ERβ (25Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An ERα isoform cloned in our laboratory, the truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1, hereafter called TERP), has also been shown to form heterodimers with and modulate ERα and ERβ activity (26Friend K.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This pituitary-specific isoform of ERα contains a unique untranslated exon 1 fused to exon 5 through exon 8 of ERα (26Friend K.E. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The resulting protein lacks the DBD and does not bind ligand efficiently. TERP has no independent transcriptional activity on ERE-containing promoters but modulates ER transcriptional activity biphasically (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, TERP stimulates ERα activity at low concentrations, where the ratio of transfected TERP to ERα is less than 1:1, but inhibits ERα activity at high concentrations, where the ratio of TERP to ERα is greater than 1:1 (28Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Levels of TERP mRNA change dramatically in response to estrogen (10Schreihofer D.A. Stoler M.H. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Vaillant C. Chesnel F. Schausi D. Tiffoche C. Thieulant M.L.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that TERP may have biological importance in the pituitary (31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TERP is transcribed from a promoter located in the intron between exons 4 and 5 of the rat ERα gene (32Tiffoche C. Vaillant C. Schausi D. Thieulant M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4106-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The TERP promoter contains EREs, suggesting that ER may directly regulate TERP expression. The ratio of TERP/ERα mRNA varies during the reproductive cycle from undetectable during metestrus to 4-fold higher than ERα during proestrus, when estrogen levels are highest.Previously, we and others demonstrated that the suppressive effects of TERP on ERα transcriptional activity, observed with TERP:ERα ratios greater than 1:1, is due to the formation of TERP/ERα heterodimers that inefficiently bind to an ERE (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Tiffoche C. Vaillant C. Schausi D. Thieulant M.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4106-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the stimulatory effects of TERP observed at TERP:ERα ratios < 1:1 must occur through a separate mechanism. Here we show that low concentrations of TERP bind efficiently to the repressor molecule REA. We suggest that by the titration and sequestration of repressor proteins, TERP can stimulate ER transcriptional activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Extraction—Cos-1, αT3, and LβT2 cells were collected with guanidinium (4 m GdnSCN, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sarkosyl, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol) and passed through an 18-gauge needle. The homogenate was layered on CsCl cushions (5.7 m CsCl and 0.01 m EDTA, pH 7) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 20 °C for 18 h (31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The pellet was removed and resuspended in 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and precipitated in ethanol overnight at –70 °C. The precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and rehydrated in sterile water.Plasmids—ERα, and TERP cDNA were generated by PCR and subcloned into a cytomegalovirus promoter containing pcDNA3.1 expression vector as described previously (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PCR products of ERα and TERP were subcloned into the pGEX2T vector downstream of the glutathione S-transferase gene as described (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Single point mutations of TERP at the dimerization domain (L509R) or at helix 12, the cofactor-binding site (E547K), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mouse REA cDNA was generated by RT-PCR amplification from αT3 total RNA using REA-specific N-terminal and C-terminal primers (5′-ATGGCCCAGAACTTGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCATCAAGGGTAAGAAATGA-3′, respectively). The 899-bp PCR product was ligated to the PCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions from three independent clones and then compared with the sequence for human REA isolated from human breast cancer MCF7 cells (GenBank™ accession number NM007273). REA was subsequently subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector and the pGEX-2T vector. The reporter vector for transfection experiments contains two copies of the vitellogenin consensus ERE fused to a 105-bp thymidine kinase promoter, (ERE)2-vit-TK-Luc.RT-PCR—Reverse transcription from rat pituitary RNA was performed as described (31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PCR conditions and primers for ERα, TERP, and actin were described (10Schreihofer D.A. Stoler M.H. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the cycle number for their PCR reactions are 29, 39, and 26, respectively. PCR conditions for REA consisted of a single cycle of 3 min at 94 °C followed by 34 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and ending with a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. The optimal cycle number for quantification of REA was determined based on PCR with 200 ng of female rat pituitary RNA over a range of 25–40 cycles. For each RNA sample, the linear range of the amplification curve was verified independently. For quantification, a minimum of two separate experiments and amplifications were performed for each RNA sample, and mRNA values from densitometric quantification were normalized for β-actin mRNA from the same samples and cDNA amplifications.Cell Culture and Transfections—Mouse αT3 gonadotrope cells, originally obtained from Dr. Pamela Mellon (University of California, San Diego, CA) (33Horn F. Bilezikjian L.M. Perrin M.H. Bosma M.M. Windle J.J. Huber K.S. Blount A.L. Hille B. Vale W. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection experiments, αT3 cells were plated in 30-mm wells at a density of 500,000 cells/well in phenol red-free DMEM with 5% charcoal-stripped newborn calf serum. The ER-negative monkey kidney Cos-1 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum. Cos-1 cells were plated in 30-mm wells at a density of 200,000 cells/well in phenol red-free DMEM with 5% stripped newborn calf serum in transfection experiments. 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with 1 μg/well luciferase reporter plasmid, various expression constructs, and pcDNA3.1 vector (for standardization of total DNA) using calcium phosphate methods. Approximately 16–18 h later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with or without 10 nm 17β-estradiol (E2) for 24 h before collection with 1× cell lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured using a Turner 20e luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized for total lysate protein assessed with Bio-Rad protein dye. Data were pooled from at least three independent experiments of duplicate or triplicate samples and are presented as arbitrary light units and normalized for protein levels.GST Pull-down Assays—PGEX2T (GST alone), GST-ERαLBD, GST-TERP, and GST-REA constructs were transformed into BL21 bacteria cells and grown in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in an orbital shaker at 37 °C for 5 h. After induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were grown overnight at 30 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the bacterial pellets were resuspended and incubated on ice for 15 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 μl/ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, the bacterial lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min and frozen at –70 °C in an ethanol bath for 1 h. After thawing at room temperature, the lysate was resuspended and incubated on ice in buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, DNase I (5 μg), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were homogenized by passing through a 20-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min. Soluble lysate was conjugated with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight and assessed for protein concentration on 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gels by Coomassie Blue stain and immunoblotting (GST-ERαLBD and GST-TERP) with ERα C1355 antibody (31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For pull-down experiments, ∼0.5 μg of GST alone or GST fusion proteins were incubated in a 150-μl mixture containing 10 nm E2, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, [35S]methionine-labeled (1,175 Ci/ mmol; 0.04 mCi/50-μl reaction) in vitro translated proteins (TnT rabbit reticulocyte transcription/translation kit; Promega) and a GST wash buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, and 0.12% Nonidet P-40. After 1.5 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in GST wash buffer four times and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 2 min prior to electrophoresis on SDS-containing 12% polyacrylamide gels at 145 V. Gels were dried and exposed to film overnight at –70 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The protein band intensity was quantified by densitometry. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed to estimate [35S]methionine incorporation in the in vitro translated proteins. Briefly, 2 μlof in vitro translated protein was incubated for 10 min with 98 μl of 1 m NaOH at 37 °C followed by a 30-min incubation with 25% trichloroacetic acid/2% tryptone on ice. The precipitate was washed on a GF/C filter with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and 70% ethanol and assayed in a scintillation counter. For competition experiments, the molar ratio of incubated protein was calculated based on the [35S]methionine incorporation and the number of methionines encoded in each protein. GST-REA was then incubated with saturating amounts of ERα L509R and increasing amounts of TERP L509R. Data shown in the figures are the representative results from at least 3–5 independent experiments.Quantification of Protein Expression—To quantify ERα, TERP, and REA mRNA through the estrous cycle, intact female CD-1 rats (200–225 g of body weight, Charles River Laboratories) were maintained on a 14:10-h light:dark cycle, and estrous cycle stage was determined by vaginal lavage. All animals were required to have two consecutive normal cycles prior to use in the study. Animals were euthanized at 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. of estrous and proestrus and at 9 a.m. on metestrus and diestrus (12–16 animals/group). Total pituitary RNA was prepared from pooled tissue (2–3/sample), and total protein was obtained by direct homogenization of individual pituitaries (three individual samples for each cycle day and time) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6) solution containing 2% SDS. Detection and quantitation of ERα and TERP protein were as described previously (11Schreihofer D.A. Rowe D.F. Rissman E.F. Scordalakes E.M. Gustafsson J.J. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4196-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein samples (75 μg) were denatured by boiling with 2% β-mercaptoethanol and separated by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 1% SDS and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected by the ERα C-terminal specific antibody C1355 (1:7,500) (31Friend K.E. Resnick E.M. Ang L.W. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). Full-length ERα and TERP protein were distinguished on the basis of size, quantitated by densitometric analysis, and normalized for β-actin protein in the same samples on the same blot as described previously (10Schreihofer D.A. Stoler M.H. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed from two separate experiments, with three samples/group. Animals were obtained and used in accordance with the guidelines established by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Virginia.RESULTSDimerization Mutant of TERP Stimulates ERα-mediated Transcription—Our laboratory has observed previously that TERP modulated ERα transcriptional activity biphasically (28Schreihofer D.A. Resnick E.M. Soh A.Y. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). High concentrations of TERP were suppressive for ER activity through inactive dimer formation with ERα that disrupted ERα binding to an ERE. We speculated that if TERP could no longer form dimers, its stimulatory effect would be more apparent. A point mutation at leucine 509 of TERP disrupts its dimerization with ERα. Although the protein of this mutant, TERP L509R, is made at the same level as the wild type, its ability to inhibit ERα is severely compromised (27Resnick E.M. Schreihofer D.A. Periasamy A. Shupnik M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7158-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of ERα with increasing amounts of TERP L509R in ER-negative Cos-1 cells consistently stimulates ERα transcriptional activity on an ERE-containing promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), whereas the same amount of wild type TERP is invariably suppressive (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in ER-positive mouse pituitary gonadotrope αT3 cells (Fig. 1C), a cell line in which TERP is normally expressed (10Schreihofer D.A. Stoler M.H. Shupnik M.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2174-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We postulated that TERP L509R might be interacting with suppressive molecules and thus sequestering them from ERα.REA Is Expressed in Mouse Pituitary Gonadotrope Cell Lines and Suppresses ER-mediated Transcriptional Activity—We next examined the potential role of the ER-specific repressor protein, REA, in TERP regulation of ERα transcription. REA interacts with ERα at the LBD, most of which is contained in TERP. We first examined the expression of REA in gonadotrope cells. RT-PCR assays were performed on RNA extracted from mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell lines, αT3 and LβT2, as well as monkey kidney Cos-1 cells, using primers designed from the published sequence of human REA (23Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B."
https://openalex.org/W2031451765,"Conversion of glutamate 1-semialdehyde to the tetrapyrrole precursor, 5-aminolevulinate, takes place in an aminomutase-catalyzed reaction involving transformations at both the non-chiral C5 and the chiral C4 of the intermediate 4,5-diaminovalerate. Presented with racemic diaminovalerate and an excess of succinic semialdehyde, the enzyme catalyzes a transamination in which only the l-enantiomer is consumed. Simultaneously, equimolar 4-aminobutyrate and aminolevulinate are formed. The enzyme is also shown to transaminate aminolevulinate and 4-aminohexenoate to l-diaminovalerate as the exclusive amino product. The interaction of the enzyme with pure d- and l-enantiomers of diaminovalerate prepared by these reactions is described. Transamination of l-diaminovalerate yielded aminolevulinate quantitatively showing that reaction at the C5 amine does not occur significantly. A much slower transamination reaction was catalyzed with d-diaminovalerate as substrate. One product of this reaction, 4-aminobutyrate, was formed in the amount equal to that of the diaminovalerate consumed. Glutamate semialdehyde was deduced to be the other primary product and was also measured in significant amounts when a high concentration of the enzyme in its pyridoxal form was reacted with d-diaminovalerate in a single turnover. Single turnover reactions showed that both enantiomers of diaminovalerate converted the enzyme from its 420-nm absorbing pyridoxaldimine form to the 330-nm absorbing pyridoxamine via rapidly formed intermediates with different absorption spectra. The intermediate formed with l-DAVA (lambdamax = 420 nm) was deduced to be the protonated external aldimine with the 4-amino group. The intermediate formed with d-DAVA (lambdamax = 390 nm) was deduced to be the unprotonated external aldimine with the 5-amino group."
