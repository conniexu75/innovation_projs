https://openalex.org/W1574745553,"Micellar complexes of human apolipoprotein A-I and phosphatidylcholine, with or without cholesterol, were prepared by adding apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) to sodium cholate-lipid mixtures. Cholate was removed by dialysis and the apo A-I.lipid complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography or by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The lipid mixtures consisted of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or egg yolk phosphatidylcholine in the presence of various molar ratios of cholesterol. The formation of complexes was examined at different phosphatidylcholine (PC)-to-apo A-I ratios, PC-to-cholate ratios, and cholate concentrations. Yields of complexes were maximal when incubation and dialysis were performed near the transition temperature of the PC. Upon lipid binding and complex formation, apo A-I experienced a significant increase in alpha-helix content, and a blue shift in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. In all lipid-protein incubation mixtures, from 600:1 to 75:1, PC/apo A-I (molar ratios), relatively small, stable complexes were present which gave maximum yields at incubation ratios similar to their isolated stoichiometries of 75:1 to 140:1, PC/apo A-I (molar ratios). For the isolated complexes, molecular weights were determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be in the range from 220,000 to 260,000; fluorescence polarization using the hydrophobic probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene showed a broadened and shifted gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition, characteristic of micellar complexes of apo A-I with PC. Complexes prepared using apo A-I, covalently labeled with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride, had an overall particle rotational relaxation time of 530 ns. On electron micrographs, the complexes, negatively stained with phosphotungstate, appeared as lamellar, discoidal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2011193034,"The decapentaplegic gene complex (2-4.0) in Drosophila melanogaster is defined by a series of allelic mutations affecting imaginal disk development. Decapentaplegic (dpp) mutant individuals exhibit a variety of pattern deficiencies and duplications in structures derived from one or more of the 15 major imaginal disks. Based on dpp mutant phenotypes, we suggest that the dpp gene complex is involved in the elaboration of positional information within developing epidermal tissue. The dpp mutations are recessive and fall into six phenotypic classes. Milder alleles (classes I and II) affect only one or a few disks while most alleles (classes III, IV, V and EL) affect all major imaginal disks. Class EL homozygotes are embryonic lethals; development is arrested before germ-band shortening late in gastrulation. Presently inseparable from EL, is a haplo-insufficient function (Hin-d) associated with the distal (left) end of the dpp gene complex. The dpp gene complex occupies most or all of 22F1--3, three densely staining polytene chromosome bands. A colinearity exists between map positions of the four identified functional units within the complex and the severities of mutant phenotypes caused by disruption of these functions. Most dpp mutations are gross chromosomal rearrangements; they exert polar effects on the decapentaplegic functions that are proximal to the rearrangement breakpoints in 22F. Many structural similarities exist between the decapentaplegic and bithorax gene complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2082460721,"We cloned overlapping DNA segments that encompass the region from the immunoglobulin JH segments to the C gamma 3 gene of BALB/c mouse. We have now cloned the entire region (about 200 kilobases) of the constant-region gene family of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, the organization of which is 5'-JH-6.5 kb-C mu-4.5 kb-C delta-55 kb-C gamma 3-34 kb-C gamma 1-21 kb-C gamma 2b-15 kb-C gamma 2a-14 kb-C epsilon-12 kb-C alpha-3'. Using these cloned DNAs, we have characterized several structural features of the constant-region gene loci. There are no other J region segments except for those at the 5' side of the C mu gene. The S region is 5' to each CH gene except for the C delta gene, and the nucleotide sequences of the S region share some homology. There is no reasonably conserved pseudogene. There are at least two species of reiterated sequences scattered in these loci. Cloning and Southern blot hybridization analyses indicate that the general organizations of the heavy-chain gene loci of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, which have many different serological markers, are fundamentally similar but different in the lengths of S regions. Restriction enzyme cleavage maps of the whole constant-region gene loci were constructed with respect to eight restriction endonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2077706021,"Although several studies of Alzheimer's disease suggest that the frequency of neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex is correlated with the severity of dementia and with reduction in presynaptic cholinergic markers in the cortex, the relationship between cholinergic cortical innervation and the pathogenesis of plaques is unknown. The hypothesis was tested that the neurites in the plaque consist, in part, of presynaptic cholinergic axons, many of which arise from neurons in the basal forebrain. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the character and distribution of plaques in monkeys, aged 4 to 31 years, with staining for acetylcholin-esterase and also with Congo red and silver stains. Immature and mature plaques were rich in acetylcholinesterase. As the plaques matured, the amount of amyloid increased, and the number of neurites and the activity of acetylcholinesterase decreased. End-stage amyloid-rich plaques lacked acetylcholinesterase. These observations indicate that changes in cortical cholinergic innervation are an important feature in the pathogenesis and evolution of the neuritic plaque."

https://openalex.org/W1569177350,1-O-Alkyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (AAGPC) triggered the release of [3H]arachidonate but not [14C]stearate from cellular phospholipids in cytochalasin B-treated rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Concentrations of AAGPC up to 20 nM caused a dose-dependent release and subsequent metabolism of the released [3H]arachidonic acid. Most of the release of the [3H]arachidonate had taken place within the first 2 min of stimulation. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine served as the sources of [3H]arachidonate with about 50% of the label coming from each pool. Challenge of cytochalasin B-treated polymorphonuclear leukocytes with AAPGC led to the production of [3H]hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and [3H]dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. No significant production of [3H]prostaglandins or [3H]thromboxanes was detected. AAGPC also caused a dose-dependent degranulation of cytochalasin B-treated rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes as shown by the release of beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme. Both the AAGPC-stimulated production of arachidonate metabolites and the degranulation response were blocked by eicosatetraynoic acid and non-dihydroguaiaretic acid at similar inhibitor concentrations. These findings suggest the bioactions of AAGPC on polymorphonuclear leukocytes may be mediated by the release of arachidonic acid and the production of mono- and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids.
https://openalex.org/W1555808871,"In stimulated platelets phosphatidylinositol is degraded by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to 1,2-diacylglycerol which is then phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid. Thrombin stimulation of horse and human platelets prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate induces the formation of [32P]lysophosphatidylinositol, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol is also degraded by a phospholipase of A type activity. Stimulation of platelets prelabeled with 32P or with 32P plus [3H]inositol produces a lysophosphatidylinositol which has a 32P-specific activity and a 3H/32P ratio which has a 32P-specific activity and a 3H/32P ratio identical with those of phosphatidylinositol. These results suggest that the lysophosphatidylinositol derives from phosphatidylinositol. Thrombin stimulation of platelets double label with 32P and [3H]arachidonate induces loss of [3H]arachidonate from phosphatidylinositol and formation of [32P]lysophosphatidylinositol, suggesting the involvement of a phospholipase A2 activity. Ionophore A23187 also induces the formation of lysophosphatidylinositol in horse and human platelets. With either stimulus, [32P]lysophosphatidylinositol appears within seconds after stimulation and parallels the loss of [3H]arachidonic acid from phosphatidylinositol. The lysophosphatidylinositol produced by thrombin or by ionophore A23187 represents 40% of the degraded phosphatidylinositol as assessed by lipid phosphorus. Quinacrine, which inhibits the liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, also blocks the formation of lysophosphatidylinositol. The results presented here indicate that phosphatidylinositol is degraded by both phospholipases, C and A2, in stimulated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1600754228,"Detergent-solubilized liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase is known to retain the ability to transfer electrons to cytochrome P-450, whereas the trypsin-solubilized reductase transfers electrons only to artificial acceptors. Due to the loss of a hydrophobic fragment by the action of trypsin, the altered reductase is no longer capable of binding cytochrome P-450. In the present study the primary tryptic attack on the rabbit reductase was shown to be at the Lys 44-Ile 45 bond to liberate the hydrophilic domain (molecular weight, 71,000) from the intact enzyme (molecular weight, 77,000). The other fragment (molecular weight, 4,800) undergoes tryptic attack at the Lys 34-Lys 35-Lys 36 sequence to yield a polypeptide representing the hydrophobic domain of the reductase and a nona- or decapeptide (Lys 35 or Lys 36 through Lys 44) which serves as the connecting region. The hydrophobic peptide, which is derived from the NH2-terminal end of the reductase, has an acetylated NH2 terminus and a region (Val 16 through Phe 32) which is exceptionally hydrophobic, with a predicted beta-sheet structure, and is believed to be involved in the binding of cytochrome P-450 and phospholipid. The site of attack on the reductase by various proteases is different, but the cleavage points are localized within a short segment of the polypeptide chain. A comparison of the tryptic forms (representing the hydrophilic domains) of the rabbit and rat reductases by terminal sequence analysis showed a high degree of similarity, with about 80% of the residues in exact correspondence and only a short variable region near the Ile NH2 terminus."

https://openalex.org/W1504821571,"The effects of estrogens on ovarian aromatase activity were investigated in vitro using granulosa cells from immature hypophysectomized estrogen-primed rats. The cells were cultured for 3 days in an androgen-free medium in the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), with or without the specified estrogen. After washing, the cells were reincubated for 5 h with 10(-7) M androstenedione, and the formation of estrogens was measured. Estrogen production by control and diethylstilbestrol-treated cells was negligible, while FSH stimulated aromatase activity. Furthermore, concomitant treatment with diethylstilbestrol led to dose-dependent increases in the FSH-induced aromatase activity with an ED50 value of 4 X 10(-9) M and an apparent Vmax value 12- to 16-fold higher than those induced by FSH alone. The direct stimulatory effect of estrogens was time-dependent and was not accounted for by increases in cell protein. Various native and synthetic estrogens also augmented the FSH induction of aromatases (native estrogens: estradiol-17 beta = estrone greater than estradiol-17 alpha greater than estriol; synthetic estrogens: hexestrol greater than moxestrol greater than ethinyl estradiol much greater than chlorotrianisene and mestranol). The effect of estradiol-17 beta was dose-dependent with an ED50 value of 9 X 10(-9) M, which is within the physiological levels of follicular estradiol-17 beta. Although treatment with androgens also enhanced the FSH-induced aromatases, treatment with a progestin (R5020) or a mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) was without effect. Thus, estrogens directly augment the stimulation of granulosa cell aromatase activity by FSH. Follicular estrogens may activate intraovarian autoregulatory positive feedback mechanisms to enhance their own production, resulting in selective follicle maturation and the preovulatory estrogen surge."
https://openalex.org/W1607112418,"Fibronectin is an adhesive glycoprotein that binds to heparin and to DNA. The binding of tryptic fragments of human plasma fibronectin to these ligands is found to be highly dependent on the concentration of divalent cations. We have identified 3 types of binding to heparin. 1) Calcium-sensitive binding is inhibited by CaCl2, but not by MgCl2 or by MnCl2. The NH2-terminal 31,000-dalton fragment (fragment 23) has this type of binding, which is half-maximally inhibited by 3 to 4 mM CaCl2. 2) Divalent cation-sensitive binding is exhibited by a 75,000-dalton fragment (fragment 13); its binding is inhibited by all 3 divalent cations. 3) Divalent cation-insensitive binding is characteristic of a 95,000-dalton fragment (fragment 10) and larger fragments. These 3 fragments (fragments 10, 13, and 23) are not disulfide-bonded to other fragments. Specific tryptic fragments of fibronectin also bind readily to native DNA in the presence of EDTA, but the binding of all fragments is abolished by the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 or MgCl2. Our results indicate that the binding of specific domains of fibronectin to heparin or to DNA can be modulated by divalent cations."

https://openalex.org/W2072058530,"Immunofluorescence and microinjection experiments have shown that vinculin (molecular weight 130,000) is localized at adhesion plaques of fibroblasts spread on a solid substrate. We found that this protein affects actin filament assembly and interactions in vitro at substoichiometric levels. Vinculin inhibits the rate of actin polymerization under conditions that limit nuclei formation, indicating an effect on the filament elongation step of the reaction. Vinculin also reduces actin filament--filament interactions measured with a low-shear viscometer. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding of 3H-labeled vinculin to actin filaments showed that there is one high-affinity binding site (dissociation constant=20 nM) for every 1,500-2,000 actin monomers. These results suggested that vinculin interacts with a specific site located at the growing ends of actin filaments in a cytochalasin-like manner, a property consistent with its proposed function as a linkage protein between filaments and the plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2106008650,"Micellar, discoidal complexes of human apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) with phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol, prepared by the method described in the preceding paper (Matz, C. M., and Jonas, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4535-4540), were used as substrates for human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, purified 10,000-fold. The micellar complexes of apo A-I.egg yolk-phosphatidylcholine.cholesterol were compared to commonly used substrates of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, consisting of small unilamellar vesicles of egg yolk-phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol in the presence of apo A-I. Under identical reaction conditions, the micellar complexes had 4- to 5-fold higher initial velocities and 3-fold greater capacities for cholesterol esters than did the corresponding vesicular substrates. Micellar complexes, labeled with 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonyl fluorescent groups in the apolipoprotein, were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. After reaction with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, they had a shorter rotational relaxation time (290 ns) and smaller Stokes radius (47 A) than the unreacted complexes (530 ns and 57 A, respectively). The characteristic stacked, discoidal particles observed on electron micrographs of negatively stained micellar, unreacted complexes disappeared after enzymatic reaction and were replaced by structures with spheroidal shapes."
https://openalex.org/W1500994458,"Mepacrine has been used as an inhibitor of the activation of endogenous phospholipases in many systems. These endogenous phospholipases are important in the modification of the lipid environment of membrane proteins and in the release of locally active oxygenated arachidonic acid metabolites. In both human platelets and erythrocytes, mepacrine blocks the release of fatty acid from phospholipid by endogenous phospholipases. However, mepacrine also interacts directly with membrane phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylethanolamine, to form less polar derivatives. This interaction occurs rapidly and is maximal at concentrations of mepacrine greater than 0.2 mM. Such drug-phospholipid interaction may perturb membrane architecture and function and be responsible for the inhibitory effects of mepacrine on cellular responses observed in many systems. Since the alteration in membrane phospholipid composition occurs under the same conditions as phospholipase inhibition, it is not possible to be certain that the inhibition of cellular responses by mepacrine is due to inhibition of phospholipases rather than to direct perturbation of the membrane. It is also possible that inhibition of phospholipase action by mepacrine is in part a consequence of the change in phospholipid composition. These results indicate that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of results obtained using mepacrine and that the usefulness of this compound for the investigation of the biological importance of phospholipase activation is limited."

https://openalex.org/W1586096959,"The dimeric enzyme sucrase-isomaltase (a complex of sucrose alpha-glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.48 and oligo-1,6-glucosidase (dextrin 6 alpha-D-glucanohydrolase), EC 3.2.1.10) of the rat small intestinal microvillus membrane is synthesized as a single chain enzymatically active precursor protein. This precursor (called pro-sucrase-isomaltase) was purified from fetal intestinal transplants in which sucrase-isomaltase was found almost exclusively in the uncleaved precursor form. A two-step procedure was developed using monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on protein A Sepharose CL-4B followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The NH2-terminal sequence of purified pro-sucrase-isomaltase was identical with that of the isolated isomaltase subunit which possesses the membrane anchor for the mature enzyme complex but differed from the NH2-terminal sequence of the sucrase subunit. This identity shows that the isomaltase domain comprising the membrane anchor is synthesized prior to the bulk of the protein destined to be localized on the luminal side of the microvillus membrane. A model is proposed for the mode of membrane assembly and the subsequent cleavage of pro-sucrase-isomaltase into its mature subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1493021919,"A proteoglycan isolated from a rat yolk sac tumor and characterized as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a smaller amount of dermatan sulfate was studied with respect to complex formation with collagen and fibronectin. The proteoglycan co-precipitated with native collagen from neutral salt solutions at 6 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Addition of fibronectin in such precipitation mixtures resulted in incorporation of fibronectin to the precipitate. Treatment of the proteoglycan with alkali to separate the glycosaminoglycan chains from the protein part and digestion of the protein part with papain greatly reduced the capacity of the proteoglycan to precipitate collagen and fibronectin. A defined extracellular matrix as represented by the complexes of collagen, proteoglycan, and fibronectin constructed here may be useful for studies on the biological effects of extracellular matrices. The multiple interactions of matrix macromolecules exemplified by these results may play a role in the formation of extracellular matrices and in the maintenance of their integrity."

The protein revealed Mr = 380,000 and contained, in a 2:1 ratio, two different disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, C-1 and D-1 (Mr = 125,000). Carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography before and after reduction proved that the two polypeptide chains are arranged in a single triple helical molecule with the chain composition (C-1)2(D-1). The disulfide bridges appear to be located 180 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus of the chains."
https://openalex.org/W1534497926,"Chlamydomonas sexual agglutinins have been quantitatively extracted from isolated flagella in vitro using the dialyzable nonionic detergent octyl-D-glucopyranoside and from cells in vivo with 12.5 mM EDTA. Both preparations elicit normal sexual responses from gametes of complementary, but not like, mating types. Extracts of vegetative cells and several agglutination-deficient (imp) mutants are totally inactive. Agglutinin activity is sensitive to trypsin, mild periodate oxidation, and heating at 60 degrees C for 1 min. These findings, coupled with the size of the molecule (it is excluded from Sepharose 6B and sediments as a 12 S particle in sucrose gradients) lead us to propose that the Chlamydomonas sexual agglutinins are large glycoproteins or glycoprotein aggregates which associate with the flagellar membrane in an extrinsic fashion. Partial purification of in vivo 125I-surface labeled EDTA extracts rules out several surface polypeptides, including the bulk of material migrating in the region of the major membrane glycoprotein (Mr 350,000), as agglutinin candidates and indicates that the active molecule is a minor component of the flagellar membrane. In addition, in vitro assays suggest a mechanism for in vivo sexual agglutination whereby stable adhesion is achieved by the active redistribution of agglutinins to the flagellar tips."

L., Henry, B., and Pace, N. R. (1973) Virology 53, 40-46). Recently, 7 S RNA was shown to be partially complementary to Alu family DNA sequences (Weiner, A. (1980) Cell 22, 209-218). In the present study the nucleotide sequence of Novikoff hepatoma 7 S RNA was determined to be: (formula, see text) Comparison of 7 S RNA, Alu and B1 family DNA, and La 4.5 S RNA sequences for homologies showed that 1) one-third of 7 S RNA, mainly the 5'-end, was homologous to Alu and B1 family sequences; 2) one 300-nucleotide long Alu family sequence contained two binding sites for 7 S RNA; and 3) the 5'-ends of 7 S RNA and La 4.5 S RNA also had extensive (60%) homologies. A model for the secondary structure of 7 S RNA based on maximal base pairing and preferential nuclease cleavage sites is also presented."

https://openalex.org/W1979435325,"Four different tubulins have been identified that are expressed during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Two α-tubulin subunits (α1 and α2) and one β-tubulin subunit (β1) are expressed throughout embryonic development. A second β-tubulin subunit (β3) is expressed only for a short period in mid-embyronic development. Synthesis of β3-tubulin in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte translation system is directed by RNA extracted from embryos only at the stage when the protein is expressed. Thus we conclude that the mRNA encoding β3-tubulin is transcribed only during the brief period of β3-tubulin synthesis. The expression of β3-tubulin is accompanied by a coordinate transient increase in the level of synthesis of the embryonic α-tubulins, thereby maintaining an approximately equimolar synthesis of α- and β-tubulin subunits throughout embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1509926294,"The chromaffin granule, which is the catecholamine storage organelle of the adrenal medulla, contains at least 0.73 M ions, yet it is isotonic with 0.3 osM solutions. One hypothesis which accounts for this disparity is formation of a complex between major constituents of the granule: the catecholamines, the proteins, and the ATP. In this paper we show by vapor pressure osmometry, which affords a direct measure of colligative properties, that ATP-catecholamine mixtures form highly nonideal solutions. At 37 degrees C, solutions containing 0.6 M epinephrine and 0.15 M ATP show an effective osmotic pressure of only 0.25 osM. The existence of polymeric complexes is implied by the fact that the increase of osmotic pressure with increasing concentrations of ATP and catecholamine falls off substantially at concentrations approaching those in the chromaffin granules. Neither inorganic ions nor calcium chelators cause regain of ideal colligative behavior. Osmotic measurements on model compounds suggest that the primary interaction is between the phosphate and amino groups. There is also evidence that the effects are not wholly due to the formation of discrete complexes; factors of nonideal solution behavior also play a role in lowering the osmotic pressure. These observations show that the stability of the chromaffin granule in situ can be accounted for, perhaps entirely, by spontaneous interactions among nucleotides and catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1524649288,"Five forms of cytochrome P-450 have been purified from liver microsomes of beta-naphthoflavone-pretreated rats by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, DEAE-cellulose, and hydroxylapatite or CM-Sepharose columns. Over 50% of the starting cytochrome P-450 content can be accounted for in these five forms after resolution on the DEAE-cellulose column, and after further purification, the combined total recovery is 30%. The five forms have the following Mr: 47,000, 50,500, 51,500, 53,500, and 56,500. The absorption maxima in reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra are 452.5, 449, 449, 447.5, and 447.5 nm, respectively. Antibody has been prepared in rabbits to each of the five forms; each antibody reacts with the antigen for which it was prepared, but not with the other four heterologous antigens. In addition, each form gives a unique peptide map pattern when partially digested with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease and electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Each form also shows an individual pattern of catalytic activities when tested with benzphetamine, ethylmorphine, p-nitroanisole, benzo[alpha]pyrene, and 7-ethoxycoumarin as substrates. By all criteria examined, these five forms appear to be distinct forms of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1547951465,"Phenylhydrazine interacted with oxidized and reduced cytochrome P-450 of rat liver microsomes to produce binding difference spectra typical of many nitrogenous compounds. The phenylhydrazine-induced difference spectrum observed with oxidized microsomal cytochrome P-450 was converted, in a time-dependent process, to yield a new spectral intermediate with an absorbance maximum around 480 nm. The time required to form this new phenylhydrazine-induced spectral intermediate was decreased from hours to minutes when either NADPH or NADH was added to the reaction mixture. Phenyldiazene generated by addition of the decarboxylation product of methyl phenyldiazenecarboxylate or by addition of potassium ferricyanide and phenylhydrazine (2:1 molar equivalents) instantly formed the new spectral intermediate. This suggests that phenyldiazene is formed during the NADPH-dependent reaction. The appearance of the new spectral intermediate occurred concomitant with the loss of CO-reactive cytochrome P-450 (less than 90%) and loss of absorbance at 418 nm. The interpretation of the optical spectral changes was supported by a loss of the low spin signals characteristic of oxidized cytochrome P-450 as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The loss of CO-reactive cytochrome P-450 apparently resulted from the formation of a binary complex of phenyldiazene and the heme of oxidized cytochrome P-450 giving rise to the 480 nm spectral intermediate. In addition, the diazene-bound heme of cytochrome P-450 apparently was modified irreversibly in the presence of oxygen. The effects observed with phenylhydrazine could be produced to a lesser degree by other hydrazine derivatives. The possible role of phenylhydrazine as a new type of suicide substrate is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1515048140,"Fluorescent derivatives of a phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and diacylglycerol have been studied to establish the effect of different polar headgroups on the mechanism and kinetics of spontaneous phospholipid transfer between recombinants of human plasma apolipoprotein A-II and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The fluorescent lipids are all 1-myristoyl-2-[9-(1-pyrenyl)nonanoyl] glycerides. The transfer of the lipids is a first order process where the rate is independent of the concentration over a 50 fold range of the acceptor recombinants. These results are consistent with the lipids transferring as monomers being a water-soluble intermediate. The rate of transfer of the different phospholipids are slightly slower than phosphatidylcholine, with that of phosphatidylethanolamine being about 4 times slower. The transfer of phospholipids with a titratable headgroup is pH-dependent. The difference in the rates and pH dependence may be a function of the interactions (hydrogen bonding) between polar headgroups. The rate of transfer of the diacylglycerol is 20 times slower than phosphatidylcholine, but its activation energy (21 kcal/mol) is only 2 to 3 kcal less than most of the phospholipids (23 kcal/mol). These results suggest that the rate and activation energy for the spontaneous transfer of phospholipids can be predicted to a first approximation on the basis of its hydrophobic content, irrespective of the pH or identity of the polar headgroup."
https://openalex.org/W1487984818,"A protein-protein association of cytochrome P-450 LM2 with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, with cytochrome b5, and with both proteins was demonstrated in reconstituted phospholipid vesicles by magnetic circular dichroism difference spectra. A 23% decrease in the absolute intensity of the Soret band of the magnetic CD spectrum of cytochrome P-450 was observed when it was reconstituted with reductase. A difference spectrum corresponding to a 7% decrease in absolute intensity was obtained when cytochrome b5 was incorporated into vesicles that already contained cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome P-450 reductase compared to a decrease of 13% in absolute intensity when cytochrome b5 was incorporated into vesicles that contained only cytochrome P-450. The use of the magnetic circular dichroism confirmed that protein-protein associations that have been detected by absorption spectroscopy between purified and detergent-solubilized proteins also exist in membranes. High ionic strength was shown to interrupt direct electron flow from cytochrome P-450 reductase to cytochrome P-450 but not the electron flow from reductase through cytochrome b5 to cytochrome P-450. Upon incorporation of cytochrome b5 into cytochrome P-450- and cytochrome P-450 reductase-containing vesicles, an increase of benzphetamine N-demethylation activity was observed. The magnitude of this increase was numerically identical to the residual activity of the reconstituted vesicles measured in the presence of 0.3 M KCl. It is concluded that there is a requirement for at least one charge pairing for electron transfer from reductase to cytochrome P-450. These observations are combined in a proposed mechanism of coupled reversible association reactions in the membrane."

When eggs were exposed to a gradient A23187 the orange crescent was induced to form in the region corresponding to the highest concentration of ionophore. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that a local increase in intracellular calcium polarizes cytoplasmic localization in the ascidian embryo.

Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of AN112 phycobilisomes partially dissociated in 50 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine, 5 mM CaCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.8, separated three distinct fractions: (1) free trimeric biliproteins, (2) hexameric complexes of phycocyanin with 27K (11 S particles), and (3) phycobilisome subassemblies equivalent in mass to approximately 25% of the intact phycobilisome (18 S particles). The 18 S particles contained equimolar amounts of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, which represented approximately 30 and 50%, respectively, of the content of these biliproteins in the AN112 phycobilisome. The 18 S particles also contained 75% and 100%, respectively, of 27K and 75K polypeptides; i.e. 75K was present in a 2-fold higher amount than in the intact phycobilisome. The absorption spectrum (lambda max 648 nm) of the 18 S particles was similar to that of allophycocyanin. Upon excitation at 580 nm, these particles exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum consisting of 680 and 660 nm components, identical with that of intact phycobilisomes. The circular dichroism spectra of AN112 phycobilisomes and of the 18 S particles, in the region between 650 and 700 nm, were also very similar. Allophycocyanin B, which fluoresces at 680 nm, was found in fraction 1, and was totally absent from the 18 S particle. Thus, the long wavelength emission of the 18 S particle must have arisen from another terminal energy acceptor. The most probable candidate is the 75K polypeptide, which has been shown to carry a bilin chromophore and emit near 680 nm (Lundell, D. J., Yamanaka, G., and Glazer, A. N. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 91, 315-319). The 27K polypeptide, present in both fractions 2 and 3, was a component of different complexes in the two fractions. Fraction 2 displayed the physical and spectroscopic properties characteristic of the phycocyanin-linker complex, (alpha beta)6.27K. However, in the 18 S particle, 27K functioned in the assembly and attachment of phycocyanin trimers to a core domain. Based on the analysis of the components in fractions 1-3, a model is proposed which describes the structure of the AN112 phycobilisome, with emphasis on the roles of the linker polypeptides in the assembly of the core."
https://openalex.org/W1497979607,"The human lymphoma cell line Daudi has the phenotype of a nonsecreting B cell. This cell line synthesizes both the membrane and secreted forms of the IgM heavy chain, but only expresses functional membrane IgM. We have found that secreted type heavy chains (mus) are rapidly degraded in these cells, with a half-life of 1.3 h. Some of the membrane type heavy chains (mum) are also rapidly catabolized but some are expressed in a stable form with a half-life of 13 h. Inhibiting the initial glycosylation of heavy chains with tunicamycin has differential effects on the catabolic rates of mus and mum chains. The turnover of mus chains is not affected by this inhibitor, but the degradation of mum chains is much more rapid after tunicamycin treatment. In comparison with their glycosylated counterparts, nonglycosylated mu chains do not covalently assemble to a significant degree with light chains. Tunicamycin treatment of Daudi cells thus seems to inhibit formation of stable mum protein, possibly by altering mu chain conformation and inhibiting its interaction with light chains. We conclude from these results that some mum chains are specifically protected from proteolysis by post-translational events. These processing events include covalent assembly with light chains, terminal glycosylation, and insertion into the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1566366551,"Abstract The homogenate of rat basophilic leukemia cells, when incubated with arachidonic acid, glutathione, and calcium, formed 3 isomers of 5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 2 isomers of 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, as well as leukotriene (LT) C4 and D4. The products were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography, ultraviolet spectral analysis, co-migration with standards, bioassay, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The enzymes responsible for the formation of LTC4 and LTD4 from LTA4 were found in the 10,000 x g pellet and, therefore, appear to be particulate. The possibility that these enzymes are bound to the cell membrane suggest that the formation of these leukotrienes might be important in the basophil and mast cells release reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1982502919,"The content of osteocalcin and protein bound gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) was studied as a function of bone maturation and mineralization in normal and vitamin D-deficient, rachitic chickens. The Gla/Ca2+ ratio was elevated in rachitic bone, particularly in the most undermineralized regions. For example, there is a 10- to 20-fold elevation in Gla/Ca2+ in the newly synthesized, least mineralized rachitic bone fraction, which progressively decreases to a 1.5-fold elevation in the most highly mineralized areas of rachitic tissue. Osteocalcin, which is the principal Gla-containing protein of mature bone, was quantitated by radioimmunoassay using specific antiserum to the 5670-dalton chicken protein. Surprisingly, the osteocalcin concentration is decreased 50% in vitamin D-deficient bone. From this we infer that accumulated Gla-containing protein in vitamin D-deficient and poorly mineralized bone may possibly represent a precursor of osteocalcin."
https://openalex.org/W1508366269,"Activation or inhibition by cytochrome b5 of benzphetamine N-demethylation was studied in micelle-reconstituted systems containing cytochrome P-450 LM2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and dilauroyl-phosphatidylcholine. The effects of cytochrome b5 were critically dependent on both protein:protein and lipid:protein ratios. A 200% stimulation of N-demethylation by cytochrome b5 was obtained at cytochrome P-450 reductase:cytochrome P-450 ratios similar to those in microsomes, compared to only a 20% stimulation at a ratio of 1:1. At lipid:protein ratios less than 50:1, the addition of cytochrome b5 caused significant inhibition of benzphetamine N-demethylation. Such an inhibition could be partially reversed by increasing phospholipid content of micelles and was not seen in vesicle-reconstituted systems at cytochrome b5:cytochrome P-450 ratios of 1:1 or lower. At high cytochrome P-450 reductase:cytochrome P-450 ratios, addition of cytochrome b5 did not alter the efficiency (80%) with which NADPH was utilized: however, at ratios similar to those in microsomes, an increase in efficiency from 42% to 80% was observed. The function of cytochrome b5 was interpreted in terms of a model in which inhibition of cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions results from changes in phospholipid-protein interactions and activation occurs via facilitation of electron transfer between NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1606963850,"This study describes the first direct measurements of amino acid efflux from human lysosomes. Isolated leucocyte lysosomes can be loaded with radioactive amino acids by exposure to low concentrations of the corresponding labeled amino acid methyl esters. Efflux of amino acid from the loaded lysosomes can then be determined. Conditions during loading are adjusted for each ester to permit its adequate intralysosomal hydrolysis and subsequent accumulation of the free amino acid. Relative rates of efflux were leucine approximately equal to phenylalanine greater than methionine greater than tryptophan much greater than cystine. Efflux of leucine, tryptophan, or cystine was independent of exogenous cation, ATP, or amino acid concentrations under the conditions tested. Leucine efflux was similar in normal and cystinotic lysosomes, providing strong evidence that isolated cystinotic lysosomes do not manifest a generalized defect in amino acid efflux. In both normal and cystinotic lysosomes, cystine efflux was much slower than efflux of leucine or other amino acids from human or rat liver lysosomes. Significant differences in mean cystine efflux between isolated normal and cystinotic lysosomes were not apparent in the present test system, although the possibility of differences in rats could not be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1489639434,"A cloned initiator methionine tRNA gene from Xenopus laevis has been transcribed in cell-free extracts (S-100) prepared from cultured X. laevis kidney cells. RNA polymerase III produces two primary transcripts of this gene which initiate with a pppG and a pppA located seven and four nucleotides, respectively, in front of the mature tRNAMet1 5' end. Both terminate with a dT5 tract just beyond the nucleotides encoding the mature tRNA. The tRNA precursors are readily processed in vitro to mature length tRNA which contains six of the seven modified nucleotides found in the in vivo tRNAMet1. Many of these ribonucleotide modifications (m1G, m2G, m7G, D, and m1A) are introduced into the primary transcripts. The single exception is t6A which is found in the tRNAMet1 anticodon loop only after maturation of the 5' and 3' termini."
https://openalex.org/W1640624742,"By the combined actions of an endo-alpha-1 leads to 6-mannanase and an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, the core oligosaccharides can be released from Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 mnn2 mannoproteins. The effects of various mannoprotein mutations were evaluated by structural comparison of these core oligosaccharides with those prepared from double mutant strains with the genotypes mnn1 mnn2, mnn2 mnn3, mnn2 mnn4, and mnn2 mnn5. The results indicate that only the mnn1 lesion has a major effect on the mannoprotein core structure. Whereas the mnn2 mannoprotein yields a core composed of 6 fragments that differ in size from each other by single mannose units, only the two smallest species predominate in the mnn1 mnn2 preparation. This change is correlated with a loss of terminal alpha 1 leads to 3-mannosyl residues, an effect on the mnn1 lesion that is found also in the polysaccharide outer chain and hydroxyamino acid-linked mannooligosaccharides. The mnn3 and mnn5 mutations also had slight effects on the core size, but clear differences in linkage composition were not apparent. The results suggest that core oligosaccharides have an average composition of Man11GlcNAc, whereas Man9GlcNAc is the major oligosaccharide in strains containing the mnn1 defect. These values are 2 to 3 sugars less than those estimated previously (Nakajima, T., and Ballou, C. E. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 66, 870-879). Detailed analysis of the major core oligosaccharide from the mnn1 mnn2 mutant revealed that the two mannoses in alpha 1 leads to 3 linkage to the backbone were adjacent to each other and that the oligosacccharide is nearly identical with one isolated from chinese hamster ovary cell membranes (Li, E., and Kornfeld, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1600-1605). This finding provides strong evidence for the evolutionary conservation of this structural feature of the high mannose core oligosaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W1525879406,"The mechanism of the activation of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase by hemeproteins was investigated using the enzyme purified from bovine seminal vesicle microsomes. At pH 8, the maximal enzyme activities with methemoglobin (2 microM), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (2 microM), and metmyoglobin (2 microM) were 70%, 42%, and 15% of that with 1 microM hematin. Apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin inhibited the enzyme activities caused by hemoproteins as well as that caused by hematin. The inhibition was removed by the addition of excess hematin. The dissociation of heme from hemoproteins was demonstrated by trapping the free heme with human albumin or to a DE-52 column. The dissociation of heme from methemoglobin was facilitated by increasing concentrations of arachidonic acid. The amount of heme dissociated from hemoproteins (methemoglobin, metmyoglobin, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) in the presence of arachidonic acid correlated with their stimulatory effects on the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase activity. Horseradish peroxidase and beef liver catalase, the hemes of which were not dissociated in the presence of arachidonic acid, were ineffective in activating prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase. Spectrophotometric titration of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase with hematin demonstrated that the enzyme bound hematin at the ratio of 1 mol/mol with an association constant of 0.6 x 10(8) M-1. From these results, we conclude that hemoproteins themselves are ineffective in activating prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase and free hematin dissociated from the hemoproteins by the interaction of arachidonic acid is the activating factor for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1587612947,"We have characterized the UDP-galactose: alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide beta 3 galactosyltransferase in human tracheal epithelium using asialo ovine submaxillary mucin as the acceptor. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained at pH 6.0-7.5 and at 20-25 mM MnCl2 and at 2% Triton X-100. Cd2+ could substitute for Mn2+ as the divalent ion cofactor. Spermine, spermidine, putrecine, cadaverine, and poly-L-lysine stimulated the enzyme activity at low (2.5 mM) MnCl2 concentration. The apparent Michaelis constants for N-acetylgalactosamine, asialo ovine submaxillary mucin, and UDP-galactose were 15.5, 1.14, and 1.36 mM, respectively. The enzyme activity was not affected by alpha-lactalbumin. The alpha-N-acetygalactosaminide beta 3 galactosyltransferase was shown to be different from the N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase by acceptor competition studies. The product of galactosyltransferase was identified as Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc alpha Ser (Thr) by (a) isolation of [14C]Gal-GalNAc-H2 after alkaline borohydride treatment of the 14C-labeled product, (b) establishment of the beta-configuration of the newly synthesized glycosidic bond by its complete cleavage by bovine testicular beta-galactosidase, and (c) assignment of the 1 leads to 3 linkage by identification of threosaminitol obtained from the oxidation of the disaccharide with periodic acid followed by reduction with sodium borohydride, hydrolysis in 4 N HCl, and analysis on an amino acid analyzer. The 1 leads to 3 linkage was confirmed by its resistance to jack bean beta-galactosidase and by the presence of a m/e 307 ion fragment and the absence of a m/e 276 ion by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. When acid and beta-galactosidase-treated human tracheobronchial mucin was used as the acceptor, 3.3% of the product was found as [14C]Gal-GalNAc-H2. The remainder of the [14C]Gal was found in longer oligosaccharides formed by a different beta-galactosyltransferase. This galactosyltransferase is slightly inhibited by alpha-lactalbumin and stimulated by spermine."
https://openalex.org/W1490343157,Monospecific antiserum raised against rat brain proline endopeptidase is used to demonstrate the ubiquity of the enzyme and its unique role in the degradation of proline-containing peptides. All endoproteolytic activity directed toward proline residues in several rat tissues is shown to share one or more common antigenic determinants with rat brain proline endopeptidase. Similar activity from tissue of other species crossreacts with rat proline endopeptidase. The data presented suggest that proline endopeptidase is the sole cytoplasmic enzyme capable of degrading proline-containing peptides in every tissue examined and that previously reported proline-specific endoproteolytic activities observed in a variety of systems may be ascribed to proline endopeptidase. The putative role of proline endopeptidase in protein degradation is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W1509508037,"The peptide chain termination factor 2 (RF2) was covalently linked to Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins with the bifunctional reagent, dimethyl suberimidate. Ribosomal RF2 complexes were identified by immunological and radioimmunological techniques which utilized both antibody specific for individual ribosomal proteins and also for RF2. Efficient cross-linking occurred with proteins L2, L7/L12, and L11 of the large ribosome subunit and to a lesser extent with S6, S17, and S18 of the small subunit. On the basis of these and other data the ribosomal binding domain of RF2 appears to be a small region at the interface between the 30 S and 50 S subunits involving parts of both subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1501326000,"We reported that when synthase D was converted to synthase I in a rat liver extract, it progressed through a synthase form with activity characteristics which could not be explained by a mixture of synthase D and synthase I (Tan, A. W. H. (1981) Biochem. J. 200, 169-172). In this study we will borrow the nomenclature to describe this non-D and non-I activity. Using activities measured at five different conditions and simultaneous equations, the amount of the three synthase forms in liver extracts can be estimated. During incubation of the liver extract, the amount of synthase R was found to increase with time and then to decrease as synthase I was generated, a profile typical of an enzyme intermediate. We investigated for the presence of synthase R in rat liver under different in vivo conditions. In contrast to the liver of fed rats which had very little synthase R, the liver of fasted rats was found to have 30% of its synthase in the R form. This synthase R was increased 2-fold when glucose was given and decreased to a very low level when glucagon was given. Synthase I was not detected, even in the livers of starved rats given glucose. Using conditions which were closer to those of the cell, synthase R was found to have relatively high activity, up to 70% that of synthase I. Based on these results, synthase R is proposed to be an active enzyme form responsible for glycogen synthesis in rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1583990177,"Cobra alpha-toxin purified from Naja naja siamensis venom was labeled with near stoichiometric quantities of fluorescein isothiocyanate. A monofluorescein alpha-toxin was separated in 50-60% yield from unconjugated alpha-toxin and other reaction products by ion exchange chromatography. The isolated mono-conjugated alpha-toxin electrofocuses largely as a single entity with 92% appearing with a pI of 9.6. The unmodified toxin has a pI of 10.7. Thermolysin digestion and subsequent high pressure liquid chromatography of the peptides yield two dominant fluorescent peaks, both of which can be traced to the labeling of lysine 23. The NE-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Lys-23 alpha-toxin shows an apparent reduction in quantum yield when compared with either free FITC or the denatured and reduced NE-FITC-Lys-23 alpha-toxin. The reduction of fluorescence is likely to be due to static quenching of the fluorescein by the tryptophanyl and tyrosyl residues (25 and 21, respectively) in the central loop region. Binding of the NE-FITC-Lys-23 alpha-toxin to the membrane-associated acetylcholine receptor is accompanied by a 95 +/- 22% increase in fluorescence which probably reflects perturbation of the beta-pleated sheet character of the region containing residues 20-25 of the alpha-toxin. Steady state fluorescence polarization measurements of NE-FITC-Lys-23 alpha-toxin yield a rotational correlation time of 3.7 ns, suggesting FITC is largely immobilized on the alpha-toxin. The NE-FITC-Lys-23 alpha-toxin binds with a dissociation constant of 4 nM determined by fluorescence polarization."

The protein was identified as the peptidoglycan transglycosylase by its ability to synthesize lysozyme-sensitive peptidoglycan from undecaprenylpyrophosphoryl-disaccharide-pentapeptide. The enzyme is inhibited by vancomycin but not by bacitracin, penicillin G, or tunicamycin. The enzyme has no detectable transpeptidase activity, but it does bind penicillin."

From the CNBr digests of the mixture of these chain fragments three peptides, a major and two minor peptides with an apparent Mr = 32,000, 24,000 and 13,000, respectively, were purified and characterized. The data presented show that CNBr peptides 24K and 13K are generated from CNBr peptide 32K by pepsin cleavage in the native molecule at the NH2-terminal end. Antisera were raised in rabbits against peptide CB32K. Inhibition assays using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assays (ELISA) showed cross-reactivity with alpha 1(IV)130K, alpha 1(IV)110K and alpha 1(IV)75K fragments. Peptides CB24K and 13K also inhibited the antiserum. Antiserum was not active when tested against alpha 1(IV)95K, alpha 1(IV)55K, alpha 2(IV)120K, and alpha 2(IV)95K fragments as inhibitors. These studies provide further evidence that alpha 1(IV)130K, 110K, and 75K are derived from the same parent chain. The pepsin cleavage sites resulting in the formation of these fragments and their internal alignment are described."

The visible spectrum has absorbance maxima at 403, 500, 530, and 620 nm; it is not reduced by dithionite. The spectrum, physical properties, and specific activity are almost identical with those of catalases from other sources, and the protein has been tentatively identified as rat liver catalase. The protein exhibited partial reactivity in double immunodiffusion plates to antiserum prepared against rat liver ferroactivator isolated by a previous method (Bentle, L. A., and Lardy, H. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1431-1440) raising the possibility that the original ferroactivator and rat liver catalase are structurally related. Inactivation of catalase by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was accompanied by loss of ferroactivator activity as well. The apparent specific activity of ferroactivator, as well. The apparent specific activity of ferroactivator, whether heme-containing or not, can be increased between 2- and 100-fold by the inclusion of bovine serum albumin, HCO3-, or a combination of the two in the incubation."

Carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate the native enzyme and the response of 13C-enriched arginyl residues to binary and ternary complex formation and to chemical modification by 2,3-butanedione. Native enzyme exhibited four resonances (A, 158.3 ppm; B, 157.4 ppm; C, 156.9 ppm; and D, 156.1 ppm) in a chemical shift range of 2.2 ppm. The 12 arginyl residues per subunit of this enzyme were found in a 1:5:5:1 distribution in the four resonances. Carbon 13 NMR spectra revealed that of the four resonances, resonance C was most perturbed by binary and ternary complex formation. The ternary complex formed with [guanidino-13C]arginine-enriched enzyme, 5-fluoro-deoxyuridylate, and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate exhibited two new resonances at 157.9 and 156.5 ppm. Carbon 13 NMR analysis of enzyme inactivated with butanedione yielded three new single-carbon resonances, one from resonance B and two from resonance C, demonstrating that three arginyl residues per subunit were derivatized. The results of the binary and ternary complex studies and the chemical modification experiment suggest that the active site arginyl residue is represented in resonance C of the native enzyme."
