https://openalex.org/W2012787657,"Paired carbon-14 ((14)C) and thorium-230((230)Th) ages were determined on fossil corals from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. The ages were used to calibrate part of the (14)C time scale and to estimate rates of sea-level rise during the last deglaciation. An abrupt offset between the (14)C and (230)Th ages suggests that the atmospheric (14)C/(12)C ratio dropped by 15 percent during the latter part of and after the Younger Dryas (YD). This prominent drop coincides with greatly reduced rates of sea-level rise. Reduction of melting because of cooler conditions during the YD may have caused an increase in the rate of ocean ventilation, which caused the atmospheric (14)C/(12)C ratio to fall. The record of sea-level rise also shows that globally averaged rates of melting were relatively high at the beginning of the YD. Thus, these measurements satisfy one of the conditions required by the hypothesis that the diversion of meltwater from the Mississippi to the St. Lawrence River triggered the YD event."
https://openalex.org/W2015993658,"Computer simulations of flow and sediment transport in the swash zone on a beach demonstrate that a model that couples local flow acceleration and alongshore surface gradient is sufficient to produce uniformly spaced beach cusps. The characteristics of the simulated cusps and the conditions under which they form are in reasonable agreement with observations of natural cusps. The self-organization mechanism in the model is incompatible with an accepted model in which standing alongshore waves drive the regular pattern of erosion and deposition that gives rise to beach cusps. Because the models make similar predictions, it is concluded that currently available observational data are insufficient for discrimination between them."

The existence of at least one other fluoride and two oxyfluorides has been demonstrated. The heaviest ""inert gas,"" radon, also reacts with fluorine, yielding a compound less volatile than xenon tetrafluoride."

In flexor and extensor protoplasts from Samanea saman Merrill, opening and closing of K+ channels were rhythmic in constant darkness. When channels were open in flexor protoplasts they were closed in extensor protoplasts, and vice versa. The rhythms were shifted by a delay in the onset of constant darkness, a response typical of endogenous circadian rhythms. During the light period, the channels in flexor protoplasts were sensitive to red light that was followed by premature darkness; phytochrome was implicated as the photoreceptor."

Lactic dehydrogenase enzymes appear as small rectangular spots lying on an oblique straight line passing through the point of initial application."
https://openalex.org/W2061371732,"Vapor pressure lowering, osmotic pressure, boiling point elevation, and freezing point depression are all related quantitatively to the decrease in μ1soln upon the addition of solute in forming a solution. In any equilibrium system, regardless of whether it is in a gravitational field or whether it contains walls, semipermeable membranes, phase transitions, or solutes, all equilibria are maintained locally, in the small region of the equilibrium, by the equality of μ1soln. If there are several subsystems in a gravitational field, at any fixed height, μi will have the same value in each subsystem into which substance i can get, and μi + Migh is constant throughout the entire system."

https://openalex.org/W2039691592,"Two lines of evidence suggest that large earthquakes that occur on either the San Jacinto fault zone (SJFZ) or the San Andreas fault zone (SAFZ) may be triggered by large earthquakes that occur on the other. First, the great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake in the SAFZ seems to have triggered a progressive sequence of earthquakes in the SJFZ. These earthquakes occurred at times and locations that are consistent with triggering by a strain pulse that propagated southeastward at a rate of 1.7 kilometers per year along the SJFZ after the 1857 earthquake. Second, the similarity in average recurrence intervals in the SJFZ (about 150 years) and in the Mojave segment of the SAFZ (132 years) suggests that large earthquakes in the northern SJFZ may stimulate the relatively frequent major earthquakes on the Mojave segment. Analysis of historic earthquake occurrence in the SJFZ suggests little likelihood of extended quiescence between earthquake sequences."

Reasons are given for the decision to test the Mars environment for microorganisms of aqueous and carbonaceous nature. Experimental considerations involved in sending a life probe to Mars are discussed. Gulliver, a probe for detecting evolved radioactive gases from labeled substrates metabolized by microorganisms, are tentatively selected to be included in the first capsule to be sent to Mars. The development and testing of the probe are described in detail. The possible significance of the probe experiment is discussed. (D.L.C.)"

They will need help in escaping from old ideas, which means escaping from old organizations built on the past. A new sponsoring organization is needed to aid in this effort. With a new intellectual foundation, and the future firmly in mind, then and only then should a new national organization be instituted."

https://openalex.org/W2066187579,"Records in Greenland ice, ocean mud, and ancient corals are revealing abrupt climate shifts during the last ice age. The climate at the end of the last ice age apparently jumped from cold to warmer conditions, jumped back to cold, and then jumped into the present warm weather conditions. The mechanism for this erratic behavior is unknown, but appears to be an interaction of North Atlantic ocean currents and the ice sheets themselves. Warm water from the tropics would evaporate and become more saline and dense as it moved north. The colder, denser water would then sink and flow back to the tropics. The melting of ice caused by the warm water would decrease the salinity of the North Atlantic current, the water would not sink, the return current would be shut down, and the waters surrounding the ice sheets would become colder, slowing melting of the sheets. The cycle could be started again by collapse of the ice sheets from their internal heat. There may be other switches that could cause sudden climate change, as may be evidenced by links between changes in the Pacific and a decade of erratic weather in North America. Researcher would like to identifymore » these switches to prevent them from being activated by human activity.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2002476594,"Pons and Fleischman have published new findings in their cold fusion research. They do not ascribe their results to nuclear fusion but do rule out chemical mechanisms. In the new work they measure the amount of time it takes to boil off a certain amount of heavy water in a cell containing palladium and platinum electrodes. By knowing the rate at which electric power enters the cell, they can calculate how much power should be consumed in boiling off the water. The actual power input falls short by a factor of about 4. The total amount of heat released over the 25-day span of the experiment (including the boil-off period) comes out to 6% more than the input of power could explain, notes a researcher doing similar work at SRI International. Previous critics of their work have not changed their minds about the unreliability of Pons' and Fleischman's work."
