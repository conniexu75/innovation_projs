https://openalex.org/W2076324161,"Methylmalonic aciduria is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by neonatal or infantile ketoacidosis. Leukocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of a 1-year-old child with this disorder converted negligible quantities of propionate-3-C14 to carbon dioxide, but oxidized succinate-1,4-C14 normally, an indication of a block in the conversion of propionate to succinate. Parenteral administration of vitamin B12 resulted in a reduction in methylmalonic acid excretion and an increase in propionate oxidation by leukocytes in vitro. The results suggest a mutation of methylmalonyl-CoA isomerase, a vitamin B12, dependent enzyme which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and provide the first demonstration of vitamin B12 ""dependency"" in man."

https://openalex.org/W1988587485,Phagocytosis of bacteria by rabbit alveolar macrophages is inhibited quantitatively by cigarette smoke in vitro. This phagocytoxic effect was abolished by addition of 0.2 to 0.4 micromole of glutathione or cysteine per milliliter of cigarette smoke. Serum protein was required to obtain both the toxic effect of the smoke and the protective action of the sulfhydryl compounds. The protective role of the sulfhydryl agents suggests an oxidant action of the cigarette smoke on these pulmonary cells.

https://openalex.org/W2015787209,"Dragonfly and damselfly oocytes regularly contain two nucleolus like bodies of different sizes, a primary nucleolus and a secondary nucleolus. The primary nucleolus stains more deeply with RNA stains than with an arginine stain; the seconidary nuicleolus stains conzversely. The primary nulcleolus incorporates uridine under all conditions tested; the secondary, only after precautions have been taken to preserve soluble RNA. Both inicorporate lysine."

One of the mutations has been identified as the insertion of two bases, the other as the insertion of a single base."
https://openalex.org/W2075688028,D-Adenosine-5'-phosphorimidazolide reacts very much more rapidly with D-adenosine than with L-adenosine on a poly-D-uridylic acid template. This permits the partial resolution of DL-adenosine. These experiments suggest that segregation of D- and L-nucleotides may have occurred at an early stage in biochemical evolution.
