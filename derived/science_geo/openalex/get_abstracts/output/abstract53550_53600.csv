https://openalex.org/W1561824493,"Abstract The action of prostaglandins on cyclic AMP levels in rat epididymal fat pads, isolated fat cells, and other tissues was studied. Fat pads incubated with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) contained higher levels of cyclic AMP than controls but lipolysis was not stimulated. However, PGE1 did not cause increased cyclic AMP levels in isolated fat cells, suggesting that the stimulatory action occurred in another cell type. PGE1 at very low concentrations antagonized the action of epinephrine on cyclic AMP levels in both intact fat pads and isolated fat cells. PGE1 was considerably more effective as an inhibitor of epinephrine than PGF1α, and PGF1β was without effect. PGE1 lowered cyclic AMP levels in isolated fat cells very rapidly, and was effective against adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucagon, and thyroid-stimulating hormone as well as the catecholamines. Incubation of intact cell preparations of lung, spleen, diaphragm, kidney, and other tissues with 2.8 µm PGE1 resulted in increased levels of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1482331547,"Abstract An enzymatic technique, with collagenase and hyaluronidase, for the preparation of isolated parenchymal cells from rat liver is described. Most of the cells (90 to 95%) appear structurally intact, but the viability of the cells varies from 75 to 95% in different preparations. The cells respire in Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution, glucose-free Hanks solution, and Medium 199, without added substrate, at rates higher than those previously described for liver cells. Furthermore, linear or near linear rates of endogenous respiration can be maintained for 2 hours. The decline of respiration which then follows is associated with certain of the cells dying off. However, after 25 hours of incubation in Medium 199, approximately 25% of the cells are still viable and respiring, and even after 3 days a few cells are still viable. Respiration is stimulated by calcium ions and by 1% albumin, but not by glucose. The results indicate that the preparative procedure for obtaining the isolated cells is far superior to those previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1800773337,"Abstract Kinetic properties of d(-)-specific lactate dehydrogenase (d-lactate:diphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) from Escherichia coli B indicate the following. 1. The reaction catalyzed is essentially unidirectional, the oxidation of d(-)-lactate with diphosphopyridine nucleotide as coenzyme proceeding at only about 0.01% of the rate of pyruvate reduction. 2. The enzyme shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics for reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, but pyruvate activates it. 3. A lag in the rate of oxidation of the reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide is eliminated by prior incubation with pyruvate. The duration of this lag is independent of enzyme concentration, suggesting that pyruvate causes a change in the conformation of the enzyme rather than in its state of aggregation. The identity of the molecular weight of the enzyme at a very low concentration in the absence and in the presence of the substrate confirms this finding. 4. Two lines of evidence indicate that there are two types of binding sites for pyruvate. The variation of Hill plots with pH is interpretable only in terms of two sites with different binding properties. Furthermore, the two sites bind different substrate analogues. Oxamate is an inhibitor of this enzyme, but does not substitute for pyruvate as an activator. On the other hand, α-ketobutyrate does not inhibit the catalysis but activates the enzyme, converting the substrate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. 5. The kinetic properties of the catalytic site appear to be similar to those of vertebrate l-lactate dehydrogenases, although the dissociation constants for both pyruvate and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide are considerably larger for the E. coli d-lactate dehydrogenase. 6. The kinetic properties of this enzyme are consistent with the course and regulation in vivo of pyruvate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1548158456,"Abstract The d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-lactate:diphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) from Escherichia coli B has been purified to homogeneity. This enzyme, mol wt 115,000, is very sensitive to autoxidation. The amino acid composition has been determined. All 12 of the cysteinyl residues of the enzyme are in the reduced state. Reaction of these cysteinyl residues with arsenite, thiol reagents, or alkylating agents leads to inhibition or inactivation of the enzyme. Pyruvate or diphosphopyridine nucleotide protects the enzyme against alkylation by iodoacetamide. However, the addition of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide causes a significant increase in the rate of alkylation by iodoacetamide, suggesting that the binding of the reduced coenzyme to this lactate dehydrogenase causes a conformational change in the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1541125966,"Abstract A procedure has been described for the purification of nucleoside diphosphatase from bovine liver microsomes. The purified enzyme is shown, by analysis in the ultracentrifuge and by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, to be nearly homogeneous. The enzyme has an s20,w of 4.9 S. Thiamine pyrophosphatase was purified together with nucleoside diphosphatase. Evidence has been obtained which indicates that the nucleoside diphosphates and thiamine pyrophosphate are hydrolyzed by a single enzyme, although the pH activity curves were not identical with the two types of substrates. Both enzyme activities were markedly enhanced by the presence of adenosine triphosphate. The effect of ATP was more pronounced at low substrate concentrations and disappeared as the substrate level increased. ATP was not consumed during the reactions. The effect of ATP was exerted without a measurable lag when it was added during the course of the reaction, and the stimulatory effect was lost immediately when ATP was removed from the reaction mixture. ATP protected the enzyme against heat inactivation, and gel filtration experiments showed ATP to be bound to the enzyme protein. Inosine triphosphate, guanosine triphosphate, and deoxyadenosine triphosphate showed the same degree of stimulatory effect as ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1505164064,"Abstract Extracts from Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites contain a new enzyme which catalyzed the reversible transformation of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate according to the following equation P-enolpyruvate + AMP + PPi ⇄ pyruvate + ATP + Pi The enzyme has been purified 30-fold and freed from interfering amounts of adenylate kinase activity. Unlike known bacterial, yeast, and muscle pyruvate kinases, for which ADP is a substrate, the amebal enzyme employs AMP. It is inactive in the forward direction in the absence of inorganic pyrophosphate. It is suggested that the new enzyme be called pyruvate-phosphate ligase (AMP) and that for the trivial name this be shortened by dropping the parenthetical part."
https://openalex.org/W1507260403,"Abstract Ethanolamine deaminase, a clostridial enzyme that catalyzes the cobamide coenzyme-dependent conversion of ethanolamine to ammonia and acetaldehyde, has been obtained as a homogeneous protein. Isolation of the relatively stable enzyme was facilitated by its unique lack of solubility in solutions with an ionic strength greater than 0.11. The specific activities of apparently homogeneous preparations isolated from different batches of cells are slightly different. A spectrophotometric assay for the detection of less than 1 µg of purified enzyme was developed by coupling the formation of acetaldehyde in the deaminase reaction with DPNH oxidation in the presence of added alcohol dehydrogenase. The deaminase reaction has an absolute requirement for cobamide coenzyme. The apparent Km values for α-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)cobamide coenzyme, α-benzimidazolyl)cobamide coenzyme, and α-(adenylyl)cobamide coenzyme are 1.5 x 10-6, 1.9 x 10-7, and 7.7 x 10-6 m, respectively. Of several compounds tested, only ethanolamine is a substrate for the enzyme. Potassium ion is required for catalytic activity, whereas Li+ and Na+ are competitive inhibitors. The pH optimum for the reaction is 6.8 to 8.2. p-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonate inhibited the deaminase 46% at 3 x 10-4 m. Like the dioldehydrase described by Lee and Abeles (15), ethanolamine deaminase is inactivated by incubation with cobamide coenzyme in the absence of substrate, and both the deaminase and dioldehydrase reactions have a detectable lag period at low levels of cobamide coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1484203152,"Abstract The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the Cu2+ and Fe3+ complexes of transferrin reveal a heterogeneity of the two specific binding sites of the protein in the pH range 4 to 6 when bicarbonate is absent. Between pH 7 and pH 11, however, or when nitrilotriacetate is present in the iron complex at lower pH, only one dominant species is present in each metal-protein complex, so that under these conditions the binding sites are indistinguishable. In the higher pH range, the spectrum of the bicarbonate-free copper-transferrin complex shows superhyperfine splitting which is unusually well resolved in the g|| region and is best interpreted as being a result of the interaction of the unpaired copper electron (hole) with four equivalent nitrogen nuclei. In the copper-transferrin-bicarbonate complex the superhyperfine splitting gives evidence of only one interacting nitrogen nucleus. Spectrophotometric titrations provide evidence that tyrosine residues also participate in copper binding, as well as in iron binding. It seems probable, therefore, that the metal-binding sites of transferrin have available 4 nitrogen ligands and 2 or 3 oxygen ligands."

https://openalex.org/W3146353419,"Abstract The phosphatidylmyoinositol dimannosides (dimannophosphoinositides) of mycobacteria occur in multiply acylated forms, two fatty acids being attached to the glycerol part of the phospholipid and additional fatty acids being esterified to available hydroxyls on the mannose or myoinositol parts. This report describes a particulate enzyme in Mycobacterium phlei which is specific in its ability to incorporate labeled fatty acids into the dimannophosphoinositides. The acylation requires coenzyme A and ATP, and it is shown that fatty acyl coenzyme A can replace these two substances in the reaction. The fatty acid specificity of the enzyme is broader than the range of fatty acids found in the lipids in the cell; in addition to palmitic and tuberculostearic acid, myristic, stearic, and oleic acid are effective substrates. The first acylation step has been clearly shown. Pure dimannophosphoinositide C (two fatty acids) is acylated by palmityl coenzyme A to yield dimannophosphoinositide B (three fatty acids). The further acylation of the latter to dimannophosphoinositide A (four fatty acids) is observed in short incubation periods, but this is followed by the conversion (deacylation) of the product to isomeric forms of dimannophosphoinositide B and C. Evidence is presented that this occurs via still more highly acylated members of the dimannophosphoinositide family. The enzyme system in M. phlei that is responsible for the biosynthesis of the dimannophosphoinositides from phosphatidylmyoinositol and GDP-mannose has been examined in more detail. Evidence has been obtained for heterogeneity in the dimannophosphoinositide B component of the products of this reaction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which provides a further indication for the existence of isomeric forms of these lipids. An over-all scheme is suggested for the biosynthesis of these complex lipids in Mycobacterium species."
https://openalex.org/W1602467024,"Cobra venoms contain heat stable, basic, proteins that inhibit iodide accumulation by thyroid slices. Activity is not related to the content of phospholipase A or various other enzymatic activities. These proteins are present only in Elapid venoms and not in snakes of the Crotalidae or Viperidae families. Two such basic proteins, named cobramines A and B, have been purified from the crude venom of the Indian cobra (Naja naja) by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography, gel filtration, and ammonium sulfate crystallization. Together they constitute ∼40% of the venom protein. Their isoelectric points are ∼11.9 and ∼12.6, respectively. Cobramine B was found to be homogeneous in paper and disc gel electrophoresis and by ultracentrifugation (s20, w = 0.98). The molecular weight was 6400 from equilibrium centrifugation measurements and 5840 on the basis of amino acid analysis (52 residues)."
https://openalex.org/W1496045846,"Enzymatic incorporation of abequose into the repeating unit of the O-antigen is catalyzed by the particulate cell envelope fraction of Salmonella typhimurium. The initial step is the formation of a lipid-linked tetrasaccharide intermediate according to the reaction cytidine diphosphate abequose + mannosyl-rhamnosyl-galactose-1-PP-lipid → abequosyl-mannosyl-rhamnosyl-galactose-1-PP-lipid. The tetrasaccharide-lipid intermediate has been isolated by extraction into chloroform-methanol, and the oligosaccharide moiety identified. Subsequent polymerization reactions lead to formation of O-antigen polysaccharide chains containing tetrasaccharide repeating units. Isolation of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide corresponding to a dimer of the repeating unit provides direct evidence that the growing O-antigen chain remains attached to lipid during polymerization. Evidence that the structure of the enzymatically synthesized polysaccharide corresponds to that of authentic O-antigen has been obtained by isolation and characterization of abequose-containing oligosaccharides following degradation of the polymers with periodate."

https://openalex.org/W1543053499,"Abstract We isolated l-glycerol 3-phosphate: NAD oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.8) from the cytoplasm of rat skeletal muscle. The crystalline enzyme was homogeneous as judged by electrophoresis at pH 5.4, 7.0, and 8.6, by amino acid analysis, and by ion exchange column chromatography. It was free of at least high molecular weight contaminants on ultracentrifugation. The purest enzyme fraction obtained had a specific activity of 263 units per mg of protein, corresponding to the ability to catalyze the oxidation of 126 µmoles of NADH per min per mg of protein, under assay conditions in which the enzyme was not saturated with substrate. The corresponding molecular activity was 7,380 molecules of NADH oxidized per min per molecule of enzyme of molecular weight 58,300. The molar extinction coefficient at 280 mµ was 0.38 x 105 m-1 cm-1. Amino acid analysis based on milligrams of protein hydrolyzed or on assumed unit residues showed 3 tyrosine, 2 tryptophan, 8 arginine, 9 cysteine or half-cystine, and 28 lysine plus arginine residues per minimal molecular weight, which was 29,150. Molecular weight estimation by gel filtration gave 63,000. Peptide mapping of the 14C-S-carboxymethylated enzyme showed 3 tyrosine, 1 or 2 tryptophan, 7 arginine, 7 to 11 14C-S-carboxymethylcysteine, and 29 tryptic peptides. These chemical studies show that the enzyme has a molecular weight of 58,300 and is composed of two subunits that are indistinguishable by peptide mapping. This molecular weight is not consistent with the accepted value for the crystalline rabbit muscle enzyme, even though these two enzymes are closely related in their electrophoretic properties, extinction coefficients expressed per gram, kinetic properties, ratios of amino acids, and, presumably, genetic origins. The molecular weight of the rat muscle enzyme is closer to that of the enzyme crystallized from bee thoraces (65,400)."

https://openalex.org/W1498048721,"Abstract Cholesterol side chain cleavage has been shown to be dependent on the electron carrier chain involving a cytochrome P-450 reductase system, flavoprotein and nonheme iron-protein of the ferredoxin type, and the oxygen-activating cytochrome P-450. The reaction is markedly inhibited by carbon monoxide. The cytochrome oxidase system inhibits the cleavage reaction by diverting the flow of electrons through the cytochrome oxidase pathway. Inhibition is reversed by cyanide. Steroid products resulting from the cleavage reaction are pregnenolone, progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone. These products were isolated and identified by paper chromatographic techniques and recrystallization to radiochemical homogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1596079206,"Abstract Escherichia coli cells were grown in the presence of radioactive 65Zn and subjected to osmotic shock. Two enzymes, 5'-nucleotidase and cyclic phosphodiesterase, were purified from the shock fluid. Other evidence indicates that 5'-nucleotidase was brought to a stage of purification corresponding to that of a homogeneous protein. The purifications were accompanied by a considerable enrichment with respect to 65Zn, which could not be removed by dialysis. Superimposable peaks of enzyme activity and 65Zn were observed for both enzymes. Cyclic phosphodiesterase and 5'-nucleotidase were inactivated after prolonged exposure to ethylenediaminetetraacetate and partial reactivation was achieved with Zn++. Treatment of 5'-nucleotidase with acid caused loss of activity associated with release of 65Zn. The preparation could be reactivated by low concentrations of each of several divalent metal ions. It is suggested that cyclic phosphodiesterase and 5'-nucleotidase are metalloproteins and possibly zinc metalloenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2035010827,"4-HYDROXYLAMINOQUINOLINE I-oxide (4-HAQO) is a reductive product of a carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline I-oxide (4-NQO), and is thought to be a more procimate carcinogen1–3. Enzyme conversion of 4-NQO to 4-HAQO is known to occur in mammalian cells4. When 4-HAQO or 4-NQO was injected intraperitoneally into rats bearing ascites hepatoma AH-130, DNA isolated from AH-130 cells showed the presence of fluorescent compound which has emission maxima at 470 mµ and excitation maxima at 360 mµ This fluorescent compound seemed to be covalently bound to the DNA molecule5,6. This paper deals with another action of 4-HAQO on DNA, namely that of making single strand scissions of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1656293431,"Abstract This work is a kinetic investigation of the reaction mechanism of malate dehydrogenase, prepared from washed mince of whole bovine heart by a variation on previous methods. The forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by this enzyme have been studied at pH 8.0 in the presence and in the absence of one product at a time, with the use of a recording fluorometer to measure changes in the concentration of NADH. The initial velocity pattern in the absence of products and the product inhibition pattern have been determined. These are consistent with an ordered mechanism which has a kinetically significant ternary complex, and in which the coenzyme substrates combine with the free enzyme. Values have been determined for all the Michaelis, dissociation, and inhibition constants of the reaction. The dissociation constants determined for the coenzymes acting as substrates differ from estimates of the same constants obtained by studying the coenzymes as product inhibitors. These effects may be related to substrate inhibition by oxalacetate and substrate activation by malate, which have been observed previously. The rate constants calculated for the separate reaction steps in the mechanism reveal that the simplest Bi mechanism (Cleland, W. W., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 67, 104 (1963)) does not apply; they are consistent with an Ordered mechanism in which the enzyme-oxidized coenzyme complex isomerizes. As with other dehydrogenases for which this condition applies, the possibility cannot be excluded that the enzyme-reduced coenzyme complex may also isomerize."
https://openalex.org/W1479936893,"The conversion of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl coenzyme A has been investigated with enzyme preparations made from Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on valine. A protein fraction has been obtained which catalyzes the oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde with NAD as the electron acceptor. The product of methylmalonate semialdehyde oxidation in the presence of CoA is heat stable, reacts with hydroxylamine to form propionohydroxamate, is eluted from a chromatographic column of Dowex 1 in the same position as propionyl-CoA, and therefore, appears to be propionyl-CoA. The product of propionaldehyde oxidation in the presence of CoA also has been characterized as propionyl-CoA since it is heat stable and reacts with hydroxylamine to form propionohydroxamate. Oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde and propionaldehyde is accompanied by the formation of equal amounts of NADH and an active acyl compound, the latter estimated as the hydroxamate. When CoA is omitted from the reaction mixture, high levels of mercaptoethanol will restore enzyme activity, but catalytic activity is altered. In the presence of CoA, the pH activity curve for the oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde is much broader and the specific activity of the enzyme is higher than when CoA is absent. Omission of CoA from reaction mixtures has little effect on the pH activity curve for the oxidation of propionaldehyde however. Other enzymes concerned with propionyl-CoA metabolism which have been identified in extracts of P. aeruginosa are phosphotransacetylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and lactyl-CoA dehydrase."

https://openalex.org/W1488412853,"Abstract The formation of glyceric acid from either l(+)- or mesotartaric acid by Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas acidovorans involves a dismutation by which the tartaric acids are oxidized by DPN to oxaloglycolic acid which, in turn, undergoes a DPNH-linked reductive decarboxylation. Oxaloglycolic acid is readily decarboxylated nonenzymatically to form a mixture of hydroxypyruvic acid and tartronic semialdehyde, each of which serves as a substrate for specific, pyridine nucleotide-linked reductases which catalyze the formation of d-glyceric acid. Enzymes for each of the steps noted are present in both organisms when growth occurs on either of the tartaric acids. The end product is d-glyceric acid, regardless of the route utilized."

Both qualitative and quantitative differences are found in the requirement for monovalent cation, depending on whether meso- or l(+)-tartrate serves as substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1531755358,"Abstract Magnetic resonance and relative enzymatic velocity studies with the use of the paramagnetic manganese ion were carried out on creatine kinase inactivated by the specific —SH reagents iodoacetic acid and dinitrofluorobenzene and by the nonspecific reagents urea and decyl sulfate. Modification of creatine kinase at the two essential —SH groups by iodoacetic acid or dinitrofluorobenzene affected the enzymatic velocity, but had little, if any, effect on the binding constants or the environment at the binding sites of Mn-ADP-, ADP3-, Mn-2'-dADP-, or Mn-ATP2-, as determined from the enhancement of the relaxation rate of the water protons due to formation of ternary complexes of enzyme, manganese, and nucleotide. The addition of creatine to the ternary Mn-ADP-enzyme complex with the native enzyme caused a change in the proton relaxation rate measured over the temperature range, 2°–43°; as the temperature decreased the binding constant of Mn-ADP changed slightly, but the creatine-binding constant increased by a factor of about 30. The effect of creatine on the proton relaxation rate of water could be ascribed to a decreased rate of exchange of the manganese water ligands with the solvent water in the quaternary complex relative to the ternary complex and to a longer correlation time for the dipole-dipole interaction between manganese and water in the coordination sphere because of increased immobilization at the binding site of Mn-ADP. No such effect of creatine was observed for enzyme with the two essential cysteine residues carboxymethylated, indicating either that creatine is no longer bound to this form of the enzyme or that carboxymethylation of the essential —SH groups prevents interaction between the creatine and manganese-nucleotide-binding sites. The decrease in the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate of the ternary complex with increasing urea concentration was correlated with loss of activity. The inactivation of creatine kinase by high concentrations of urea was reversible. The inactivation of creatine kinase by decyl sulfate was irreversible. In the presence of 0.01 m decyl sulfate, relatively high values were obtained for the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate of the manganese-enzyme complex, and this enhancement decreased on the addition of ADP, the reverse of the behavior of the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1592702600,"Abstract An antimycin-resistant mutant of Torulopsis utilis has been isolated following acriflavine treatment. NADH oxidase, succinicoxidase, and cytochrome c reductase activities in respiratory particles prepared from the mutant, in comparison with particles prepared from the wild type, were relatively insensitive to antimycin; 30 to 35 times as much antibiotic was required for 50% inhibition of succinic oxidase activity. The mutant was also relatively insensitive to inhibition by 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide. An excellent correspondence was found between the amount of antimycin required to inhibit succinic oxidase activity maximally and the amount which will bind to respiratory particles from the wild type. Eighty per cent less antimycin binding per mg of protein was observed in particles obtained from the mutant. A comparison of the rates of various electron transport activities in preparations from wild type and mutant did not reveal any large differences in specific activities."
https://openalex.org/W1550191252,"Abstract l-α-Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase was demonstrated to be inhibited by a homologous series of N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides, ranging from the N1-methyl to the N1-dodecyl derivative, inclusive. The inhibition obtained was observed to be reversible and competitive with respect to the coenzyme NAD. The binding of N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides larger than the N1-pentyl derivative to glycerophosphate dehydrogenase was shown to be facilitated through nonpolar interactions with the enzyme. Adenosine, adenylic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine diphosphoribose were also shown to be coenzyme-competitive inhibitors of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The effectiveness of binding of these compounds increased with the size of the adenine derivative employed. Multiple inhibition analysis was used to demonstrate simultaneous binding of inhibitors that interact with different regions of the NAD-binding site of the enzyme. Inhibitors interacting with the same regions of the NAD-binding site were shown to mutually exclude one another from binding to the enzyme. It was suggested that the binding of NAD to glycerophosphate dehydrogenase occurs through interactions involving the adenosine moiety, the pyrophosphate grouping, and the positively charged nicotinamide ring system. The presence of a hydrophobic region near the NAD-binding site of the enzyme was indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1500995531,"The copper(II) equilibria of triglycine have been investigated in 3.0 m (Na)ClO4 medium at 25° with glass and copper amalgam electrodes. The range of B, the total concentration of copper(II) ions, was 1 to 100 m m ; the range of A, the total concentration of triglycine, was 2 to 250 m m ; and the pH range was 1.5 to 11. The dipolar ion form of triglycine = HA, Y = (H - h)/A, h = [H+], and b = [Cu2+]. Two sets of data (Y against log h at constant A, B) and (log B/b against A at constant h, B) were recorded. They were treated independently, first by the use of various graphical methods assuming the existence of any species of the type CupHqAr(2p+q-r)+ and then by the use of the general (least squares) minimizing computer program, Letagrop (19). The mean composition of the complexes and the “best” sets of equilibrium constants are tabulated. It is concluded that mononuclear species CuHqA(1+q)+, having q = 1, 0, −1, −2, predominate at low B and A. At higher concentrations (≥10 m m ), there is also evidence for some CuHqA2q+ and Cu2HqA2(2+q)+. Of these, species with (p, q) equal to (1, 0), (1, −1), (1, −2) and (2, 1), (2, 0) (2, −2), (2, −4) give the best agreement with the experimental data. Deviations can largely be described to small analytical errors but may also indicate some minor species, if so probably CuH2A22+ and Cu2H2A24+."
https://openalex.org/W1494386493,"Abstract When 14C-l-lysine is incubated with cell-free extracts of Clostridium SB4, a new basic amino acid is formed. This compound does not accumulate when lysine is fermented in the presence of intrinsic factor. The basic amino acid has been isolated in radiochemically pure form. It is not oxidized by chloramine-T or periodate, it yields about 1 mole of acetic acid per mole in the Kuhn-Roth C-terminal methyl group determination, and it reversibly forms a lactam. The data support the conclusion that this new amino acid, which requires a cobamide coenzyme for formation, is 3,5-diaminohexanoic acid. The basic amino acid is readily fermented to volatile acids by extracts of Clostridium SB4. It appears to be an intermediate in the fermentation of lysine."
https://openalex.org/W26356489,"A purified, NADH-linked, d (-)-specific lactate dehydrogenase from Butyribacterium rettgeri was shown to be inhibited by ATP. Several other nucleotides were also capable of inhibiting the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme but, at equivalent concentrations, none was found to be as effective as ATP. The inhibition by ATP appears to be of the partially competitive type with respect to NADH. This suggests that ATP may interact with the enzyme at a site distinct from the coenzyme-binding site. On the other hand, ATP seems to be an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to pyruvate, i.e. at any given concentration of ATP, maximum inhibition was observed only when the enzyme was fully saturated with pyruvate. Although pyruvate appeared to increase the affinity of the lactate dehydrogenase for ATP, it was shown to cause a slight increase in the apparent K m for NADH. This differential effect of the substrate on the apparent affinities of the enzyme for the inhibitor and its coenzyme supports the hypothesis that separate sites are involved in binding the two compounds. Interactions of the enzyme with its coenzyme or the nucleotide inhibitor may result in conformational alterations of the protein. ATP protected the enzyme against heat inactivation and NADH reversed this protective effect, although the coenzyme itself had no effect on the heat lability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526083608,"Abstract d-Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase was extensively purified from swine kidney by a simplified procedure which involved chromatography on cellulose phosphate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and separation on Sephadex G-200. The final specific activity of the enzyme was 25.2 µmoles per min per mg and 34% of the activity present in the crude extract was recovered. The stability of the purified enzyme was greatly increased by the addition of 0.01 m β-mercaptoethylamine and 0.0005 m 8-hydroxyquinoline. The purified enzyme was sensitive to inhibition by adenosine monophosphate and high concentrations of d-fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The preparation was essentially homogeneous after electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and elution from cellulose phosphate and Sephadex G-200 columns. Ultracentrifugal sedimentation analysis revealed the presence of a major symmetrical peak with s20, ω = 7.5 and a minor symmetrical peak with s20, ω = 3.6. The proportion of the minor peak was increased by dialysis of the enzyme preparation. The molecular weight of swine kidney d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase calculated from data obtained by ultracentrifugation, chromatography on Sephadex G-200, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation was 129,500 and that of the minor component was about 65,000. The turnover number of the enzyme was 3250 moles of d-fructose 1,6-diphosphate converted to fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate per min per mole of enzyme.

This is accompanied by an 80 to 90% reduction in the rate of protein synthesis by the cells. The phenethyl alcohol-induced loss of polyribosomes is prevented by treating cells with actidione (cycloheximide) before phenethyl alcohol. This result suggests that the loss of polyribosomes after treatment with phenethyl alcohol probably results from the normal release of ribosomes from the messenger upon completion of polypeptide chains and a simultaneous interference by phenethyl alcohol with the reattachment of ribosomes to messenger RNA. Messenger RNA is conserved during treatment with phenethyl alcohol, since upon removal of the chemical from the cells protein synthesis resumes in the presence of actinomycin D at about 80% of the normal rate with the concomitant re-formation of the polyribosomes. Experiments were undertaken to elucidate the fate of messenger RNA after treatment with phenethyl alcohol. Cells were pulse labeled with 3H-uridine and then incubated with phenethyl alcohol plus actinomycin D. Cytoplasmic extracts from these cells were analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The results indicate that the phenethyl alcohol-induced disaggregation of polyribosomes is accompanied by a loss of about one-half of the pulse-labeled messenger RNA from the cytoplasm. The remainder remains associated with cytoplasmic membranous structures. Re-formation of polyribosomes after removal of phenethyl alcohol appears to proceed via a direct attachment of 80 S or 110 S ribosomes to conserved messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2068184700,"A pancreatic ribonuclease digest of carbon-14-labeled Satellite Tobacco Necrosis Virus RNA was fractionated, according to charge, by column chromatography. Individual fractions were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphomonoesterase and rechromatogramed. The fraction originally containing oligonucleotides with seven negative charges separated into two components corresponding to five and two negative charges, respectively, and therefore must have contained a terminal trinucleotide 5'-pyrophosphate, in addition to the internal hexanucleotides. Other fractions when similarly treated were found to contain only internal oligonucleotides."

The system depended on the addition of the following components:succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, cytochrome c, cytochrome oxidase, Q10, and phospholipids. The rate of oxidation was quite rapid, comparable to that of submitochondrial particles."

https://openalex.org/W1536560548,"Abstract The kinetics of the reactions catalyzed by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Zymobacterium oroticum have been studied by means of a rapid mixing-freezing technique and observation by electron paramagnetic resonance and optical reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature. With both DPNH and dihydroorotate as reducing substrate, within the limits of error, the kinetics of appearance or disappearance of the radical signal and the signal at g = 1.94 were identical. The reduction of the flavin to the fully reduced state is not a catalytically significant reaction. Reduction of the enzyme components by DPNH is a fast step with a half-time of a few milliseconds, whereas reoxidation by orotate or oxygen is relatively slow and limiting in turnover. In the steady state, with DPNH as substrate, the electron carriers in the enzyme are largely reduced even in the presence of excess orotate or oxygen. The turnover numbers calculated from the present experiments agree with those derived from the kinetics of over-all catalysis under catalytic assay conditions. The formation of ferrous phenanthroline is a much slower reaction than the appearance of the g = 1.94 signal, even when enzyme previously reduced by DPNH is mixed with the chelator, and is not a suitable indicator of catalytically significant changes in the enzyme. It is concluded that formation of flavin semiquinone and electron uptake by a protein-bound iron complex of unknown structure are both catalytically significant reaction steps in all presently known reactions of the enzyme. In the presence of a mercurial, an electron path to oxygen not involving the iron complex with electron paramagnetic resonance signal at g = 1.94 may be established, while all other catalytic functions are severely impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1540702174,"Abstract Escherichia coli grown in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate revealed a selective depression in the levels of cyclic phosphodiesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, and alkaline phosphatase. This was not due to the formation of an inhibitor. The reduction was most striking when the concentration of EDTA was sufficient to cause a small impairment of growth. However, substantial reduction in enzyme activity could also be demonstrated in the presence of excess MgCl2; under such conditions growth was normal. Six other enzymes were unaffected by exposure to the chelating agent, and the patterns of ribosomal RNA were normal. Cells grown in the presence of EDTA were abnormally sensitive to actinomycin D and showed reduced uptake of 3H-uracil into acid-insoluble products. Experiments with purified, 14C-labeled EDTA indicated that the cells did not take up this material. It is suggested that EDTA acts by binding a trace metal ion essential for the activity of cyclic phosphodiesterase, 5'-nucleotidase, and alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1590943447,"Abstract When dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, from Zymobacterium oroticum, was reduced by DPNH or dihydroorotate and examined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry, a relatively intense free radical signal and the asymmetric signal at g = 1.94, found in many nonheme iron proteins, were observed within a few milliseconds. Both shape and saturation with microwave power of the free radical signals varied with the specific electron-donating and -accepting substrates, the presence of an inhibitor, the pH, and the time of reaction. Optical reflectance spectra of frozen samples indicated formation of at least two intermediates, one typical for DPNH plus enzyme (λmax at 565 and at 610 to 620 mµ) and one for dihydroorotate (or DPNH plus orotate) and enzyme (λmax at 585 and 640 mµ). These optical and electron paramagnetic resonance observations point to a variety of intermediate species in the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. The maximal free radical signals, obtained rapidly with DPNH at pH 6.5, were approximately 1.5 times those which appeared with dihydroorotate at pH 8.2, whereas the iron signals were more nearly comparable."

No difference in incorporation could be seen when DPN+ labeled in either the nicotinamide or the adenine portion of the molecule was used. Incorporation is not dependent on endogenous phosphate and proceeds equally well in a State 4 or a State 3 system. The uptake of DPN+ by mitochondria is also stimulated by oligomycin and can be supported by ATP in the presence of antimycin A. This latter reaction is inhibited by both oligomycin and 2,4-dinitrophenol."

The relative rates of synthesis of the various virus proteins late in infection were remarkably constant regardless of cell type infected. This was true in cell lines that produced only small amounts of virus and virus proteins, as well as in those that gave large yields of viruses and virus proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1577365122,"Abstract Particulate preparations obtained from a number of tissues, including liver, kidney, and muscle inactivated renal d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase when they were incubated with the enzyme in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, magnesium ion, and cysteine. Purified swine kidney d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase and rat kidney uridine diphosphate-d-glucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase were inactivated by washed rat kidney cortex mitochondria. The initial rate of the reaction was dependent on the concentration of mitochondria, d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, and adenosine nucleotides, and magnesium ion and cysteine were required for maximum activity. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme by mitochondria was stimulated by the addition of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine monophosphate and to a lesser extent by adenosine triphosphate. The addition of malate and succinate to the incubation mixture decreased the rate of inactivation. Under the experimental conditions used in this study the rate of inactivation was approximately 1.1 x 10-3 µmole of d-fructose 1,6-diphosphatase per min per g of tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2117756065,"Abstract Influences of different concentrations of salts (0.002 to 1.25 eq per liter) on the binding of skatole and acetyl-l-tryptophan at the primary binding site of bovine plasma albumin have been studied by equilibrium dialysis. With the exception of Na2-ethylenediaminetetraacetate and ethylenediammonium aspartate, which have little effect, all salts in the concentration range of 0.005 to 0.1 eq per liter inhibit the binding of acetyl-l-tryptophan; their order of effectiveness, which is invariant with salt concentration, is KClO4 g KSCN g KI g LiCl g CaCl2 g KF g KCl g NaCl g ethylenediammonium chloride g K2SO4. With skatole the addition of halide-like salts (except KF) in the concentration range of 0 to 0.05 eq per liter increases the binding markedly. The order at 0.002 eq per liter solute is KClO4 g KSCN g KI g ethylenediammonium chloride g KCl g LiCl g CaCl2 (this order is consistent with increased skatole binding with increased salt anion binding). Between 0.05 and 0.25 eq per liter binding of skatole decreases with further addition of KClO4 and KSCN, remains approximately constant with further addition of KI, but increases with further addition of the Cl- salts. Other solutes have no effect (Na2-ethylenediaminetetraacetate, ethylenediammonium aspartate, K2SO4, and glycine), or a small enhancing effect (KF) on skatole binding. Between 0.25 and 1.25 eq per liter the addition of most salts increases the binding of skatole. The salt concentration binding profile of β-3-indolylethanol in KSCN solutions is similar to that of acetyl-l-tryptophan, implying that the charge of the acetyl-l-tryptophan is not the element which leads to the differences between its binding and that of skatole. Effects of SCN- and Cl- on acetyl-l-tryptophan-albumin binding show direct competitive inhibition as well as anomalous ionic strength effects. It is concluded that the primary influence of salts is against the polar elements of the binding center."

https://openalex.org/W1539056469,"Abstract Exogenous pyruvate was found to have an inhibitory effect on aerobic glycolysis in guinea pig cerebral cortex slices. Under conditions of electrical stimulation, inhibition by pyruvate was not observed. Pyruvate acts as an oxidant by formation of lactate which may explain the observed lower NADH:NAD ratio. This may relieve the NADH inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, accelerate the removal of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and cause the defacilitation of phosphofructokinase. This would account for the observation that, in the steady state, pyruvate caused a rise in glucose 6-phosphate and a fall in fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations. Omission of phosphate from the tissue medium, although not sufficient to decrease aerobic glycolysis, had a marked effect on the level of glycolytic intermediates and appeared to increase the effects of pyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W2046619324,"Muchnik and Gage1 have recently suggested that bromides act as sedatives by reducing the amount of transmitter substances released at synapses in the central nervous system. The evidence in favour of this suggestion is that the replacement of external chloride by bromide ions reduces the quantal content of the end-plate potential (e.p.p.) of frog skeletal muscle fibres. This result, however, was obtained in experiments in which neuromuscular transmission was already blocked, and the quantal content of the e.p.p. greatly reduced, by the presence of magnesium ions and a subnormal concentration of calcium ions. It therefore seemed of interest to investigate the action of bromide ions on synaptic transmission in an otherwise normal ionic environment."
