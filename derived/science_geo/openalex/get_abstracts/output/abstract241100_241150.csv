https://openalex.org/W2023424615,"During vertebrate development, successive phases of embryonic and fetal myogenesis lead to the formation and growth of skeletal muscles. Although the origin and molecular regulation of the earliest embryonic muscle cells is well understood, less is known about later stages of myogenesis. We have identified a new cell population that expresses the transcription factors Pax3 and Pax7 (paired box proteins 3 and 7) but no skeletal-muscle-specific markers. These cells are maintained as a proliferating population in embryonic and fetal muscles of the trunk and limbs throughout development. Using a stable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter targeted to Pax3, we demonstrate that they constitute resident muscle progenitor cells that subsequently become myogenic and form skeletal muscle. Late in fetal development, these cells adopt a satellite cell position characteristic of progenitor cells in postnatal muscle. In the absence of both Pax3 and Pax7, further muscle development is arrested and only the early embryonic muscle of the myotome forms. Cells failing to express Pax3 or Pax7 die or assume a non-myogenic fate. We conclude that this resident Pax3/Pax7-dependent progenitor cell population constitutes a source of myogenic cells of prime importance for skeletal muscle formation, a finding also of potential value in the context of cell therapy for muscle disease."

Here we identify a SNP in the promoter region of FCRL3, a member of the Fc receptor-like family, that is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (odds ratio = 2.15, P = 0.00000085). This polymorphism alters the binding affinity of nuclear factor-kappaB and regulates FCRL3 expression. We observed high FCRL3 expression on B cells and augmented autoantibody production in individuals with the disease-susceptible genotype. We also found associations between the SNP and susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. FCRL3 may therefore have a pivotal role in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2035672439,"Cellular protein folding is challenged by environmental stress and aging, which lead to aberrant protein conformations and aggregation. One way to antagonize the detrimental consequences of protein misfolding is to reactivate vital proteins from aggregates. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp104 facilitates disaggregation and reactivates aggregated proteins with assistance from Hsp70 (Ssa1) and Hsp40 (Ydj1). The small heat shock proteins, Hsp26 and Hsp42, also function in the recovery of misfolded proteins and prevent aggregation in vitro, but their in vivo roles in protein homeostasis remain elusive. We observed that after a sublethal heat shock, a majority of Hsp26 becomes insoluble. Its return to the soluble state during recovery depends on the presence of Hsp104. Further, cells lacking Hsp26 are impaired in the disaggregation of an easily assayed heat-aggregated reporter protein, luciferase. In vitro, Hsp104, Ssa1, and Ydj1 reactivate luciferase:Hsp26 co-aggregates 20-fold more efficiently than luciferase aggregates alone. Small Hsps also facilitate the Hsp104-mediated solubilization of polyglutamine in yeast. Thus, Hsp26 renders aggregates more accessible to Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1. Small Hsps partially suppress toxicity, even in the absence of Hsp104, potentially by sequestering polyglutamine from toxic interactions with other proteins. Hence, Hsp26 plays an important role in pathways that defend cells against environmental stress and the types of protein misfolding seen in neurodegenerative disease.

Most of them form dynamic oligomeric structures ranging from 9 to 50 subunits (4Haslbeck M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). sHsps share a conserved α-crystallin domain of 80-100 amino acids at their C terminus (4Haslbeck M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), whereas their N-terminal regions are highly variable in sequence and length (5Haslbeck M. Ignatiou A. Saibil H. Helmich S. Frenzl E. Stromer T. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two sHsps, Hsp26 and Hsp42. Both proteins are highly expressed when yeast cells enter respiratory growth in preparation for transition to stationary phase or when subjected to moderate heat stress (6Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although yeast cells deleted for HSP26 or HSP42 show no overt heat sensitivity or thermotolerance defects, they do accumulate protein aggregates (6Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Petko L. Lindquist S. Cell. 1986; 45: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The aggregated proteins in both deletion mutants overlap substantially, suggesting at least partially overlapping roles of Hsp26 and Hsp42 (6Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In vitro, Hsp26 and Hsp42 form distinct oligomeric complexes and assemble into large co-complexes with aggregation-prone proteins upon heat shock (6Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N.

It has been proposed that sHsps aid in the refolding of denatured proteins by holding them in a reactivation-competent state (4Haslbeck M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Reactivation of aggregated proteins in yeast is carried out by Hsp104 with assistance from the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system both in vivo and in vitro (12Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Hsp104 is a member of the AAA+ superfamily of proteins that is generally associated with structural remodeling of proteins and protein complexes. Recent work demonstrates that the prokaryotic homolog of Hsp104, ClpB, achieves disaggregation by active unfolding of protein aggregates followed by refolding by Hsp70/Hsp40. Also, the prokaryotic sHsps, IbpA/B, were shown to assist in the reactivation of aggregated substrates by ClpB, Hsp70, and Hsp40 (13Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwulbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Mogk A. Schlieker C. Friedrich K.L. Schonfeld H.J. Vierling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31033-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Hsp26 facilitates the disaggregation of aggregated proteins after heat shock by Hsp104 in vivo and in vitro. This is achieved by the co-assembly of Hsp26 with misfolded proteins that bolster access of the disaggregation machinery composed of Hsp104/Hsp70 and Hsp40. As an example of sHsp action relevant to protein misfolding diseases in humans, we demonstrate that sHsps together with Hsp104 antagonize polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity. Yeast media were prepared using complete supplemental mixtures from Q-BIOGene, Irvine, CA. All strains were constructed in W303 background and are listed in supplemental Table I. Gene deletion strains were constructed using the short flanking homology method using kanamycin or hygromycin resistance cassettes as described (15Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). Primers used for gene deletions are listed in supplemental Table II. Transformation of yeast was performed as described in Ito et al. (16Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast integrating plasmids for the expression of huntingtin exon I-CFP fusions (25Q and 72Q in pRS303 plasmid backbone, 2M. Duennwald, S. Jagadish, F. Giorgini, S. Willingham, S. L. Lindquist, and P. J. Muchowski, manuscript in preparation. were linearized by restriction with BstXI prior to transformation. Plasmids for the overexpression of Hsp104, Hsp26, and Hsp42 are described in supplemental Table III. For growth assays, required strains were grown overnight in selective media. Cell densities were equalized and spotted in 5-fold dilutions on appropriate selective medium using a spotter (Frogger, V&P Scientific, Inc). The plates were documented after 2-3 days of incubation at 30 °C. Protein extractions for immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (17Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and filter retardation assays of aggregated material were performed essentially as described (18Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Dot blots were performed exactly like the filter retardation assays except using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes instead of cellulose acetate. For the induction of expression of polyglutamine huntingtin fragment in yeast, cultures were grown at 30 °C in raffinose containing liquid medium (2%) and transferred to galactose containing medium. After 8 h of growth in galactose, cells were harvested for protein extraction and filter retardation assays. Hsp104, Ssa1, and Ydj1 were purified as described earlier (19Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Purified Hsp26 and antibodies to Hsp26 and Hsp42 were kind gifts of Professor Johannes Buchner and Dr. Martin Haslbeck at Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany. Firefly luciferase and the assay kit were purchased from Promega Corporation. Starter cultures were grown overnight in YPD medium (yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose) at 30 °C. 70 ml of YPD/strain was inoculated using the starter cultures at a density of 0.05 absorbance units at 600 nm (A600). They were allowed to grow at 30 °C till they reached an A600 value of 0.5 (mid-log phase). Cultures were subjected to 37 °C for 30 min (pretreatment) followed by 46 °C for 30 or 60 min (sublethal heat shock). The cultures were allowed to recover at 30 °C after addition of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) to block protein synthesis. 10-ml samples were removed at various stages as indicated. The cell pellets were washed with water and frozen at -80 °C until use. Protein samples were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in 220 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.9), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/ml zymolyase (Seikagaku) and 25 units of Benzonase™ nuclease (Novagen) containing 1 tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture in 5 ml) incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by sonication in a cup horn sonicator (Virsonic) with 6 × 5-s pulses of 50 watts. Cell ghosts were removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 1 min. 200 μl of supernatant were collected as the total protein extract. The protein concentrations in all samples were equalized. 100 μl of the total extract was subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min to separate the soluble and aggregated proteins. 100-μl supernatants were removed into fresh tubes, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. Two-dimensional PAGE was performed following manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) using the DryStrip (pH 4-7) for first dimension and ExcelGel SDS 12-14% for second dimension with the Multiphor II system. Each spot was dried in a 1.5-ml tube before submitting them for protein identification at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymers Facility at the University of Texas South Western. For analysis by SDS-PAGE, all samples were boiled for 10 min after the addition of SDS-sample loading buffer. For Western blotting, 10 μl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies against Hsp26 or Hsp42. For thermotolerance assays, cells were pretreated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by 48 or 50 °C (lethal heat shock) for varying lengths of time. Samples after each treatment were chilled on ice. The survival of cells was assayed by spotting 5 μl of 5-fold serial dilutions on to YPD plates. Hsp104-dependent Reactivation Assays—In vivo protein disaggregation assays were performed as described earlier (12Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In vitro assays for reactivation of aggregated firefly luciferase (FFL) were performed essentially as described in Glover et al. (19Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Denaturation of FFL was carried out by heating at 45 °C for 15 min in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of Hsp26. Heat-treated FFL samples were added to reactions with indicated chaperones. ATP regeneration system comprising creatine phosphate (15 mm) (Roche Diagnostics) and creatine kinase (0.5 μm) was included. Reactivated FFL activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) Hsp26 oligomer (0.4 μm) and firefly luciferase (0.1 or 1 μm) individually or together were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min to clear large particles. Diffusion coefficients were measured by monitoring intensity of scattered laser light (589 nm) using a Protein Solutions DynaPro instrument equipped with a temperature controlled microsampler. Samples were heated to 45 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to 25 °C. Fifty data points were acquired for each measurement. The viscosity of the buffer at 25 °C of 0.891 centipoise was used for calculations. To identify substrates and cofactors of Hsp104-mediated protein disaggregation in yeast, we analyzed proteins that accumulate in aggregates after heat shock and depend on Hsp104 for resolubilization. Using two-dimensional PAGE, we compared proteins from the soluble and the insoluble fractions of wild-type (WT) and Δhsp104 cells. Proteins were examined: 1. before a non-lethal heat shock, 2. immediately thereafter and 3. after recovery (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Several proteins became insoluble after heat shock and were resolubilized in WT but not in Δhsp104 cells. These proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Among them, Hsp26 was very abundant and was identified with high confidence (supplemental Table IV). The results were confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies against Hsp26 (Fig. 2A). Heat shock induced the expression of Hsp26 severalfold over untreated levels. Immediately after the heat treatment, most Hsp26 had become insoluble in both the WT and Δhsp104 cells. After recovery at 25 °C for 1 h, the majority of Hsp26 was resolubilized in WT cells but remained insoluble in Δhsp104 cells. We next tested by Western blot whether the solubility of Hsp42, the other sHsp in yeast, might also depend on the presence of Hsp104 after heat shock. Approximately 50% of Hsp42 was detected in the insoluble fraction regardless of previous heat treatment (Fig. 2B). Upon heat treatment Hsp42 levels increased severalfold, but its solubility in WT and Δhsp104 cells remained similar. In the accompanying paper, Haslbeck et al. (36Haslbeck M. Miess A. Stromer T. Water S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (April 20): 23861-23868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) also observed that Hsp26 is the major protein found in the insoluble fraction of yeast cells after heat shock. These observations reveal a functional interaction between Hsp26 (but not necessarily Hsp42) and Hsp104, wherein Hsp26 is sequestered into the insoluble fraction after heat shock and is resolubilized in an Hsp104-dependent manner during recovery. To understand the role of sHsps in thermotolerance, we tested the recovery of sHsp deletion strains after a severe heat shock. Previous work demonstrated that neither Hsp26 nor Hsp42 was required for thermotolerance (survival after a severe heat shock) (7Petko L. Lindquist S. Cell. 1986; 45: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Wotton D. Freeman K. Shore D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2717-2723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In agreement, we saw no thermotolerance defect in Δhsp26 or Δhsp42 cells (Fig. 3). Even the Δhsp26Δhsp42 double mutant had wild-type levels of thermotolerance. However, Δhsp104 cells have a 5-fold higher rate of survival than Δhsp104 Δhsp26 double deletions after a short (10 min) heat shock at 50 °C. The synthetic effect of the deletions of Hsp104 and Hsp26 in our experiments suggests a functional link between these chaperones in response to heat shock and the ensuing protein disaggregation. Surprisingly, the deletion of Hsp42 in Δhsp104 cells does not show this effect, revealing a non-overlapping function of Hsp26 and Hsp42 in thermotolerance. We hypothesized that Hsp26 binds unfolded proteins after heat shock and thereby enables Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 to resolubilize aggregates more efficiently. To test this, we investigated the Hsp104-dependent disaggregation of a temperature-sensitive protein whose functional state is readily quantified (a previously described luciferase variant (12Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 20Escher A. O'Kane D.J. Lee J. Szalay A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6528-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). Each strain constitutively expressing luciferase was pretreated at 37 °C for 30 min and then given a sublethal heat shock at 46 °C for 30 min (12Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide after the heat shock to focus on the reactivation of luciferase synthesized prior to heat shock. The Hsp26 deletion did not affect the activity of luciferase at 25 °C or during the conditioning pretreatment at 37 °C. The sublethal heat shock reduced the luciferase activity to <5% in mid-log phase cells (Fig. 4). Cells deleted for Hsp104 did not recover luciferase activity, regardless of the presence of sHsps (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Cells deleted for Hsp26 reactivated luciferase to a similar extent to WT when grown in mid-log phase. In the stationary phase however, Δhsp26 cells reactivated luciferase at a significantly slower rate than WT cells. The increased dependence of stationary phase cells on Hsp26 for disaggregation is also consistent with the role of sHsps in senescence (21Morrow G. Tanguay R.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 23Walker G.A. White T.M. McColl G. Jenkins N.L. Babich S. Candido E.P. Johnson T.E. Lithgow G.J. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 56: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To investigate mechanistic aspects of the cooperation between Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 and Hsp26 we used purified proteins in aggregation and disaggregation assays. The Hsp104-dependent return of Hsp26 to the soluble state after heat shock likely reflects its ability to capture denatured proteins and keep them in a refolding competent state. FFL aggregates were prepared by heating FFL at 45 °C in the absence and presence of various concentrations of Hsp26. Heat not only causes the aggregation of FFL but it also activates Hsp26 by disassembling the oligomers (9Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Moreover, heat-aggregated FFL on its own is a poor substrate for Hsp104 (19Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), so we used it to test the effects of Hsp26 (Fig. 5A). Disaggregation reactions were initiated by diluting FFL aggregates 10-fold into reaction mixtures containing no chaperones, Hsp104 alone, Ssa1 and Ydj1, or all three chaperones. When Hsp26 was present during the heat denaturation of FFL, it improved resolubilization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1-mediated FFL reactivation was ~20-fold more efficient when FFL aggregates were prepared in the presence of Hsp26 than in its absence. Replacing Hsp26 with another protein such as bovine serum albumin did not influence FFL reactivation (data not shown). When Hsp26 was added after the aggregation of FFL it did not facilitate disaggregation by Hsp104 (FFL activity was not detectable in all samples; data not shown) indicating that formation of the Hsp26-FFL co-complex was essential for reactivation. These observations provide the first direct evidence for cooperation between Hsp26 and Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 chaperones in the reactivation of aggregated proteins. Increasing FFL concentration with a constant Hsp26 concentration drastically reduced the efficiency of reactivation (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that a Hsp26 oligomer:FFL ratio of 2:5 was optimal for FFL as a substrate under these conditions. Our results argue that Hsp26 facilitates protein disaggregation by the Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 machinery in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, Hsp26 can only perform its solubilizing function when it co-aggregates with the protein substrate and not after substrate aggregation. The simplest explanation for the relative inefficiency of FFL reactivation at low Hsp26:FFL ratios, is that Hsp26 was unable to capture all of the FFL. To investigate this we studied the physical nature of Hsp26-FFL complexes by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 6 and supplemental Table V). In the absence of a misfolded client protein, Hsp26 is an oligomer of ~18 nm in diameter (Fig. 6) and has been shown to disassemble at 45 °C (9Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). FFL aggregated into very large particles when heated to 45 °C without Hsp26 (>300 nm, data not shown). However, when the two proteins are mixed at a ~4:1 or a ~1:2 ratio (Hsp26 oligomer:FFL) and heated to 45 °C no large aggregates were observed. Instead, the measured particle diameter was ~33 or ~66 nm respectively. Thus, Hsp26 is able to capture all of the FFL even when Hsp26:FFL ratios were low. However, complexes formed with high Hsp26 concentrations lead to the formation of smaller particles. These are readily resolubilized by Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1. At lower Hsp26 concentrations, larger particles are formed, which are more resilient to resolubilization. We next tested whether the function of Hsp26 and the Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 disaggregation machinery applies to proteins involved in human protein misfolding disease. Previously, our laboratory and others demonstrated that yeast serves as a useful model for studying human neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation such as Huntington disease (24Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 25Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newman G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Parkinson disease (26Outeiro T.F. Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We tested whether deletion or overexpression of Hsp26, Hsp42, Hsp104, or various combinations thereof, would affect the toxicity conferred by expanded polyglutamine region (72Q) of human huntingtin. Yeast cells expressing a normal polyglutamine stretch (25Q) under identical conditions were used as a control. Deletions of Hsp26 or Hsp42 had almost no effect on the toxicity of 72Q (supplemental Fig. 1). This is not surprising given that both sHsps are normally expressed at very low levels in yeast. Overexpressing Hsp104, Hsp26, or Hsp42 reduced 72Q-induced toxicity (Fig. 7A). However, only overexpressing combinations of Hsp104 together with Hsp26 or Hsp42 strongly reduced the toxicity of 72Q (Fig. 7A). Importantly, the overexpression of these genes does not change the status of the [RNQ+] prion (data not shown), which is crucial for the aggregation and toxicity of 72Q in yeast (25Meriin A.B.

Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) could not be suppressed by the overexpression of Hsp104 and Hsp26 or Hsp42 (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus the ability of these chaperones to suppress toxicity depends on the nature of the aggregated protein. To test whether the chaperone-mediated reduction of polyglutamine-induced toxicity correlates with protein disaggregation activity, we analyzed the polyglutamine aggregation in filter-trap assays (Fig. 7B). The combinations of Hsp104 with Hsp26 or Hsp42 markedly reduced 72Q aggregation. The overexpression of the chaperones was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7B). Notably, the reduction in 72Q aggregation and toxicity was achieved without a reduction of its expression level as demonstrated by the dot blot (Fig. 7B). In summary, these experiments show that sHsps antagonize the toxicity of a polyglutamine protein in yeast. This reduction of toxicity correlates with the solubilization of the polyglutamine aggregates. Our work illustrates that sHsps are captors of misfolded proteins and modulators of their disaggregation. When proteins misfold, sHsps bind them and, as a consequence, co-aggregate with them. This keeps the entire aggregate in a state that allows efficient disaggregation by the AAA(+) protein Hsp104. In doing so, Hsp104 both liberates sHsps and passes misfolded proteins to the Hsp70/40 machinery. This machinery, in turn, facilitates their reactivation (Fig. 8). Thus, sHsps act at the first step in the pathway that leads to the reactivation of misfolded substrates. Similarly, sHsps enable Hsp104 to solubilize polyglutamine aggregates and ameliorate polyglutamine toxicity in yeast. This helps to clarify the role of sHsps in the pathobiology of numerous protein conformation disorders such as Huntington disease. Because sHsps and Hsp104 are likely to act on misfolded oligomeric intermediates, as well as on larger aggregates, our work does not identify the toxic species. However, the modulation of both the physical state and the toxicity of polyglutamine proteins by sHsps and Hsp104 establishes a direct link between the conformational state of the protein and its toxicity. The human sHsp, HSP27, was identified as a suppressor of polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in a cellular model of Huntington disease (27Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In this study, HSP27 suppressed cell death without suppressing polyglutamine aggregation. Instead, sHsps antagonize the effects of polyglutamine-induced oxidative stress and thereby reduce cell death. Our results suggest that the ability of sHsps to efficiently decrease polyglutamine aggregation by changing its solubility and its toxicity is directly associated with Hsp104-dependent disaggregation. This only takes place efficiently when sHsps and Hsp104 are simultaneously overexpressed. Notably, in accordance with Wyttenbach et al. (27Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) in our microscopic studies no major changes in the number or morphology of polyglutamine aggregates where detected when sHsps were overexpressed (data not shown). We also observed a significant reduction of polyglutamine toxicity when sHsps were overexpressed alone. This indicates an additional mode of action of sHsps, antagonizing polyglutamine-induced toxicity by sequestration. We suggest that when sHsps bind polyglutamine-containing proteins, it prevents them from interacting with other proteins in a toxic manner. Among other things, this would be expected to reduce oxidative stress. Finally, for those proteins that are oxidatively damaged or misfolded through interactions with polyglutamines, sHsp binding might facilitate their degradation and/or reactivation. In contrast to polyglutamine we did not observe any effect of the overexpression of sHsps on the toxicity of α-synuclein in yeast, even in the presence of overexpressed Hsp104 (supplemental Fig. 2). We speculated that this difference can be explained by the diverse nature of α-synuclein and polyglutamine aggregates. Although sHsps interact closely with the highly insoluble polyglutamine they may not recognize the more soluble misfolded α-synuclein. This result might also demonstrate a certain degree of substrate specificity of the disaggregating function of sHsps. sHsps of different organisms are only moderately conserved in sequence, but their mechanism of action seems very similar. For example, denatured proteins bound by bacterial (28Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), plant (29Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), or mammalian (11Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 30Stege G.J. Brunsting J.F. Kampinga H.H. Konings A.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) sHsps can be reactivated by the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp40. Bacterial ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones can reactivate proteins bound to Hsp16.6 from Synechocystis sp., Hsp18.1 from Pisum sativum, or IbpA/IbpB from Escherichia coli (13Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwulbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Mogk A. Schlieker C. Friedrich K.L. Schonfeld H.J. Vierling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31033-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Such observations establish that the interaction between sHsps, Hsp104/ClpB, and Hsp70/Hsp40 have been evolutionarily conserved. But even though multiple sHsps have been identified in humans (31Kappe G. Franck E. Verschuure P. Boelens W.C. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), no close Hsp104/ClpB homologues have been found in mammalian cells. Is there a functional analogue of Hsp104/ClpB in mammals that interacts with sHsps in protein disaggregation? It has been speculated that the proteins p97 and torsin A, which are also members of the AAA+ family of protein remodeling factors, are able to perform an Hsp104/ClpB-like function in mammalian cells (32Weibezahn J. Bukau B. Mogk A. Microb. Cell Fact. 16. 2004; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, a recent study by Glover and colleagues (33Mosser D.D. Ho S. Glover J.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 8107-8115Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggests that there may not be an Hsp104/ClpB-like activity in mammalian cells, even though Hsp104 is able to perform its disaggregating activity in mammalian cells. Considering the strong dependence of sHsps on Hsp104/ClpB-mediated protein disaggregation in other systems it will be key to elucidate to what degree this mechanism is conserved in mammals. Although previous work demonstrated that Hsp26 and Hsp42 are capable of binding highly overlapping groups of proteins (6Haslbeck M. Braun N. Stromer T. Richter B. Model N. Weinkauf S. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), our results suggest a functional distinction between the two sHsps. Although the majority of Hsp26 is found associated with aggregated proteins only after heat shock, ~50% of Hsp42 is always found in the insoluble protein fraction. In addition, the deletion of Hsp104 does not result in any measurable differences in Hsp42 solubility. The two sHsps may differ in their modes of action or require specific cellular conditions to function. Despite these differences both sHsps show virtually the same effects on suppression of polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity. Members of the AAA(+) protein family use adaptor proteins to bind their substrates. For example, in E. coli, SsrA-tagged proteins are delivered to the AAA+ protein ClpXP for degradation by its adaptor SspB (34Wah D.A. Levchenko I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Likewise, ubiquitinated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells are recognized by the adaptor proteins Npl4 and Ufd1 before they interact with the AAA+ protein p97/Cdc48 (35Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast to the direct interaction of these AAA(+) proteins and their adaptors, a direct binding of Hsp104 to sHsps has not been established, despite attempts to find it. 3A. G. Cashikar and S. L. Lindquist, unpublished data. Also, no modification of the client proteins like the SsrA tag or ubiquitylation in the before-mentioned examples has been observed. How then are the misfolded client proteins recognized by Hsp104? We suggest that rather than binding Hsp104 directly and recruiting it to aggregates, sHsps keep the client proteins in a state that allows fruitful interaction with Hsp104. To this end sHsps have to form a co-complex with client proteins during their aggregation. It then can promote disaggregation post facto. This mode of action allows Hsp104 to disaggregate a wide range of clients, including stress-damaged proteins or misfolding polyglutamine huntingtin without any further modifications.

Increased Nrf2 activity alone was sufficient to protect animals from 3-NP toxicity because intrastriatal adenovirus-mediated Nrf2 overexpression significantly reduced lesion size compared with green fluorescent protein overexpressing controls. In cultured astrocytes, 3-NP was found to increase Nrf2 activity leading to antioxidant response element-dependent gene expression providing a potential mechanism for the increased sensitivity of Nrf2–/– animals to 3-NP toxicity in vivo.

Normally, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the actin-bound regulatory protein, Keap1 (9Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 10Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Multiple cysteine residues allow Keap1 to act as a molecular “switch” by responding to electrophiles/ROS with a conformational change, which releases Nrf2 for nuclear translocation and activation of Phase 2 gene expression (11Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, Nrf2 provides an important mechanistic link between oxidative stress leading to cell death and antioxidant gene expression supporting cell survival. Nrf2–/– mice are particularly maladapted when challenged with toxicity paradigms such as hyperoxic lung injury, butylated hydroxytoluene-induced acute pulmonary injury, acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity, benzo[a]pyrene-induced tumorigenesis in the forestomach, or cigarette smoke-induced emphysema (14Chan K.

Although the protective function of Nrf2 is apparent in peripheral tissues, the role of Nrf2 in the brain, where substantial ROS/RNS production can occur because of a high rate of metabolism, remains unclear. We hypothesize that Nrf2 function is critical for supporting neuronal survival during neurodegenerative disease when aberrant ROS/RNS production is known to be exacerbated (20Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). To study the effect of Nrf2 activity on in vivo neurodegeneration, we systemically administered 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which causes striatal-specific cell loss leading to impairment of motor function (21Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic inhibition by 3-NP produces oxidative stress in the brain through multiple mechanisms. 1) ATP depletion, membrane depolarization, increased neuronal/glial glutamate release, overactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate ionotropic glutamate receptors, accumulation of intracellular Ca2+, and excessive mitochondrial ROS production (22Reynolds I.J. Hastings T.G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3318-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schulz J.B. Matthews R.T. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D. Henshaw D.R. Cipolloni P.B. Mecocci P. Kowall N.W. Rosen B.R. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8419-8429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2) Secondary activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes such as phospholipase A2 (production of inflammatory mediators) and nitric-oxide synthase (peroxynitrite formation) (24Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 25Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). 3) Excessive dopamine release, which can generate H2O2 when metabolized (26Reynolds D.S. Carter R.J. Morton A.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10116-10127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Nrf2 activity in the brain is an attractive strategy for mitigating ROS/RNS overproduction during neurodegenerative disease. To test the hypothesis that augmentation of Nrf2 could protect neurons in vivo, we increased Nrf2 activity in the brain using dietary administration of the small molecule inducer, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) or adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Nrf2 (6Shih A.Y. Johnson D.A. Wong G. Kraft A.D. Jiang L. Erb H. Johnson J.A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, these treatments protected cultured neurons from toxicity paradigms that mimic aspects of in vivo neurodegeneration, such as glutamate-induced glutathione depletion, dopamine toxicity, direct exposure to H2O2, metabolic inhibition with mitochondrial toxins (rotenone), platelet activating factor-induced inflammatory responses, and increased intracellular Ca2+ (6Shih A.Y.

Importantly, neuronal cultures derived from Nrf2–/–mice showed increased susceptibility to neurotoxicity paradigms and were not protected by Nrf2 inducers, but could be rescued by overexpression of Nrf2 (27Lee J.M.

Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Nrf2 activation is a protective response to counter the toxic effects of metabolic inhibition and ROS/RNS production in the brain. Loss of Nrf2 function in Nrf2–/– mice exacerbated motor deficits and striatal lesions caused by 3-NP administration. Conversely, pre-activation of the Nrf2 response (using dietary administration of a Nrf2 inducer or viral gene transfer) attenuated 3-NP toxicity. Nrf2 activation may be a viable strategy to prime the antioxidant capacity of the brain, thereby decreasing injury caused by progressive neurodegeneration. Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. In Vivo 3-NP Dosage Regimen—All experiments were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee and were conducted in strict accordance with guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River, Canada) (250–350 g) and Nrf2–/– mice (C57Bl/6/SV129 background), originating from the laboratory of Dr. Yuet Wai Kan (32Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. 3-NP was prepared in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and maintained at 4 °C for up to 1 week. For Nrf2 mice, a similar number of males and females (aged 10–16 weeks) were used. The 3-NP treatment regimen consisted of 9 total intraperitoneal injections with one injection given every 12 h at successively increasing doses: 20 mg/kg × 4, 40 mg/kg × 4, and 60 mg/kg × 1 (33Fernagut P.O. Hervier L. Labattu B. Bioulac B. Tison F. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). No significant difference was observed between males and females with respect to behavior, weight loss, or lesion size in this study. For rats, daily intraperitoneal injections of 3-NP (n = 10) or PBS control (n = 10) were administered by one of two dosage regimens: 40, 40, and 20 mg/kg or 40, 20, 20, and 20 mg/kg, each regimen resulting in the animal receiving a total of 100 mg/kg of 3-NP over 3 or 4 days. Both dosage regimens were tested to overcome possible preconditioning effects because of adenovirus injection. However, the average lesion volumes produced by the two dosage regimens were not different after statistical analyses (two-tailed t test), and the groups were pooled. Because virus was injected unilaterally we conservatively only included in the study animals with measurable 3-NP lesions by histology. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection or upon displaying severe motor behavior deficits such as recumbence (complete loss of motor control). Semi-qualitative Behavior Scoring of Mice—A detailed description for the assessment of 3-NP induced motor deficits was described previously (33Fernagut P.O. Hervier L. Labattu B. Bioulac B. Tison F. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the scoring system involved the evaluation of 5 major symptoms each with a 3-tiered scoring scale (0, 1, or 2), with 0 = normal behavior and 2 = severe deficit. Symptoms included: (a) hind limb clasping, (b) reduced general locomotor activity, (c) hind limb dystonia (increased muscle tone leading to abnormal jerky movements), (d) truncal dystonia, and (e) postural instability. Animals received a cumulative score of 10 for each trial. Behavior was assessed by an experimenter blinded to the animal genotype and treatment before each scheduled injection. Histology and Fluorojade Staining—Mice were deeply anesthetized with euthanyl (Bimeda-MTC) and trans-cardially perfused with room temperature PBS followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were post-fixed overnight in paraformaldehyde and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose for 2 days before cryostat sectioning. Cresyl violet staining was performed with standard protocols on 40-μm sections mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher). Lesion volume was calculated according to the principle of Cavalieri (volume = s1d1 + s2d2 + s3d3 + s4d4), where s = lesion surface area and d = distance between the 2 sections. Adjacent 20-μm slide-mounted sections were examined for Fluorojade (Histochem Inc.) staining as previously described (34Schmued L.C. Albertson C. Slikker Jr., W. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Cresyl violet sections were scanned at 600 d.p.i. on an Epson desktop scanner and lesion area was quantified by an experimenter blinded to the animal genotypes using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Four anatomical levels of the striatum were examined (Bregma (in mm) +1.10, +0.40, –0.26, –0.92) according to the mouse brain atlas (35Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2001Google Scholar). Fluorojade-positive neurons were only assessed in the core of the striatal lesion. Fluorojade images were collected using Northern Eclipse software (version 6.0). The wide-field fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiophot) setup was equipped with a Retiga Exi CCD camera (QImaging). For rats, perfusion cryosectioning and cresyl violet staining were performed as described for mice. Total lesion volumes were calculated using the following formula Vt = V1 + V2 +... + Vn, where Vn=πh(rn−12+rn−1rn+rn2)/3, where h is the distance between 2 sections and r is the radius of the lesion area using sections from Bregma (in mm) 1.70, 1.20, 0.70, 0.20, –0.26, and –0.80 according to the rat brain atlas (36Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Sydney1986Google Scholar). Succinate Dehydrogenase Assay—Male or female mice from each genotype were acutely injected with 60 mg/kg of 3-NP and were always paired with PBS-injected littermates of the same sex and genotype. After 2 h, the mice were euthanized with halothane and then decapitated. Brains were washed with ice-cold PBS and striata and cortices were dissected from a 2-mm brain matrix slice at approximately Bregma +1.0 mm. Crude mitochondrial samples were prepared by Dounce homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. To collect the mitochondria, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C, 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then re-centrifuged at 7,200 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and the mitochondrial pellet resuspended in the same buffer. SDH activity was assayed immediately using a protocol based on studies by Pennington et al. (37Pennington R.J. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction consisted of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1 m succinate, 0.05 m sucrose, 2 mg/ml p-iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (prepared fresh), and 125 μg/ml crude mitochondria (final concentrations in a 400-μl reaction volume) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The formazan mixture was vortexed before measurement on a microplate reader at 490 nm. Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchronic acid method (Pierce). Brain homogenates were serially diluted for the assay and data analyses were performed on values within the linear range of the SDH reaction. We also used 4 Nrf2+/– mice to examine the dose-response relationship between acute SDH inhibition and various injected 3-NP concentrations (20, 40, or 60 mg/kg). Both 20 and 40 mg/kg doses produced little or no change 2 h after injection, compared with PBS injection (data not shown), whereas 60 mg/kg produced an observable decrease in activity. The 60 mg/kg dose was used for further SDH bioassays. Preparation of tBHQ-supplemented Diets—All rats and mice were normally fed Lab Diet 5001, which contains no tBHQ, but trace amounts of BHA for preserving animal fats (2 ppm). For tBHQ feeding, food pellets were powdered in a coffee grinder and dry mixed with tBHQ (1% w/w). Distilled water was added to the powder (equal v/w), and the mixture was reshaped into food pellets. The pellets were then baked at 60 °C for 3 h. Control food was processed in the same fashion without the addition of tBHQ. Initially, we determined 5% tBHQ in diet was not consumed by Nrf2+/– mice (n = 3), and 0.5% tBHQ, although consumed, only slightly preserved motor function during 3-NP treatment (n = 3). For these reasons, a concentration of 1% tBHQ was used in all further feeding experiments. Enzyme Assays for Brain Tissue—Brain and liver tissue were dissected in ice-cold PBS and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in tissue buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 250 mm sucrose. Crude homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Tissue homogenate supernatants were collected and promptly assayed for enzyme activity. NQO1 enzyme activity was determined by calculating the dicumarol-sensitive fraction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indo-phenol reduction (38Benson A.M. Hunkeler M.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5216-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Reactions consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm FAD, 200 μm NADH, 30 μg/ml protein, with and without 20 μm dicumarol were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C (final concentrations in 200 μl of reaction volume). 2,6-dichlorophenol-indo-phenol was then added to a final concentration of 36 μm (20 μl volume), and the reaction was monitored at 540 nm. The extinction coefficient for 2,6-dichlorophenolindo-phenol was 2.1 × 104m–1 cm–1. The GST assay consisted of 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 1 mm glutathione, and 100 μg/ml protein at 37 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) (final concentration in 150 μl of reaction volume) (39Kelly V.P. Ellis E.M. Manson M.M. Chanas S.A. Moffat G.J. McLeod R. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 957-969PubMed Google Scholar). The GST reaction was monitored at 340 nm and the spontaneous non-enzymatic slope was subtracted from the total observed slope. The extinction coefficient for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was 9600 m–1 cm–1. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay consisted of 3.3 mm pyruvate, 0.34 mm NADH, and 100 μg/ml protein in PBS at 37 °C (final concentrations in 150 μl of reaction volume) (40Everse J. Berger R.L. Kaplan N.O. Science. 1970; 168: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The LDH reaction was monitored at 340 nm and the spontaneous non-enzymatic slope was subtracted from the total observed slope. Purified LDH enzyme standards were used to ensure that values were obtained within the linear range of the assay. The extinction coefficient for NADH was 6219 m–1 cm–1. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchronic acid method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Stereotaxic Injections—Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Somnitol (MTC Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, ON) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). A burr hole was drilled and injection was performed into the right striatum at coordinates: 1.00-mm anterior-posterior from Bregma, 2.60-mm medial-lateral, and at both –4.50- and –5.50-mm dorsal-ventral, using a 10-μl Hamilton gas-tight syringe with a 26-gauge needle (type 2 tip). The virus was delivered by manually pressing the syringe plunger 3 times at 4-min intervals. Ad-GFP or Ad-Nrf2 was delivered at a concentration of 5 × 106 total plaque forming units in 3 μl of PBS. Wounds were irrigated with 0.9% sterile saline solution and sutured. Animals were allowed to recover for 3 days before 3-NP treatment was initiated. Immunohistochemistry—For rats, frozen 10-μm brain sections were thawed in PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal anti-O4 (Chemicon) or rabbit polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acid protein antibodies were diluted 1:400 and 1:200, respectively, in Ab buffer (3% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber. Sections were rinsed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgM Alexa 546-conjugated or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibodies (both Molecular Probes, 1:500) in a humid chamber for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS prior to mounting with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.) and No. 1 glass coverslips (Corning). All GFP fluorescence from viral infection could be detected without using an anti-GFP antibody. To assess total striatal volume, a propidium iodide counterstain was used to label all cell nuclei. Sections were incubated in 8 μm propidium iodide dissolved in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 10-min PBS rinse. To determine infectivity, GFP fluorescence was calculated by thresholding images to subtract background and calculating the area of fluorescence (Image J). In the same section, propidium iodide staining was used to locate the corpus callosum and caudate putamen. The area encompassed by these two regions was defined as the striatal area. Data were expressed as % GFP+ volume within the total striatal volume. For NeuN staining, an antigen retrieval process was used following thawing. Sections were incubated at 80 °C for 30 min in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 8.5) and then rinsed for 5 min in PBS prior to anti-NeuN antibody incubation overnight at 4 °C (Chemicon, 1:100) and goat anti-mouse Cy3 secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (Sigma, 1:200). Fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss LSM Meta 510 confocal microscope and analyzed using NIH Image (for Mac) or ImageJ (for PC). Preparation of Primary Glial-enriched and COS-1 Cultures—Enriched glial cultures were prepared from 0–2 day post-natal Wistar rat pups as described previously (6Shih A.Y. Johnson D.A. Wong G. Kraft A.D. Jiang L. Erb H. Johnson J.A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used largely results in a population of Type I and II astrocytes as assessed by anti-glial fibrillary acid protein staining. COS-1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Plasmids and Adenoviruses—PEF mammalian expression plasmids carrying cDNA encoding mouse Nrf2 and Nrf2DN were a generous gift from Dr. Jawed Alam (Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA) (1Alam J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus-tagged Nrf2-GFP vector was made by PCR amplifying the Nrf2 coding sequence from the PEF vector with specific primer sequences: forward, 5′-ACTCAGATCTCGAGAAGATTTGATTGACATCCTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCGGGGGTACCCTAGTTTTTCTTTGTATC-3′. The resulting PCR product was restriction digested with XhoI and KpnI for ligation into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Invitrogen). The Keap1 vector was a generous gift from Dr. Masayuki Yamamoto (University of Tsukuba), later modified to Keap1-FLAG by Laurie Zipper (University of Wisconsin) (9Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y.

Transfection, Infection, and Treatments for Astrocytes and COS-1 Cells—Astrocytes and COS-1 cells seeded (1 × 105 cells/ml) in 24-well plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. In particular, for each well of a 24-well plate, 1 μg of DNA and 1 μl of Lipofectamine were used. The transfection efficiency was typically ∼20% for astrocytes and ∼50% for COS-1 cells as assessed by β-galactosidase staining. For some experiments, adenovirus infection of astrocytes as described previously (6Shih A.Y. Johnson D.A. Wong G. Kraft A.D. Jiang L. Erb H. Johnson J.A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was initiated immediately after Lipofectamine transfection. All infected cultures were examined for adequate infection efficiency (∼90% of glia) as assessed by GFP fluorescence. 3-NP or tBHQ treatments were initiated 24 h afte"
https://openalex.org/W2042553854,"Parkinson disease and other α-synucleinopathies are characterized by the deposition of intraneuronal α-synuclein (αSyn) inclusions. A significant fraction (about 15%) of αSyn in these pathological structures are truncated forms that have a much higher propensity than the full-length αSyn to form aggregates in vitro. However, little is known about the role of truncated αSyn species in pathogenesis or the means by which they are generated. Here, we have provided an in vitro mechanistic study demonstrating that truncated αSyns induce rapid aggregation of full-length protein at substoichiometric ratios. Co-overexpression of truncated αSyn with full-length protein increases cell vulnerability to oxidative stress in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest a precipitating role for truncated αSyn in the pathogenesis of diseases involving αSyn aggregation. In this regard, the A53T mutation found in some cases of familial Parkinson disease exacerbates the accumulation of insoluble αSyns that correlates with the onset of pathology in transgenic mice expressing human αSyn-A53T mutant. The caspase-like activity of the 20 S proteasome produces truncated fragments similar to those found in patients and animal models from degradation of unstructured αSyn. We propose a model in which incomplete degradation of αSyn, especially under overloaded proteasome capacity, produces highly amyloidogenic fragments that rapidly induce the aggregation of full-length protein. These aggregates in turn reduce proteasome activity, leading to further accumulation of fragmented and full-length αSyns, creating a vicious cycle of cytotoxicity. This model has parallels in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington disease, where coaggregation of poly(Q) fragments with full-length protein has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2165790227,"Human granzyme B (GrB) released from cytotoxic lymphocytes plays a key role in the induction of target cell apoptosis when internalized in the presence of perforin. Here we demonstrate that GrB also possesses a potent extracellular matrix remodeling activity. Both native and recombinant GrB caused detachment of immortalized and transformed cell lines, primary endothelial cells, and chondrocytes. Cell detachment by GrB induced endothelial cell death (anoikis). GrB also inhibited tumor cell spreading, migration, and invasion in vitro. Investigation into the underlying mechanism revealed that GrB efficiently cleaves three proteins involved in extracellular matrix structure and function: vitronectin, fibronectin, and laminin. In vitronectin, GrB cleaves after an Arg-Lys-Asp (RGD) motif, which is part of the integrin-binding site found in matrix proteins. We propose that targeting of the integrin-extracellular matrix interface by GrB may allow perforin-independent killing of target cells via anoikis, restrict motility of tumor cells, facilitate lymphocyte migration, or directly reduce virus infectivity. It may also contribute to tissue destruction in diseases in which extracellular GrB is evident, such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2089943881,"In the human autoimmune blistering disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) pathogenic antibodies bind the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3 (dsg3), causing epidermal cell-cell detachment (acantholysis).

Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and p38MAPK were identified as proteins rapidly phosphorylated in response to PV IgG.

The specificity of anti-dsg3 antibodies in PV patient sera enabled us to utilize this reagent to initiate changes in desmosome structure and look for activation of signaling and the relationship of these signaling events to the mechanism of acantholysis. Materials—HSP27 antibodies were from ABR (Golden, CO); phospho-HSP27, p38MAPK, and phospho-p38MAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). SB202190, SB203580, Calphostin C, H-7, and U-73122 were from Calbiochem. IgG Preparation—PV sera (PV1, mucocutaneous PV; PV2, mucosal PV) were previously described (12Ding X. Aoki V.

PV IgG was purified from sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography on Protein G (HiTrap; Amersham Biosciences). IgG fractions were dialyzed against PBS, sterile filtered, and CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and activity assayed by indirect IF on sectioned monkey esophagus (PV1 = 1:640, PV2 = 1:5120). Control IgG (no activity by indirect IF) was prepared in parallel from normal human sera. Depleted PV IgG was prepared by removal of dsg3-specific antibodies from sera PV2 by affinity chromatography on a recombinant dsg3 ectodomain column (12Ding X. Aoki V. Mascaro Jr., J.M.

The flow-through was free of dsg3-specific IgG by negative indirect IF (data not shown). Tissue Culture—Normal primary human keratinocytes were passaged and expanded as described (13Hu P. O'Keefe E.J. Rubenstein D.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1059-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third passage keratinocytes were grown to 80–90% confluence when dsg3, but not dsg1, was detected by Western blot of cell extracts using dsg3- and dsg1-specific monoclonal antibodies, respectively (data not shown). [32P]H3PO4 was then added to the culture medium (5 mCi/ml); the cells were incubated for 2 h and either control IgG, PV IgG, or an equivalent volume of buffer was added (to concentrations of 5, 10, or 25 μm). Cells were incubated for 15, 30, 60, or 150 min and then washed extensively in PBS prior to harvesting in IEF lysis buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm Tris, 10 μm pepstatin, 100 μm leupeptin, 10 μm E-64, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration was by modified Bradford as described (13Hu P. O'Keefe E.J. Rubenstein D.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1059-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IPG buffer (pH 3–10, non linear; Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.5% prior to isoelectric focusing. For inhibition studies, keratinocytes were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with the p38MAPK inhibitors SB202190 (100 μm) or SB 203580 (100 μm), the protein kinase C inhibitors Calphostin C (100 nm) or H-7 (10 μm), or the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 (4 μm), after which PV IgG was added to a final concentration of 25 μm and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and harvested in IEF lysis buffer. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—40 μg of 32P-labeled extracts per gel were separated in the first dimension using 13 cm pH 3–10, non-linear IPGphor strips (Amersham Biosciences) and in the second dimension by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film and phosphorimage detection on an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 phosphorimager. The ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) program was used to quantify the radioactive signal detected from each spot on individual gels. The signal detected by the phosphorimager is expressed as spot volume and corresponds to the radioactive decay from the 32P-labeled protein in each spot. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using the Student's t test. Standards of known specific activity were spotted onto filter paper and used as internal controls for standardization among gel scans. Spots whose radioactivity remained constant among the various conditions served as internal controls. Protein Identification—Two-dimensional gel spots of interest were excised and digested with sequence grade trypsin and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data acquired using a Q-tof Ultima Global instrument (Micromass/Waters Corp., Manchester, UK) as previously described (14Karring H.

Native Gel Electrophoresis and Chemical Cross-linking—Keratinocytes grown to 80% confluence were incubated in the presence of 25 μm control IgG, 25 μm PV IgG, or an equivalent volume of buffer for 30 min and washed and harvested in PBS, and native extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenization. Extracts (10 μg) from each sample were separated by native 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen), electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HSP27 antibodies. Native standards were from Amersham Biosciences (HMW native electrophoresis calibration kit). Alternatively, HSP27 in native extracts was cross-linked as described (15Lambert H. Charette S.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) by incubation in an equal volume of 0.1% glutaraldehyde in water for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 10 mm EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HSP27 antibodies. Confocal Microscopy—Keratinocytes grown to 100% confluence were incubated with 25 μm control IgG (Con IgG) or 25 μm PV IgG (PV IgG) for 6 h at 37°C or preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (100 μm) and then incubated with 25 μm control IgG (Con IgG + Inh) or 25 μm PV IgG (PV IgG + Inh) for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and stained with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), pancytokeratin antibodies (clone AE1/AE3; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), or goat anti-human E-cadherin antibodies (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (16Hu E. Chen Z. Fredrickson T.A. Spurr N. Gentle S. Sims M. Zhu Y. Halsey W. Van Horn S. Mao J. Sathe G.M. Brooks D.P. Exp. Nephrol. 2001; 9: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), followed by Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Images were analyzed using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and capture at 500–550 nm or an excitation wavelength of 561 nm and capture at 590–650 nm using a ×63 objective with NA 1.4. Double-labeled samples were checked for bleed-through by turning off the longer wavelength laser and assaying for the absence of image. For three-dimensional image reconstructions, serial sections were scanned at 0.244 μm and rendered using the program Volocity Version 3 (Improvision, Lexington, MA). We used dsg3-specific PV IgG to initiate structural changes in the desmosome and examined keratinocyte extracts for changes in intracellular phosphorylation by culturing normal human keratinocytes in the presence of [32P]H3PO4 and exposing them to PV IgG. Phosphorimage analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled keratinocyte extracts was used to identify and quantify changes in protein phosphorylation. PV IgG Alters Cellular Phosphorylation Patterns—At least three phosphorylation events, which precede loss of cell-cell adhesion as assessed by membrane retraction of apposing cells, occurred within 30 min of exposure of keratinocytes to PV IgG (Fig. 1). Relative to buffer and normal IgG controls, PV IgG-treated keratinocytes show increased phosphorylation in the proteins corresponding to Spots 2, 3, and 5 (Fig. 1). No significant difference in phosphorylation was observed in Spots 1 and 4 in control or PV IgG-treated keratinocytes. Additionally, the phosphorylation of several spots (labeled with an asterisk in Fig. 1A) did not change across time, dose, or culture conditions, and they serve as internal controls. PV IgG-induced Protein Phosphorylation Is Dose Dependent—To examine dose dependence, keratinocytes were incubated in the presence of 5, 10, or 25 μm PV or control IgG or buffer and examined for changes in phosphorylation by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Dose-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation of Spots 2, 3, and 5 were observed in PV IgG-treated cells, but not in cells treated with control IgG or in Spots 1 and 4 in cells treated with either PV or control IgG. PV IgG-induced Protein Phosphorylation Is Rapid and Transient—We then determined the time course by culturing keratinocytes in the presence of [32P]H3PO4 and 25 μm PV IgG, 25 μm control IgG, or buffer for 30, 60, and 150 min (Fig. 2A). Proteins corresponding to Spots 2, 3, and 5 showed a rapid rise in phosphorylation that peaked within 30 min of addition to the medium of PV IgG, after which the levels of phosphorylation declined. No time-dependent change was observed after addition of either control IgG or buffer. No notable change was observed in Spots 1 and 4. Protein Phosphorylation Requires Anti-dsg3 Activity—Phosphorylation of Spots 2, 3, and 5 was dependent upon PV IgG as these phosphorylation events were not observed when samples were incubated with IgG or buffer controls or when the PV IgG fractions were depleted of dsg3-specific antibodies by immunoabsorption (Fig. 2B). Additionally, PV IgG from two different PV patients stimulated the same pattern of phosphorylation, and the level of phosphorylation correlated with their anti-dsg3 activity as determined by indirect IF. No notable difference was observed in Spots 1 and 4. PV IgG Induces Phosphorylation of Heat Shock Protein 27 (HSP27)—In-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF were used to determine the identity of Spot 2 as HSP27 (data not shown). Western blot detection using antibodies to HSP27 and phospho-HSP27 confirmed the identity. After treatment of keratinocytes with PV IgG, increased signal was detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the most acidic charge variant of HSP27 (Fig. 3A). Additionally, increased phospho-HSP27 reactivity was observed in PV IgG-treated keratinocyte extracts when examined by Western blot of one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). PV IgG-induced Phosphorylation of HSP27 Requires p38 Mitogen-activating Protein Kinase (p38MAPK)—Activation of p38MAPK results in phosphorylation of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP 2), which in turn phosphorylates HSP27 (17Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Increased phospho-p38MAPK was detected in PV IgG-treated keratinocytes relative to controls (Fig. 4A), suggesting that PV IgG signaling to HSP27 is mediated by activated p38MAPK; inhibition of p38MAPK inhibited the phosphorylation of HSP27 in keratinocytes exposed to PV IgG (Fig. 4B). No notable inhibition of HSP27 phosphorylation was observed in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitors Calphostin C and H-7 or the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122. PV IgG-induced Phosphorylation of HSP27 Is Associated with a Transition from Large to Small Oligomers—Because phosphorylation of HSP27 is associated with transitions from large to small oligomers (15Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of PV IgG-induced HSP27 phosphorylation on its oligomerization. On native pore limit gels, both large and small oligomers of HSP27 were detected in human keratinocytes incubated with buffer or control IgG; however, a decreased level of large oligomeric HSP27 was observed in PV IgG-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 4C). The migration on native gels is consistent with prior reports of large HSP27 oligomers of average molecular mass 530 kDa reduced to small oligomers of molecular mass 110 kDa by phosphorylation with MAPKAP kinase 2 (17Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The large oligomeric isoform was not well detected by Western blot of native gels, perhaps because of the relative inefficiency of high molecular mass native proteins to undergo electrotransfer; therefore, cross-linking was used to stabilize large oligomeric HSP27. Native extracts from keratinocytes were chemically cross-linked in glutaraldehyde and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with HSP27 antibodies. This protocol enhanced the detection of high molecular mass HSP27 oligomers observed in buffer or control IgG-treated cells but markedly reduced in PV IgG-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 4D). p38MAPK Inhibition Blocks PV IgG-induced Keratin and Actin Reorganization—In response to PV IgG, the keratin filament network of keratinocytes retracts from the cell membrane. We utilized this physiologic end point to determine whether the observed signaling events had a role in activating PV IgG-induced changes in the cytoskeleton. Consistent with previous reports (11Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), keratin filaments in PV IgG-treated keratinocytes were retracted from the membrane and demonstrated enhanced perinuclear localization. PV IgG-induced keratin filament retraction was prevented by the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, in PV IgG-treated keratinocytes phalloidin staining suggested that the actin cytoskeleton was undergoing reorganization consistent with the transition from stationary adherent cells to non-adherent migratory cells. PV IgG treatment was associated with a change from cortical staining to a pattern suggestive of ruffling membranes (18Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Notably, the PV IgG-induced actin reorganization was similarly prevented by the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (Fig. 5B, PV IgG + Inh). Although the acantholytic properties of dsg3 autoantibodies from PV patient sera have been well described, the molecular mechanisms by which these autoantibodies disrupt keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion has not been characterized. By incubating keratinocytes in the presence of [32P]H3PO4, we were able to identify changes in the phosphorylation pattern of cellular substrates after addition of purified PV IgG to keratinocyte cell cultures. Several spots, resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, were observed to undergo rapid changes in phosphorylation. The increase and subsequent decrease in phosphorylation observed is consistent with a dynamic regulatory process and with the transient nature of protein post-translational modifications characteristic of intracellular signaling cascades. Other spots on the gel were not affected by the addition of PV IgG; i.e. no time- or dose-dependent phosphorylation changes were observed in the majority of the phosphoproteins resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, indicating that the observed changes in phosphorylation did not result from a general increase in phosphorylation but were specific for discrete cellular substrates. Specificity of the phosphorylation induced by anti-dsg3 PV antibodies was demonstrated by (i) the inability of either control IgG or PV IgG fractions depleted of dsg3-specific antibodies by immunoabsorption to stimulate phosphorylation of Spots 2, 3, and 5, (ii) PV IgG purified from different PV patients stimulated the same pattern of phosphorylation, and (iii) the level of phosphorylation correlated with their anti-dsg3 activity. Because PV IgG specifically target dsg3, the observed phosphorylation/signaling events are proposed to result from changes in the desmosome. The precise nature of this structural change is unknown but may include disruption of desmosomal protein-protein interactions or conformational changes within the target dsg3 molecule. MALDI-Tof mass spectrometry analysis of in-gel tryptic digests was used to identify one of these phosphoproteins as HSP27; this identity was confirmed by immunoblotting with HSP27 and phospho-HSP27-specific monoclonal antibodies. The observation that HSP27 was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to PV IgG suggested that p38MAPK might similarly be phosphorylated because phosphorylation of p38MAPK had previously been shown to phosphorylate MAPKAP kinase 2, which in turn phosphorylates HSP27. As predicted, p38MAPK was similarly rapidly phosphorylated in keratinocytes exposed to PV IgG. Inhibitors of p38MAPK activity prevented PV IgG-induced HSP27 phosphorylation. The observation that HSP27 is one of the proteins phosphorylated in response to PV IgG is intriguing. HSP27 functions as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the refolding of denatured proteins but also participates in signaling where it may regulate elements of the cytoskeleton, including actin filaments (19Benndorf R.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112 (Pt. 13): 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Large oligomeric HSP27 is thought to have chaperone function, whereas, small oligomeric HSP27 may have direct signaling and cytoskeletal regulatory functions (22Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P.

Phosphorylation of HSP27 is thought to have a role in its ability to regulate the cytoskeleton (24Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Missense mutations in HSP27 lead to disrupted neurofilament assembly and cause the neuromuscular disorder Charcot-Marie Tooth disease as well as distal hereditary motor neuropathy, providing additional support for the role of HSP27 in intermediate filament regulation (27Evgrafov O.V. Mersiyanova I. Irobi J. Van Den Bosch L. Dierick I. Leung C.L. Schagina O. Verpoorten N. Van Impe K. Fedotov V. Dadali E. Auer-Grumbach M. Windpassinger C. Wagner K. Mitrovic Z. Hilton-Jones D. Talbot K. Martin J.J. Vasserman N. Tverskaya S. Polyakov A. Liem R.K. Gettemans J. Robberecht W. De Jonghe P. Timmerman V. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with a mechanism by which PV IgG binding to dsg3 activates “outside-in” desmosome signaling in which (i) phosphorylation of p38MAPK leads to (ii) phosphorylation of MAPKAP kinase 2, which in turn (iii) phosphorylates HSP27, leading to (iv) changes in HSP27 quaternary structure and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, endorepellin binding to α2β1 integrin activates a signaling pathway in which p38MAPK and HSP27 phosphorylation are associated with structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton (28Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E.M. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Hook M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that HSP27 may have a central role in cell adhesion junction signaling. The observation that specific inhibition of this pathway using p38MAPK inhibitors can prevent changes in the cytoskeleton associated with the transition from an adherent to non-adherent phenotype supports the hypothesis that the observed signaling events may be required for the loss of cell-cell adhesion induced in vivo by PV autoantibodies. HSP27 phosphorylation correlates with changes induced by PV IgG; however, it may be premature to suggest that HSP27 phosphorylation is the critical step in this signaling pathway. Other p38MAPK substrates may play a role in PV IgG-induced cytoskeletal reorganization. Numerous direct and indirect downstream targets of p38MAPK have been reported, including protein kinases (29Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T.

Furthermore, although we have not yet determined the protein identity of Spots 3 and 5, it seems likely that they also play a role in this response because they too exhibit dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation upon addition of PV IgG. Keratinocytes from plakoglobin knock-out mice form desmosome-like structures that appear to mediate cell-cell adhesion in monolayer cultures but are resistant to PV IgG-mediated keratin filament retraction (11Caldelari R. de Bruin A. Baumann D. Suter M.M. Bierkamp C. Balmer V. Muller E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that mechanisms in addition to steric hindrance may be required for PV IgG to mediate the loss of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and provides additional support for the hypothesis that signaling plays a role. Further support for desmosome signaling is provided by the observation that genetic defects in desmosome components are associated with altered epithelial differentiation (37Rickman L. Simrak D. Stevens H.P. Hunt D.M. King I.A. Bryant S.P. Eady R.A. Leigh I.M. Arnemann J. Magee A.I. Kelsell D.P. Buxton R.S. Hum. Mol.

Binding of specific pathogenic antibodies to dsg3 activates intracellular phosphorylation events, suggesting that, in addition to functioning in cell-cell adhesion, desmosomes are capable of acting as transmembrane receptors that transduce signals from the extracellular environment to the intracellular environment. Pharmacologic inhibition of PV IgG-induced p38MAPK activation and HSP27 phosphorylation may prove beneficial in the treatment of this severe and life-threatening autoimmune disease.

https://openalex.org/W2013453206,"In all organisms studied, elevated temperatures induce the expression of a variety of stress proteins, among them small Hsps (sHsp). sHsps are chaperones that prevent the unspecific aggregation of proteins by forming stable complexes with unfolded polypeptides. Reactivation of captured proteins requires the assistance of other ATP-dependent chaperones. How sHsps and ATP-dependent chaperones work together is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the interplay of chaperones present in the cytosol of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Specifically, we characterized the influence of Hsp104 and Ssa1 on the disassembly of Hsp26·substrate complexes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We show that recovery of proteins from aggregates in the cell requires the chaperones to work together with defined but overlapping functions. During reactivation, proteins are transferred from a stable complex with Hsp26 to Hsp104 and Hsp70. The need for ATP-dependent chaperones depends on the type of sHsp·substrate complex. Although Ssa1 is able to release substrate proteins from soluble Hsp26·substrate complexes, Hsp104 is essential to dissociate substrate proteins from aggregates with incorporated sHsps. Our results are consistent with a model of several interrelated defense lines against protein aggregation."

To investigate novel mechanisms of LOX regulation and function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify LOX-interacting proteins.

LOX binds to the cellular form of FN (cFN) with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 nm. This was comparable with our measured Kd of LOX binding to tropoelastin (1.9 nm) and type I collagen (5.2 nm), but LOX demonstrated a much lower binding affinity for the plasma form of FN (pFN). Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed co-localization of FN and LOX in normal human tissues, where these proteins may interact in vivo. LOX enzymatic activity assays showed that cFN does not seem to be a substrate of LOX. However, cFN can act as a scaffold for enzymatically active 30-kDa LOX. Furthermore, in FN-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observed dramatically decreased proteolytic processing of the 45-kDa LOX proenzyme to the 30-kDa active form, with a corresponding decrease in LOX enzyme activity.

Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 15Magnusson M.K. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). FN accomplishes this diverse array of functions through interactions with a large variety of proteins including collagens, fibrin, thrombospondin, cell surface integrins, heparin sulfate proteoglycans, and tenascin-C. FN is secreted as a dimer bound together by C-terminal disulfide bonds, and it has been traditionally categorized as either soluble plasma FN (pFN) or insoluble cellular FN (cFN) (14Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 19ffrench-Constant C. Exp.

It has been shown that activation of soluble FN induces a conformational change resulting in an insoluble molecule that is highly adhesive through revealed binding domains (21Johnson K.J. Sage H.

In tissues, activated FN is deposited and organized into a polymeric matrix, which has long been observed to be associated with collagen fibers. Classic studies of wound healing have revealed a temporal sequence of FN deposition followed by cell invasion, then type III collagen deposition followed by type I collagen deposition, and finally, loss of FN (17Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar, 18Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, the formation of the FN matrix has been shown to be critical for the subsequent assembly of types I and III collagen fibrils (26Velling T. Risteli J. Wennerberg K. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37377-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3546-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that cFN is required for collagen gel contraction in wound healing models (28Asaga H. Kikuchi S. Yoshizato K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Taliana L. Evans M.D. Dimitrijevich S.D. Steele J.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity has also been shown to be a critical factor in similar collagen gel contraction models (31Woodley D.T. Yamauchi M. Wynn K.C. Mechanic G. Briggaman R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 580-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Redden R.A. Doolin E.J. Skin Res. Technol. 2003; 9: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The FN matrix was proposed to act as a scaffold to regulate the deposition and assembly of type I and III collagens, but the molecular mechanisms by which the FN matrix may accomplish this have not been established. In this study, we report the identification of FN as a binding partner for LOX detected by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the mature 30-kDa LOX protein as bait. We demonstrate that LOX has a high binding affinity for cFN, but not pFN, and that the cytokine receptor-like (CRL) domain of LOX seems to play a role in stabilizing this binding. We also show that FN does not seem to be a substrate of LOX but that FN-bound LOX retains its amine oxidase activity. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed LOX and FN co-localization in cultured fibroblasts and various human tissues. In FN-null mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures, we detected dramatically decreased proteolytic processing of LOX with a corresponding decrease in catalytic activity. Reagents—Monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) was purchased from Covance, Inc. Monoclonal anti-FN antibody (FN8–12), which recognizes all isoforms of FN, was purchased from Takara Bio Inc. Monoclonal anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit anti-LOX antibody was previously characterized and recognizes both the full-length and the processed LOX from human and mouse (33Li P.A. He Q. Cao T. Yong G. Szauter K. Fong K.S.K. Karlsson J. Keep M. Csiszar K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 12: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-BMP-1 antibody, which recognizes the CUB-2 domain, was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. Purified rabbit IgG, used as an isotype-negative control for immunofluorescent staining, was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescent staining, which included anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 (red) to visualize the anti-FN antibody and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green) to visualize the anti-LOX antibody and the purified rabbit IgG-negative control, were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Purified active bovine LOX (bLOX) was generously provided by Dr. Hebert Kagan (34Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson III, T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Purified pFN, cFN, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and chick tropoelastin proteins were purchased from Sigma. Purified rat tail collagen type I was purchased from BD Biosciences. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Primers were designed to introduce restriction sites 5′ and 3′ to sequence verified LOX cDNA to clone the inserts into Clontech's pGBKT7 vector downstream and in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The primers used to amplify the full-length LOX cDNA were: 5′-ACA TGC CAT GGT GAT GCG CTT CGC CTG GAC CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGC GGA TCC CTA ATA CGG TGA AAT TGT GCA GC-3′ (reverse), with the introduced NcoI and BamHI restriction sites underlined. To express only the mature form of LOX (amino acids 169–417), a forward primer was designed that started at the known BMP-1 cleavage site (10Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar): 5′-CCG GAA TTC GAC GAC CCT TAC AAC CCC TA-3′ (forward), with the introduced EcoRI site underlined. After PCR amplification, the inserts were digested and ligated into the pGBKT7 vector. The finished constructs, pGBKT7-proLOX and pGBKT7-LOX, were each verified by DNA sequencing. Two-hybrid screening was conducted according to Clontech's System 3 protocol using a human placental cDNA library (Clontech), which contained over 3.5 × 106 independent clones generated from human placental mRNA with oligo(dT) primers. The library was transformed into AH109 yeast that contained pGBKT7-LOX with an efficiency measured by dilutions of transformants on non-selective plates. Clones containing interacting proteins were selected by growth on a drop-out minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine and by activation of the lacZ gene. The positive clones were streaked multiple times on these selective plates to get single clones and to verify their growth under selective conditions. The library plasmids were isolated from the positive yeast clones, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced using an ABI 310 capillary sequencer. The interactions of the identified FN clones were further characterized by performing direct interaction assays in AH109 yeast. pGBKT7, pGBKT7-proLOX, pGBKT7-LOX, or pGBKT7-lamin C (Clontech) was co-transformed with pGADT7 or pGADT7-FN. The selection for positive interactions was carried out with the same stringent conditions as the original two-hybrid screen. Cell Culture—Human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from Clonetics, Inc. and grown using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Serologicals Corp.), penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from FN-null mice (FN-/-) and heterozygous siblings (FN+/-) were generously provided by Dr. Deane Mosher (35Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). MEFs were kept in culture under the same conditions as human neonatal skin fibroblasts as described above, except 10% FN-depleted FBS was used to supplement the DMEM. The removal of FN from the FBS was accomplished by mixing 4 ml of gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with 25 ml of FBS overnight and then centrifuging to remove the resin. Only human and mouse primary fibroblasts of less than passage 10 were used for protein analysis. For experiments analyzing cell medium proteins, cells were grown to 2 days post-confluency, washed with PBS, and incubated with serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM. After an additional 48 h in culture, the conditioned cell medium (CCM) was collected. To concentrate total proteins from the CCM for Western blotting, we added 10 μl of Strataclean Resin (Stratagene) to the appropriate volume of CCM, and then the sample was vortexed and mixed for 30 min at 4 °C (36Ziegler J. Vogt T. Miersch O. Strack D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and we added 2× Laemmli buffer to the resin, boiled it for 5 min, and then froze the sample. GST Protein Expression and Pull-downs—The plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to generate expression constructs for various LOX fragments containing an N-terminal GST tag. The pGBKT7-proLOX plasmid was used as a cDNA template for cloning the LOX fragments. Recombinant GST·LOX fusion proteins, corresponding to amino acids 1–417 (proLOX), 169–417 (mature LOX), 1–168 (propeptide), 169–348 (mature LOX minus the CRL domain), and 349–417 (CRL domain), were cloned and transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene). GST fusion protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to growing cultures and shaking for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies using a solubilization buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.2), filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter, and refolded with a rapid dilution into 10 mm K2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.2). GST·LOX fusion proteins were captured and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted using the inclusion body solubilization buffer and refolded. Protein concentrations were measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For GST pull-down experiments, 5 μg of GST·LOX or GST alone was attached to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with 10 μgof purified pFN, 10 μg of purified cFN, or 1 ml of human neonatal skin fibroblast CCM for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with PBST (0.05% Tween 20) and then resuspended in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min, and equal amounts were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. Bound FN was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-FN monoclonal antibody. Solid Phase Binding Assays—To determine the binding affinity of LOX to FN as compared with various ECM and control proteins, solid phase binding assays were performed (37Mould P. Streuli C.H. Grant M. Extracellular Matrix Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 295-299Google Scholar). Wells of high protein-binding EIA/RIA microplates (catalog number 3590; Corning) were coated with purified proteins at 200 nmol/well in PBS or 10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 8.2) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 3 h at 37 °C. After removing the blocking solution, wells were washed three times with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Purified soluble “ligand” protein was added to the wells at various concentrations (0–100 nm) in PBS or 10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 8.2) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBST, and bound ligand was reacted with anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-FN primary antibody and then detected with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Peroxidase activity was quantitated using the Quant-aBlu fluorogenic peroxidase substrate kit (Pierce), with absorbance measured at 405 nm. All samples were performed in triplicate. The dissociation constants were calculated using non-linear regression analysis performed by Prism3 statistical software (Graphpad, Inc.). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cultured human fibroblasts were grown, as described above, on glass coverslips until 6 days post-confluency and then washed with PBS three times and fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, washed again in PBS, and blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were reacted with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then washed in PBS with 0.1% BSA three times for 5 min each. The bound primary antibodies were reacted with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then the coverslips were washed three times in PBS with 0.1% BSA for 5 min each. After a final wash in PBS for 5 min, the coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescent staining on fixed human tissues was performed using human tissue macroarrays (catalog number 70312-3 and 70313-3, Novagen). The tissue sections were deparaffinized by heating at 60 °C for 30 min and washing three times in xylene for 15 min. Tissue sections were then rehydrated in 100, 95, 80, and 70% ethanol followed by immersion in PBS. When needed, antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving the sections in 0.01 m citric acid on high, medium, and then low power for 5 min each. The sections were washed in PBS three times for 5 min and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were reacted with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBST, and then incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. After three final washes in PBS, Vectashield was used to mount coverslips. All slides were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM Pascal confocal microscope. LOX Activity Assays—The LOX enzyme activity was measured using the Amplex Red fluorescence assay (38Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which we have adapted for use in microplate format. The assay reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.2), 1.2 m urea, 50 μm Amplex Red, 0.1 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 10 mm 1,5-diaminopentane (cadaverine) substrate. The protein samples were added to the reaction mix, in the presence or absence of 500 μm BAPN, which was then incubated at 37 °C. The fluorescent product was excited at 560 nm, and the emission was read at 590 nm using a BMG Labtechnologies Inc. Polarstar Optima. To measure whether LOX activity is affected by binding to FN, 10 pmol of purified bLOX was incubated with 10 pmol of purified cFN or BSA at 4 °C for 1 h. To determine whether LOX retains amine oxidase activity when bound to a solid phase FN matrix, we performed an experiment similar to the solid phase binding assays. We coated microplate wells with cFN, and after blocking with BSA, we incubated bLOX in the wells at a concentration range of 0–100 nm overnight at 4 °C. We washed away the unbound bLOX three times with PBST and once with PBS and then added 200 μl of the above Amplex Red reaction mix (with 1,5-diaminopentane substrate) without urea. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and the fluorescence was measured as above. To measure LOX activity in MEF culture medium, an equal microgram amount of CCM proteins from FN+/- and FN-/- cultures were added to each microplate well and incubated with the Amplex Red reaction mix listed above, using 1,5-diaminopentane as a substrate. Parallel samples were incubated with 500 μm BAPN as a negative control. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was measured every 5 min. The LOX activity was calculated as the increase in fluorescent units over time (120) above the BAPN controls. Replicate samples were used to decrease experimental error. LOX activity assays performed from MEF CCM required the concentration of medium proteins using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Identified LOX Interactions with FN—To investigate novel mechanisms of LOX regulation and function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify LOX-interacting proteins. The expression of the lysyl oxidase gene is high in placental tissues, and we anticipated that using a placental library would be optimal for discovering proteins with LOX-binding ability. It was unknown whether the N-terminal propeptide region of LOX (amino acids 1–168) would inhibit protein interactions, as it has been theorized to electrostatically interact with the active site region of LOX to inhibit enzyme activity (39Kagan H.M. Li W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 660-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Additionally, the LOX protein in the ECM has been shown to be predominantly the processed active 30-kDa form. Therefore, a bait designed to encode the 30-kDa mature form of LOX (amino acids 169–417) was used to screen a human placental yeast two-hybrid library (Fig. 1A). After transformation of pGBKT7-LOX into yeast strain AH109, expression of the fusion protein GAL4-BD-LOX was confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). Assays for expression of the reporter genes ade2, his3, and lacZ showed no autonomous transcriptional activity by GAL4-BD-LOX alone. Subsequently, the placental cDNA library was transformed into the yeast strain containing pGBKT7-LOX, and the cells were plated to screen for expression of the three reporter genes. From plated dilution controls, the library transformation efficiency was over 5 × 106 colony-forming units/μg. Yeast colonies that expressed all three reporter genes were isolated, and the library insert cDNA was sequenced. From this yeast two-hybrid screen, three of the positive clones we isolated were overlapping FN cDNA fragments. Because the placental cDNA library was constructed using oligo(dT) primers, all the FN fragments were on the C-terminal end of the protein. The shortest FN cDNA encoded amino acids 2057–2446, which contained a heparin-binding domain, a REDV cell adhesion site, the IIICS alternative splicing domain, one type III repeat, and the fibrin-binding domain (Fig. 1). All three FN cDNAs included part of the alternatively spliced IIICS domain (Fig. 1), which is more commonly expressed in cellular forms of FN. To verify that the binding of FN was specific to LOX and to determine whether FN could also bind to the full-length form of LOX (proLOX), several combinations of baits and target plasmids were co-transformed into yeast and streaked on -Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp-selective plates. Yeast were also co-transformed with combinations of LOX and FN proteins with empty vectors as negative controls. A non-interacting bait protein, nuclear lamin C, was also used as a negative control to show specificity of the FN interaction. Only the yeast cells that contained LOX or pro-LOX and FN were able to grow on the nutritional dropout plates (Fig. 2). These data demonstrated that the detected interaction between LOX and FN was not the result of nonspecific binding and that the propeptide region does not inhibit the interaction of LOX with the FN clones isolated from the screen. LOX-FN Interaction in Vitro—To verify and to biochemically characterize the interaction of LOX and FN, further experiments required adequate amounts of purified LOX protein. Since LOX has been successfully expressed in bacteria (40Ouzzine M. Boyd A. Hulmes D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 41Jung S.T. Kim M.S. Seo J.Y. Kim H.C. Kim Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we cloned LOX cDNA into the pGEX-4T-1 vector to express LOX as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. The N-terminal GST tag allowed for rapid purification of large amounts of the recombinant LOX protein through the high affinity binding to glutathione. We were able to express and purify sufficient amounts of GST·LOX from the bacteria inclusion bodies using a slightly modified method of protein refolding based on that of Jung et al. (41Jung S.T. Kim M.S. Seo J.Y. Kim H.C. Kim Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also cloned the full-length proLOX as a GST fusion protein, but despite attempts to optimize the growing conditions, GST-proLOX never expressed at the correct molecular weight, and it was not used for further experiments. For analysis of individual LOX domains, we cloned three other cDNA fragments that span the entire length of the LOX protein: GST·LOX1–168, GST·LOX169–348, and GST·LOX349–417, where the numbers refer to the included amino acids. We successfully expressed the fusion proteins and were able to purify the"

The outer layer of the cell wall is enriched in highly glycosylated mannoproteins that are implicated in many aspects of the host-fungus interaction.

Golgi-bound mannosyltransferases require Mn2+ as an essential cofactor. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the P-type ATPase Pmr1p transports Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions into the Golgi. To determine the effect of a gross defect in glycosylation on host-fungus interactions of C. albicans, we disrupted the PMR1 homolog, CaPMR1. This mutation would simultaneously inhibit many Golgi-located, Mn2+-dependent mannosyltransferases. The Capmr1Δ null mutant was viable in vitro and had no growth defect even on media containing low Ca2+/Mn2+ ion concentrations. However, cells grown in these media progressively lost viability upon entering stationary phase. Phosphomannan was almost completely absent, and O-mannan was severely truncated in the null mutant. A defect in N-linked outer chain glycosylation was also apparent, demonstrated by the underglycosylation of surface acid phosphatase. Consistent with the glycosylation defect, the null mutant had a weakened cell wall, exemplified by hypersensitivity to Calcofluor white, Congo red, and hygromycin B and constitutive activation of the cell integrity pathway. In a murine model of systemic infection, the null mutant was severely attenuated in virulence.

Both the carbohydrate epitopes and the protein components have been implicated in these roles (7Calderone R. Gow N.A.R. Candida and Candidiasis. ASM Press, Washington, D.

Mycol. 1997; 35: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although the exact epitopes involved are still unclear. The study of glycosylation in C. albicans will therefore increase our understanding of the host-fungus interaction. To determine the role of glycosylation in the virulence of this fungus, we deleted the Golgi P-type ATPase, which transports divalent cations into the Golgi, where they act as essential cofactors for mannosyltransferases. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the transfer of the first mannose residue to serine or threonine in O-linked glycosylation (13Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and by the transfer of the N-linked core structure to asparagine residues (14Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The construction and transfer of the N-linked core (14Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and the initiation of O-linked glycosylation (16Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) are essential processes. Glycosylation is continued in the Golgi with the extension of the linear O-linked glycans (17Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the extensive elaboration of the branched outer chains of the N-linked glycans (18Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The process of glycosylation has been extensively studied in S. cerevisiae (13Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Burda P.

Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and this has provided a resource for understanding glycosylation in C. albicans. However, key differences exist between the O- and N-glycan structures present in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. For example, in C. albicans, the terminal O-linked glycans that are attached by α1,2-linkages, as opposed to α1,3-linkages in S. cerevisiae (19Munro C.A. Bates S. Buurman E.T. Hughes H.B. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Atrih A. Ferguson M.A. Bain J.M. Brand A. Hamilton S. Westwater C. Thomson L.M. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and β1,2-linked mannose residues are present in both the acid-labile and acid-stable N-linked glycans (20Shibata N. Arai M. Haga E. Kikuchi T. Najima M. Satoh T. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the completion of the C. albicans genome project, it has also become clear that there has been expansion and contraction of the number of genes in different mannosyltransferase gene families of C. albicans. 1S. Bates, C. A. Munro, and N. A. R. Gow, unpublished data. Hence, the process of glycosylation has adapted in C. albicans, perhaps as a result of selective pressure from its interaction with a mammalian host. To date, few genes involved in glycosylation in C. albicans have been analyzed in detail. Those studied include members of the PMT and MNT gene families, all of which act in O-glycosylation, and the studies have demonstrated the importance of O-glycans in virulence (19Munro C.A. Bates S. Buurman E.T. Hughes H.B. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Atrih A. Ferguson M.A. Bain J.M. Brand A. Hamilton S. Westwater C. Thomson L.M. Brown A.J.P. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2005; 55: 546-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Also, Mnn9p is involved in extension of the N-linked glycan outer chain and hence is required for normal cell wall composition (25Southard S.B. Specht C.A. Mishra C. Chen-Weiner J. Robbins P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7439-7448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphomannan has been implicated in the interaction of C. albicans with macrophages. However, deletion of the C. albicans MNN4 gene, which is required for mannosyl phosphate transfer, demonstrated that phosphomannan is not required for macrophage interactions or virulence of C. albicans (26Hobson R.P. Munro C.A. Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Cutler J.E. Heinsbroek S.E. Brown G.D. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol.

Genes such as CaVRG4 2The abbreviations used are: Ca, C. albicans; SD, synthetic dextrose; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BEC, buccal epithelial cell(s); cfu, colony-forming units. and CaSRB1, which encode proteins required for supplying the Golgi with GDP-mannose, the mannose donor, are essential in C. albicans, indicating the overall importance of glycosylation to cell viability (27Nishikawa A.

Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, to date, no single glycosylation event in the Golgi has been shown to be essential. As well as requiring GDP-mannose as the mannose donor, Golgi-bound mannosyltransferases require manganese ions as essential cofactors. In S. cerevisiae, the P-type ATPase Pmr1p is a Ca2+/Mn2+ ion pump that supplies the Golgi with these ions (31Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Homologs of Pmr1p are classed as secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPases and are distinct from the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (34Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase class of P-type ATPases has been identified in a wide range of fungal and animal cells, including S. cerevisiae. Disruption of PMR1 in S. cerevisiae results in a range of phenotypes, including some protein-sorting defects such as elevated secretion of heterologously expressed proteins (35Moir D.T. Dumais D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Harmsen M.M. Bruyne M.I. Raue H.A. Maat J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and incomplete processing of the α-factor (32Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The null mutant also has severe glycosylation defects affecting both N- and O-linked mannoproteins (31Rudolph H.K. Antebi A.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of a gross defect in glycosylation on host-fungus interactions and virulence, we constructed a null mutant of the C. albicans PMR1 homolog. We reasoned that this mutant would down-regulate glycosylation in general, allowing the importance of this protein modification to fungal virulence to be assessed. The null mutant had severe defects in both O- and N-glycosylation and was hypersensitive to cell wall stress. In a murine model of systemic infection, the strain was severely attenuated in virulence. These results demonstrate that normal glycosylation is not required for growth in vitro, but is essential for the virulence of C. albicans. Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—All strains used and constructed during this work are listed in Table I. Strains were grown at 30 °C in YEPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) mycological peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) or in SD medium (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 2% glucose) with uridine (50 μg/ml) as required. Calcium-deficient medium was prepared as SD medium but with the omission of CaCl2 from the yeast nitrogen base. The only source of calcium ions in this medium was from the calcium salt of pantothenoate (present at 0.8 μm). Solid media were prepared with 2% technical agar no. 3. Hyphal cells were grown in YEPD medium + 20% newborn calf serum, RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), or Lee's medium (pH 6.5) (37Lee K.L. Buckley H.R. Campbell C.C. Sabouraudia. 1975; 13: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) at 37 °C or in solid Spider medium (38Liu H. Kohler J. Fink G.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. To induce acid phosphatase expression, cells were grown in Sabouraud glucose medium depleted of phosphate. Phosphate ions from 1% neopeptone were allowed to precipitate for 30 min after the addition of 0.01 m MgSO4 and 0.28% NH4OH, followed by filtration and adjustment to pH 5.4 with concentrated HCl before the addition of glucose to a final concentration of 4% (w/v). For virulence testing, strains were grown in NGY medium (0.1% neopeptone, 0.4% glucose, and 0.1% yeast extract) at 30 °C.Table IStrains used in this studyStrainParent strainGenotypeSourceCAI-4ura3Δ::imm434/ura3Δ::imm434Ref. 39Fonzi W.A.

Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make the disruption cassette, the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the gene were amplified by PCR (5′-primer pair 5′-GAAGAGCTCACGGCAATGTAAGTAAGTGCG-3′ and 5′-GAAAGATCTGTGATGGCTAATGTGATCG-3′, with the SacI and BglII restriction sites underlined, respectively; and 3′-primer pair 5′-GAAGTCGACCAGTATTGCTGCATTGAC-3′ and 5′-GAAGCATGCTGCAAGCTATACACCATAAC-3′, with the SalI and SphI restriction sites underlined, respectively) and cloned into the complementary restriction sites of pMB-7 (39Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption cassette was released by digestion with SacI and SphI and contained the ura-blaster cassette flanked by complementary sequences 733 bp upstream and 620 bp downstream of CaPMR1. CaPMR1 was disrupted by sequential rounds of transformation of strain CAI-4 and the recycling of the URA3 marker by selection on SD medium plus 5-fluoroorotic acid (1 mg/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml). To avoid potential problems associated with the ectopic expression of URA3 (40Brand A. MacCallum D.M. Brown A.J.P. Gow N.A.R. Odds F.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the Ura-Capmr1Δ null strain was transformed with StuI-digested CIp10 plasmid (41Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so that URA3 was expressed at the RPS1 locus (orf19.3002, formally referred to as RPS10). To create a re-integrant strain to act as a control, the CaPMR1 open reading frame plus 1055 bp of its promoter and 765 bp of its terminator were amplified by PCR (primer Pair 5′-CAGACCTAGTCCGACATTGGC-3′ and 5′-ATGAAGCAAGTATCATTGGAGC-3′), and the 3.6-kb product was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK). The insert was released by NotI digestion and subcloned into the NotI site of CIp10. The resulting plasmid was digested with StuI and transformed into the Ura-Capmr1Δ null strain. As a positive control for experiments, strain CAI-4 was also transformed with StuI-digested CIp10; hence, all strains analyzed in this work have URA3 expressed at the RPS1 locus. The two RPS1 alleles in strain CAI-4 can be distinguished by the presence of a polymorphism resulting in the presence or absence of an XbaI restriction site downstream of RPS1. As an added control, all strains used were confirmed to have CIp10 inserted into the non-XbaI-containing RPS1 allele. Sensitivity Testing—To test strains for sensitivity to specific wall-stressing agents, strains were initially grown for 24 h in YEPD medium and then washed with water and resuspended at A600 = 1. These cells were inoculated into YEPD medium at A600 = 0.01, and 95-μl volumes were pipetted into microdilution plate wells. Test agents in 5-μl volumes were added at a range of doubling dilutions. Plates were incubated for 16 h at 30 °C, and absorbance was read at 600 nm. All strains were tested in duplicate. The agents tested were Calcofluor white (100 μg/ml), Congo red (100 μg/ml), SDS (0.1%), hygromycin B (500 μg/ml), a high salt concentration (NaCl2, KCl, CaCl2, MnCl2, or MgCl2; each at 1 m), caffeine (50 mm), vanadate (80 mm), and tunicamycin (100 μg/ml). The concentrations listed are the maximal concentration tested for each agent. Antifungal susceptibility testing was carried out by standard methods (42National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeast Approved Standard. 2nd Ed. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA2002Google Scholar), except that agents were diluted beyond the stated ranges because derivatives of the C. albicans SC5314 genetic background are known to be highly susceptible to antifungal agents. Protein Extracts and Western Blotting—To test for activation of the cell integrity pathway (43de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), cells were grown in YEPD medium at 30 °C and collected in mid-exponential growth. For positive controls, the strains were stressed by the addition of 100 μg/ml Calcofluor white 2 h before collection. Cells were washed and resuspended in extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, UK)) and then disrupted with glass beads in a FastPrep machine (Qbiogene, Inc., Cambridge, UK). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 10 min. Protein extracts were quantified using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce, Cramlington, UK). Prior to Western blotting, 50 μg of protein was separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) before blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Detection was then carried out with the PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAPK antibody kit (New England Bio-labs Inc., Hertfordshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This antibody cross-reacts with C. albicans Mkc1p (Slt2p) in its phosphorylated form. Cell Wall Analysis—Alcian blue binding assays were carried out as described previously (26Hobson R.P. Munro C.A. Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Cutler J.E. Heinsbroek S.E. Brown G.D. Odds F.C. Gow N.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39628-39635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 × 107 stationary phase cells were washed with water, resuspended in 1 ml of Alcian blue (30 μg/ml) in 0.02 m HCl, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then spun down, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 620 nm was measured to determine the level of non-bound Alcian blue from a calibration curve. From these values, the specific amount of Alcian blue bound to cells was calculated (1 unit = 1 μg bound per A600 unit of cell suspension). Total cell wall carbohydrate composition was analyzed by hydrolyzing cell walls with sulfuric acid and determining the monosaccharide composition by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection as described previously (44Dallies N. Francois J. Paquet V. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 45Munro C.A. Whitton R.K. Hughes H.B. Rella M. Selvaggini S. Gow N.A.R. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2003; 40: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling of Glycans and TLC—For the analysis of O-linked and acid-labile glycans, yeast cells were initially labeled with d-[2-3H]mannose. Cells growing in 2 ml of YP medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) mycological peptone) + 0.5% sucrose were incubated with 1.85 MBq of d-[2-3H]mannose (555 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, UK) at 30 °C for 90 min. Cells were then harvested, resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted with glass beads as described above. The cell walls were collected and washed twice with 1 m NaCl and twice with water. O-Linked glycans were released by β-elimination with 100 mm NaOH for 16 h at room temperature. Cell walls were pelleted at 21,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing O-linked glycans was retained for TLC analysis. The cell walls were washed twice with water and then boiled for 1 h in 10 mm HCl to release the acid-labile glycans. The remaining cell walls were pelleted as described above, and the supernatant was retained for TLC analysis. Samples for TLC were spotted onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (What-man, Brentford, UK) and allowed to dry. Plates were chromatographed by two ascents of the solvent (3:4:2.5:4 ethyl acetate/butan-1-ol/acetic acid/water). For detection, plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and visualized by autofluorography (East-man Kodak BioMax XLS). Acid Phosphatase Zymogram—In situ acid phosphatase activity assays were performed following a modified method of Schweingruber et al. (46Schweingruber A.M. Schoenholzer F. Keller L. Schwaninger R. Trachsel H. Schweingruber M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in phosphate-depleted Sabouraud glucose medium to induce acid phosphatase expression. Cells were collected and washed before resuspension in 200 μl of lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were then disrupted with glass beads as described above. The lysate was clarified by two rounds of centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 10 min. For endoglycosidase H treatment, the native sample was treated with 25 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were then mixed with nondenaturing loading dye (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.01% bromphenol blue, 15% glycerol) and run on a 6% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) under nondenaturing conditions for 6 h at 125 V. The gel was rinsed in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with substrate solution (0.05% α-naphthyl phosphate in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2)) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the gel was stained with 0.05% α-naphthyl phosphate and 0.03% fast blue in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) at 60 °C for 10–30 min until the color developed. Adhesion to Buccal Epithelial Cells—Adhesion to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) was assessed by a modification of a method previously described for measuring adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells (47Odds F.C. Webster C.E. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1988; 22: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, BEC were collected from a healthy volunteer, washed twice with physiological saline, and resuspended at 5 × 105 BEC/ml. C. albicans strains were grown in NGY medium, washed twice with physiological saline, and suspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml. The C. albicans strain and BEC were then mixed in equal proportions (200 μl) to achieve a 10:1 ratio of yeast cells to BEC and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The cells were fixed with formalin, and the BEC were scored for the number of yeast cells adhered. At least 150 BEC were assessed for C. albicans adherence, and the assay was carried out in triplicate. Virulence Assays—For virulence testing of strains, immunocompetent female BALB/c mice (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd., Loughborough, UK) were challenged intravenously. Strains were grown with shaking for 18–24 h in NGY medium at 30 °C. Cells were washed twice with water and resuspended in physiological saline. Groups of five or six mice were inoculated intravenously with each strain at 2.1 × 104 colony-forming units (cfu)/g of mouse body weight. Mice were monitored over 28 days; animals showing signs of distress or illness were humanely terminated; and deaths were recorded as occurring the following day. The kidneys and brains were removed post mortem and homogenized in 0.5 ml of water, and C. albicans tissue burdens were determined by viable counting. Isolation and Analysis of CaPMR1—We initially identified CaPMR1 before the completion of the C. albicans genome project by PCR with primers based on an unpublished sequence showing homology to S. cerevisiae PMR1 and a degenerate primer based on the P-loop found in all P-type ATPases. The regions surrounding CaPMR1 were then cloned by unidirectional Vectorette PCR (Sigma, Haverhill, UK) (48Riley J. Butler R. Ogilvie D. Finniear R. Jenner D. Powell S. Anand R. Smith J.C.

The CaPMR1 open reading frame of 2754 bp (GenBank™/EBI accession AJ277171) is predicted to encode a protein of 917 amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W2120579879,"Little is known about the organization of lipids in biomembranes. Lipid rafts are defined as sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich clusters in the membrane. Details of the lipid distribution of lipid rafts are not well characterized mainly because of a lack of appropriate probes. Ganglioside GM1-specific protein, cholera toxin, has long been the only lipid probe of lipid rafts. Recently it was shown that earthworm toxin, lysenin, specifically recognizes sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains. Binding of lysenin to sphingomyelin is accompanied by the oligomerization of the toxin that leads to pore formation in the target membrane. In this study, we generated a truncated lysenin mutant that does not oligomerize and thus is non-toxic. Using this mutant lysenin, we showed that plasma membrane sphingomyelin-rich domains are spatially distinct from ganglioside GM1-rich membrane domains in Jurkat T cells. Like T cell receptor activation and cross-linking of GM1, cross-linking of sphingomyelin induced calcium influx and ERK phosphorylation in the cell. However, unlike CD3 or GM1, cross-linking of sphingomyelin did not induce significant protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Combination of lysenin and sphingomyelinase treatment suggested the involvement of G-protein-coupled receptor in sphingomyelin-mediated signal transduction. These results thus suggest that the sphingomyelin-rich domain provides a functional signal cascade platform that is distinct from those provided by T cell receptor or GM1. Our study therefore elucidates the spatial and functional heterogeneity of lipid rafts. Little is known about the organization of lipids in biomembranes.

Our study therefore elucidates the spatial and functional heterogeneity of lipid rafts. Whereas the bilayer organization of biomembranes can be reconstituted in artificial liposomes with a simple lipid composition, biological membranes contain thousands of different lipid species whose cellular distribution is stringently controlled (1Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This complex distribution of lipids suggests that the targeting of lipids is highly regulated and that cells require a complex lipid supramolecular organization within their membranes. In the plasma membrane, most of the sphingolipids reside in the outer leaflet, whereas phospholipids containing the amino groups, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, are located in the cytoplasmic surface (2Balasubramanian K. Schroit A.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 701-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Lateral segregation of lipids on the plasma membrane is also reported. A typical example is a lipid heterogeneity between the apical and the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells (4van Meer G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The lipid diffusion barrier between axons and dendrites (5Kobayashi T. Storrie B. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Nakada C. Ritchie K. Oba Y. Nakamura M. Hotta Y. Iino R. Kasai R.S. Yamaguchi K. Fujiwara T. Kusumi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) is another example. The existence of submicrometer scale heterogeneity of plasma membrane lipids is a matter of debate. In particular, the proposed existence of specific types of microdomains called lipid rafts that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids attracts much attention (7Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar, 8Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are suggested to play important roles in a number of cellular processes as diverse as signal transduction, membrane traffic, and pathogen entry (9Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Detergent insolubility has been an operational definition of lipid rafts in cell membranes (10London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, recent results indicate that detergent resistance does not correlate with the existence of lipid domains (11Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Therefore, a more direct approach is required to understand the detailed organization of membrane lipids. At present, this approach is hindered by the lack of appropriate probes.

Previously it was shown that the earthworm toxin lysenin specifically recognizes SM (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol.

Kobayashi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9766-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently we have revealed that lysenin recognizes SM only when SM forms aggregates or domains (15Ishitsuka R. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Hirabayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 296-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Ishitsuka R. Kobayashi T. Anat. Sci. Int. 2004; 79: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using these characteristics, we have shown that SM exists as aggregates of at least a few lipid molecules in most of the membranes. We have also shown that the distribution of SM is different among different cell types as well as between different membrane domains in the same cell. One big problem of using lysenin as an SM probe is its toxicity. In the present study, we developed a non-toxic mutant of lysenin that recognizes SM. This mutant lysenin made it possible to examine the distribution of SM in living cells. Using mutant lysenin and sphingomyelinase, we showed that SM-rich domains in the plasma membrane are spatially and functionally segregated from the ganglioside GM1-rich membrane domains.

The gradient was centrifuged for 20 h at 90,000 × g at 4 °C using a Beckman Coulter Optima™ MAX-E ultra-centrifuge. Fractions (0.6 ml each) were collected from the top of the tube and were subjected to Western blotting. Fluorescence intensity of N-NBD-PE was also measured to monitor the position of liposomes in the gradient. Niemann-Pick type A (NPA) fibroblasts and the Jurkat cell line were gifts from Drs. Hitoshi Sakuraba and Michiyuki Matsuda, respectively. NPA cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. The mutant Jurkat cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The wild type and mutant Jurkat cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. NPA fibroblasts were plated onto cover glass. After 24-48 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 10 min, preincubated with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated with the recombinant protein for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were fixed again, incubated with anti-GST antibody for 30 min followed by the addition of anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa 488, and mounted in Mowiol. For SMase treatment, NPA cells were incubated with 10 milliunits/ml recombinant B. cereus sphingomyelinase in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Jurkat cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml HV-NT-Lys or His-monomer Venus A206K-non-toxic lysenin (HmV-NT-Lys) in the presence of 10 μg/ml CTxB conjugated with Alexa 594 on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were then placed onto a glass-bottomed culture dish precoated with poly-l-lysine (MatTEK). Confocal images were obtained using an LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 100× (1.4 numerical aperture) objective and processed with LSM Image Browser (Zeiss). Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay (22Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 106 Jurkat cells were washed with PBS twice, incubated with various concentrations of GST or GST-NT-Lys for 30 min at room temperature, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without sera, and then cultured in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml MTT at 37 °C.

Briefly cells were first labeled with HmV-NT-Lys and biotinylated cholera toxin B fragments at 4 °C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.02% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were quenched with 0.1 m NH4Cl and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin. The fixed cells were labeled with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody at 4 °C followed by labeling with goat anti-rabbit IgG-5-nm gold and goat anti-biotin-IgG-10-nm gold at 4 °C. The labeled cells were attached to nickel EM grids that had been coated with Formvar and carbon and treated with poly-l-lysine (0.8 mg/ml for 30 min followed by a 10-s distilled H2O rinse and air drying). The cell-attached EM grids were covered with a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip, and pressure was applied to the coverslip for 20 s by bearing down with a rubber cork. The coverslips were lifted, leaving fragments of the cell membranes adherent to the grids. Membranes were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and further fixed for 10 min with 1% OsO4 in distilled H2O. Samples were then processed for 10 min in 1% aqueous tannic acid followed by two 5-min rinses with distilled H2O, 10 min with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, and two 1-min rinses with distilled H2O. The grids were air-dried, examined, and photographed at ×50,000 using a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV. Twenty EM negatives were digitized with an image scanner (Epson GT-X700). The scanned images were contrast-adjusted and trimmed at 1500 × 1500 nm with Photoshop 6.0 software. The x-y coordinates of each gold particle were obtained with ImageJ public domain software. Obtained data were analyzed with Ripley's K-function using SPSS 2.0 software. Intracellular Free Ca2+ Measurement—Jurkat cells were harvested from the growth medium, and 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Fura-2AM (Dojin Kagaku) was added to the cells at the final concentration of 3 μm. After 30 min at 35 °C, the cells were washed twice with Fura-2 solution (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaHPO4, 0.1% glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in 3 ml of the same solution. The ratio of the light intensity emitted at 505 nm upon dye excitation at the two wavelengths 340 and 380 nm at 35 °C was measured every other second using an FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). When indicated as EGTA buffer, EGTA (pH 8.0) was added to the buffer at the final concentration of 1 mm. For SMase treatment, SMase (1.25 units/ml) was added during Fura-2AM loading. 3 × 106 Jurkat cells were washed with PBS twice, incubated with 50 μg/ml GST or GST-NT-Lys for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with or without 10 μg/ml monoclonal anti-GST antibody. Cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and replated onto 12-well plates precoated with anti-mouse Ig antibody as described previously (26Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). After the indicated period, an equal volume of cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 2% Triton X-100 was added. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 3-5 × 106 cells were suspended in Nucleofector™ solution V and then 3 μg of pIM21-H-Ras N17, which codes for a dominant negative form of H-Ras with mRFP under an internal ribosome entry site sequence, was introduced using program C-16 of the Nucleofector device (Amaxa). 72 h later, the cells were utilized for analysis. In the previous study, we used native lysenin or full-length recombinant lysenin to characterize the organization of SM on plasma membranes (13Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22762-22770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Ishitsuka R. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Hirabayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 296-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One drawback of using full-length lysenin is its toxicity. Recently we examined the role of tryptophan residues of the protein on the recognition of SM and the cell toxicity (14Kiyokawa E. Makino A. Ishii K. Otsuka N. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Kobayashi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9766-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Systematic tryptophan to alanine mutation resulted in either the loss of both SM recognition and cell killing activities or no significant alteration of both activities. In the present study we prepared a series of deletion mutants of lysenin and measured their SM binding and hemolytic activities. Fig. 1A indicates the list of these deletion mutants. Mutants were tagged with MBP at their N termini and expressed in E. coli. The cytotoxicity of the MBP-conjugated mutants was analyzed by measuring hemolysis against sheep erythrocytes, whereas the recognition of SM was assessed by immunofluorescence labeling of fibroblasts from a NPA patient (14Kiyokawa E. Makino A. Ishii K. Otsuka N. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Kobayashi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9766-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NPA cells are deficient in acid SMase activity and therefore accumulate SM in late endosomes/lysosomes. As shown in Fig. 1A, deletion of C-terminal amino acids diminished the recognition of SM by lysenin. In contrast, lysenin could bind SM even after removal of N-terminal amino acids. The minimal fragment that could recognize SM contained amino acids 161-297 of lysenin. Hereafter we refer to this minimal peptide as NT-Lys. It is noteworthy that all deletion mutants lost their hemolytic activity. Changing the tag from MBP to GST did not alter the activity of the lysenin mutants. In Fig. 1, B and C, the binding specificity of GST-lysenin and the deletion mutant GST-NT-Lys was compared by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-NT-Lys had lower affinity than GST-lysenin. However, both GST-lysenin and GST-NT-Lys selectively bound SM. Slightly positive signals were obtained with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine in both GST-lysenin and GST-NT-Lys. Other phospholipids, sphingolipids, or glycolipids bound neither GST-lysenin nor GST-NT-Lys. GST alone did not bind to any lipids. The kinetic parameters of GST-NT-Lys binding to SM were then determined using the BIAcore system, and the results were compared with those published for earthworm lysenin (12Yamaji A. Sekizawa Y. Emoto K. Sakuraba H. Inoue K. Kobayashi H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5300-5306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Table I). GST-NT-Lys and native lysenin showed comparable on-rate of binding to SM. In contrast, dissociation of GST-NT-Lys was 100 times faster than that of native lysenin. This is a 36-fold difference of overall KD. To overcome this difference, we used relatively high concentrations of non-toxic lysenins compared with native lysenin throughout our experiments. In Fig. 1D, we examined the selective binding of GST-NT-Lys to SM using artificial membranes. Multilamellar liposomes composed of SM/PC/cholesterol (Chol), S1P/PC/Chol, or SPC/PC/Chol were prepared. All liposomes contained fluorescent phosphatidylethanolamine as a non-exchangeable liposome marker. After incubation with GST or GST-NT-Lys, liposomes were separated from unbound proteins by a flotation gradient. GST-NT-Lys floated up together with SM/PC/Chol liposomes, whereas GST alone remained at the bottom of the gradient. The GST-NT-Lys probe weakly bound to S1P/PC/Chol liposomes. GST-NT-Lys did not float up when SPC/PC/Chol liposomes were used. These results indicate that GST-NT-Lys selectively binds SM-containing membranes. Native and full-length lysenins oligomerize in the presence of sphingomyelin (13Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Baba T. Senoh Y. Kimura-Suda H. Sato S.B. Terada N. Ohno S. Kiyokawa E. Umeda M.

Unlike native lysenin, SM did not induce oligomerization of GST-NT-Lys as shown in Fig. 1E. The recognition of cellular SM by GST-NT-Lys was then examined by measuring the binding of GST-NT-Lys to fixed and permeabilized NPA fibroblasts. Like native and non-truncated lysenin, GST-NT-Lys labeled intracellular organelles that are co-localized with tetraspanin CD63, which is enriched in lysosomes/late endosomes (28Escola J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2147716262,"The high molecular mass glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) can become modified by the covalent attachment of heavy chains (HCs) derived from the serum protein inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI), which is composed of three subunits (HC1, HC2 and bikunin) linked together via a chondroitin sulfate moiety. The formation of HC.HA is likely to play an important role in the stabilization of HA-rich extracellular matrices in the context of inflammatory disease (e.g. arthritis) and ovulation. Here, we have characterized the complexes formed in vitro between purified human IalphaI and recombinant human TSG-6 (an inflammation-associated protein implicated previously in this process) and show that these complexes (i.e. TSG-6 x HC1 and TSG-6 x HC2) act as intermediates in the formation of HC x HA. This is likely to involve two transesterification reactions in which an ester bond linking an HC to chondroitin sulfate in intact IalphaI is transferred first onto TSG-6 and then onto HA. The formation of TSG-6 x HC1 and TSG-6 x C2 complexes was accompanied by the production of bikunin x HC2 and bikunin x HC1 by-products, respectively, which were observed to break down, releasing free bikunin and HCs. Both TSG-6 x HC formation and the subsequent HC transfer are metal ion-dependent processes; these reactions have a requirement for either Mg2+ or Mn2+ and are inhibited by Co2+. TSG-6, which is released upon the transfer of HCs from TSG-6 onto HA, was shown to combine with IalphaI to form new TSG-6 x HC complexes and thus be recycled. The finding that TSG-6 acts as cofactor and catalyst in the production of HC x HA complexes has important implications for our understanding of inflammatory and inflammation-like processes."
https://openalex.org/W2109183374,"The capacity of DNA damaging agents to induce apoptosis is regulated by target gene induction by p53. We found that p53 targeted MDM2 in cells in which DNA repair was occurring, but persistent DNA damage induced by chemotherapy led p53 to selectively target PTEN. High dose chemotherapy induced the phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46, whereas low dose chemotherapy did not. A nonphosphorylatable serine 46 to alanine p53 mutant (S46A) targeted the MDM2 promoter in preference to that for PTEN. A serine 46 to aspartate mutant (S46D, a phosphorylation mimic) targeted PTEN in preference to MDM2. These observations show that phosphorylation of serine 46 in p53 is sufficient for it to induce the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) tumor suppressor protein in preference to MDM2. S46A induced significantly less cell death than the S46D in cells. The phosphorylation-induced change of p53 promoter targeting suppresses the induction of MDM2 and the formation of the autoregulatory feedback loop. Induction of PTEN by p53 followed by expression of PTEN inhibits AKT-induced translocation of MDM2 into the nucleus and sustains p53 function.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The induction of MDM2 prevents inappropriate apoptosis by suppressing p53 function. AKT phosphorylates MDM2 and induces its movement into the nucleus, in which it down-regulates p53 (37Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5484-5489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In damaged or mutated cells p53 activates genes that promote apoptosis; among these is PTEN (41Stambolic V. MacPherson D. Sas D. Lin Y. Snow B. Jang Y. Benchimol S. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 can induce MDM2, which inhibits p53 function. Alternatively, p53 can induce PTEN, which stabilizes p53 by segregating it from MDM2. This facilitates formation of a cycle in which p53 induces PTEN and PTEN stabilizes p53. PTEN and p53 facilitate the activities of each other to induce cell death. The mechanism that leads p53 to alter target gene selection is fundamental to understanding its actions and the subject of this study.Here we demonstrate that as the concentration of etoposide to which cells are exposed increases, an alteration from the induction of antiapoptotic MDM2 to proapoptotic PTEN occurs, and this dictates whether cells live or die. This change of protein induction by p53 results from the phosphorylation of serine 46 and an alteration of gene promoter selection. A consequence of the change of promoter targeting is that cells exposed to low levels of stress respond with the induction of MDM2, a protective response (22Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar), whereas high levels of stress abrogate the protective response and induce an apoptotic amplification cycle that promotes death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Saos-2, H1299, and U20S cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum.

The present study assayed changes of signaling associated with etoposide-induced apoptosis, leading us to evaluate etoposide effects over a concentration range of 4.7 to 470 nm.

Some cells were transfected with the pHook vector (Invitrogen) that encodes a single chain surface antibody (c-MYC-tagged sFv) that was used for normalization of transfection efficiency as described in figure legends. For reporter assays, cells were transfected with β-galactosidase and vectors using the calcium phosphate method, and reporter activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The PTEN reporter was a gift from Dr. Ian de Belle and has been described recently (51Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat.

Debris was collected by centrifugation, and equal amounts of supernatant protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with antibodies to phospho-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA), p53, MDM2, p53AIP1, PTEN, p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and GAPDH (Babco, Berkeley, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to active caspase 3 was from Chemicon Inc. (Temecula, CA). Generally, antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:1000 or 1:1500. After incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—U2OS cells were treated as described in the legends, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol.

One μg of total RNA was used for RT-PCR with the Superscript One-step kit (Invitrogen) (30 and 15 cycles for MDM2 and GAPDH, respectively). The PCR products, 900 bp for MDM2 and 260 bp for GAPDH, were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to mutate serine 46 in human p53. Oligonucleotides used were 5′-gattgatgctggccccggacgatattg-3′ and 5′-aatatcgtccggggccagcatcaaatc-3′. Mutagenesis was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.Alkaline Comet Assays—After treatment with etoposide, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in culture medium for 2 h, and 104 to 5 × 104 cells were embedded in 0.5% agarose and spread on a comet slide. Cells were lysed during a 30-min incubation with 2.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, 10 mm Tris base, and 100 mm EDTA, pH 10, at 4 °C. The lysate was treated with 300 mm sodium hydroxide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 13.0, for 30 min to unwind DNA, and electrophoresis was performed in cold 300 mm sodium hydroxide, 1 mmm EDTA for 25 min (1 V/cm, 250 mA). Slides were neutralized in Tris buffer (0.4 m, pH 7.4), stained with SYBR green staining solution, and scored by fluorescence microscopy. Two hundred comets on each slide were classified according to relative fluorescence intensity in the tail as follows: I (none, < 5%); II (low, 5–20%); III (medium, 20–40%), IV (high, 40–95%); V (total, >95%). For evaluation of DNA damage (arbitrary units), each comet was given a value of 0–4 (from undamaged (I, 0) to maximally damaged (V, 4)).Apoptosis—Cells were fixed in 1% formalin/PBS, stained with 20 μg/ml acridine orange, and visualized using a fluorescence microscope with a blue-green filter. Apoptotic cells showed cytoplasmic and nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation or fragmentation. At least 200 cells were analyzed, and the fraction of apoptotic cells is reported as percentage of the total (the apoptotic ratio). For 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, cells were treated as described, and viability was determined (40Mayo L.D. Dixon J.E. Durden D.L. Tonks N.K. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5484-5489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo define conditions that lead p53 to induce MDM2 or PTEN, asynchronous U2OS cells were treated with 4.7, 47, or 470 nm etoposide for 2 h, the medium was changed, and cells were harvested. This regimen was chosen to simulate how cells in a tumor would be exposed to chemotherapy. Each concentration of etoposide increased the levels of p53, but the magnitude and duration of response increased with the dose of etoposide (Fig. 1A). MDM2 rose in parallel with p53 in cells treated with 4.7 and 47 nm etoposide but remained low in cells treated with 470 nm etoposide. PTEN was not induced by 4.7 or 47 nm etoposide but increased robustly in cells treated with 470 nm etoposide.To test whether the increase of the MDM2 and PTEN proteins was due to increased levels of mRNA, RNA was isolated from cells treated with 4.7 or 470 nm etoposide, and MDM2 and PTEN expression was assessed by RT-PCR. MDM2 was high in cells exposed to 4.7 nm etoposide and lower after treatment with 470 nm etoposide; PTEN was almost undetectable in cells treated with 4.7 nm etoposide but greatly augmented by 470 nm etoposide (Fig. 1B).Etoposide induces DNA double strand breaks. To examine whether the persistence of DNA damage corresponded to MDM2 or PTEN induction, we performed a comet assay. Etoposide induced DNA damage in a concentration-dependent manner, and damage that persisted 6 h after treatment was greater in cells treated with 470 nm than with 47 or 4.7 etoposide (Fig. 1C). Confocal microscopy showed that 470 nm but not 4.7 nm etoposide induced irregular morphology and shrinkage characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 1D, top), and this was quantified by double blind analysis (Fig. 1D, bottom).We hypothesized that the autoregulatory feedback loop that attenuates p53 function by the induction of MDM2 may be negated during high dose chemotherapy by a change of promoter targeting favoring activation of PTEN. To test this, p53-null Saos-2 cells were transfected with transcriptionally active or inactive p53 in the absence or presence of MDM2, and Western blotting showed that MDM2 diminished p53 levels and subsequently a product of one of its target genes, PTEN (Fig. 2A). Transcriptionally inactive mutant (22/23) p53, which does not bind and is not down-regulated by MDM2, did not induce PTEN (Fig. 2A). To determine whether p53 elevates PTEN in response to DNA damage, HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines isogenically matched for the presence or absence of p53 were treated with etoposide. Etoposide increased PTEN only in p53-positive cells (Fig. 2B). To reinforce the conclusion that p53 is required for PTEN induction, we took advantage of the fact that p14arf stabilizes p53 (52Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar) and used U2OS cells engineered to express p14Arf when treated with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (53Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Induction of p14arf increased p53 and PTEN protein levels and expression of another p53 target, p21 (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Induction of PTEN by p53. A, p53-null Saos-2 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of wild type or mutant (22/23) p53 and 3 μg of the pHook expression plasmid in the absence or presence of 5 μg of an MDM2 plasmid. Western blots were probed with anti-p53, anti-PTEN, or anti-MYC (to detect pHook as control for variances of transfection efficiencies). B, wild type or p53-null isogenically matched Hct116 cells were treated with 2.35 μm etoposide for 2 h. At this time, or 2 or 4 h thereafter, cells were lysed, and Western blots were prepared and probed for PTEN, p53, and GAPDH. C, U2OS cells expressing p14arf were treated in the absence or presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and protein levels of p14arf, p53, p21, and PTEN were assayed by Western blotting. D, catalytically inactive (C124S) PTEN or PTEN (2 μg), β-galactosidase (1 μg), and the PTEN promoter coupled to the luciferase gene (0.5 μg) were transfected into U2OS cells. PTEN promoter activity was assayed. E, catalytically inactive or wild type PTEN (2 μg), β-galactosidase (1 μg), and the PTEN reporter (0.5 μg) were transfected into p53-positive or -null HCT116 cells. Black bars represent PTEN activity in cells wild type for p53; white bars, activity in p53-null cells. Relative luciferase activity was the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase light units. Results shown are from three independent transfections, and S.D. was derived from the mean. F, MCF7 cells were transfected with 6 μg of vector or PTEN, 1.5 μg of PTEN reporter, and 3 μg of β-galactosidase in the absence or presence of pifithrin-α. Twenty-four h thereafter the cells were lysed, and PTEN promoter activity was assayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gene reporter assays showed that p53 mediated its effect on PTEN by activation of the PTEN promoter. U2OS cells, wild type for p53, were transfected with vector, catalytically dead (C124S) PTEN or PTEN, and a PTEN promoter luciferase reporter. Ectopic expression of active but not inactive PTEN activated the PTEN promoter, presumably by inhibiting the nuclear movement of MDM2 and thereby sustaining the function of p53 (Fig. 2D). To show that p53 activates the PTEN promoter, isogenically matched HCT116 cells, wild type or null for p53, were transfected with PTEN or catalytically inactive PTEN (C124S) and the PTEN reporter. PTEN activated PTEN only in HCT116 cells that contained p53 (Fig. 2E). The capacity of the p53 antagonist, pifithrin, to block the induction of the PTEN in p53-positive cells also showed that p53 mediated PTEN induction (Fig. 2F). Thus, in addition to inducing MDM2, which protects cells from death, p53 can induce PTEN and promote apoptosis.p53 is phosphorylated at numerous sites in response to DNA damage. This led us to evaluate changes of p53 phosphorylation in U2OS cells treated with different concentrations of etoposide. Although quantitative evaluation of the relative stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation is difficult, qualitative comparison of the time courses of phosphorylation of various sites in p53 from the same extracts was performed to permit us to ultimately focus on a particular site in p53. Cells were incubated with a high or low concentration of etoposide for various times, and 50 μg of lysate from each incubate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were then probed with antibodies that would recognize alterations of any phosphorylation site over time. The time dependence of phosphorylation of serines 6, 9, 15, 20, 37, or 392 (Fig. 3A), did not correlate with the time and concentration dependencies of PTEN induction in these cells (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of serine 46 was unaffected by the treatment of cells with 4.7 nm etoposide but increased with time when cells were incubated with 470 nm etoposide (Fig. 3A). The response of normal human mammary epithelial cells to etoposide was also examined (Fig. 3B). Human mammary epithelial cells were incubated with 4.7 or 470 nm etoposide for 5 h. MDM2 levels increased after treatment with 4.7 but not 470 nm etoposide. As with U2OS cells (Fig. 1A), PTEN was induced by 470 but not by 4.7 nm etoposide, and this correlated with phosphorylation of serine 46 in p53.Fig. 3Etoposide-induced phosphorylation of p53. A, U2OS cells were treated with 4.7 or 470 nm etoposide for various times and then harvested. Equal volumes of cell lysate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots determined the phosphorylation status of serines (pSer) 6, 9, 15, 20, 37, 46, and 392. Results are from a representative experiment. B, normal human mammary epithelial cells were treated with 4.7 or 470 nm etoposide, and a Western blot was prepared from cell extracts after 5 h. p53, phosphorylation of serines 46 and 15 in p53, PTEN, MDM2, and GAPDH were examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interest in serine 46 was reinforced by the demonstration that its phosphorylation correlated with increased PTEN in cells treated with 470 nm etoposide. Expression of apoptosis-induced protein 1 (p53AIP1) is dependent on serine 46 phosphorylation of p53 and plays a role in the induction of the apoptotic program (54Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T.

https://openalex.org/W2110200667,"Most bacteria contain soluble quinone-reducing flavoenzymes. However, no biological benefit for this activity has previously been demonstrated. ChrR of Pseudomonas putida is one such enzyme that has also been characterized as a chromate reductase; yet we propose that it is the quinone-reducing activity of ChrR that has the greatest biological significance. ChrR reduces quinones by simultaneous two-electron transfer, avoiding formation of highly reactive semiquinone intermediates and producing quinols that promote tolerance of H2O2. Expression of chrR was induced by H2O2, and levels of chrR expression in overexpressing, wild type, and knock-out mutant strains correlated with the H2O2 tolerance and scavenging ability of each strain. The chrR expression level also correlated with intracellular H2O2 levels as measured by protein carbonylation assays and fluorescence-activated cell scanning analysis with the H2O2-responsive dye H2DCFDA. Thus, enhancing the activity of ChrR in a chromate-remediating bacterial strain may not only increase the rate of chromate transformation, it may also augment the capacity of these cells to withstand the unavoidable production of H2O2 that accompanies chromate reduction.

Microbial bioreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is a promising strategy for detoxification of chromate, a prevalent anthropogenic pollutant. A wide range of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Shewanella oneidensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, pseudomonads, and several sulfate reducers have been identified that are capable of carrying out a complete reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (1Wang Y.T. Lovley D.R. Environmental Microbe-Metal Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 225-235Google Scholar, 2Keyhan M. Ackerley D.F. Matin A. Pellei M. Porta A. Remediation of Contaminated Sediments-2003. Batelle Press, Columbus, OH2003Google Scholar). However, high cell densities are generally required for significant levels of Cr(VI) transformation, and an effective system for in situ bioremediation has yet to be developed. To enhance this activity, we have proposed molecular engineering of cells and enzymes to decrease chromate toxicity to bacteria and increase chromate transformation (3Ackerley D.F. Gonzalez C.F.

Remediation and Beneficial Re-use of Contaminated Sediments. Battelle Press, Columbus, OH2002: 103-111Google Scholar).Previously, we described the purification and characterization of ChrR, a soluble chromate-reducing enzyme from Pseudomonas putida (3Ackerley D.F.

Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). ChrR is a dimeric flavin mononucleotide-binding flavoprotein that is able to catalyze a full reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (6Park C.H. Keyhan M. Wielinga B. Fendorf S. Matin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A chrR mutant of P. putida was impaired both in chromate transformation rate and viability in the presence of chromate (3Ackerley D.F. Gonzalez C.F. Park C.H. Blake R. Keyhan M. Matin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and thus ChrR is a promising candidate for bioengineering studies aimed at generating a more effective chromate-reducing strain. Not only does the identification of individual enzymes that make a discernible contribution to chromate reduction pave the way for directed evolution of an enhanced chromate-reducing enzyme, it also offers scope for regulating the expression of that enzyme in a way that maximizes its chromate-reducing potential.Several researchers have commented that, as introduction of chromate into the environment is a recent anthropogenic event, enzymatic chromate reduction is likely a secondary activity of reductases with different primary roles (6Park C.H. Keyhan M. Wielinga B. Fendorf S. Matin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Ishibashi Y. Cervantes C. Silver S. Appl. Environ.

Petersen J.N. Biotechnol. Prog. 2002; 18: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography during biochemical purification of chromate-reducing enzymes has identified multiple peaks of chromate-reducing activity in cellular extracts (6Park C.H. Keyhan M. Wielinga B. Fendorf S. Matin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1788-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki T. Miyata N. Horitsu H. Kawai K. Takamizawa K. Tai Y. Okazaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5340-5534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with this hypothesis. That chromate reduction might not be the primary biological role of ChrR does not argue against the potential of this enzyme for bioremediation; however, it is of interest to discern what such a role might be, to better gauge possible consequences of manipulating the activity and expression of this enzyme.ChrR contains the signature sequence LFVTPEYNXXXXXX-LKNAIDXXS at amino acid positions 75–98 (3Ackerley D.F. Gonzalez C.F. Park C.H. Blake R. Keyhan M. Matin A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), identifying it as a member of the NADH_dh2 family of putative flavin-binding quinone reductases. Although the membrane-bound quinone oxidoreductases have been well studied in respiration, little is known about the biological role of soluble bacterial quinone reductases, which can be either flavin-binding or flavin-independent (11Maruyama A. Kumagai Y. Morikawa K. Taguchi K. Hayashi H. Ohta T. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The flavoenzymes tend to have broad substrate specificity, and have been primarily characterized in the context of alternative substrates (e.g. nitroreductase NfsA (12Zenno S. Koike H. Kumar A.N. Jayaraman R. Tanokura M. Saigo K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4508-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), ferric reductase FerB (13Mazoch J. Tesarik R. Sedlacek V. Kucera I. Turanek J. Eur.

Remediation and Beneficial Re-use of Contaminated Sediments. Battelle Press, Columbus, OH2002: 103-111Google Scholar)). Even outside of bacteria, only one soluble flavoenzyme has been well characterized as a quinone reductase, namely mammalian NQO1 1The abbreviations used are: NQO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; H2DCFDA, dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; LpDH, lipoyl dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: NQO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1; LB, Luria-Bertani medium; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; H2DCFDA, dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate; LpDH, lipoyl dehydrogenase. (14Ross D. Siegel D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). NQO1 is believed to act primarily in an antioxidant capacity, reducing membrane quinones, such as vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 divalently to quinols, which then act as quenchers of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide radicals (15Beyer R.E.

Bolton E.M. Burr J.A. Liebler D.C. Ross D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ChrR shares no sequence homology with NQO1. Nonetheless, in the work described here, we showed a clear benefit of the quinone reductase activity of ChrR to P. putida in guarding against H2O2 stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. In experiments comparing the wild type and chrR mutant to the chrR+-overexpressing strain, the former two strains contained the empty plasmid pMMB67EH.

High levels of ChrR were detected in cell extracts from the chrR+ strain under these conditions, using the GelCode® His6 protein tag stain (Pierce) (results not shown). Recombinant ChrR protein was purified from BL21(chrR) cells as described previously (3Ackerley D.F. Gonzalez C.F. Park C.H. Blake R. Keyhan M. Matin A. Appl. Environ.

Kinetic measurements of enzyme activity were performed at the optimal pH and temperature for individual quinone substrates, which were determined in separate experiments. Optimal pH was determined using 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.8, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, or 8.0) and Tris/HCl (pH 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, or 8.9) buffers. Optimal temperature was determined in a Shimadzu temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. One-ml reaction mixtures contained 50 mm buffer, 250 μm quinone substrate (50 μm for coenzyme Q1), and 0.1–5.0 μg of purified recombinant ChrR, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 250 μm NADH. For the steady state analysis of the reaction mechanism of ChrR, 1-ml reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.25 μg of ChrR, and 50–250 μm menadione and were initiated by the addition of either 50, 100, or 250 μm NADH. Benzoquinone was added from a 10 mm stock in double distilled H2O, menadione and duroquinone from a 10 mm stock dissolved in ethanol, and coenzyme Q1 from a 200 mm stock in N,N-dimethylformamide that was subsequently diluted to a 250 μm working stock (with continuous vortexing during dilution) in double distilled H2O.The reaction mixture used to investigate semiquinone generation during benzoquinone reduction by the pure ChrR protein or LpDH control (lipoyl dehydrogenase, alternative nomenclature diaphorase, from Clostridium kluyveri; purchased from Sigma), with cytochrome c as a trap for semiquinone, was as follows: 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 (to avoid quinone autoxidation, which occurs spontaneously above pH 7.0), 50 μm benzoquinone, 0.1 μg·ml–1 ChrR or 2.5 μg·ml–1 LpDH, and 75 μm cytochrome c (from horse heart) (Sigma). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 250 μm NADH. Increase in absorbance because of reduced cytochrome c was followed at 550 nm at 30 °C.Culture growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 660 nm. H2O2 was added to the cultures where indicated. Residual H2O2 was assayed with the fluorescent dye Amplex Red (Molecular Probes), and levels of activated dye were quantified in a Turner® Quantech™ fluorometer (Cole Parmer), excitation at 540 nm and emission at 585 nm. Paraquat and CuSO4 stresses were monitored across a range of 20–200 μm and 1–10 mm, respectively.Flow Cytometry—Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) cytometry analysis was performed using the H2O2-activated green fluorescent dye H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes). chrR+, wild type, and chrR mutant cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A660 0.4–0.7), and then each was split into two cultures (one control and one amended with 1 mm H2O2) and incubated as described above for 1 h. Cells (0.5 ml/culture A660) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in LB containing 20 μm H2DCFDA, and then incubated for 15 min and diluted 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline. The fluorescence levels (excitation 488 nm and emission 530 nm) of 50,000 cells were then counted for each strain under each condition using a FACScalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences), as described previously (17Valdivia R.H.

CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences) was used for data analysis and generation of histograms.Detection of Protein Carbonylation by Slot-blotting—chrR+, wild type, and chrR mutant cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A660 0.4–0.5). 1 ml of cells were removed from each culture and pelleted by centrifugation, and 3 mm H2O2 was added to the remaining cultures. Further 1-ml samples were collected at 15 and 60 min. Immediately following centrifugation, each cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 1% SDS), vortexed vigorously, and boiled for 5 min. The protein concentration of each sample was measured using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit, following which, samples were diluted in lysis buffer to 100 μg·ml–1 total protein concentration, and 1 volume of 12% SDS was added to each. 10-μl samples were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and neutralized according to the methods of Levine et al.

The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h in 2% nonfat milk powder in TBST containing a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenol or 2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody (DakoCytomation), washed in TBST, and incubated as before with a 1:12,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Sigma). Bands were visualized with the ECL Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Bisociences) and quantified using TinyQuant© software (Norman Iscove, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada).Determination of chrR Expression Profile by Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—An overnight culture of wild type P. putida KT2440 was used to inoculate two fresh LB cultures, one unamended and one with 1 mm H2O2, to a starting A660 of 0.1. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with aeration, and (0.5 ml/culture A660) sample volumes were collected from each culture every 2 h, treated with a 1/10 volume of stop solution (5% buffer-saturated phenol in 100% ethanol), mixed by inversion, pelleted at 11,000 revolutions/min for 5 min, and then snap-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol water bath and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was prepared from these samples by TRIzol® (Invitrogen) extraction followed by the addition of an equal volume of 70% ethanol and purification on an RNeasy column (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment. Complete DNA removal in each sample was confirmed by PCR using the chrR primers and conditions described below; if product was detected, the samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) and re-purified with an RNeasy column. Final RNA yield was quantified by A260 measurements. Reverse transcription was performed on 0.5 μg of total RNA from each sample using the Qiagen Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen), and a reverse chrR primer (5′-GACGATCTTCAGCGCAAGG-3′). Primers for quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR were designed (Beacon Designer software package; Premier Biosoft Intl.) to amplify a 118-bp internal chrR fragment (ChrR2F, 5′-TGAGCCAGGTGTATTCGGTAG-3′; ChrR120R, 5′-GACGATCTTCAGCGCAAGG-3′), and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was performed using an iCycler iQ real-time detection system (Bio-Rad) with the Qiagen QuantiTect Sybr® Green PCR kit. Reaction mixtures (final volume, 20 μl) contained 1× QuantiTect MasterMix, 6 pmol of each primer, 1 μl from the corresponding reverse transcription reaction, and DNase/RNase free water. Following hot start (95 °C for 15 min), 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s were performed. A data acquisition step (83 °C for 10 s) was used and set above the Tm of potential primer dimers to minimize any Sybr Green absorbance due to the latter. Melt curve analyses displayed a single peak at 87.5 °C, indicating specific chrR amplification. The chrR copy number in each sample was determined by comparing cycle thresholds to a standard curve of identical reaction mixtures run in parallel, using the PCR-generated full-length chrR gene (in the range of 103–108 copies) as the template.RESULTSKinetic Analysis of Quinone Reduction—Consistent with our proposal that quinone, rather than chromate, reduction may be the primary biological role of ChrR, we showed that this enzyme has a much greater affinity for a variety of quinone substrates (Table II), with a kcat/Km of 8.5 × 106, 1.9 × 106, 1.2 × 105, and 5.3 × 104m–1 s–1 for benzoquinone, menadione, duroquinone, and coenzyme Q1 respectively, compared with 2.2 × 104m–1 s–1 for chromate. The decrease in activity observed with these quinones correlates with their decreasing solubility in water.Table IIKinetics of quinone reduction of ChrRSubstrateVmaxbDetermined at optimal T and optimal pH for each substrate.KmbDetermined at optimal T and optimal pH for each substrate.kcatcBased on a dimeric enzyme molecular mass of 50 kDa (3).kcat/KmOptimal TdChrR tolerated a broad range of temperatures, with V > 60% Vmax from 20 to 70 °C for all substrates.Optimal pHeChrR was also very pH tolerant; V > 70% Vmax from pH 5.8 to 8.9 for all quinone substrates.μmol·min-1·mg-1μms-1m-1·s-1°CBenzoquinone1,4001109308.5 × 106707.5Menadione6602304401.9 × 106608.0Duroquinone37210251.2 × 105708.0CoQ19.61206.45.3 × 104608.5ChromateaAs reported in Ref. 3.8.82605.82.2 × 104705.0a As reported in Ref. 3Ackerley D.F.

Open table in a new tab Steady state kinetic analyses using menadione as an electron acceptor at various fixed concentrations of NADH (50, 100, or 250 μm) gave parallel lines in double reciprocal plots (not shown). This indicates that ChrR reduces quinones with bi-bi ping-pong (double-displacement) kinetics in two distinct steps: first, a complete reduction of ChrR flavin mononucleotide by NADH, and second, transfer of these two electrons from flavin mononucleotide to the quinone substrate.Mode of Quinone Reduction—Flavoenzymes can reduce quinones by single-electron, mixed single- and two-electron, and exclusive two-electron transfers (19Cenas N. Anusevicius Z. Nivinskas H. Miseviciene L. Sarlauskas J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 258-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The former two mechanisms generate semiquinone intermediates, which in turn are highly prone to generate superoxide radicals (20Lind C. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ChrR reduces quinones is therefore of interest, as simultaneous two-electron transfer from the subunit flavin mononucleotide cofactor might suggest a protective role for the enzyme in guarding against formation of reactive semiquinone intermediates. We tested the mechanism of quinone reduction using benzoquinone as a substrate in the presence of a cytochrome c trap, because cytochrome c is readily reduced both by benzosemiquinone and the superoxide it can generate but not by the fully reduced benzoquinol (21Ohnishi T. Yamazaki H. Iyanagi T. Nakamura T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that no cytochrome c was reduced during ChrR-catalyzed reduction of benzoquinone (Fig. 1A), indicating a simultaneous two-electron transfer that avoids formation of a benzosemiquinone intermediate. In contrast, several other bacterial flavoenzymes perform a one-electron reduction of quinones, including LpDH (22Argyrou A. Sun G. Palfey B.A. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During LpDH-catalyzed reduction of benzoquinone, high levels of cytochrome c reduction were observed (Fig. 1A). LpDH also oxidized 30% more NADH than ChrR, indicating a drain of electrons via cytochrome c reduction (Fig. 1A, inset).The above result suggested that ChrR might be able to guard against semiquinone formation by diverting oxidized quinones away from the one-electron reducers. To test this, we added equivalent enzyme units of ChrR to a LpDH-catalyzed reduction of limiting benzoquinone in the presence of cytochrome c and found that cytochrome c reduction was swiftly halted (Fig. 1B, arrow 1). Addition of further oxidized benzoquinone to the reaction mix re-initiated cytochrome c reduction, but this was likewise soon halted (Fig. 1B, arrows 2 and 3), and the overall levels of semiquinone formation/benzoquinone reduced were only ∼20% of those observed with LpDH alone. This observation provides in vitro support for the hypothesis that two-electron reduction by ChrR makes quinones unavailable for one-electron-reducing enzymes, and thereby minimizes formation of reactive semiquinones.ChrR Confers Resistance to H2O2—NQO1 also reduces quinones divalently, and by doing so, protects against oxidative stress in two ways. The first is by guarding against semiquinone formation, and the second is by generating reduced quinols that can quench reactive oxygen species (14Ross D. Siegel D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that ChrR may play a similar role in P. putida in antioxidant defense, we examined the relative ability of chrR+-overexpressing, wild type, and chrR mutant cells to grow in the presence of exogenous H2O2. The different cell cultures exhibited lag phases of varying duration, following which normal sigmoidal growth curves were observed (Fig. 2). The chrR+ strain was always the first to recover, followed by the wild type, and finally the chrR mutant; in triplicate experiments using 3 mm H2O2, the chrR+ strain recovered after 5.7 ± 0.6 h, the wild type after 8.7 ± 1.5 h, and the chrR mutant after 12.3 ± 2 h. The recovery time correlated with the ability of each strain to remove H2O2 from the growth medium, with the lag phase ending ∼2 h after the extracellular H2O2 concentration had dropped below 5 μm (Fig. 2).Fig. 2H2O2-scavenging (open symbols) and growth (as measured by A660, solid symbols) of chrR+ (♦), wild type (▪), and chrR mutant (▴) cultures inoculated to initial A660 0.1 in LB amended with 3 mm H2O2. This experiment was repeated in triplicate, with consistent results. The figure presents representative data from one of the replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cultures of chrR+-overexpressing, wild type, and chrR mutant cells that were grown in parallel but challenged with paraquat or CuSO4 instead of H2O2 showed only small variations from one another in their growth kinetics (not shown). This suggests that the two-electron-reduced quinols formed by ChrR are not directly protective against one-electron oxidizers, presumably because quenching of one-electron-oxidized species would in turn generate reactive semiquinones.ChrR Minimizes Intracellular H2O2 Stress—To examine levels of intracellular stress when the chrR+, wild type, and chrR mutant strains were challenged with H2O2, two separate methods were employed. The first of these was FACS cell counting, using the H2O2-activated green fluorescent dye dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). This dye has previously been used to measure H2O2 in eukaryotic cells; we found it effective for FACS in bacteria as well. Mid-exponential phase cells were grown for 1 h in H2O2-amended or control medium, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 15 min in LB containing H2DCFDA, and then the fluorescence levels of 50,000 cells were counted for each strain under each condition. A gate (M2) was established that delineated the upper 5% of fluorescent cells for the unstressed wild type (Fig. 3B). Although there was no significant difference between the three strains in the absence of exogenous stress (Fig. 3, A–C, G), in the presence of H2O2, the percentage of gated cells for the chrR mutant was 46 ± 5.2, the wild type strain was 35 ± 3.6, and the chrR+ strain was 24 ± 3.5 (Fig. 3, D–G).Fig. 3A–F, representative histograms plotting the fluorescence of 50,000 cells treated with 20 μm H2DCFDA. The lower boundary of the M1 gate defines the cut-off for an event to be registered as cellular fluorescence, whereas the M2 gate was established to measure population shifts and delineates approximately the upper 5% fluorescence boundary of unstressed wild type cells. A, unchallenged chrR mutant, M2 = (5.7 ± 0.6)%. B, unchallenged wild type, M2 = (5.3 ± 0.8)%. C, unchallenged chrR+, M2 = (5.1 ± 0.2)%. D, H O (1 mm for 1 h)-challenged chrR mutant, M2 = (46 ± 5.2)%. E, H2O2-challenged wild type, M2 = (35 ± 3.6)%. F, H2O2-challenged chrR+, M2 = (24 ± 3.5)%. G, bar graph summarizing the percentage of cells within the M2 gate for each strain under each condition. FACS data were collected in triplicate. Error bars are mean ± S.E. of 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The above data indicated that levels of intracellular H2O2 stress were inversely correlated with chrR expression. If so, this should be reflected by the protein carbonylation levels in each strain. Carbonyl groups are introduced into protein side chains by site-specific oxidative modifications, and although this is not the sole mechanism of protein carbonyl formation in vivo, carbonyl quantification is believed to provide an accurate estimate of the oxidation status of proteins (18Levine R.L.

The gene expression profiles of unstimulated and HA12- or FGF-2-stimulated endothelial cells were compared using a microarray analysis approach.

Among the genes selectively up-regulated in response to HA12 was the chemokine CXCL1/GRO1 gene. The notion that the induction of CXCL1/GRO1 is of importance for HA12-induced endothelial cell sprouting was supported by the fact that morphogenesis was inhibited by antibodies specifically neutralizing the CXCL1/GRO1 protein product. HA12-stimulated endothelial cell differentiation was exerted via binding to CD44 since it was inhibited by antibodies blocking CD44 function.

It has been suggested before that some of these organic acids may induce excitotoxic cell damage, however, the relevance of bioenergetic impairment is not yet understood. The major aim of our study was to investigate respiratory chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation in this disease using purified single enzymes and tissue homogenates from Gcdh-deficient and wild-type mice. In purified enzymes, glutaryl-CoA but not glutaric or 3-hydroxyglutaric induced an uncompetitive inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activity. Notably, reduced activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity has recently been demonstrated in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. In contrast to α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, no direct inhibition of glutaryl-CoA, glutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid was found in other enzymes tested. In Gcdh-deficient mice, respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid activities remained widely unaffected, virtually excluding regulatory changes in these enzymes. However, hepatic activity of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was decreased and concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitines increased in the bile of these mice, which suggested disturbed oxidation of long-chain fatty acids.

However, some studies of cultured primary neurons were unable to confirm a role for glutamate receptor activation (22Bjugstad K.B. Zawada W.M. Goodman S. Freed C.R. J. Inherit. Metab.

The major aim of the present study was to comprehensively investigate whether the metabolites that accumulate in GCDH deficiency affect mitochondrial energy metabolism, including the respiratory chain, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and β-oxidation of fatty acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Tissue Extracts—The Gcdh–/– mice used for these experiments were generated via gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells, and have been previously described (27Koeller D.M.

E3 activity was determined as NADH oxidation at λ = 340–400 nm.Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDHc)—PDHc activity (EC 1.2.4.1) was investigated according to a recently described method (35Schwab M.A. Kolker S. van den Heuvel L.P. Sauer S. Wolf N.I. Rating D. Hoffmann G.F. Smeitink J.A. Okun J.G. Clin. Chem. 2005; 51: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

These assay conditions were also used for the analysis of bovine heart SMPs.Glutathione Content of Tissue Homogenates—Glutathione concentrations were determined according to a modification of Ref. 36Okun J.G. Sauer S. Bahr S. Lenhartz H. Mayatepek E.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2004; 27: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. Glutathione reductase (EC 1.8.1.7) activity in liver and brain homogenates was assayed in a buffer (adjusted to pH 7.5; 25 °C) containing 180 mmol/liter of disodium hydrogen phosphate, 6 mmol/liter of Na-EDTA, 0.3 mmol/liter of NADPH, 6 mmol/liter of DTNB, and 0.3 units/ml of glutathione reductase (Sigma). Enzyme activity was determined as DTNB reduction at λ = 412 nm. Glutathione content was determined by correlating the detected enzyme activities with a calibration curve generated with samples of defined glutathione concentration.Spectrophotometric Analysis of FAD-dependent Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenases—FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, such as short-chain (SCAD, EC 1.3.99.2), medium-chain (MCAD, EC 1.3.99.3), very long-chain (VLCAD, EC 1.3.99.13), and GCDH (EC 1.3.99.7), were assayed at a concentration of 1 mg of protein/ml in a buffer (adjusted to pH 7.5; 37 °C) containing 250 mmol/liter of sucrose, 120 mmol/liter of potassium phosphate, 5 mmol/liter of MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) laurylmaltoside, 0.2 mmol/liter of ferricenium hexafluorophosphate, 0.01 mmol/liter of FAD, and 0.5 mmol/liter of N-ethylmaleimide.

Butyryl-CoA (50 μmol/liter; for SCAD activity), octanoyl-CoA (50 μmol/liter; for MCAD activity), and palmitoyl-CoA (50 μmol/liter; for VLCAD activity) were used as physiological substrates. Changes in the activity of these enzymes were determined by comparison of liver homogenates from Gcdh–/– and wt mice. In further experiments, the effects of GA, 3-OH-GA, and glutaryl-CoA (up to 1 mmol/liter; adjusted to pH 7.5) on SCAD, MCAD, and VLCAD activities were investigated.Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.D.

No significant differences in the activity of the five multiprotein complexes were found between Gcdh–/– and wt mice, except for a slight increase of complex II activity in liver homogenates of Gcdh–/– mice (p = 0.004 versus wt; Table I).Table ISpectrophotometric analysis of single respiratory chain complexes I–V in tissue homogenates from Gcdh–/–and wild type (wt) miceTissueGenotypeComplex IComplex IIComplex IIIComplex IVComplex VBrainGcdh-/-6.6 ± 2.04.9 ± 1.121.8 ± 6.292.4 ± 28.127.7 ± 11.8wt6.6. ± 2.44.2 ± 1.418.4 ± 7.190.3 ± 29.335.7 ± 16.6LiverGcdh-/-1.6 ± 0.78.5 ± 3.6ap < 0.05.17.7 ± 6.030.5 ± 12.118.6 ± 7.2wt1.0 ± 0.54.2 ± 3.516.8 ± 8.323.2 ± 11.711.8 ± 6.3Skeletal muscleGcdh-/-1.2 ± 0.91.9 ± 0.95.3 ± 3.310.6 ± 8.424.5 ± 11.0wt2.1 ± 1.42.2 ± 1.05.6 ± 2.611.1 ± 7.829.1 ± 13.4Heart muscleGcdh-/-11.3 ± 3.819.2 ± 7.139.0 ± 19.2127.3 ± 47.062.5 ± 22.9wt9.4 ± 2.519.5 ± 8.044.9 ± 19.5119.0 ± 50.462.0 ± 25.3a p < 0.05.

In accordance with the results obtained in tissue homogenates, no direct inhibitory effect of GA, 3-OH-GA, or glutaryl-CoA (up to a final concentration of 1 mmol/liter each) on single respiratory chain complexes I–V was found in SMPs (Table II). In both homogenates and SMPs, addition of standard respiratory chain inhibitors revealed good inhibitory responses (93–100% of control activity, p < 0.001 versus controls), confirming the specificity of our results.Table IISpectrophotometric analysis of single respiratory chain complexes I-V in SMPs from bovine heart after incubation with glutaric acid, 3-hydoxyglutaric acid, or glutaryl-CoAComplex IComplex IIComplex IIIComplex IVComplex VControl23.0 ± 1.915.5 ± 0.266.2 ± 9.51327 ± 11877.2 ± 1.1Glutaryl-CoA (1 mmol/liter)25.0 ± 0.414.5 ± 0.257.1 ± 28.71436 ± 13172.4 ± 1.6GA (1 mmol/liter)22.0 ± 1.815.3 ± 0.564.6 ± 2.81269 ± 6272.7 ± 2.83-OH-GA (1 mmol/liter)21.4 ± 0.616.0 ± 0.365.9 ± 8.61307 ± 6872.4 ± 1.3Standard inhibitoraComplex I: 2-n-decylquinazolin-4-yl-amine (1 μmol/liter); complex II: malonate (1 mmol/liter); complex III: stigmatellin (2 μmol/liter); complex IV: NaCN (2 mmol/liter); complex V: oligomycin (80 μmol/liter).1.9 ± 0.8bp < 0.05.0.7 ± 0.0bp < 0.05.2.0 ± 0.0bp < 0.05.14.7 ± 5.7bp < 0.05.4.3 ± 2.1bp < 0.05.a Complex I: 2-n-decylquinazolin-4-yl-amine (1 μmol/liter); complex II: malonate (1 mmol/liter); complex III: stigmatellin (2 μmol/liter); complex IV: NaCN (2 mmol/liter); complex V: oligomycin (80 μmol/liter).b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Glutaryl-CoA Inhibits α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex—Next, we investigated the activity of purified single TCA cycle enzymes from porcine heart during incubation with GA, 3-OH-GA, or glutaryl-CoA. Notably, glutaryl-CoA inhibited KGDHc in a concentration-dependent way (Fig. 1A). Varying the concentrations of α-ketoglutarate and glutaryl-CoA demonstrated that inhibition of KGDHc by glutaryl-CoA was uncompetitive to α-ketoglutarate (Vmax, 54.7 mOD/min; Km, 0.15 mmol/liter; Kis, 0.35 mmol/liter; Fig. 1A). Glutaryl-CoA (1 mmol/liter) was degraded in the reverse reaction of the KGDHc subunit E2k (50% of activity with succinyl-CoA as substrate) indicating that glutaryl-CoA is a product of this subunit, whereas it showed no influence on the E1k (126% of control activity) and the E3 (106% of control activity) subunits. Inhibition of KGDHc by glutaryl-CoA was also found using 2-ketoadipate as an alternative substrate (data not shown). The specificity of our finding was confirmed by additional experiments in SMPs, demonstrating the same results (data not shown). In comparison with KGDHc, glutaryl-CoA induced a less pronounced inhibition of PDHc (Fig. 1B).Next, we investigated additional enzymes of the TCA cycle. Glutaryl-CoA showed no significant effect on MDH, fumarase, aconitase, and IDH, and revealed only a weak inhibition of CS (Fig. 2). The apparent inhibition of MDH and fumarase was most likely an artifact because of the coupling of the malate dehydrogenase and fumarase assays with citrate synthase, which was weakly inhibited by glutaryl-CoA. Neither GA nor 3-OH-GA showed a significant effect on KGDHc (GA 1 mmol/liter, 96% of control; 3-OH-GA 1 mmol/liter, 98% of control), PDHc (GA 1 mmol/liter, 95% of control; 3-OH-GA 1 mmol/liter, 90% of control) aconitase, IDH, fumarase, or MDH, but both slightly activated CS (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, and glutaryl-CoA on TCA cycle enzymes. Activities of CS, malate dehydrogenase (MD), fumarase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ISD) were assayed in the presence or absence of GA, 3-OH-GA, and glutaryl-CoA (each 1 mmol/liter). CS was slightly activated by GA (129% of control) and 3-OH-GA (123% of control), whereas MDH, fumarase, aconitase, and ISD activities remained unaffected. Glutaryl-CoA slightly decreased activities of CS, MDH, and fumarase. The apparent inhibition of MDH and fumarase is most likely an artifact because of the coupling of the MDH and fumarase assays with CS.

https://openalex.org/W1988477597,"The Pkh1 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a homolog of the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), regulates downstream AGC-type protein kinases including Ypk1/2 and Pkc1, which control cell wall integrity, growth, and other processes. Phytosphingosine (PHS), a sphingoid long chain base, is hypothesized to be a lipid activator of Pkh1 and thereby controls the activity of Ypk1/2. Here we present biochemical evidence supporting this hypothesis, and in addition we demonstrate that PHS also stimulates autophosphorylation and activation of Ypk1/2. Greatest stimulation of Ypk1/2 phosphorylation and activity are achieved by inclusion of both PHS and Pkh1 in an in vitro kinase reaction. We also demonstrate for the first time that Pkh1 phosphorylates the Sch9 protein kinase in vitro and that such phosphorylation is stimulated by PHS. This is the first biochemical demonstration of Sch9 activators, and the results further support roles for long chain bases in heat stress resistance in addition to implying roles in chronological aging and cell size determination, since Sch9 functions in these processes. Thus, our data support a model in which PHS, rather than simply being an upstream activator of Pkh1, also activates kinases that are downstream targets of Pkh1 including Ypk1/2 and Sch9.

Sphingolipids play many vital roles in eucaryotic cells where they are structural components of membranes, act as regulators of signal transduction pathways, and associate with sterols to form lipid rafts (1Ohanian J. Ohanian V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 2053-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Sphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide are the best characterized sphingolipid signaling molecules, with sphingosine 1-phosphate promoting growth and preventing apoptosis and ceramide performing an opposing role by promoting apoptosis (3Spiegel S.

In contrast to the large body of knowledge for ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate, the long chain base (LCB) 1The abbreviations used are: LCB, long chain base; AGC, protein kinases A, G, and C; PHS, phytosphingosine; DHS, dihydrosphingosine; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase; KD, kinase dead; PH, pleckstrin homology; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and glucose. sphingosine, derived from breakdown of ceramide and then used to make sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a poorly characterized signaling molecule in mammals (5Cuvillier O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The opposite situation exists in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where very little is known about the signaling functions of ceramide and long chain base phosphates, but signaling functions for the long chain bases phytosphingosine (PHS) and dihydrosphingosine (DHS), the homologs of sphingosine, are being revealed. Here we present evidence that PHS is a signaling molecule that activates the protein kinase Pkh1, a homolog of the mammalian 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1), which then activates downstream protein kinases including Ypk1, Ypk2, and Sch9. Many different growth and survival factors activate PDK1 in mammals so that it phosphorylates and activates downstream protein kinases, several of which are members of the protein kinase A, protein kinase G, and protein kinase C (AGC) kinase family that controls multiple cellular processes (6Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Homologs of PDK1 are widespread in nature, including two in S. cerevisiae, Pkh1 and Pkh2 (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Deletion of either PKH1 or PKH2 has little or no effect on cell growth, but deletion of both is lethal, indicating that they perform one or more essential functions. Pkh1 and Pkh2 share about 50% amino acid identity and about 70% amino acid similarity with human PDK1. In addition, a human PDK1 cDNA complements the growth defect of a yeast pkh1Δ pkh2Δ double deletion mutant, demonstrating functional similarity of the human and yeast PDKs (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The best characterized downstream substrate of Pkh1 and Pkh2 is the protein kinase Pkc1 (8Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8344-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which regulates a mitogen-activated protein kinase module that controls cell wall integrity (9Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J.

In addition to Pkc1, S. cerevisiae contains three other AGC kinase family members, Ypk1, Ypk2/Ykr2, and Sch9, that have been suggested to be substrates of Pkh1/2 based on the similarity of the amino acid sequence of their activation loop, including the threonine (termed the PDK1 site) phosphorylated in Pkc1 by Pkh1/2 (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ypk1 was first shown both in vitro and in vivo to be a substrate for Pkh1 (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Some data support the idea that Pkh1 preferentially phosphorylates Ypk1, whereas Pkh2 phosphorylates Ypk2 (12Roelants F.M. Torrance P.D. Bezman N. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3005-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Ypk1 and its paralog, Ypk2, perform one or more functions necessary for growth, possibly a function in cell wall integrity (12Roelants F.M. Torrance P.D. Bezman N. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3005-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Schmelzle T. Helliwell S.B. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Human serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK) is a functional homolog of Ypk1 (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr.

Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) noted that 3-phosphoinositides, which are the upstream signal for activating mammalian PDK1, did not stimulate the activity of Pkh1, probably because it lacks a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, such as is found in PDK1 and Akt/protein kinase B. Thus, the activating signal for Pkh1/2 has remained unknown. The first clue about the nature of the activating signal came from an analysis of multicopy suppressor genes that enabled yeast cells to grow in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of myriocin (14Sun Y. Taniguchi R. Tanoue D. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Mori K. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), an antibiotic that inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway (15Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). YPK1 was identified as such a suppressor gene, and indirect evidence suggested that its phosphorylation was stimulated by a sphingolipid, possibly by PHS. Because Pkh1 was known to phosphorylate Ypk1 and since 3-phosphoinositides did not stimulate phosphorylation (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), Sun et al. (14Sun Y. Taniguchi R. Tanoue D. Yamaji T. Takematsu H. Mori K. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggested that yeast use sphingolipids instead of phosphoinositides as activating lipids. The first clue that LCBs were the activating sphingolipid came from studies of a temperature-sensitive strain (lcb1-100) having a block in endocytosis at 37 °C (16Friant S. Lombardi R. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). LCB1 encodes a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase and at the restrictive temperature an lcb1-100 strain stops making sphingolipids (17Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and instead of producing a transient increase in LCBs, as occurs in wild type cells during heat shock (18Dickson R.C.

Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The endocytosis defect was found to be suppressed by multiple copies of PKC1, YCK2, PKH1, or PKH2 (16Friant S. Lombardi R. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Friant S. Zanolari B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2834-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22deHart A.K. Schnell J.D. Allen D.A. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How multiple copies of these genes restore endocytosis is unclear, but the data suggested that the activity of these kinases was stimulated by some sphingolipid, and it was found using immunoprecipitated HA-tagged proteins that LCBs gave a 2–3-fold stimulation in Pkc1 phosphorylation by Pkh1 or Pkh2 (16Friant S. Lombardi R. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the signaling pathways and cellular processes regulated by LCBs we set out using purified proteins to directly demonstrate that LCBs stimulate phosphorylation and activation of Ypk1, Ypk2, and Sch9 by Pkh1. In addition to showing that LCBs stimulate Pkh1 activity, we also found that LCBs stimulate autophosphorylation and activation of Ypk1, Ypk2, and Sch9. These results show that rather than acting solely as an upstream activator of signaling pathways regulated by Pkh1, LCBs also act downstream to activate kinase substrates of Pkh1. Our data are the first biochemical demonstration of upstream regulators of Sch9, an important protein kinase, related to mammalian Akt/protein kinase B, that plays poorly defined roles in heat stress resistance (23Morano K.A.

Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or complete synthetic medium containing 0.34% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 1% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 400 mg/liter serine, 200 mg/liter threonine, 150 mg/liter valine, 30 mg/liter aspartic acid and glutamic acid, 50 mg/liter phenylalanine, 30 mg/liter adenine, isoleucine, and tyrosine, and 20 mg/liter each of arginine, histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, uracil, and tryptophan. Synthetic medium lacking uracil (SD-Ura) was used to select cells transformed with a plasmid carrying URA3. Solid media contained 2% agar. Six histidine residues were added to the N terminus of proteins (Pkh1, Pkh1-KD, Pkh2, Pkh2-KD, Ypk1, Ypk1-KD, Ypk2, Ypk2-KD, Sch9 and Sch9-KD) by cloning genes into pYES2/NTA (Invitrogen) so that gene expression was driven by the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. His6-tagged proteins were expressed in yeast strains RCD224 (MATa leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 trp1 his4 rme1), BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), or BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0).

Mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The wild type and an Sch9 (K441R) kinase dead mutant were expressed as N-terminal epitope-tagged proteins using a 3HA-SCH9 allele carried on a plasmid (p426-HA3-SCH9) (23Morano K.A. Thiele D.J.

Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—Yeast cells transformed with a multicopy vector expressing the desired gene under control of the GAL1 promoter were grown overnight at 30 °C to an A600 nm of 0.4 in 1 liter of S-Ura medium containing 2% sucrose and 0.1% glucose. Protein overproduction was induced by adding galactose to 2% and incubating the culture for 8–10 h. A cell-free protein extract was prepared as described previously (8Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8344-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 0.8 × 4-cm Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) containing 1 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The flow-thru was collected and passed through the column again followed by 5 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol. His6-tagged proteins were eluted with 3 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol) except His6-Pkh2, which was eluted with 3 ml of a slightly different buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole). Six 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (32Zhang X. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22030-22038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three fractions with the highest level of tagged protein were pooled, separated into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. His6- and 3HA-tagged proteins were also purified by immunoprecipitation from cell-free yeast extracts as described previously (16Friant S. Lombardi R. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—An appropriate amount of kinase and substrate, determined in preliminary experiments, were combined in 18 μl of phosphorylation buffer and warmed to 30 °C before starting the reaction by adding 2 μl of ATP solution (1 mm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The final component concentrations were 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate and 100 μm ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimage analysis to quantify phosphorylation of substrate. Two-step Ypk1/Ypk2 Kinase Activity Assay—Affinity-purified His6-Ypk1 or His6-Ypk2 (1 μg) were activated by incubation with His6-Pkh1 (50 ng) and 50 μm PHS (stock prepared in 95% EtOH and diluted to a final concentration of 1%) in 200 μl of kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm magnesium acetate) plus 100 μm ATP at 30 °C. After 30 min the reactions were chilled on ice, and 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) plus 2 μg of anti-His antibody (Amersham, #27-4710-0) and 10 μl of 50% protein A beads were added to each tube. Tubes were rotated at 4 °C overnight, and the immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation buffer and 2 times with kinase assay buffer before suspension in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer. The kinase activity of Ypk1 or Ypk2 was assayed by adding 30 μl of a kinase buffer with 2.5 μm PKI-tide (Alexis Biochemicals, CA), 1 μm microcystin-LR (Alexis Biochemicals), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4μCi), and 100 μm Cross-tide (GRPRTSSFAEG, BIOSOURCE Int.) as substrate (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 20 s at top speed in a microcentrifuge, and 20 μl of supernatant fluid was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (2.5 cm circles, Whatman P81) which was processed as described previously (33Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The pellets were treated with Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE to analyze the amount of Ypk1 or Ypk2 in each reaction. No effort was made to separate Ypk1 and Pkh1 because control reactions showed that Pkh1 did not phosphorylate Cross-tide. One unit of kinase activity is defined as the amount of protein required to catalyze phosphorylation of 1 nmol of Cross-tide/min. Two-step Sch9 Kinase Activity Assay—3HA-Sch9 was isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Anti-Rat, Roche Applied Science) and IgG-Sepharose beads (Sigma). In the first step of the reaction, immunoprecipitated 3HA-Sch9 (50 ng) was incubated at 30 °C with 2.5 ng of His6-Pkh1 or His6-Pkh2 in a 20-μl reaction containing or lacking 50 μm PHS (stock prepared in 95% EtOH and diluted to a final concentration of 1%) and kinase assay buffer (final concentrations were 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm magnesium acetate). After 30 min the reactions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were resuspended in 500 μl of kinase buffer followed by centrifugation. This washing procedure was repeated a total of three times. In the second step of the reaction, the resuspended beads were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction containing 1.5 μg of Lsp1 (the molar ratio of Sch9:Lsp1 was 1:100), 50 μm PHS, or 1% ethanol (final concentration), and ATP (4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimage analysis to quantify the phosphorylation of Lsp1. Miscellaneous Assays—To quantify purified His6-tagged yeast proteins, serial dilutions were resolved on SDS-PAGE along with dilutions of a BSA standard (Bio-Rad). A scanned image of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel was analyzed, and the protein quantities of specific bands were determined by using ImageQuant software. LCBs Stimulate Phosphorylation of Ypk1 and Ypk2—Available published data imply that phosphorylation of Ypk1 and Ypk2 by Pkh1 and Pkh2 is stimulated by LCBs. However, there has been no direct biochemical demonstration of this hypothesis. To determine whether LCBs stimulate Pkh1 and phosphorylate the downstream kinases Ypk1 and Ypk2, we performed in vitro kinase assays using His6-tagged, partially purified protein kinases. We focus primarily on Pkh1, since it has functional overlap with Pkh2 and appears to be more important (12Roelants F.M. Torrance P.D. Bezman N. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3005-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We found that phosphorylation of Ypk1 increased linearly for about 40 min when both PHS and Pkh1 were included in the kinase reaction (Fig. 1A). Less phosphorylation was observed when either PHS or Pkh1 were omitted from the reaction, and the lowest level of phosphorylation was observed when only Ypk1 was present in the reaction. To prove that phosphorylation of Ypk1 was due to Pkh1 and not to a contaminating protein kinase, a Pkh1 kinase dead variant (KD, K154R) was examined and found to give about the same level of phosphorylation as in a kinase reaction lacking Pkh1 but containing Ypk1 and PHS (Fig. 1, compare panels A and B). Weak phosphorylation in the Ypk1-only reaction is either due to autophosphorylation or to a contaminating kinase (Fig. 1A), since it was also seen when Ypk1 was incubated with a Pkh1 kinase dead variant (Fig. 1B). We conclude from these results that PHS produces a 5–8-fold stimulation of Ypk1 phosphorylation by Pkh1. In addition, PHS produces an approximate 2-fold stimulation of Ypk1 autophosphorylation either in the absence of wild type Pkh1 (Fig. 1A) or in the presence of the kinase dead mutant (Fig. 1B). Qualitatively similar results were observed when Ypk2 was used as a substrate for Pkh1 (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of Ypk2 was barely stimulated by Pkh1 but was stimulated about 2-fold when PHS was added to the reaction. Adding both PHS and Pkh1 to the reaction gave a further 2-fold stimulation in phosphorylation for a combined 4-fold stimulation. To prove that Pkh1 and not a contaminating protein kinase was phosphorylated Ypk2, a Pkh1 kinase dead variant (KD, K208R) was compared with the wild type enzyme. The reaction containing the kinase dead variant did show some phosphorylation of Ypk2 that was stimulated 2-fold by PHS (Fig. 1D). Weak phosphorylation in the Ypk2 reaction is either due to autophosphorylation or to a contaminating kinase, which seems to be slightly stimulated by PHS. Panels E and F in Fig. 1 show representative phosphorimages of the 32P-labeled Ypk1 and Ypk2 proteins produced in kinase reactions. Reactions containing PHS or Pkh1 show two Ypk1 bands of about equal concentration. In reactions containing both PHS and Pkh1 there is an increase in the amount of the upper Ypk1 band, indicating that this species of Ypk1 protein is more phosphorylated than is the lower, faster migrating species. Ypk2 appears as a broader more diffuse band that becomes more phosphorylated in the reaction containing both PHS and Ypk2. The data shown in panels A–D (Fig. 1) represent values for the lower plus the upper band of Ypk1 and the broad band of Ypk2. Pkh1-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1 was examined in more detail by varying the concentration and type of LCB added to the kinase reaction. PHS at 50 μm stimulated phosphorylation of Ypk1 slightly better than 10 μm, although 100 μm barely stimulated (Fig. 2A). DHS, lacking the 4-OH group found on PHS, was tested as the biological erythro isomer and the non-biological threo isomer. Surprisingly, the threo isomer stimulated Ypk1 phosphorylation better than the erythro isomer (Fig. 2, compare panels B and C), suggesting that DHS may not be as significant as PHS in activating Ypk1 phosphorylation in vivo. The phosphorylated version of DHS, DHS-1-P, showed no stimulation of phosphorylation and neither did the acylated version of sphingosine, C6-ceramide (Fig. 2, D and E), indicating that the free amino and C1-OH groups on PHS are important for kinase stimulation. Stearylamine, a long chain amine, stimulated phosphorylation, but unlike the LCBs, there was no inhibition of phosphorylation at the highest concentration used. This difference suggests that stearylamine and LCBs work in different ways to stimulate phosphorylation. Finally, sphingosine, the LCB found in mammalian but not fungal sphingolipids, was the best stimulator of Ypk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2G), giving almost twice the stimulation as 50 μm PHS. LCBs and Pkh1 Activate Ypk1 and Ypk2 in Vitro—We next examined what effects LCBs and Pkh1 have on Ypk1 kinase activity by using the artificial substrate, Cross-tide, used previously to assay activation of Ypk1 by Pkh1 and Pkh2 (7Casamayor A.

Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3289-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The activation assay was done is two steps. In step one, Ypk1 or Ypk2 was incubated with or without Pkh1 or PHS in the presence of ATP so that Ypk1 or Ypk2 could be activated by phosphorylation. In the second step, Ypk1 or Ypk2 was immunoprecipitated, and the precipitate was used in a kinase assay to quantify the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to Cross-tide. Ypk1 was activated 4-fold by either PHS or Pkh1, and inclusion of both in the reaction produced an 8-fold, additive increase in Ypk1 activity (Fig. 3). Activation by Pkh1 required its kinase activity, since the K154R kinase dead variant did not activate Ypk1. It should be noted that Pkh1 was also immunoprecipitated, but control reactions showed that it did not phosphorylate Cross-tide. Ypk2 was activated 2–3-fold by PHS but was not activated by Pkh1 alone. However, when both PHS and Pkh1 were added to the reaction, Ypk1 was activated about 4-fold (Fig. 3). Like Ypk1, activation of Ypk2 required Pkh1 kinase activity, since the K154R kinase dead variant did not activate Ypk2. LCBs, Pkh1, and Pkh2 Stimulate Phosphorylation of Sch9—Based upon the sequence similarity of the PDK1 and PDK2 sites in Ypk1 and Ypk2 to the corresponding regions in Sch9, it was suggested that Sch9 is activated by Pkh1 and Pkh2 (7Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has never been tested directly. Because phosphorylation of Ypk1, Ypk2, and Pkc1 by Pkh1 and Pkh2 has been demonstrated to be stimulated by PHS, we also wanted to see if phosphorylation of Sch9 is directly stimulated by PHS or indirectly via stimulation of Pkh1 or Pkh2. To determine whether Sch9 is a substrate of Pkh1 and Pkh2 and if phosphorylation is stimulated by LCBs, we performed in vitro"

These mutations (R702C and N93K in human NMHC II-A, R709C in murine NMHC II-B, and R726S in human NMHC II-C) result in phenotypes affecting kidneys, platelets, and leukocytes (II-A), heart and brain (II-B), and the inner ear (II-C). To better understand the mechanisms underlying these defects, we characterized the in vitro activity of mutated and wild-type baculovirus-expressed heavy meromyosin (HMM) II-B and II-C. We also expressed two alternatively spliced isoforms of NMHC II-C which differ by inclusion/exclusion of eight amino acids in loop 1, with and without mutations. Comparison of the actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility shows that mutation of residues Asn-97 and Arg-709 in HMM II-B and the homologous residue Arg-722 (Arg-730 in the alternatively spliced isoform) in HMM II-C decreases both parameters but affects in vitro motility more severely. Analysis of the transient kinetics of the HMM II-B R709C mutant shows an extremely tight affinity of HMM for ADP and a very slow release of ADP from acto-HMM. Although mutations generally decreased HMM activity, the R730S mutation in HMM II-C, unlike the R730C mutation, had no effect on actin-activated MgATPase activity but decreased the rate of in vitro motility by 75% compared with wild type. Insertion of eight amino acids into the HMM II-C heavy chain increases both actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility.

Comparison of the actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility shows that mutation of residues Asn-97 and Arg-709 in HMM II-B and the homologous residue Arg-722 (Arg-730 in the alternatively spliced isoform) in HMM II-C decreases both parameters but affects in vitro motility more severely. Analysis of the transient kinetics of the HMM II-B R709C mutant shows an extremely tight affinity of HMM for ADP and a very slow release of ADP from acto-HMM. Although mutations generally decreased HMM activity, the R730S mutation in HMM II-C, unlike the R730C mutation, had no effect on actin-activated MgATPase activity but decreased the rate of in vitro motility by 75% compared with wild type. Insertion of eight amino acids into the HMM II-C heavy chain increases both actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility. Class II myosins are hexameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains that hydrolyze MgATP and interact with actin to produce movement. Mammalian nonmuscle myosins II play an important role in diverse types of movement, including cytokinesis, cell migration, and cell shape change (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed.

Information on the biological role of nonmuscle myosin II-C is presently limited due to its more recent identification. Nevertheless, the protein expression pattern in human and mouse tissues for NMHC II-C shows that this protein is absent during the earliest stages of development (7Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S.

NMHC II-C has two alternatively spliced isoforms, with the inserted isoform (NMHC II-C1) differing from the noninserted isoform (NMHC II-C0) by 8 amino acids (ASVSTMSY in mice) that are inserted into loop 1 in the globular head (7Golomb E.

The inserted NMHC II-C mRNA is highly expressed in adult murine liver, kidney, testes, brain, and lung, but heart and skeletal muscle contains only small amounts of the inserted message (7Golomb E.

To date there has been no biochemical characterization of the differences between the inserted and noninserted NMHC II-C isoforms. Single amino acid mutations have been reported in humans for NMHC II-A and II-C. The mutations in NMHC II-A are spread throughout the NMHC and result in defects in a variety of cells and organs including platelets, kidney, lens, and the inner ear (11Heath K.E. Campos-Barros A. Toren A. Rozenfeld-Granot G. Carlsson L.E. Savige J. Denison J.C. Gregory M.C. White J.G. Barker D.F. Greinacher A. Epstein C.J. Glucksman M.J. Martignetti J.A. Am. J. Hum.

The in vitro effects of a number of these mutations on the myosin enzymatic activity and assembly have been reported (12Franke J.D. Dong F. Rickoll W.L. Kelley M.J. Kiehart D.P.

Of particular interest are the mutations N93K and R702C in NMHC II-A, which have been expressed as heavy meromyosin fragments (HMM) using baculovirus and characterized with respect to their actin-activated MgATPase activity and their ability to translocate actin filaments (13Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, the R726S mutation in NMHC II-C at an amino acid homologous to the R702C mutation in NMHC II-A results in an autosomal dominant hearing loss in humans (14Donaudy F. Snoeckx R. Pfister M. Zenner H.P. Blin N. Di S.M. Ferrara A. Lanzara C. Ficarella R. Declau F. Pusch C.M. Nurnberg P. Melchionda S. Zelante L. Ballana E. Estivill X. Van C.G. Gasparini P. Savoia A. Am. J. Hum.

Our laboratory has generated mice with a mutation in NMHC II-B (R709C), which is homologous to the residue mutated in NMHC II-A (R702C). The NMHC II-B mutant mice develop major defects in the brain and heart during embryonic development (15Ma X. Kawamoto S. Hara Y. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X. Yu Z.X. Adelstein R.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study is to quantitate the kinetic parameters of the various mutated and alternatively spliced isoforms of nonmuscle myosin II-B and II-C and to compare the effects of these mutations among all three nonmuscle myosins. To accomplish this we expressed the relevant HMMs along with the 20- and 17-kDa myosin light chains using the baculovirus expression system. The kinetic properties of two different mutations in HMM II-B, N97K and R709C, were compared with wild-type HMM II-B as well as to the previously reported results for homologous mutations in HMM II-A (13Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also introduced mutations into NMHC II-C, but here we also address the effects of alternative splicing. First, we compared the actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility of the inserted and noninserted isoforms of murine HMM II-C. We then introduced the mutation R722C, which is homologous to R709C in NMHC II-B and R702C in NMHC II-A, into both the inserted (R730C) and noninserted (R722C) NMHC II-C isoforms. After we initiated this work, a report appeared describing humans with an autosomal dominant hearing loss who had a mutation in NMHC II-C at R726S (14Donaudy F. Snoeckx R. Pfister M. Zenner H.P. Blin N. Di S.M. Ferrara A. Lanzara C. Ficarella R. Declau F. Pusch C.M. Nurnberg P. Melchionda S. Zelante L. Ballana E. Estivill X. Van C.G. Gasparini P. Savoia A. Am. J. Hum.

This is homologous to Arg-722 (or Arg-730 in the inserted isoform) in mice, so we also expressed murine-inserted HMM II-C that had the R730S mutation. Construction of Baculovirus Expression Vectors—A recombinant HMM-like protein of human NMHC II-B and mouse NMHC II-C was expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system. Briefly, the cDNA (nucleotides 1–3135) for human NMHC II-B (GenBank™ accession number M69181, with a change in Cys-800 to Tyr, which is the more common amino acid used) and the cDNA (nucleotides 1–4071) for mouse NMHC II-C (GenBank™ accession number AY205605) were truncated at codon 1045 and at codon 1357, respectively, to create an HMM fragment. Nucleotides encoding a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop signal were appended to aid in purification. The HMM constructs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Site-directed Mutagenesis—We used a PCR-based mutagenesis technique to generate the mutant constructs of HMM II-B and II-C. For the N97K mutant HMM II-B, the nucleotides coding for Asn at codon 97 were mutated to nucleotides coding for Lys. The primers used were 5′-GCAGAATTGACATGCTTGAAGGAGGCTTCCGTTTTACATAATCTG-3′ and the complementary antisense primer. Similarly, for the R709C mutant HMM II-B, Arg-709 was mutated to Cys using the primer 5′-GTCCTGGAAGGGATCTGTATCTGTCGCCAGGGCTTCCCT-3′ and the complementary antisense primer. The mutated nucleotides responsible for conversion to different amino acids are shown in bold and underlined. The complete nucleotide sequence of the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate a clone of the 8-amino acid inserted isoform in NMHC II-C, we introduced the 24-nucleotide cassette encoding the insert into the TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) with the noninserted fragment (nucleotide 1–1227) by the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The clone with the insert together with the 3′ portion of HMM II-C was then subcloned into pFastBac1. Arg-722 in HMM II-C (or Arg-730 in the inserted HMM II-C) was mutated to Cys or Ser using the primer 5′-GGGGTCCTCGAAGGTATATGCATCTGTCGCCAAGGCTTC-3′ or 5′-GGGGTCCTCGAAGGTATAAGCATCTGTCGCCAAGGCTTC-3′, respectively. Preparation and Purification of HMM Proteins—The wild-type and mutant recombinant HMMs of NMHC II-B and the two isoforms of NMHC II-C were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system including the appropriate light chains (17Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and purified according to Wang et al. (18Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each virus was cotransfected along with a virus containing both light chains into 3 × 109 Sf9 cells. The infected cells were harvested by sedimentation after 72 h of growth and stored at –80 °C. Western blot analyses of the Sf9 cell pellets before extraction of the proteins demonstrated that significant amounts of the protein were expressed. The partially thawed pellet was extracted with 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.3) 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and proteinase inhibitor mixture after homogenization in a ground glass homogenizer and purified by FLAG affinity chromatography. The material eluted from the FLAG column (Sigma) was concentrated using a Sepharose Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using smooth muscle HMM as a standard. ATPase Assay—Actin-activated MgATPase activities were measured by an NADH-linked assay as described by Wang et al. (19Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, 10 μg/ml MLCK, 40 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mm NADH plus various concentrations of actin. Actin filaments were stabilized by a 1.5-fold molar excess of phalloidin (Calbiochem). The actin concentration varied from 1 to 50 μm. The assays were performed at 25 °C for HMM II-B and 25 and 37 °C for HMM II-C. Data were corrected for the background ATPase activity of actin. Fitting of experimental data sets to mathematical functions was done using OriginLab 7.0 (Microcal Corp.). Reported means and S.D. are those of three to four separate experiments. For ATPase activities measured at 37 °C in the case of HMM II-C0 and II-C1, only two experiments from two different preparations are reported. In Vitro Motility (IVM) Assay—Assays were performed at 30 °C in a buffer comprising 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm dithiothreitol 0.2 μm chicken gizzard tropomyosin, 0.7% methylcellulose, 2.5 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 2 μg/ml catalase. All HMM proteins were introduced at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml into a flow chamber with a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip. The surface was subsequently blocked by 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 1 min at room temperature in a solution containing 5 μm unlabeled F-actin, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 4 μg/ml MLCK. After washout, 20 nm F-actin labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and the above assay buffer was applied to the flow chamber. The sliding speed of actin filaments over the myosin-coated surface was analyzed using the CellTrak system (Motion Analysis) as described earlier (17Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Reported means and S.D. are those of three to four separate experiments. Transient Kinetics—Stopped-flow experiments were performed in a SF-2001 apparatus (Kin-Tek Corp.) at 25 °C in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EGTA. Pyrene fluorescence was excited at 365 nm (6-nm bandwidth), and emission was monitored through a 400-nm long-pass filter. 2′(3)-O-(N-Methylanthraniloyl)-ADP (Molecular Probes) was excited via energy transfer from vicinal tryptophan residues (excitation at 280 nm with a 6-nm bandwidth), and the emitted light was selected using a 400-nm longpass cutoff filter. Pre-mixing concentrations are indicated throughout this study unless stated otherwise. The volume ratio was 1:1 in all experiments. Actin was pyrene-labeled as in Cooper et al. (20Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Actin filaments were stabilized by a 1.5-fold molar excess of phalloidin. HMM constructs were thiophosphorylated and re-purified as in Facemyer and Cremo (21Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fitting of experimental datasets to mathematical functions was done using the SF-2001 software and OriginLab 7.0. Reported means and S.D. are those for two to three different experiments. Table I summarizes the mutations introduced into NMHC II-B and NMHC II-C. The table also includes a list of the developmental defects associated with these mutations, both in humans and mice. Note that because the identity of amino acids between the same NMHC isoforms from mice and humans exceeds 90%, we considered the species together for comparative purposes. Fig. 1 is a Coomassie Blue-stained gel showing each of the purified HMM constructs expressed using the baculovirus system. These include the wild-type and mutant HMM II-B as well as the wild-type and mutant HMM II-C with the inserted amino acids (C1) or without (C0). Each of these proteins could be purified in mg quantities, and each HMM heavy chain bound the co-expressed MLC20 and MLC17 in an approximate 1:1:1 ratio.Table IMutations in the NMHC and their association with developmental defectsNMHCSpeciesMutationsAssociated defects*II-BHumanN97K*II-BHumanR709CII-BMouseR709CDefect in brain and heart (15Ma X.

The basal activity was very low (<0.004 s–1) for each of the HMM II-B and HMM II-C proteins. All the HMMs (both II-B and II-C as well as II-A (13Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Fig. 2A shows that both the N97K and R709C mutations decrease the actin-activated MgATPase activity of phosphorylated HMM II-B, with the latter mutation having a greater effect. The data for each HMM were fitted to a hyperbolic equation to determine the kinetic constants: Vmax (maximal actin-activated ATPase activity) and KATPase (actin concentration at half-maximal activation; see Table II). Fig. 2B shows an expanded data set at lower actin concentrations, confirming the values in Fig. 2A. The Vmax of R709C-HMM was about 29% that of WT-HMM (0.05 ± 0.003 s–1 for R709C compared with 0.17 ± 0.04 s–1 for the wild-type), and its KATPase was much lower than that of WT-HMM (<0.5 μm for R709C compared with 3.4 ± 1.8 μm for the wild-type), indicating that it has a considerably higher actin affinity in the presence of ATP (see Table II). In contrast, the Vmax (0.12 ± 0.04 s–1) and KATPase (1.8 ± 0.6 μm) values of N97K-HMM were about 70 and 55% of that of WT-HMM, respectively.Table IISummary of actin-activated MgATPase activity and in vitro motility of HMMsHMMs°CaMeasured temperature for MgATPase activity assay.VmaxKATPaseIVM (30 °C)S-1μMμm/sHMM II-B25WT-HMM0.17 ± 0.043.4 ± 1.80.17 ± 0.03N97K-HMM0.12 ± 0.041.8 ± 0.60.06 ± 0.004R709C-HMM0.05 ± 0.003<0.5NSMHMM II-C37C1-HMM0.85 ± 0.1826.1 ± 6.20.08 ± 0.003C0-HMM0.29 ± 0.049.9 ± 6.00.03 ± 0.005HMM II-C25C1-HMM0.26 ± 0.0025.7 ± 2.90.08 ± 0.01C0-HMM0.18 ± 0.044.2 ± 1.10.03 ± 0.006C1-R730C-HMM0.08 ± 0.0071.6 ± 0.2NSMC0-R722C-HMM0.03 ± 0.0010.4 ± 0.02NSMC1-R730S-HMM0.28 ± 0.043.5 ± 1.20.02 ± 0.003HMM II-A (37Kovacs M.

Open table in a new tab An important functional property of myosin is its ability to translocate actin filaments. This can be measured using the in vitro motility assay with rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin. The movement of actin filaments over the myosin-coated surface was detected by fluorescence microscopy and the sliding speed was analyzed using the CellTrak system. All myosins were phosphorylated using MLCK prior to assay. As Table II shows, WT-HMM II-B moved actin filaments with an average velocity of 0.17 μm/s. The average sliding velocity of actin filaments propelled by mutant N97K-HMM was 0.06 μm/s (Fig. 2C). In contrast, we did not observe any significant movement (<0.01 μm/s) of actin filaments bound to R709C-HMM coated surfaces (Fig. 2C). Neither could we detect any motility of R709C-HMM in a similar motility assay using a laser scanning confocal microscope set up over a time course of 60 min. These results indicate that the R709C mutation in HMM II-B causes a large reduction in the actin-activated MgATPase activity and a loss of unloaded in vitro motor activity. Inhibition of HMM II-A Movement by R709C-HMM—To better understand the mechanism underlying the absence of detectable movement of actin filaments by R709C-HMM in the IVM assay, we mixed the R709C mutant HMM II-B at varying ratios with wild-type HMM II-A, the nonmuscle HMM found to propel actin filaments with the highest velocity among nonmuscle HMMs (13Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of the mutant R709C-HMM, even in low amounts, markedly slowed the movement of HMM II-A, showing that the R709C-HMM is predominantly in a strongly actin-bound state during steady-state ATP hydrolysis, which is also indicated by the very low KATPase value (<0.5 μm) shown in Table II. ADP Kinetics of Wild-type and Mutant HMM II-B—To gain further insight into the kinetic differences among the R709C mutant, the N97K mutant and wild-type HMM II-B, we determined the ADP binding affinity of actin-bound wild-type and mutant HMM II-B proteins (acto-HMM). We used a stopped-flow-based ADP titration method obtaining the results shown in Fig. 4A. The ATP-induced dissociation of the HMM heads of all three constructs from pyrene-actin caused a multiexponential increase in pyrene-actin fluorescence. The fast phase of the transients (with observed rate constants of 50–100 s–1) represents the ATP-induced dissociation of the ADP-free fraction of myosin heads from actin, whereas the slow phase (rate constants <3 s–1) reflects the ADP-bound fraction in which ADP dissociation from the myosin head rate-limits the subsequent ATP binding and actomyosin dissociation process. Analysis of the amplitude data showed that the Kd of ADP binding to acto-N97K-HMM was modestly higher than that to acto-WT-HMM (1.1 ± 0.1 μm compared with 0.61 ± 0.13 μm, respectively), whereas the acto-R709C-HMM appeared to have a very high ADP affinity (Kd<0.1 μm, Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the offrate constant (koff) of ADP dissociation from acto-N97K-HMM was slightly elevated compared with the wild-type (1.9 ± 0.3 s–1 compared with 0.52 ± 0.05 s–1, respectively), whereas acto-R709C-HMM exhibits an extremely slow release of ADP (koff = 0.02 ± 0.005 s–1) from acto-HMM (Fig. 4, B and C, Table III). To assess the effect of actin on the ADP kinetics of R709C-HMM, we have also determined its ADP binding properties using 2′(3)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-ADP, a fluorescent ADP analog both in the presence and absence of actin. We did not observe a significant change in the thermodynamic coupling ratio between actin and ADP binding and the enhancement of the ADP release rate by actin in R709C-HMM compared with that in wild-type subfragment 1 of NMHC II-B (Table III).Table IIIADP kinetics of wild-type and mutant HMM II-B constructsWT-S1 (19Wang F.

The trichomonad parasite T. vaginalis causes one of the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection in humans, trichomoniasis. The parasite as well as a secreted cysteine protease (CP) fraction, isolated by affinity chromatography followed by Bio-Gel P-60 column chromatography, are shown to induce HVEC apoptosis, as demonstrated by the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate flow cytometry analyses. Initiation of apoptosis is correlated with protease activity because the specific CP inhibitor E-64 inhibits both activities. SDS-PAGE analysis of the CP fraction reveals triplet bands around 30 kDa, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS indicates two closely associated peaks of molecular mass 23.6 and 23.8 kDa. Mass spectral peptide sequencing of the proteolytically digested CPs results in matches to previously reported cDNA clones, CP2, CP3, and CP4 (Mallinson, D. J., Lockwood, B. C., Coombs, G. H., and North, M. J. (1994) Microbiology 140, 2725-2735), as well as another sequence with high homology to CP4 (www.tigr.org). These last two species are the most abundant components of the CP fraction. The present results, suggesting that CP-induced programmed cell death may be involved in the pathogenesis of T. vaginalis infection in vivo, may have important implications for therapeutic intervention.

They showed the presence of several CPs in the extracellular medium and demonstrated that T. vaginalis secretes CPs (7Mallinson D.J. Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2725-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Their work culminated in the cloning of four T. vaginalis CPs (7Mallinson D.J. Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2725-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using sequences based on homologies within the broad family of CPs (GenBank™ accession numbers: X77218, X77219, X77220 and X77221). Two of the clones appear to be full-length. The other two are partial, although near full-length. Subsequently, additional CPs were cloned by Garber et al. (24Garber G.E. Lemchuk-Favel L.T. Metsick K.E. Dimock K.I. Appl. Parasitol. 1993; 34: 345-349Google Scholar) (accession number X70823) and Leon-Sicairos et al. (25Leon-Sicairos C.R. Parez-Martinez I. Alvarez-Sanchez M.E.

Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; accession numbers AY371180, AY371181, and AY463679). Several years ago, we established human (H) and bovine (B) vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) culture systems that display host-parasite specificity (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that trichomonad infection of VECs in vitro results in cell detachment followed by cell destruction (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that host cell destruction is the result of apoptosis, which is induced by CPs secreted by T. vaginalis. Apoptosis is an important and well regulated form of cell death that occurs under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions (29Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It has been studied in detail as a response to several bacterial and viral infections (30Moss J.E. Aliprantis A.O. Zychlinsky A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 187: 203-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and it is apparent that viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens have evolved a variety of different strategies to modulate host cell apoptosis (31Zychlinsky A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Gao L-Y. Kwaik Y.A. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 306-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The studies presented here are the first to demonstrate that extracellular T. vaginalis CPs induce HVEC apoptosis. We have identified these CPs using mass spectrometric analysis and comparison to the GenBank and TIGR data bases. Preliminary sequence data were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research through the website at www.tigr.org. T. vaginalis (UR1) isolates were obtained from a symptomatic patient attending an STD clinic. Following axenization, parasites were cultured in Diamond's TYM (pH 6.0) with 10% heat-inactivated equine serum (HyClone Laboratories) at 37 °C, as reported earlier (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Parasites were harvested in late log phase (24 h) by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS (pH 7.2). The trichomonads were suspended in Williams' medium for experimental purposes (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBS-washed trichomonads were resuspended in trichomonad incubation buffer (PBS with 10 mm HEPES, and 0.05% l-ascorbic acid, pH 6.2) and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h, as reported earlier (33Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Hayes G.R. Kumar I. Beach D.H. Frajblat M. Gilbert R.O. Sommer U. Costello C.E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4151-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Thomford J.W. Talbot J.A. Ikeda J.S. Corbeil L.B. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preparations were used only when >95% parasites were motile after incubation. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered sequentially through 0.45- and 0.22-μm filters followed by additional centrifugation for 2 h at 50,000 × g. The soluble fraction (devoid of membrane debris) was concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (Centriplus 10, 10K MWCO, or Jumbosep 10K, PALL). SF was applied to a bacitracin affinity chromatography column according to methods reported earlier (21North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Hayes G.R. Kumar I. Beach D.H. Frajblat M. Gilbert R.O. Sommer U. Costello C.E. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4151-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) was used as the support matrix. Concentrated SF was diluted (1:3) with sodium acetate buffer (20 mm, pH 4.0) and applied to the column (equilibrated in sodium acetate buffer) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The column was washed (0.8 ml/min) with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer until A280 read zero. Material bound to the column was eluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1.0 m NaCl, 25% 2-propanol as described by Thomford et al. (34Thomford J.W. Talbot J.A. Ikeda J.S. Corbeil L.B. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The eluted fractions containing protein (A280) were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against water and concentrated using centrifugal filtration devices. The concentrated bacitracin-bound fraction was applied to a Bio-Gel P-60 column (1 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 6.0), and fractions were collected. Two protein peaks (molecular mass ~30 and 60 kDa) were detected and the appropriate fractions were combined and concentrated using centrifugal devices. Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagent. Preparations typically yielded 100-200 μg of the 60-kDa fraction and ~600 μg of the 30-kDa fraction (CP30) from 4 liters of parasite culture (~2.2 × 1010 parasites). The two fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis on 12% polyacrylamide gels, according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), using a 3% stacking gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The masses of the intact proteins in the CP fraction were determined by MALDI-TOF MS on a Bruker Reflex IV instrument, with irradiation from a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 5-methoxysalicylic acid (9:1) as the matrix. The mass scale was calibrated with bovine serum albumin and myoglobin. Interpretation was done using XTOF 5.1.1 (Bruker). The fractions were digested with trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C in solution after reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT), or in-gel after reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide. The digests were first screened by MALDI-TOF MS as described above, with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix and Bruker peptide standard (m/z 757-3147) for calibration. Peptides were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Sciex Pulsar i QoTOF mass spectrometer (QStar) either by electrospray ionization (ESI) (nanospray) MS using self-pulled glass tips, or following SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion, by LC-MS/MS using an online Waters CapLC system with a Michrom Magic C18 (5 μm, 200 Å, 0.1 × 150 mm) column. The data were analyzed using QAnalyst (Applied Biosystems) software, GPMaw 5.02 (Lighthouse data, Denmark), using the predicted CP sequences published by Mallinson et al. (8Mallinson D.J. Livingston J. Appleton K.M. Lees S.J. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3077-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Sicairos et al. (25Leon-Sicairos C.R. Parez-Martinez I. Alvarez-Sanchez M.E. Lopez-Villasenor I. Arroyo R. J. Eukaryot.

Cysteine protease activity was determined essentially as reported by Thomford et al. (34Thomford J.W. Talbot J.A. Ikeda J.S. Corbeil L.B. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using Z-RR-AMC (n-carbobenzoxyl-arginyl-arginyl-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) as substrate. Briefly, 1 μg of protein was added to 980 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT (pH 7.6), and 10 μl of Z-RR-AMC (1 mg/ml in Me2SO, 15 μm final concentration) and the fluorescence was continuously monitored at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm. HVECs were cultured as previously reported (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HVECs were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Williams' complete medium (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured to confluence and subcultured. Williams' complete medium for normal growth contained fetal bovine serum (10%), 2 mml-glutamine, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml), and antibiotic (streptomycin, 100 μg/ml)-antimycotic (amphotericin B, 0.25 μg/ml). The purity of HVECs was determined by anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody. The identification of squamous epithelium in HVEC cultures was performed by immunostaining with C23 antibody (obtained from Dr. R. Wu, University of California, Davis) as reported earlier (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell purity is routinely 98-99%. The only contaminants present were vaginal fibroblasts, which are not killed in response to parasites. For experimental studies, cells were subcultured in 96/48/24-well cluster plates or in 6-well plates. In some experiments, the cells were also cultured on a glass coverslip (Fisher Scientific) placed in a 6-well plate containing Williams' medium. All experiments were performed when cells were 70-80% confluent and proliferating. When employed as controls, bovine cells (BVECs) were cultured similarly, as reported earlier (28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HVECs were exposed to trichomonad parasites, SF, or the isolated CP fraction for 4-20 h at 37 °C. In control experiments, parasites or the CP fraction were omitted, or HVECs were treated with the homogenous CP30 isolated from the bovine parasite T. foetus. The WST-1 assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure cytotoxicity/viability of HVECs, according to the manufacturers instructions. Cytotoxicity is calculated as 1 - E/C, where E/C is the ratio of absorbance of the formazan reading at 450 nm for experimental (E) versus control (C) samples. Data are derived from quadruplicate samples in three separate experiments. In some experiments protease inhibitors such as aprotinin (Sigma; 46-180 nm), leupeptin (Sigma; 0.63-2.5 μm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma; 3.4 μm to 1.3 mm), TLCK (Calbiochem; 135-540 μm), and E-64 (Calbiochem; 70-280 μm) were added to wells containing HVECs immediately before the start of the incubation. A variety of methods, described below, were employed to evaluate apoptotic cell death of HVECs. Camptothecin (Fluka; 5 μg/ml) was used as a positive control to induce apoptosis. DNA fragmentation was quantitatively evaluated by Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturers instructions. The enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was calculated as the ratio of the absorbance of the sample cells/absorbance of control cells. The enrichment factor was used as a parameter of apoptosis and shown on the y axis as mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments (36Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). An enrichment factor of 1 represents background or spontaneous apoptosis (generally ~6-10%). Following incubation of HVECs in 48- or 24-well plates with appropriate agents the supernatant was collected and centrifuged, and the pellet was washed with PBS. The cell pellet and washed cells remaining in the wells were lysed and added to microtiter plates as described in the ELISA kit. The supernatant was not used in the ELISA when HVECs were infected with live parasites because it contains parasites along with dead HVECs. The annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) was used to measure plasma membrane asymmetry. Following treatment for 6 h in 6-well plates, HVECs were harvested by the addition of 0.25% trypsin, 5.3 mm EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C (28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin was inactivated by addition of Williams' medium, cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g and the pellet was washed with PBS. Washed cells were resuspended in the binding buffer and stained with both annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI), according to the manufacturers protocol, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The FACStar plus flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) was set for FL 1 (annexin) versus FL 2 (PI) bivariate analysis. Data from 10,000 cells/sample were collected. The quadrants were set based on the population of healthy, unstained cells in untreated samples. CellQuest analysis of the data were used to calculate the percentage of the cells in the respective quadrants. Ac-DEVD-AFC (Bio-Rad) was used as the substrate to detect caspase activation fluorometrically in HVECs treated with CPs, E-64-treated CPs, and camptothecin. HVEC lysates were prepared and incubated with the substrate in cell lysis buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, anti-ACTIVE® caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Promega Corp.) was employed to detect an active form of caspase-3 in apoptotic HVECs. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed according to the manufacturers instructions. The involvement of caspases in HVEC apoptosis was further assessed by the incubation of HVECs with the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Enzyme System Product, Inc.). The inhibitor (75 μm final concentration) was added 45 min prior to activation (with CPs) and cytotoxicity/apoptosis were evaluated by the WST-1 assay. In earlier reports (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Beach D.H. Shin S.T. Gilbert R.O. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that incubation of trichomonad parasites with cultured VECs (HVECs and BVECs) leads to host cell death in a strikingly species-specific manner. We subsequently observed that a SF, obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is cytotoxic to host cells in a species-specific manner. SF obtained from T. vaginalis causes the complete destruction of HVECs in a time and concentration dependent manner (not shown). Thus having shown earlier that T. vaginalis parasites are cytopathogenic to HVECs (27Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4200-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we have now investigated whether the observed cell death is the result of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1B, HVECs undergo apoptosis when exposed to live T. vaginalis parasites or to the SF fraction. Camptothecin was used as a positive control to show apoptosis in HVECs. Although only the data obtained by a single technique for assaying apoptosis is shown in Fig. 1, we obtained identical results with flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC, MitoCapture (JC-1 dye, BioVision Inc.), and DNA fragmentation using bisbenzamide assays. It was reported a number of years ago that trichomonads secrete a number of hydrolytic enzymes (23Lockwood B.C. North M.J. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Of particular note was the demonstration that CPs are present in the secreted fraction (Refs. 21North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Lockwood B.C. North M.J. Scott K.I. Bremner A.F. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Lockwood B.C. North M.J. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; see below). As shown in Fig. 1A, heat treatment virtually eliminates the cytotoxicity of SF. Cytotoxicity requires a reducing agent (e.g. cysteine), but is diminished by E-64, a specific inhibitor of CPs, and by TLCK, which inhibits both cysteine and serine proteases. Other protease inhibitors, including leupeptin (0.63-2.5 μm), aprotinin (46-180 nm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (3.4 μm-1.3 mm) had no effect on SF-induced HVEC cell death. The SF fraction from the bovine parasite (TF-SF) is not cytotoxic to HVECs, nor does it induce apoptosis (Fig. 1). These results suggest that CPs in T. vaginalis SF are the initiators of HVEC apoptosis. To examine the hypothesis that CPs are the cytotoxic agents in SF and may initiate parasite-induced HVEC apoptosis, we employed bacitracin affinity chromatography to purify active components in SF, as reported earlier for parasite CPs (21North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Thomford J.W. Talbot J.A. Ikeda J.S. Corbeil L.B. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The vast majority of the A280 absorbing material in SF did not bind to the bacitracin affinity column and showed no cytotoxic activity (data not shown). The bound material was eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining, of this fraction showed a single band around 60 kDa and three closely spaced bands around 30 kDa. These two major fractions were subsequently separated on a Bio-Gel P-60 column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 2A. The number of bands in the approximately 30-kDa fraction (CP30) was variable, suggesting the possibility of proteolytic degradation. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of this fraction (Fig. 3) showed a peak centered at 23.8 kDa with a clear shoulder at 23.6 kDa and a high mass tail.Fig. 3MALDI-TOF MS of the TLCK-treated CP30 fraction. CP30 was prepared in the presence of TLCK, to eliminate autolysis observed during sample preparation for MS. Assignments for the most abundant signals, the CP4, CPT, and CP3 proteins, are indicated. The minor signals marked single (*) and double asterisks (**) at m/z 4041 and 8404 might originate from contaminants, whereas the minor signals marked Tv? at m/z 10,801 and 11,307 correspond to the approximate size of the sequences predicted to be cleaved off during maturation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protease activity of the CP30 fraction was measured fluorometrically using Z-RR-AMC as substrate. Protease activity required the presence of reducing agents such as cysteine (data not shown), or DTT, and was inhibited by E-64 and leupeptin (Fig. 2B), thus confirming its identity as a CP. The isolated CP30 fraction is also biologically active, as it is cytotoxic toward HVECs. Cytotoxicity is concentration dependent and is inhibited by E-64, indicating that apoptosis is closely correlated with CP activity (Fig. 4). Leupeptin (62.5-250 μm, not shown) also inhibits cytotoxicity. The specific activity (based on 50% cell death in cytotoxic assays) of this fraction is increased about 13-fold relative to SF. In contrast, the 60-kDa fraction showed less than 5% the cytotoxicity and CP enzymatic activity of the CP30 fraction. In control experiments, HVECs treated with the purified, homogeneous CP30 (33Singh B.N. Lucas J.J. Hayes G.R. Kumar I. Beach D.H. Frajblat M. Gil"

https://openalex.org/W2092539040,"Monomeric streptavidin with reversible biotin binding capability has many potential applications. Because a complete biotin binding site in each streptavidin subunit requires the contribution of tryptophan 120 from a neighboring subunit, monomerization of the natural tetrameric streptavidin can generate streptavidin with reduced biotin binding affinity. Three residues, valine 55, threonine 76, and valine 125, were changed to either arginine or threonine to create electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance at the interfaces. The double mutation (T76R,V125R) was highly effective to monomerize streptavidin. Because interfacial hydrophobic residues are exposed to solvent once tetrameric streptavidin is converted to the monomeric state, a quadruple mutein (T76R,V125R,V55T,L109T) was developed. The first two mutations are for monomerization, whereas the last two mutations aim to improve hydrophilicity at the interface to minimize aggregation. Monomerization was confirmed by four different approaches including gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, sensitivity to proteinase K, and chemical cross-linking. The quadruple mutein remained in the monomeric state at a concentration greater than 2 mg/ml. Its kinetic parameters for interaction with biotin suggest excellent reversible biotin binding capability, which enables the mutein to be easily purified on the biotin-agarose matrix. Another mutein (D61A,W120K) was developed based on two mutations that have been shown to be effective in monomerizing avidin. This streptavidin mutein was oligomeric in nature.

(Strept)avidin with reversible biotin binding capability can extend the applications of the biotin-(strept)avidin technology. These molecules can be applied for affinity purification of biotinylated biomolecules, screening of ultratight binders binding to biotinylated biomolecules displayed on the phage display system, and development of reusable biosensor chips, protein/antibody microarrays, and enzyme bioreactors (1Morag E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Balass M. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Fuchs S. Wilchek M. Katchalskikatzir E. Anal.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of (strept)avidin (4Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies also demonstrate the importance of this residue for tight biotin binding and subunit communications (6Freitag S. Le Trong I. Chilkoti A. Klumb L.A. Stayton P.S.

Therefore, development of monomeric (strept)avidin can be an attractive approach to engineer (strept)avidin with reversible biotin binding capability. The engineering of (strept)avidin to its monomeric form is technically challenging. In the case of avidin, the first generation of engineered monomeric avidin can exist in the monomeric state only in the absence of biotin (9Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This problem has been solved by the recent development of the second generation of monomeric avidin (10Laitinen O.H. Nordlund H.R. Hytonen V.P. Uotila S.T. Marttila A.T. Savolainen J. Airenne K.J.

Structural alignment of avidin and streptavidin indicates that these two residues correspond to Asp-61 and Trp-120 in streptavidin (11Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This illustrates the need to identify a new set of critical residues in combination with effective approaches to generate monomeric streptavidin with minimal mutational changes. Development of monomeric streptavidin has been reported previously through mutation of three residues to alanine (12Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C. Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46422-46428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the low affinity of this mutein toward biotin (Kd = 1.7 × 10-6 m) makes it less than ideal for many applications. To develop better versions of monomeric streptavidin, three residues (Val-55, Thr-76, and Val-125) were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. In combination with L109T mutation, a series of single, double, and quadruple streptavidin muteins were created and produced from Bacillus subtilis via secretion. As they were produced in the soluble form without the requirement of refolding (13Nagarajan V. Ramaley R. Albertson H. Chen M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3894-3898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu S.-C. Qureshi M.H. Wong S.-L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), their oligomeric state can be rapidly analyzed by SDS-PAGE using culture supernatants from the streptavidin mutein production strains. The muteins were purified and further characterized by different approaches to confirm their monomeric state. Their kinetic parameters for biotin binding were determined by surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor studies. Construction of Streptavidin Mutants—Different point mutations were introduced to the coding sequence of a synthetic streptavidin gene (ssav) in the B. subtilis expression vector pSSAV-Tcry (14Wu S.-C. Qureshi M.H. Wong S.-L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by PCR-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Five mutants (V125R, V125T, V55R, V55T, and T76R), each bearing a single mutation that results in the change of an amino acid residue as the name suggests, were constructed using pSSAV-Tcry as the template and the primers listed in Table I. The amplified products were digested with the pair of enzymes listed in Table I and cloned into pSSAV-Tcry. Five plasmids (pV125R, pV125T, pV55R, pV55T, and pT76R) resulted.Table IMutagenic primers for the construction of streptavidin mutants Mutated codons are bolded and underlined.

For M2 (T76R,V125R), a ScaI/NheI-digested fragment of pV125R was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pT76R. For AK (D61A,W120K), the fragment bearing the two mutations was amplified by PCR using the primers SAVD61AF and SAVW120KB (Table I) and the template pSSAV-Tcry. The amplified fragment was digested by XbaI/ScaI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pSSAV-Tcry. The construction of M4 (T76R,V125R,V55T,L109T) involved two steps (Supplemental Fig. S1). First, a 164-bp fragment bearing two mutations (T76R,L109T) was amplified using SAVT76RF and SAVL109TB (Table I) as primers and pSSAV-Tcry as template. The amplified product was digested by BamHI/ScaI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pV55T to generate pV55T-T76R-L109T. In the second step, a ScaI/NheI-digested fragment of pV125R was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pV55T-T76R-L109T to generate pV55T-T76R-L109T-V125R. Production and Purification of Streptavidin—Wild-type streptavidin was produced by B. subtilis WB800(pSSAV-Tcry) cultured in a defined medium (14Wu S.-C. Qureshi M.H. Wong S.-L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The secreted protein was purified to homogeneity using cation exchange followed by iminobiotin affinity chromatography (12Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C. Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46422-46428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Production and purification of streptavidin muteins followed a similar scheme with two major modifications: super-rich medium (15Halling S.M. Sanchez-Anzaldo F.J. Fukuda R. Doi R.H. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used in place of the defined medium, and biotin-agarose (Sigma) was used in place of iminobiotin-agarose as the affinity matrix. Dialyzed sample containing partially purified mutein was loaded to a 1-ml biotin-agarose column. Streptavidin muteins were eluted from the column using 20 mm d-biotin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2). Concentration of purified streptavidin was determined spectrophotometrically using the known extinction coefficient at 280 nm (16Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 17Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3359) Google Scholar) for each individual mutein. Determination of the Molecular Size of Streptavidin—Molecular mass of purified streptavidin and its muteins was estimated by both gel filtration and dynamic light scattering studies. Gel filtration was performed on the Bio-Rad biologic work station equipped with a Bio-Prep SE 100/17 column that had been calibrated with molecular mass protein markers (Bio-Rad). Molecular mass was also estimated from the hydrodynamic radius of the mutein obtained using a DynaPro MS dynamic light scattering instrument (Protein Solutions) that had been calibrated with lysozyme. Protein samples (2–3 mg/ml in PBS) were passed through a 0.02-μm filter (Whatman Anodisc 13) immediately prior to measurement. The size distribution profile was analyzed using the manufacturer's Dynamics V6 software. Proteinase K Digestion of Streptavidin and Its Muteins—Purified streptavidin and its muteins (30 μm monomer) were treated with proteinase K (Invitrogen, 5 μm) for 15 min at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0. The reaction was stopped by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (18Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Boiled samples of precipitated proteins were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. The same analysis was performed with streptavidin samples treated with biotin (1 mm final concentration) prior to proteinase K digestion. Cross-linking Reactions—Cross-linking of streptavidin and its muteins was carried out using ethylene glycol bis(sulfosuccinimidyl succinate) (sulfo-EGS) (Pierce) as the cross-linker. A typical reaction mixture (20 μl) contained the purified mutein (0.25 mg/ml) and sulfo-EGS (10-fold molar excess over the protein) in PBS. After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with Tris-HCl (30 mm, pH 7.5). Aliquots of the cross-linking reaction samples were boiled and examined by SDS-PAGE.

Kinetic Analysis of Streptavidin Muteins—The kinetic parameters (both on and off rates for interaction with biotin) of streptavidin muteins were determined in real time using the surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcoreX biosensor. Biotin-conjugated bovine serum albumin immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip was used to study the reversibility of biotin binding (12Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C. Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol.

The plots of accessible surface area of individual residues in streptavidin in either the monomeric or tetrameric state were generated using the Protein Dossier module in the Sting Millennium Suite. Selection of Key Residues in Streptavidin for Site-directed Mutagenesis—Tetrameric streptavidin is arranged as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 1A). The interface between subunits A and B (and between C and D) has the most extensive subunit interactions. The interfacial contact area between A and B is ∼1,557 Å2 with 17 H-bonding interactions, two salt bridges, and numerous van der Waals interactions. The interface contact between A and D is also extensive with a contact area of 525 Å2 and two interfacial H-bonding interactions. The weakest interface interaction is between subunits A and C with an interfacial contact area of 171 Å2. To engineer monomeric streptavidin with a minimal number of mutated residues, an attractive approach is to introduce both charge repulsion and steric hindrance at these interfaces. As protein has structural plasticity (23Vetter I.R. Baase W.A. Heinz D.W. Xiong J.P. Snow S. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2399-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Atwell S.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 262-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is vital to select interfacial residues located on a rigid surface to maximize the effects of charge repulsion and steric hindrance. Because streptavidin subunit forms an eight-antiparallel stranded β-barrel structure (4Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R. Science. 1989; 243: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 5Hendrickson W.A. Pahler A. Smith J.L. Satow Y. Merritt E.A. Phizackerley R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), the selected residues should be located on the β-strands rather than in the loop regions. Furthermore the selected residue in one subunit should be located very close to the equivalent residue or a charged residue in another subunit at the interface. Examination of interfacial residues (Fig. 1, B–D) shows that Thr-76, Val-125, and Val-55 meet the criteria. Hence they were selected for mutagenesis. Effects of Single Mutations on Monomerization of Streptavidin—Streptavidin muteins carrying a single amino acid change at the selected site were produced in their soluble form by B. subtilis via secretion. Analysis of non-boiled culture supernatants by SDS-PAGE offers a quick screen for the mutation effect (12Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C. Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46422-46428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Weaker subunit interaction would result in a higher percentage of the sample in the monomeric state on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Because biotin can strengthen subunit interaction, samples were analyzed in the presence or absence of biotin (9Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M.

Eng. 1999; 16: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The impact of the mutation on weakening of the subunit interaction followed the order: T76R > V125R > V125T ≈ V55R > V55T (Fig. 2 and Table II). The T76R mutein (designated M1) existed 100% in the monomeric state on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel even in the presence of biotin. In contrast, V55T mutation had the lowest impact with the majority of molecules in the tetrameric state even in the absence of added biotin. Presence of biotin shifts the majority of the three remaining muteins (V125R, V125T, and V55R) to the tetrameric state. As expected, changing valine to arginine exerted greater impact than changing it to threonine. This is true for both Val-125 and Val-55.Table IISummary of the mutagenic effects on weakening of subunit interactions in streptavidin muteins as reflected by the degree of monomerization of streptavidin muteins after SDS-PAGE Estimation of the percentage of streptavidin in monomeric and tetrameric states is based on the blots showing the migration pattern of non-boiled samples in Figs. 2 and 3.Streptavidin muteinNo additional biotinWith additional biotinMonomerTetramerMonomerTetramer%M1 (T76R)10001000V125R9281288V125T25750100V55R20801090V55T1990100M2 (T76R,V125R)10001000M4 (T76R,V125R,V55T,L109T)10001000AK10001000 Open table in a new tab Effects of Multiple Mutations on Monomerization of Streptavidin—To develop idealized monomeric streptavidin muteins that are more likely to remain in the monomeric state at high streptavidin concentrations and have excellent reversible biotin binding capability, two more muteins were created. M2 is the double mutant carrying both the T76R and V125R mutations. M4 is a quadruple mutant carrying T76R, V125R, V55T, and L109T mutations. In this combination, the three interfacial hydrophobic residues Val-125, Val-55, and Leu-109 were changed to hydrophilic ones. The last construct is AK, a double mutant (D61A,W120K) carrying two mutations (equivalent to those performed in avidin) that have been shown to convert tetrameric avidin to the monomeric state (10Laitinen O.H. Nordlund H.R. Hytonen V.P. Uotila S.T. Marttila A.T. Savolainen J. Airenne K.J. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4010-4014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 and Table II, just like M1, all these muteins existed in monomeric state on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel even in the presence of biotin. Purification of Streptavidin Muteins—Purification of M4 was used as an example to illustrate the process (Fig. 4). Proteins partially purified by ion exchange chromatography (lane 2) were applied to a biotin-agarose column. M4 could be readily eluted off from the column using biotin-containing buffer as the eluant (lanes 5–7). Pure streptavidin mutein obtained by this simple procedure, after removal of biotin by dialysis, could be used for biochemical characterizations. To demonstrate that dialysis could effectively remove any bound biotin from the M4 mutein, the dialyzed sample was reloaded to the biotin-agarose matrix. Over 95% of the sample could be retained on the column and eluted off from the column using biotin (data not shown). Of all the muteins, M1 tended to have a long trailing tail during elution. This indicates that M1 may not have the desirable reversible biotin binding property. Therefore, it was not characterized further. Determination of Apparent Molecular Mass of Streptavidin Muteins by Gel Filtration—Observation of 100% monomerization of the streptavidin mutein using a non-boiled sample for SDS-PAGE does not always truly reflect its existence in the monomeric state in solution because SDS can promote subunit dissociation (27Bayer E.A. Ehrlichrogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Waner M.J. Navrotskaya I. Bain A. Oldham E.D. Mascotti D.P. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2701-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular masses of the purified wild-type streptavidin and the three muteins (M2, M4, and AK) were estimated by gel filtration (Supplemental Fig. 2A and Table III). The expected molecular mass of monomeric streptavidin is 16.5 kDa. M2 and M4 in the absence of biotin showed the apparent molecular masses of 19.95 and 21.87 kDa, respectively. These masses increased slightly in the presence of biotin. These data suggest that the muteins are monomeric in nature because their masses are less than that for the streptavidin dimer (33 kDa). In contrast, the AK mutein showed an apparent molecular mass of 45.66 kDa even in the absence of biotin. This indicates the oligomeric nature of this mutein. Supplemental Fig. 2B shows the elution profile of purified M4 (in the absence of biotin) from the gel filtration column. The sample (loaded at 2 mg/ml) was eluted as a single peak. There is no evidence for the presence of tetrameric streptavidin, which would be eluted at 30.5 min. Determination of Apparent Molecular Mass of Streptavidin Muteins by Dynamic Light Scattering—Because the apparent molecular mass of wild-type streptavidin in the absence of biotin is 10 kDa less than expected (56 instead of 66 kDa) as determined by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering (29Schurr J.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 4: 371-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was used as a second method to estimate the apparent molecular masses. The apparent molecular mass of wild-type streptavidin obtained in this way (69 kDa) was closer to that expected (66 kDa) (Table III). The apparent molecular masses for both M2 and M4 in the absence of biotin indicated that they were in the monomeric state. Addition of biotin caused only a slight increase in their apparent molecular masses. The AK mutein again was found to be oligomeric independent of the presence or absence of biotin.Table IIIMolecular mass determination of wild-type (wt) streptavidin and its muteins by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering In dynamic light scattering, the estimated molecular mass (M) was calculated from the measured hydrodynamic radius (RH) using a protein calibration curve. The peaks have a polydispersity below 15%. Theoretical molecular mass is estimated from the amino acid composition of the mature protein (17Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D.

Nordlund H.R. Hytonen V.P. Uotila S.T. Marttila A.T. Savolainen J. Airenne K.J. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4010-4014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, wild-type streptavidin and its muteins were treated with proteinase K (Fig. 5A). Wild-type streptavidin was converted to the core form independent of the presence or absence of biotin. Under the condition used, the core streptavidin was resistant to further degradation by proteinase K. In contrast, all three muteins including AK, M2, and M4 were much more susceptible to proteinase K digestion. Sensitivity to proteinase K is more apparent for M2 and M4, which were completely digested independent of the presence or absence of biotin. This property is consistent with the monomeric nature of these muteins. The AK mutein behaved differently. Although most of it was digested by proteinase K in the absence of biotin, it became much more resistant to proteinase K when biotin was present. Cross-linking of Streptavidin and Its Muteins—To strengthen the idea that both M2 and M4 are monomeric whereas AK is oligomeric in nature, protein cross-linking was carried out using sulfo-EGS as the cross-linking agent. Sulfo-EGS reacts with both the accessible α-amino groups at the N termini and the surface-exposed ϵ-amino groups of the lysine side chains in proteins. Secreted wild-type streptavidin has eight lysine residues in each subunit. The three-dimensional structural model of streptavidin suggests that lysine 121 in subunit A is 14.1 Å from lysine 121 in subunit D. As the spacer arm in sulfo-EGS is 16.1 Å, subunits A and D (same for subunits B and C) should be easily cross-linked by sulfo-EGS. Also it is possible to have cross-linking between subunits A and B as the N-terminal region from subunit A, which contains two lysine residues, is likely to be positioned close to lysine 80 in subunit B. The same is true for subunits C and D. Therefore, one should be able to differentiate tetrameric streptavidin from the monomeric form with the observation of cross-linked tetrameric streptavidin using sulfo-EGS. Lysozyme, well known to be monomeric in solution (30Blake C.C. Koenig D.F. Mair G.A. North A.C. Phillips D.C. Sarma V.R. Nature. 1965; 206: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 31Schwalbe H. Grimshaw S.B. Spencer A. Buck M. Boyd J. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. Smith L.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), served as the negative control. Fig. 5B shows that the amount of dimeric lysozyme increased slightly in the presence of the cross-linking agent. This helped set the upper limit of the concentration of sulfo-EGS to be used under the experimental condition. The wild-type streptavidin subunit had an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa on the SDS gel. After treatment with sulfo-EGS, most of these subunits were cross-linked to dimers and higher oligomers with small amounts remaining in the monomeric state. M2 and M4 muteins behaved very similarly (data for M2 are not shown). The majority of the M2 and M4 muteins after the cross-linking treatment migrated as monomers with small amounts in the dimeric form. These dimers may represent cross-linked monomeric subunits that were artificially generated in the same manner as with lysozyme. AK showed a cross-linking profile very similar to that of the wild-type streptavidin. These data strongly support the idea that M2 and M4 muteins are monomeric, whereas the AK mutein is oligomeric in solution. Reversible Interaction between Streptavidin Muteins and Biotin—The on rate and off rate of the interactions between streptavidin muteins and biotin were determined by surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcore biosensor (12Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C. Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46422-46428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Table IV (graphical plots for M4 are shown in Supplemental Fig. S3), M2, M4, and AK had their dissociation constant (Kd) in the range of 10-7m. The off rates (kd) for these muteins were almost the same, whereas the on rate (ka) for the AK mutein was slightly lower than the rest. One of the factors affecting the on rate is the diffusion coefficient (or molecular mass) of the streptavidin molecule. Because AK is oligomeric in nature, this may account for the lower on rate for this mutein-biotin interaction.Table IVKinetic parameters for the interactions between streptavidin muteins and biotinProteinkakdKdm–1 s–1s–1mM21.88 ± 0.07 × 1043.22 ± 0.01 × 10–31.71 ± 0.07 × 10–7M41.80 ± 0.04 × 1043.39 ± 0.02 × 10–31.87 ± 0.06 × 10–7AK1.46 ± 0.05 × 1043.59 ± 0.03 × 10–32.46 ± 0.10 × 10–7 Open table in a new tab Although streptavidin and avidin have similar three-dimensional structures and biotin binding properties, development of monomeric streptavidin is much more challenging for two reasons. First, streptavidin has stronger subunit interfacial interactions than avidin (27Bayer E.A. Ehrlichrogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Waner M.J. Navrotskaya I. Bain A. Oldham E.D. Mascotti D.P. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2701-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More potent mutations are required to weaken this strong interface interaction. Second, monomerization of streptavidin may result in the surface exposure of hydrophobic residues that normally would be buried at the interface in tetrameric streptavidin. This can potentially affect the solubility of the monomeric streptavidin and lead to reassociation of the monomers. The problem can be less dramatic for avidin, which is a glycosylated protein with a carbohydrate chain in each of the avidin subunits. Despite the challenge, our study illustrates that, by selecting a critical residue located on a rigid surface for mutagenic study and the introduction of charge repulsion and steric hindrance at the interface, a single mutation (T76R) can be greatly effective in developing monomeric streptavidin. Besides the suggestion from SDS-PAGE analysis, gel filtration study of the M1 mutein also indicated that the majority of M1 was eluted at a position corresponding to the monomeric form (data not shown). The main drawback for this mutein is its elution behavior on the biotin-agarose column. The elution profile had a typical long trailing tail. Furthermore more M1 could be recovered by soaking the column overnight with buffer containing biotin. This suggests that some of the M1 population have higher affinity to the matrix. To increase the efficiency of streptavidin monomerization, M2 mutein was developed by combining two potent mutations (T76R,V125R). Data from gel filtration study, dynamic light scattering, sensitivity to proteinase K, and cross-linking reaction confirmed the monomeric state of M2. The elution profile of this mutein from the biotin-agarose matrix had a considerable improvement over that of M1. When a 30-min on-column incubation period was allowed for the eluant in between fraction collection, about 90% of M2 could be recovered within 3 column volumes of the eluant. To ensure that the streptavidin mutein will stably remain in the monomeric state, more mutations were introduced to M2. The exposure of the AB (or CD) interface will expose three hydrophobic residues: Val-55, Leu-109, and Val-125. In the M2 mutein, Val-125 has been changed to arginine. We chose to further convert Val-55 and Leu-109 to threonine, a more hydrophilic residue, to develop the M4 mutein. Conversion to threonine instead of arginine is preferred because proteins with high pI are known to have nonspecific interactions via electrostatic interactions (32Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Marttila A.T. Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The calculated pI of M2 is 8.1. If both Val-55 and Leu-109 are converted to arginine, the resulting mutein will have a pI of 9.2. This may increase the chance of charge-related nonspecific interactions. The conversion of these residues to negatively charged residues was not considered because both Val-55 and Leu-109 are located on the β-strands, and negatively charged residues are relatively poor β-strand formers. M4 mutein shares with M2 mutein many desirable features of an idealized monomeric streptavidin. They both exist in the monomeric state at a reasonably high protein concentration (2 mg/ml or more as used in the dynamic light scattering study). Both have excellent reversible biotin binding capability as reflected by their on rate and off rate for biotin interaction. Both have a moderate pI value of 8.1 so that charge-related nonspecific interactions will be minimal. In addition, M4 has two features that make it even more attractive in practice. Molecules of M2 mutein tend to aggregate in solution. Filtration of M2 through a 0.02-μm filter was essential for obtaining a good signal of the mutein for dynamic light scattering studies because of poor signal detection caused by the presence of small amounts of large aggregates in an unfiltered sample. On the other hand, a decent signal could at least be obtained with an unfiltered sample of similarly prepared M4. Thus, conversion of the two hydrophobic residues (Val-55 and Leu-109) to the more hydrophilic threonine residue did help minimize aggregation of the mutein. Another attractive feature is that M4 has a remarkably sharp elution profile with its purification using biotin-agarose. Over 95% of the mutein could be readily eluted off from the column using just 2 column volumes of the eluant, leading to a high rate of protein recovery. In the site-directed mutagenesis study, it is not difficult to understand the impact of the mutations in the following order: T76R > V125R > V55R. Analysis of the solvent accessibility of individual amino acid residues with tetrameric streptavidin indicates that the solvent-accessible area of Thr-76 in subunit A is zero. Its close distances to both Thr-76 and Arg-59 in subunit B and location on a rigid surface of a β-barrel structure make it an ideal residue to be changed to arginine to achieve the maximal electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance effects at the subunit interface (Fig. 1B). The surface-accessible area of Val-125 in subunit A is 1.78%. It has extensive interactions with Leu-109, Trp-120, Thr-123, and Val-125 in subunit D (Fig. 1C); Leu-109 in subunit B; and Gln-107 in subunit C. Its conversion to arginine results in charge repulsion in subunit D and potential steric hindrance for subunits B, C, and D. As for Val-55 in subunit A, its surface accessible area is 29.7%; and it is only close to Arg-59 in subunit B at the interface (Fig. 1D). Thus, V55R has the least impact on monomerization. Although AK mutein shows reversible biotin binding property and monomeric behavior on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, it clearly exists in the oligomeric state in solution as suggested by gel filtration studies, dynamic light scattering, and cross-linking pattern. This study illustrates the importance of selecting critical residues and effective approaches to achieve the maximal monomerization effect on tetrameric streptavidin.

https://openalex.org/W2053145402,"Abstract Catalase-peroxidases (KatG) are bifunctional enzymes possessing both catalase and peroxidase activities. Three crystal structures of different KatGs revealed the presence of a novel Met-Tyr-Trp cross-link that has been suggested to impart catalatic activity to the KatGs. High-performance liquid chromatographic separation of the peptide fragments resulting from tryptic digestion of recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis WT KatG identified a peptide with unusual UV-visible spectroscopic features attributable to the Met255-Tyr229-Trp107 cross-link, whose structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry. WT KatG lacking the Met-Tyr-Trp cross-link was prepared, making possible studies of its formation under oxidizing conditions that generate either compound I (peroxyacetic acid, PAA) or compound II (2-methyl-1-phenyl-2-propyl hydroperoxide, MPPH). Incubation of this “cross-link-free” WT KatG with PAA revealed complete formation of the Met-Tyr-Trp structure after six equivalents of peracid were added, whereas MPPH was unable to promote cross-link formation. A mechanism for Met-Tyr-Trp autocatalytic formation by KatG compound I is proposed from these studies. Optical stopped-flow studies of WT KatG and KatG(Y229F), a mutant in which the cross-link cannot be formed, were performed with MPPH and revealed an unusual compound II spectrum for WT KatG, best described as (P·)FeIII, where P· represents a protein-based radical. This contrasts with the oxoferryl compound II spectrum observed for KatG(Y229F) under identical conditions. The structure-function-spectroscopy relationship in KatG is discussed with relevance to the role that the Met-Tyr-Trp cross-link plays in the catalase-peroxidase mechanism."

It is the most important among lymphoid translocations, because follicular lymphomas account for nearly half of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (5Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The t(14;18) translocation is assumed to result from recombination between the bcl-2 gene and V(D)J subexons during V(D)J recombination in pre-B cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). This translocation juxtaposes the bcl-2 locus on chromosome 18 to the intron enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, leading to the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and thereby to follicular lymphoma (1Bakhshi A. Wright J.J. Graninger W. Seto M. Owens J. Cossman J. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2396-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2Wyatt R.T.

Although the bcl-2 gene is more than 200 kb long, in most follicular lymphoma patients, the break at chromosome 18 occurs within a small 150-bp region located in the untranslated portion of the terminal (third) exon, designated as the major breakpoint region (Mbr) 1The abbreviations used are: Mbr, major breakpoint region; bcl-2 Mbr, major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: Mbr, major breakpoint region; bcl-2 Mbr, major breakpoint region of the bcl-2 gene; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; EM, electron microscopy; nt, nucleotide(s). (see Supplemental Fig. 1 for orientation) (2Wyatt R.T. Rudders R.A. Zelenetz A. Delellis R.A. Krontiris T.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Jager U. Bocskor S. Le T. Mitterbauer G. Bolz I. Chott A. Kneba A. Mannhalter C. Nadel B. Blood. 2000; 95: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the 150-bp Mbr, there are three peaks (hotspots) of breakage, each about 15–20 bp in size (Supplemental Fig. 1) (3Jager U. Bocskor S. Le T. Mitterbauer G. Bolz I. Chott A. Kneba A. Mannhalter C. Nadel B. Blood. 2000; 95: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristic precision and distribution profile within the bcl-2 Mbr strongly suggest some strong local regional specificity to the bcl-2 Mbr (5Raghavan S.C. Lieber M.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analysis of patient breakpoint junctions suggested that a V(D)J recombination-mediated mechanism generates a break on chromosome 14, in which DH and JH subexons are cleaved at a pair of signal sequences (12- or 23-signal) by the RAG complex (RAG1, RAG2, and HMG1). However, the mechanism of breakage at the bcl-2 Mbr was completely unknown, although it had been speculated that the Mbr sequence may act like a cryptic signal sequence. Recently, we and others showed that whereas the RAG complex misrecognizes some breakpoint sites as cryptic heptamer/nonamer signals (10Lewis S.M. Agard E. Suh S. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the bcl-2 Mbr does not function as a cryptic signal (12Marculescu R. Le T. Simon P. Jaeger U. Nadel B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the bcl-2 Mbr adopts a non-B form structure within the mammalian chromosome (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This altered DNA structure can be recapitulated when the bcl-2 Mbr is present on a human minichromosome or on an E. coli episome (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The structure at the 150-bp bcl-2 Mbr contains distinctive regions of single-strandedness that correspond well to the regions of translocation frequency among patients. Based on an intracellular transfection system, we could reconstitute the t(14;18) translocation process inside mammalian cells and show that it is dependent on the RAG complex (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the structure formation could be recapitulated on DNA fragments of various lengths containing the bcl-2 Mbr region (14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The non-B structure formation is favored in the presence of Mg2+ at neutral pH and is stable for days. The structure formation also requires Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding (14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These features rule out many non-B DNA conformations but do not permit us to determine the specific non-B conformation that does exist at the Mbr. Triple helical DNA (triplex DNA) structures can form inter- or intramolecularly and were first reported nearly 50 years ago (15Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Crossref Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 16Chamberlin M.J. Patterson D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 410-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Morgan A.R. Wells R.D. J.

Triplexes are formed at polypurine-polypyrimidine (R.Y) tracts (19Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 20Sinden R.R.

Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar, 22Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Triplexes formed within the same duplex DNA region are known as intramolecular triplexes, or H-DNA (23Mirkin S.M. Lyamichev V.I. Drushlyak K.N. Dobrynin V.N. Filippov S.A. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Nature. 1987; 330: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The third strand (R or Y) occupies the major groove of the duplex DNA (R.Y). There are two general types of triplexes. Depending on whether the third strand of the triplex is rich in purines (R) or pyrimidines (Y), they are called R.R.Y triplexes or Y.R.Y triplexes (20Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar, 21Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). Each of these triplexes is known to form under specific reaction conditions. Y.R.Y triplexes are favored in acidic pH, whereas R.R.Y triplexes prefer neutral pH and require the presence of divalent metal cations, making the latter more likely under physiologic conditions (20Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar, 21Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). R.R.Y triplexes tolerate more versatile pairing schemes and form more rapidly (24Faucon B. Mergny J.L. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). H-DNA is formed by a fold-back mechanism, stabilized by supercoiling, and half of the length of the R or Y strand (fourth strand) is unpaired (20Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar, 21Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). Here we show that the bcl-2 Mbr is capable of adopting two different non-B conformations at peak I (termed I-α and I-β), in addition to the one non-B conformation at peak III, within the mammalian cells. The Mbr structure formation is facilitated by supercoiling, although it is not dependent upon it. Full molecule bisulfite sequencing experiments reveal strand asymmetry at the single-stranded regions of the bcl-2 Mbr in mammalian cells or when the DNA is harvested from Escherichia coli. Gel shift assays and electron microscopy show that a triplex-specific antibody binds to the bcl-2 Mbr. Circular dichroism studies show that the structure is an R.R.Y triplex. Based on these studies, we provide both two- and three-dimensional models for an R.R.Y structure at peak I of the bcl-2 Mbr. In sum, there are 14 lines of experimentation using five different methods indicating an R.R.Y triplex conformation at the bcl-2 Mbr. In addition, we find that such triplex formation is the basis for the bcl-2 translocation. Enzymes, Chemicals, and Reagents—Sodium bisulfite and other chemical reagents are from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes are from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Components for cell culture are from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Radioisotope-labeled nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmid Construction—The plasmid constructs were made by modifying the SV40-based plasmid, pGG51 (25Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A SalI-digested, 300-bp PCR fragment of the bcl-2 Mbr was cloned into the SalI site of pGG51 after removing the 12-signal normally at this site. The resulting plasmid, pXW5, contains the bcl-2 fragment in the physiologic transcriptional orientation relative to the lac transcriptional promoter. In the case of pSCR33, after deleting the 12-signal from pGG51 by SalI digestion, the linear DNA was self-ligated. The pSCR41 was constructed by cloning a mutated 300-bp PCR product of bcl-2 Mbr (see “Mutagenesis at the Bcl-2 Mbr”) into the SalI site of pSCR33. The plasmid, pSCR1, was constructed by cloning the 300-bp SalI fragment into the SalI site of pBSS3, a derivative of Bluescript plasmid in which the lacZ promoter has been deleted (26Yu K. Chedin F. Hsieh C-L. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Bisulfite Modification Assay—The bisulfite modification assay was carried out as described earlier (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). See Supplemental Material for details. Mutagenesis at the bcl-2 Mbr—Mutagenesis was carried out using standard PCR protocol with mutant sequence primers (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). See Supplemental Material for details. Monoclonal Antibody Detection of Triplex DNA—0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ng each of two triplex antibodies (Jel466 or Jel318) were individually incubated with 1 μg of the supercoiled plasmid DNA (pXW5) in 1× buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a 20-μl volume. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, a 700-bp bcl-2 Mbr fragment was released by AatII/BamHI digestion for 2 h at 37 °C. Digestion products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting. Southern hybridization was carried out by using the same labeled AatII/BamHI fragment as the probe (labeling with [α-32P]dCTP). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C overnight. Radioactive blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS and exposed to a phosphor imager screen. Radioactive signals were detected by scanning. For control experiments, pSCR33 (the 300-bp bcl-2 Mbr is absent in this plasmid) was incubated with 0, 50, and 100 ng of Jel466 in a 20-μl volume. Here, the same AatII/BamHI digestion was used to release the fragment, which is 300 bp smaller. In another control, after incubation with the antibody, a 1.6-kb fragment (AvrII/AatII) was released from the backbone of the plasmid and resolved on an agarose gel. For Southern hybridization, the same 1.6-kb fragment was used as the probe after labeling. Other steps were the same as above. Electron Microscopy—DNA fragments (488 and 425 bp) for electron microscopy were prepared by PCR amplification. The DNA (1 μg) was then gel-purified and incubated in triplex-forming buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm spermine) at 37 °C overnight. The products were then purified and resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2. About 300 ng of DNA was then resuspended in 10 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with 100 ng of triplex-specific antibody (Jel466 or Jel318) or without antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. Following the 1-h incubation, the samples were fixed for 5 min at 22 °C by adding an equal amount of 1.2% glutaraldehyde and then diluted with 280 μl of TE(10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The fixed samples were absorbed to thin carbon foils, washed, air-dried, and rotary shadow-cast with tungsten at high vacuum (28Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken on a Phillips CM12 electron microscope at 40 kV. Images for publication were captured using a Gatan CCD camera and then using DigitalMicrograph 3.3 (Gatan Inc.). Circular Dichroism—The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter fitted with a JASCO PFD-425S Peltier temperature control system at 22 or 80 °C in a wavelength range of 210–310 nm. The DNA samples containing duplex DNA (1.6 μm) and third strand oligomer (1.6 μm) were incubated together in a buffer containing 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm spermidine for 1 h at 22 °C. DNA samples were placed on a 0.1-cm path length square quartz cuvette and used for the scanning. 30 scans were performed per spectrum. Spectra of buffer solution were subtracted to correct for base-line artifacts. CD spectra were normalized in units of molar ellipticity (degrees cm2 dmol–1). Human Recombination Assay—The human lymphoid cell line, Reh, was grown logarithmically, transfected with the appropriate plasmid substrates using the electroporation/DEAE-dextran method as described previously (29Gauss G. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6739-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C. The various steps involved in the human V(D)J recombinase assay described previously (25Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Gauss G.H. Domain I. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). See Supplemental Material for details. More than One Non-B Conformation Exists at the bcl-2 Mbr within Mammalian Cells—A significant amount of single-strandedness exists at the bcl-2 Mbr based on probing using a bisulfite modification assay on genomic DNA, sensitivity to KMnO4 and OsO4in vivo, a P1 nuclease assay in vitro, and a gel shift assay in vitro (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). KMnO4 and OsO4in vivo analysis are useful methods but suffer from the fact that they do not represent minority molecular conformations well. For the bcl-2 Mbr, there is the additional problem that there is a paucity of Ts where these chemicals react, and this same limitation applies to psoralen (20Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar). Here we have used the bisulfite modification assay to further understand the nature of the non-B DNA structure within the mammalian cells. The chromosomal DNA was extracted from mammalian cells (Reh, a pre-B cell line) using a nondenaturing method to minimize disturbances to any non-B DNA conformation. The DNA was then treated with bisulfite. (Similar results were obtained regardless of whether the bisulfite is used at pH 5.2 or 6.5 (13Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C-L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).) The molecules with non-B DNA structure were enriched with restriction enzyme digestion and detected by PCR, cloning, and sequencing (see “Experimental Procedures”). These molecules showed an increase in bisulfite conversion of cytosine to thymine (suggesting single-strandedness) at or around peaks I and III (Fig. 1). There is only background bisulfite reactivity at peak II. Detailed analysis of sequenced molecules shows that in many of the molecules, the single-stranded region exists at or upstream of peak I and/or at peak III at the same time (Fig. 1A, labeled I-α; III; or I-α, III). This suggests that two local, independent non-B DNA structures may exist, sometimes within the same molecule. However, in other molecules, the single-strandedness is downstream of peak I and at peak III (Fig. 1A, labeled I-β and III). This finding suggests that at peak I, there may be more than one non-B DNA structure. In addition, there are molecules with less common structures, such as single-strandedness at I-γ alone or at I-γ plus III (Fig. 1A). Comparable classifications can be made for the bottom strand as well, though these are less obvious (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the present study shows the precise location and nature of the non-B DNA structure formation at the level of the individual molecule within the mammalian cells. There is also an asymmetry in the bisulfite conversion between the top and bottom strands, and this asymmetry is more obvious at peak I (see below). Non-B DNA Structure Formation Is Favored by Supercoiling—We find that molecules with continuous stretches of bisulfite conversion (i.e. molecules with the non-B form DNA structure) are highest for minichromosomes harvested from human cells (47%) and supercoiled plasmid DNA harvested from E. coli (45%), both by nondenaturing methods. However, in the case of chromosomal DNA, the frequency of molecules with structure was only about 28% (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with the large amount of superhelical tension that it is possible to achieve on circular molecules (prokaryotic and eukaryotic plasmids). In the case of chromosomal DNA, where there is a documented (32Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but low level of supercoiling compared with circular DNA, a relatively lower fraction of molecules form the structure (Fig. 2A). When there is no supercoiling (on short linear DNA fragments containing the bcl-2 Mbr), we see only 10–15% of the molecules with the non-B structure (14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, we find only 18% of the molecules with the non-B structure when the plasmid DNA is linearized (Fig. 2A). Therefore, our results suggest that structure formation is facilitated when supercoiling is present. Although the frequency of molecules with the non-B structure varies in proportion to the superhelical tension, the overall bisulfite conversion frequency is comparable among the molecules with the non-B structure in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (Fig. 2B). Structural Analysis of Both Strands of Individual DNA Molecules—The bisulfite modification assay described thus far provides information about only one strand of a duplex DNA molecule at a time. We were interested in gaining information about both strands of the same molecule, wherever feasible, since that would dramatically help us to predict the nature of the structure. One may think of this as “full-molecule” information rather than the “half-molecule” information obtained when the two strands must be separated. Full-molecule analysis is possible in the case of E. coli plasmids bearing the bcl-2 Mbr region but on a very limited scale (see “Experimental Procedures”). We have fully characterized a small number of molecules on both strands (Fig. 3, A and B). We find that the single-stranded regions for full molecules correspond extremely well to the collective information obtained for populations of half-molecules. In particular, the regions of single-strandedness on the top and bottom portions match very well with the population information for the chromosomal bcl-2 Mbr (Fig. 1). This information confirms that the pooled half-molecule information is very similar to, if not indistinguishable from, full-molecule information. This finding also indicates that there is asymmetry between the top and bottom strands, particularly at peak I and to some extent at peak III. Multiple Factors That Affect Triplex Formation, but Not B-DNA, Also Affect the bcl-2 Mbr Structure—Although clustering of patient breakpoints has been observed in the 150-bp region of the bcl-2 Mbr region, we could not find any canonical sequences known to form structures such as symmetric bubbles, heterologous loops, cruciforms, Z-DNA, tetraplexes (quadraplexes or G-quartets), or triplexes. However, a relatively purine-rich bottom strand just upstream of peak I of the Mbr suggested the possibility of triplex formation, albeit with obvious mismatches. In earlier studies, we have seen that the non-B structure formation at the bcl-2 Mbr is favored in the presence of Mg2+ and spermidine at neutral pH (14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Above, we have noted that the structure formation is favored when supercoiling is present, and supercoiling is known to favor triplex formation (20Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar, 21Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar, 22Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In a putative triplex, the third strand would most likely be Hoogsteen paired with another duplex DNA portion, and the fourth strand would remain unpaired. In order to further investigate this possibility, we studied factors known to affect triplex formation. We have seen that 7-deazaadenine and 7-deazaguanine (analogues of adenine and guanine, respectively) interfere with Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation and also abolish the non-B structure formation (14Raghavan S.C. Houston S. Hegde B.G. Langen R. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46213-46225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This further supports a triplex structure, because B-form DNA does not rely on base pairing at the N7 position. Because the maximal single-strandedness is at peaks I and III of the Mbr, mutations within these regions might affect the non-B structure. We mutated CCC → GGG on the top strand and vice versa on the bottom strand by using a standard mutagenesis protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”); such a change would not alter B-form DNA. The 300-bp PCR fragment containing the mutated bcl-2 Mbr was then cloned into pXW5 to replace the bcl-2 Mbr. The resulting plasmid (pSCR41) was examined using the bisulfite modification assay. The mutant Mbr shows a 3-fold reduction in the fraction of supercoiled plasmid molecules that adopt significant stretches of single-strandedness at the Mbr (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, when pSCR41 is linearized before the bisulfite modification assay, we cannot detect any molecules with significant single-strandedness (Fig. 2A). These results show that the CCC → GGG change causes a reduction in bisulfite conversion frequency in the Mbr (Fig. 2B). P1 nuclease sensitivity analyses confirm these findings (data not shown). The CCC → GGG alteration would make a triplex structure weaker, since three Hoogsteen pairing GGG residues on the purine-rich second strand have been altered to “CCC” (see “Discussion”). Polyvalent cations are known to favor triplexes at neutral pH (21Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer-Verlag, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar).

In view of the functional equivalence of the gene encoding C. elegans PC synthase 1, ce-pcs-1, to its homologs from plant and fungal sources, we have gone on to explore processes downstream of PC fabrication in this organism. Here we describe the identification of a half-molecule ATP-binding cassette transporter, CeHMT-1, from C. elegans with an equivalent topology to that of the putative PC transporter SpHMT-1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. At one level, CeHMT-1 satisfies the requirements of a Cd2+ tolerance factor involved in the sequestration and/or elimination of Cd·PC complexes. Heterologous expression of cehmt-1 in S. pombe alleviates the Cd2+-hypersensitivity of hmt– mutants concomitant with the localization of CeHMT-1 to the vacuolar membrane. Suppression of the expression of ce-hmt-1 in intact worms by RNA interference (RNAi) confers a Cd2+-hypersensitive phenotype similar to but more pronounced than that exhibited by ce-pcs-1 RNAi worms. At another level, it is evident from comparisons of the cell morphology of ce-hmt-1 and cepcs-1 single and double RNAi mutants that CeHMT-1 also contributes to Cd2+ tolerance in other ways. Whereas the intestinal epithelial cells of ce-pcs-1 RNAi worms undergo necrosis upon exposure to toxic levels of Cd2+, the corresponding cells of ce-hmt-1 RNAi worms instead elaborate punctate refractive inclusions within the vicinity of the nucleus. Moreover, a deficiency in CeHMT-1 does not interfere with the phenotype associated with CePCS-1 deficiency and vice versa. Double ce-hmt-1; ce-pcs-1 RNAi mutants exhibit both cell morphologies when exposed to Cd2+. These results and those from our previous investigations of the requirement for PC synthase for heavy metal tolerance in C. elegans demonstrate PC-dependent, HMT-1-mediated heavy metal detoxification not only in S. pombe but also in some invertebrates while at the same time indicating that the action of CeHMT-1 does not depend exclusively on PC synthesis.

Malaria is a major public health issue in many areas of the world, with Plasmodium falciparum being the causative agent of the most severe and deadliest form of this disease. Each year, 500 million new infections resulting in up to 2 million deaths and enormous economic damage (1Organization World Health World Health Organization Fact Sheet No. 94—Malaria. World Health Organization, Geneva2004Google Scholar) are attributed to this parasite. Drug resistance in P. falciparum has been aggravating the problem in many parts of the world during the last two decades, and new antimalarial agents addressing new targets are desperately needed. The protozoan parasite resides in erythrocytes of infected individuals during the asexual part of its life cycle. Recent studies indicated that hemoglobin degradation in a parasitic acidic organelle represents a major metabolic pathway and is crucial for survival of the parasite. Multiple proteinases appear to be actively involved in hemoglobin degradation (2Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, three members of a family of P. falciparum aspartic proteinases (PMI, 1The abbreviations used are: PM, plasmepsin; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Many of the identified molecules are peptidomimetic in nature, a compound class often associated with relatively low bioavailability and, importantly for use in developing countries, unfeasible due to significant cost of goods. We have discovered and subsequently optimized a new class of potent PMII inhibitors that could potentially overcome both these problems (8Boss C. Richard-Bildstein S. Weller T. Fischli W. Meyer S.

All attempts to model our achiral inhibitors into the active site of currently available structures of PMII or PMIV led to unsatisfactory results and were unable to explain the structure-activity relationship. As a result, studies of highly resolved structural information of relevant protein-inhibitor complexes were initiated. Presented here is a highly resolved structure of PMII inhibited by a potent non-peptidomimetic achiral inhibitor. This PMII-inhibitor complex reveals new features not yet observed in structures of aspartic proteinases, and it can serve as a starting point for structure-guided molecular design of novel compound classes with further optimized properties. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA encoding the last 48 residues of the pro-part and the whole mature sequence of P. falciparum plasmepsin II was cloned into the T7-dependent vector pET3a for expression (clone was obtained from C. Berry, Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK). Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and refolded as described by Hill et al. (16Hill J. Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with minor modifications to the protocol. The resulting soluble refolded protein was purified using a ligand affinity column, followed by size exclusion chromatography into 20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentrator for crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were obtained applying the hanging drop method using protein versus reservoir drop ratios of 2:1 and 3:1, respectively. Crystals were obtained with 25–30% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 0.3 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.0–6.0) after 2 weeks. Data were collected at the PX beamline at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using a structure of inhibited PMII (PDB code 1LF3). Data processing, structure solution, and refinement were performed with the program suite CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta. Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50 (Pt 5): 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). For manual rebuilding of the structure, the program Moloc (18Gerber P.R. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar was applied in there. A probe radius of 1.4 Å was used for calculations. Assay for Plasmepsin II—Proteolytic activity of plasmepsin II was determined in fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assays with a substrate purchased from Bachem (M-2120). Approximately 1 nm enzyme was incubated with 1 μm substrate at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 12.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 10% Me2SO. Enzyme activity was derived from the turnover rate of the substrate and monitored by the increase of the fluorescent signal over time. Fluorescence was determined with a FluoroStar Galaxy from BMG using excitation and emission filters of 355 and 520 nm, respectively. Test compounds were dissolved and diluted in 100% Me2SO. Inhibitory activity of the compounds was expressed as IC50, which represents the concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of the maximal (uninhibited) enzyme activity. IC50 values determined for published inhibitors corresponded well with the reported data. The x-ray crystal structure of mature wild type PMII inhibited by the potent (34 nm) non-peptidomimetic and achiral inhibitor 1 (Fig. 1) was solved at a resolution of 1.6 Å. All 329 amino acids of PMII were visible and could be built into electron density. The enzyme crystallized in space group P21 21 2 comprising one enzyme molecule in the asymmetric unit, an arrangement not seen in any of the structures of PMII published so far. A Ramachandran plot revealed that with the exception of two residues (Leu191 and Asn3), all amino acids were found in “most favored” or “allowed” regions. General Description of Structure—The overall architecture of the single enzyme molecule in the asymmetric unit compares well with structures inhibited by statine derivatives. A superposition with a structure of PMII inhibited by the prototypic peptidomimetic compound pepstatin A (PDB code 1SME) resulted in a root mean square deviation of 0.55 Å for 288 of 329 Cα atoms (Fig. 2). A significant difference in protein conformation was found in the region of a long β hairpin called “flap” (Lys72-Phe85) that was covering parts of the active site as well as the catalytically important aspartates. The complete absence of hydrogen bonds between the tightly bound inhibitor 1 and the flap, as well as diminished attractive hydrophobic interactions, allowed the flap to twist and lift its tip by 6 Å (Val78) to 9 Å (Ser79) compared with the structure of PDB code 1SME (Fig. 3). The highly conserved Tyr77 that was part of this flap was lifted up 4.6 Å (Cα) and rotated –120° around χ1, thereby losing a hydrogen bond contact with the indole NH of the highly conserved Trp41. The interaction between these two side chains was typically observed in structures of aspartic proteinases from eukaryotic sources that were inhibited by peptidomimetic inhibitors (e.g. pepstatin, PDB code 1SME). Compared with known structures of monomeric aspartic proteinases, the side chain of Trp41 was rotated –120° around χ1 and 180° around χ2, opening up a large, mostly hydrophobic pocket toward the core of the protein (Figs. 2 and 4). Such a concerted rearrangement was never observed in structures with peptidomimetic inhibitors. Similar movements have been described for structures of renin (20Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J.P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F. Wostl W. Chem.

Amino acid side chains in the active site that were not part of the flap superimpose well in our structure and the structure of PDB code 1SME, respectively, with the already mentioned exception of Trp41.Fig. 3Close up of the flap region of PMII (green) inhibited by 1 (inhibitor not shown) and PMII (PDB code 1SME, blue) inhibited by pepstatin (inhibitor not shown).

The piperidine moiety is engaged in a H-bond with the catalytic water, whereas the imidazole ring is involved in a H-bond contact with the outer oxygen of Asp214 (see also Fig. 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unexpectedly, the active site of each enzyme molecule hosted not just one but two inhibitor molecules (Fig. 5). One molecule was tightly bound and deeply buried in the reshaped active site of the proteinase and was most likely solely responsible for the high inhibitory potency. The second inhibitor experienced significantly less protein contact. It is noteworthy that this molecule is also in contact with amino acids Val239-Leu242 of a loop residing in a neighboring PMII proteinase (Fig. 5). Superposition of our new structure with a PMII-pepstatin A complex (PDB code 1SME) revealed that besides the newly created pocket, the more tightly bound “inner” inhibitor molecule also occupied subsites S1′, parts of S1 and S3, and the S5 pocket (21Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The second “outer” inhibitor molecule occupied the S2, S4, and the S6 pocket as well as space filled by the backbone of the peptidomimetic inhibitor and the tip of the flap in pepstatin A-inhibited PMII (1SME).Fig. 6PMII is represented as Cα backbone (green) with the catalytic aspartates (partially visible) shown in white. The catalytic water sitting between the two catalytic aspartates is depicted as a red ball. Inhibitor 1 (yellow) is located in the active site of the enzyme, with its n-pentyl chain filling a hydrophobic cavity prominently formed by a number of aromatic side chains. Superimposed is the prototypic peptidomimetic inhibitor pepstatin (PDB code 1SME, cyan). Note the very different occupation of space between these two types of inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specific Enzyme Inhibitor Interactions—As briefly mentioned in the previous section, relocation of side chains from Trp41 and Tyr77 in conjunction with a rise of significant parts of the flap (Fig. 3) opened up a new lengthy hydrophobic binding pocket that was predominantly shaped by side chains of Trp41, Phe111, and Tyr115 and limited at its far end by Pro43 (Fig. 6). This newly generated pocket, which allowed an unexpected binding mode of our inhibitors, was the main reason why we failed to understand the structure-activity relationship by using the pepstatin-inhibited structure of PDB code 1SME for our modeling studies. The pocket was tightly filled with the 4-pentyl-phenyl moiety of 1 (Fig. 4), with its aromatic ring being involved in two favorable “edge on face” contacts with the electron-rich side chains of Trp41 and Phe111, respectively. Additionally, this phenyl ring of the inhibitor was sandwiched between side chains of Met75 and Ile123, thereby experiencing significant loss of motional freedom. The n-pentyl chain was present in extended conformation and had ideal length and volume to optimally fill this newly created cylinder-shaped lipophilic pocket (Fig. 4). The atoms of this alkyl chain showed unusually low B-values, indicating very tight binding and strongly reduced motion. The tertiary amide moiety was rotated by 75° compared with the phenyl ring and, as such, was in an almost unstrained conformation. There was no direct hydrogen bond between enzyme and the amide carbonyl oxygen. However, there was a water molecule in ideal distance and geometry to form a H-bond, although without any further H-bond contact to the enzyme. The tertiary amide nitrogen was linked on one side to the central piperidine moiety and on the other side to the 4′-substituted biphenyl-methylene unit that occupied parts of the S1 and S3 pockets (Fig. 6). The proximal phenyl ring was in contact with side chains of Ile32 and Ile123, whereas the distal aromatic moiety touches side chains of Met15, Ile32, and Phe120. Side chains of Ile14, Met15, and Ser118 in collaboration with parts of the second inhibitor molecule tightly embraced the terminal 4′-methyl-acetate substituent, thereby diminishing its freedom of rotation. This was clearly reflected by well-defined electron density for the methyl-acetate group, with the exception of the ester methyl carbon. The amide-linked piperidine moiety of 1 was located “above” the two catalytic aspartates. This was in contrast to the situation described in Ref. 20Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J.P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F. Wostl W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, in which a protonated secondary amine of the piperidine ring forms two strong hydrogen bond contacts, one with each of the two catalytic aspartates. Such interactions were impossible for the N-substituted piperidine in 1 due to steric reasons. To overcome this lack of required space, the piperidine ring was lifted with the nitrogen moved up by 2.5 Å and C4 by 1 Å, respectively, compared with the structure described in Ref. 20Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J.P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F. Wostl W. Chem.

The tertiary amino group contacted the two aspartates indirectly via a very strong hydrogen bond to the catalytic water, which was not expelled from its position between the two carboxylates of the catalytic aspartates (Fig. 4). The water molecule in our structure superimposed very well with the nitrogen atom of the unsubstituted piperidine described in Ref. 20Oefner C. Binggeli A. Breu V. Bur D. Clozel J.P. D'Arcy A. Dorn A. Fischli W. Gruninger F. Guller R. Hirth G. Marki H. Mathews S. Muller M. Ridley R.G. Stadler H. Vieira E. Wilhelm M. Winkler F. Wostl W. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. (Structure PDB code 1PR8 was temporarily available from PDB but has been withdrawn recently for unknown reasons.) The 2-methylene-imidazole unit linked to the piperidine nitrogen occupied the S1′ pocket in an unstrained conformation, and its N1 participated in a hydrogen bond to the outer oxygen of Asp214 (Fig. 7). The second imidazole nitrogen was involved in a water-mediated contact to the alcoholic ester oxygen of the second inhibitor molecule. The second, or outer, inhibitor molecule ran in the opposite direction compared with the inner molecule, with piperidine rings touching terminal aromats of the biphenyl moiety in the opposite inhibitor (Fig. 5). The outer inhibitor mainly occupied the remaining space in the active site, with the biphenyl moiety located in the S2 pocket and compensating for the relocated Val74 at the tip of the flap that had been lifted. The methylene tether to the amide bond packed against the biphenyl unit of the inner inhibitor, thereby establishing attractive hydrophobic interactions. The amide carbonyl oxygen accepted a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH of Ser218, whereas the 4-pentyl-phenyl residue was mimicking part of the natural substrate backbone as well as partially filling the S6 pocket. The piperidine ring was located next to the relocated flap, with its nitrogen engaged in water-mediated contacts to the phenolic OH of Tyr77 and the hydroxy group of Thr114, respectively (Fig. 7). Using the software program XSAE (an unpublished program obtained from Dr. C. Broger, Hoffmann-La Roche), we calculated surface interactions for PMII hosting two inhibitor molecules and a neighboring enzyme molecule, respectively, to qualitatively judge individual interactions between inhibitors and enzyme(s). Note that different inhibitor conformations lead to slightly different total surfaces for the two inhibitors. Of a total surface of 979 Å2 of the buried inner inhibitor, the large majority (757 Å2) were covered by PMII, whereas only 501 of 956 Å2 of the outer inhibitor were in contact with this enzyme molecule. Some 125 Å2 of the outer inhibitor were shielded from solvent by a symmetry-related PMII molecule (Fig. 5). The two inhibitors covered 151 Å2 of each other's surface. The symmetry-related PMII molecule did not touch the inner inhibitor at all. Plasmepsins play an important role in hemoglobin degradation in Plasmodium parasites because they are supposed to perform initial cleavages before numerous other proteinases get involved in the degradation process. Recent knock-out studies have shown that none of the four proteinases (PMI–PMIV) is absolutely crucial for survival of the parasite (5Liu J. Gluzman I.Y. Drew M.E. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1432-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Omara-Opyene A.L. Moura P.A. Sulsona C.R. Bonilla J.A. Yowell C.A. Fujioka H. Fidock D.A. Dame J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54088-54096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, effective drugs must inhibit multiple plasmepsins to increase antimalarial effects and, at the same time, decrease the likelihood of resistance development. Designing compounds active against multiple enzymes with reasonable bioavailability and devoid of unwanted side effects is a difficult endeavor. It is therefore of great help if structural details of all target enzymes are known in atomic resolution. A number of x-ray structures of PMII and PMIV have been published (11Nezami A. Kimura T.

A. 1996; 93: 10034-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), but they were considered to be irrelevant for our purposes because we identified inhibitors with new topologies (8Boss C. Richard-Bildstein S. Weller T. Fischli W. Meyer S. Binkert C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 883-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that could not be reliably modeled into the active site of existing PMII structures. We therefore embarked on a project aimed at solving structures of relevant enzymes inhibited by our new compounds. We could obtain an x-ray structure of PMII complexed to a potent achiral inhibitor at 1.6 Å resolution, currently the highest resolved structure of this enzyme. Unexpectedly, we could locate not just one but two inhibitors with clearly defined electron density in the active site of one enzyme molecule. To our knowledge, this had not been observed thus far in structures of monomeric aspartic proteinases. However, two inhibitor molecules per active site could be localized in x-ray structures of homodimeric HIV-1 proteinase inhibited by a dithioketal derivative of haloperidol (23Rutenber E. Fauman E.B. Keenan R.J. Fong S. Furth P.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Meng E. Kuntz I.D. DeCamp D.L. Salto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15343-15346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By coincidence, in analogy to our compound 1, these inhibitors also comprised a N-substituted piperidine moiety with an additional substituent in position 4. Their binding modes in wild type and a Q7K mutant from HIV-1 were very different from each other, but in both cases, a halide anion was located near the protonated tertiary amino group. In neither of these two structures was the piperidine nitrogen found to be within hydrogen bond distance to either one of the catalytic aspartates. Inhibitory activity of these haloperidol derivatives was strongly dependent on the presence of halide anions in the assay solution, whereas in our system, no halide anions were required for inhibition of PMII. The finding of not just one but two clearly defined inhibitor molecules in the active site came rather unexpectedly. To estimate whether the second inhibitor was simply a “crystallization artifact” or must be considered part of the measured enzyme inhibition, we calculated enzyme-inhibitor surface interactions. Whereas the inner molecule was deeply buried, and more than 77% of its mostly hydrophobic surface was occluded from access to water, the outer molecule had only a total of 65% of its surface buried, including 13% covered by a neighboring enzyme molecule (Fig. 5). Assuming that nanomolar concentrated PMII in solution was not favoring such close interactions with a second enzyme molecule, as observed in the crystal structure, one would conclude that only 52% of the surface of the outer molecule was involved in enzyme-inhibitor interactions. This led to a difference o"

To examine the role of tRNA in amino acid activation more closely, several assays employing a tRNA analog in which the 2′-OH group at the 3′-terminal A76 nucleotide is replaced with hydrogen ( tRNA2′HGln) were developed. These experiments revealed a 104-fold reduction in kcat/Km in the presence of the analog, suggesting a direct catalytic role for tRNA in the activation reaction. The catalytic importance of the A76 2′-OH group in aminoacylation mirrors a similar role for this moiety that has recently been demonstrated during peptidyl transfer on the ribosome. Unexpectedly, tracking of Gln-AMP formation utilizing an α-32P-labeled ATP substrate in the presence of tRNA2′HGln showed that AMP accumulates 5-fold more rapidly than Gln-AMP. A cold-trapping experiment revealed that the nonenzymatic rate of Gln-AMP hydrolysis is too slow to account for the rapid AMP formation; hence, the hydrolysis of Gln-AMP to form glutamine and AMP must be directly catalyzed by the GlnRS⋅tRNA2′HGln complex. This hydrolysis of glutaminyl adenylate represents a novel reaction that is directly analogous to the pre-transfer editing hydrolysis of noncognate aminoacyl adenylates by editing synthetases such as isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.

https://openalex.org/W2000514089,"We report the identification of a natural antisense mRNA of hyaluronan synthase 2 that we have chosen to designate as HASNT (for HA synthase 2 antisense) in human and mouse. HASNT is transcribed from the opposite strand of the HAS2 gene locus and is represented by several independent expressed sequence tags in human. Portions of the mouse Hasnt gene were identified through an exon-trapping approach. Sequence conservation is extremely low between human and mouse HASNT, and it is not clear whether these mRNAs contain functional open reading frames. HASNT has an alternate splice site in both human and mouse. This splice site is located at an identical position within the gene in both species and results in mRNAs of two different lengths. In each species, the antisense portion of the HASNT gene is complementary to the first exon of HAS2, which represents the 5′-untranslated region. To study the biological activity of HASNT, two human expressed sequence tag clones, representing long and short HASNT splice variants, were cloned into a tetracycline-inducible vector and were stably transfected into human osteosarcoma U2-OS Tet-on cells. The long and short HASNT-expressing cells had a reduction in HAS2 mRNA levels up to 94 and 86%, respectively, whereas hyaluronan biosynthesis was inhibited by 40 and 37%, respectively. Cell proliferation was reduced throughout the time frame of the experiment. Exogenous high molecular mass hyaluronan failed to rescue the suppressed cell proliferation, whereas adenoviral-mediated overexpression of hyaluronan synthase 3, which stimulated endogenous hyaluronan biosynthesis, was able to rescue. Collectively, our data suggest that natural antisense mRNAs of HAS2 are able to regulate HAS2 mRNA levels and hyaluronan biosynthesis in a cell culture model system and may have an important and novel regulatory role in the control of HAS2, HA biosynthesis, and HA-dependent cell functions in vivo.

HA is both a common and necessary component of extracellular matrices within most vertebrate tissues (1Meyer K. Palmer J.W. J. Biol.

HA functions not only as a major structural component, but it can also regulate a variety of physiological and pathological functions, such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and metastatic spread of tumor cells (4Rilla K.

Mammalian HA is synthesized at the plasma membrane by one of three HA synthases (HASs), HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 (7Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 679-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that many cell types synthesize significant amounts of HA from an apparently minimal HAS2 mRNA pool (≤50 copies) (4Rilla K. Lammi M.J. Sironen R. Torronen K. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Hyttinen M. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of HAS mRNAs is correlated with HA biosynthesis. In general, it can be stated that expression of HAS mRNAs correlates with HA biosynthesis; high levels of HAS mRNAs are mirrored by high levels of HA biosynthesis (14Jacobson A. Brinck J. Briskin M.J. Spicer A.P. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Fulop A.S. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For instance, mouse cumulus cell oocyte complexes, isolated immediately after inducing an ovulatory cycle (at which time they do not synthesize HA), expressed no Has2 mRNA. When HA biosynthesis began ∼3–4 h later, however, Has2 mRNA was expressed at high levels (15Fulop A.S. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HAS2 expression can be stimulated by many growth factors and cytokines. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB is able to dramatically stimulate HA biosynthesis by normal human mesothelial cells (14Jacobson A. Brinck J. Briskin M.J. Spicer A.P. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This stimulation of HA biosynthesis corresponded closely with a rapid increase in HAS2 mRNA levels. Overall, studies suggest that HAS gene transcription represents the primary control mechanism that acts to regulate HA biosynthesis on a cellular level. It is not surprising, therefore, that reduction of the HAS2 copy number affects HA biosynthesis and HA-related cell functions, such as cell migration and proliferation (4Rilla K. Lammi M.J. Sironen R. Torronen K. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Hyttinen M. Pelkonen J. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the importance of HAS gene transcript levels to both HA biosynthesis and basic cellular functions. Despite recent progress in studies focused upon the differential expression of three mammalian HAS isoforms and identification of the respective promoter sequences, the molecular mechanisms that regulate HAS mRNA levels remain unclear. Gene structures and promoter sequences have now been identified for all three HAS genes (16Yamada Y. Itano N. Zako M. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Niim A. Ueda M. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W. Watson C.E. Liu C. Williams K.J. Werth V.P. Biochem.

Bowen T. Intern. J. Biochem. & Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1272-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The HAS2 and HAS3 genes are organized in a similar fashion, with the entire 5′-untranslated region encoded within the first exon. This gene organization has been maintained over at least 500 million years of evolution. The first exon of the Amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) has genes is composed of the entire 5′-untranslated region, whereas the remainder of the coding sequence is contained within one large exon. 2A. Spicer and R. Taft, unpublished data. Glucocorticoids induce a rapid and sustained, near-total suppression of HAS2 mRNA levels in osteosarcoma cells and dermal fibroblasts, mediated through substantial decreases in both gene transcription and HAS2 mRNA stability (17Zhang W. Watson C.E. Liu C. Williams K.J. Werth V.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β inhibited the HAS2 mRNA level in osteosarcoma and chondrocytes (12Recklies A.D. White C. Melching L. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Overall, several lines of evidence suggest that additional mechanisms may act in concert with changes in transcriptional activity to rapidly regulate HAS2 mRNA levels. Natural antisense RNAs are endogenous transcripts, which are complementary to mRNA sequences of known function, i.e. their sense sequences (19Vanhee-Brossollet C. Vaquero C. Gene. 1998; 211: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Natural antisense RNAs are capable of regulating prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression (19Vanhee-Brossollet C. Vaquero C. Gene. 1998; 211: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Knee R. Murphy P.R. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Brantl S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1575: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Natural antisense RNAs exert their regulatory effects at multiple levels, including transcription, RNA editing, post-transcription, and translation (22Farrel C.M. Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Tosic M. Roach A. de Rivaz J.C. Dolivo M. Matthieu J.M.

Hill V. Graham I.R. Neuromuscular Disorder. 2002; 12: 67-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By altering the expression of a particular gene, natural antisense RNAs regulate biological functions, such as development, viral infection, or adaptive responses (26Good L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antisense transcription is predicted to be abundant in the human and mouse genomes (27Shendure J. Church G.M. Genome Biology. 2002; 3: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Through analyses of the mouse genome sequence, computer searches have predicted the expression of over 2000 putative sense-antisense RNA pairs (28The FANTOM Consortium the RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phases I & II Team Nature. 2002; 420: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Many antisense RNAs are conserved among species, such as the c-myc antisense in human, bovine, and rodents (29Kindy M.S. McCormack J.E. Buckler A.J. Levine R.A. Sonensheim G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Nepveu A. Marcus K.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2859-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The wide distribution and conservation of endogenous antisense transcripts strongly suggest that antisense RNAs are not accidental and may play a general regulatory role in gene expression in many higher eukaryotes, including mammals. In our current investigation, we have discovered natural antisense mRNAs of human and mouse HAS2 that are transcribed from the opposite strand of the HAS2 gene locus. We have chosen to designate these natural HAS2 antisense genes as HASNT. We have demonstrated herein that HASNT mRNAs reduce HAS2 mRNA levels and HA biosynthesis in HASNT-transfected cells. Our data suggest that HASNT is a novel and important mechanism in the regulation of HAS2 mRNA levels, HAS2-associated HA biosynthesis and HA-related biological functions in vivo. Data Base Searches—Nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST searches were performed of the human and mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases using the full-length human and mouse HAS2 cDNA sequences and partial genomic sequences. Candidate ESTs were used to screen the EST data base in an effort to extend sequences through creation of a contig of overlapping EST sequences. Putative polypeptide sequences were also searched against the protein data base using standard search parameters with suppression of the low complexity filter. Additional data bases that were used include the University of Santa Cruz Genome Site and the Ensembl site. Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Real time PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Tetracycline-inducible pTRE2hyg plasmid vector, doxycycline, geneticin (G418), and hygromycin were purchased from BD Biociences. pCIneo plasmid vector was purchased from Promega Corporation (Los Altos, CA). [3H]acetic acid (4.7 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HASNT EST clones, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, McCoy's 5A medium, fetal bovine serum, L-glutamax, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. All other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, BD Biosciences, or Ambion (Austin, TX). Cell Culture—SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney, COS-1, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 5 mm L-glutamax and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. The U2-OS Tet-on osteosarcoma cell line was purchased from BD Biosciences. These cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 μg/ml geneticin (G418) (active constituent). L, S-HASNT/pTRE2hyg, and pTRE2hyg vector plasmid-transfected cells were selected in McCoy's 5A medium containing 100 μg/ml geneticin (G418) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin. Stably transfected cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium with 100 μg/ml geneticin (G418) and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. All experiments using stably transfected U2-OS cells were performed in the absence of antibiotics, except 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Plasmid Construction—Exon-trapping vectors were prepared by forced blunt ligation of genomic restriction fragments of the mouse Has2 gene into the unique BbsI restriction endonuclease site that is located within the chimeric intron of the pCIneo expression vector (Promega Corporation). Insert orientation was determined through a combination of restriction mapping and automated DNA sequencing. Human HASNT cDNAs were amplified from EST-derived plasmid DNAs by PCR using oligonucleotides that incorporate flanking BamHI and NheI restriction sites. Resultant HASNT cDNAs were inserted into the pTRE2hyg vector via the BamHI/NheI restriction sites. Nucleotide sequences of HASNT EST cDNA clones and inserts of HASNT/pTRE2hyg plasmid constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Exon Trapping in COS-1 Cells—Genomic restriction fragments derived from previously identified mouse Has2 genomic clones (7Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were ligated into the BbsI site of the general purpose expression vector pCIneo. This site is located within the chimeric intron that is positioned between the transcription start site and the multiple cloning site of the plasmid. Resultant plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells growing in 10-cm cell culture dishes using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNAs were isolated from transfected cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Reverse-transcription PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNA from each sample, as described previously (32Spicer A.P. Seldin M.F. Gendler S.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3079-3091PubMed Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotide primers made according to the sequence of the pCIneo vector: forward (PCR only), 5′-GGTAGCCTTGCAGAAGTTGGTCGT-3′; reverse (RT and PCR), 5′-CACTGCATTCTAGTTGTGGTTTGTC-3′. Prior to reverse transcription, reactions were treated with 10 units of DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min at 95 °C to destroy plasmid DNAs that might have co-purified with the total RNAs. PCR reactions proceeded through 30 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and were completed with a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV illumination. Amplified fragments were gel-purified (Qiagen gel extraction kit) and directly cloned through TOPO cloning using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Resultant plasmid DNAs were sequenced using automated DNA sequencing, and the sequences of putative exons were determined. To map the position of putative exons relative to each other, DNA sequencing, restriction mapping, and PCR amplifications were performed utilizing cloned genomic DNA fragments as the templates. Northern Blot—A human multiple tissue Northern blot membrane was purchased from BD Biosciences. The probe for human HASNT was unique to HASNT and represented a portion of the first exon and all of the third HASNT exon shown in Fig. 2. Hybridization and washing conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer. The HASNT blot was exposed to film (Biomax MR) for 8 days at –80 °C with two intensifier screens. The blot was then stripped and rehybridized with a human HAS2 cDNA probe, representing the open reading frame (ORF) only. Reverse Transcription-PCR of Human HASNT—Total RNAs were isolated from individual clones using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using human HASNT-specific reverse primer. This reverse primer would only anneal to HASNT mRNAs and would not reverse transcribe HAS2 cDNAs. The reverse transcription was performed using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42 °C for 1 h. Two-hundred nanograms of total RNA were used to amplify a partial human HASNT cDNA by PCR using human HASNT-specific forward and reverse primers. The human HASNT-specific primers were: forward, 5′-GGATCC-TGGCCCGATCTTTCTGC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCTAGC-CTTAAGTTGGAGGAGGCAGAAG-3′. The primers possessed BamHI and NheI restriction endonuclease sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends to facilitate additional cloning experiments. These primers would only amplify a human HASNT cDNA corresponding to Long-HASNT (L-HASNT). Furthermore, these primers were designed such that they would not amplify sequences from total genomic DNA nor HAS2 cDNAs under the PCR conditions that were used. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 5 min at 72 °C. Preparation of Stable Transfectants Expressing Antisense RNA to HAS2—U2-OS cells were transfected with pTRE2hyg/L-HASNT, pTRE2hyg/S-HASNT and pTRE2hyg vector, respectively. Transfection was performed using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Transfected cells were subjected to limiting dilution and were plated in 96-well plates. All transfectants were selected through 4–6 weeks of antibiotic selection in 400 μg/ml geneticin and 300 μg/ml hygromycin until cell growth was stable. Stable transfectants were maintained in the parental medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml geneticin and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation assays were performed using the MTT cell proliferation kit (Roche Applied Science) (33Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated for each cell clone. Cells were synchronized by culture in fetal bovine serum-free medium for 72 h. Cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer. Two thousand cells in 100 μl of McCoy 5A medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and doxycycline (2 μg/ml), of individual L-, S-HASNT, and Vec-only clones, were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured for 1–5 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Ten microliters of MTT reagent were added to the wells every 24 h during the experimental period and then incubated exactly for another 4 h before adding 100 μl of lysis buffer. After adding lysis buffer, the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the absorbances at A590 were measured in a multiwell spectrophotometer, and the cell numbers were calculated based on individual standard curves. Cell Adhesion Assay—Two-hundred thousand cells were seeded onto 10-cm cell culture plates. Cells were incubated for 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing three times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Adherent cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. The experiments were repeated six times. Quantitative Analysis of HAS2 Expression—Total RNAs were isolated from individual clones using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Relative expression levels of HAS2 were determined by quantitative real time PCR. Gene-specific primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) and were as follows: forward, 5′-TCATGCTTTTGACGCTGTATGTAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAAGCACCATGTCATATTGTTGTC-3′ (IDT, Coralville, IA); and probe, 5′-FAM-(CCAATAGCATGCATAGAGCAACGTTCCA)-TAMRA-3′ (Biosearch Technologies, Inc. Novato, CA). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to first strand cDNA by incubating with random hexamer and M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 45 °C for 1 h. Two-hundred nanograms of total RNA were used for real time PCR. The TaqMan® real time PCR reaction conditions were: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 min and at 60 °C for 10 min. The TaqMan® real time PCR was performed in an ABI Prism® 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed by SDS software version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications of β-actin, which was used as the internal control for normalization, were performed using the β-actin detection reagent (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves for HAS2 and β-actin were generated by serial dilution of U2-OS total RNA. Data were discarded if the amplification efficiency was below 80%. Metabolic HA Biosynthesis Assay—HA synthesis was detected by labeling HA with [3H]acetic acid (34Spicer A.P. Iozzo Renato V. Proteoglycan Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology. 171. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey2001: 378-379Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 10-cm plates at 25% confluence in medium containing 1.5 μg doxycycline/ml and 100 μCi [3H]acetic acid/ml and cultured for 48 h. Cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer. HA in the culture medium, on the cell surface, and inside cells was pooled together. Three volumes of 1.3% potassium acetate/95% ethanol were added to each sample and incubated overnight at –20 °C to precipitate macromolecules. Precipitates were resuspended in 5 ml of 0.5% (w/v) protease XIV (Sigma) solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and incubated overnight at 37 °C on a rocking platform. Samples were precipitated again with 3 volumes of 1.3% potassium acetate/95% ethanol. Precipitates were resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. One-half of each sample was digested with 20 turbidity reducing units of streptomyces hyaluronate lyase (Sigma) in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 60 °C overnight. HA was precipitated using 125 μl of 12% cetyl pyridinium chloride (CEPC) solution and washed in 500 μl of 0.05% CEPC/50 mm NaCl. Final pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of methanol and counted in the 2500TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). HAS3 Adenovirus Infection—Cells were seeded at 20% confluence in 10-cm cell culture dishes in culture medium with 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline. When cells reached 40–45% confluence, the monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then mouse HAS3 adenovirus 3J. Y. Tien, W. Huang, and A. Spicer, manuscript in preparation. was added to each culture dish. The multiplicity of infection was between 500 and 1000 optical plaque units/cell. The monolayers were cultured in the presence of adenovirus at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for another 2 h, and then fresh culture medium was added to each culture dish. The cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, for another 72 h before being assayed. Cell Proliferation Rescue Assays—The cell proliferation assays for HA rescue were performed as mentioned above, except that the medium contained 100 μg/ml high molecular weight HA (Fisher). Cell proliferation assays for HAS3 rescue were performed using the HAS3 adenovirus-infected HASNT cells, prepared as mentioned above. Discovery of Natural Antisense mRNAs of HAS2 (HASNT)— Data base searches using the complete published cDNA sequence for human and mouse HAS2 identified several EST clones (Fig. 1A) that shared sequence identity with the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of human HAS2 (Fig. 1B). Many of these clones were oriented in a direction consistent with their transcription from the opposite strand of the HAS2 locus, representing putative cis-encoded natural antisense mRNAs of HAS2. Through additional data base searches, a total sequence of 1.6 kbp (Fig. 1B) was derived for the human transcript, which was split into 4 exons, all of which were flanked by a consensus splice acceptor and donor sequences (Figs. 1 and 2). The 1.6-kbp cDNA was initially assembled in silico from overlapping EST sequences and then confirmed as being part of a contiguous mRNA using RT-PCR (data not shown). A short ORF was predicted within the human sequence, although the functionality of this ORF remains unclear to date. The predicted polypeptide had no sequence identity to any other polypeptide sequence and was not conserved with any predicted polypeptide generated from the derived mouse sequence. Although we have been able to verify the 1.6-kbp cDNA sequence for human HASNT using RT-PCR, all efforts to determine the true transcription start site(s) of this transcript have failed to date. Based upon our RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, and Northern analyses, HASNT represents an extremely rare transcript. We have screened two cDNA libraries without success and have made multiple attempts at 5′-RACE and primer extensions to determine the true transcription start site for HASNT. In the absence of complete sequence information and the confirmed presence or identity of a functional ORF, we have assigned this gene the name HASNT. Four exons were identified. The four HASNT exons were distributed as follows with respect to the previously described HAS2 gene structure. One HASNT exon was encoded by sequences located within intron 1 of HAS2, one exon was complementary to a portion of HAS2 exon 1, and two HASNT exons were encoded by sequences located within the proximal promoter region for HAS2 (Fig. 2). An alternate splice site was identified, which resulted in alternate mRNAs with long (L) and short (S) antisense regions. Long (L)-HASNT, represented by image clone 5171029 (GenBank™ accession number BI829151), has 257 nucleotides of perfect complementary sequence to a region starting ∼70 bp from the presumed transcription start site of human HAS2 (accession number AJ604570), whereas Short (S)-HASNT, represented by im"

We now report that MIF promotes the activation of the canonical ERK MAPK cascade and cyclin D1 expression by stimulating the activity of the Rho GTPase and downstream signaling to stress fiber formation. Rho-dependent stress fiber accumulation promotes the sustained activation of ERK and subsequent cyclin D1 expression during G1-S phase cell cycle progression. This pathway is reported to be dependent upon myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, integrin clustering, and subsequent activation of focal adhesion kinase, leading to sustained MAPK activity. Our studies reveal that recombinant MIF induces cyclin D1 expression in a Rho-, Rho kinase-, MLC kinase-, and ERK-dependent manner in asynchronous NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Moreover, MIF–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts display aberrant cyclin D1 expression that is linked to defective Rho activity, stress fiber formation, and MLC phosphorylation. These results suggest that MIF is an integral autocrine mediator of Rho GTPase-dependent signaling events and provide mechanistic insight into how MIF regulates proliferative, migratory, and oncogenic processes.

Despite being one of the earliest cytokines discovered, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 1The abbreviations used are: MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; rMIF, recombinant MIF; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin; RBD, rhotekin binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SRF, serum response factor; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; rMIF, recombinant MIF; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; HA, hemagglutinin; RBD, rhotekin binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SRF, serum response factor; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. is arguably the least understood. MIF has been shown to exert effects on a variety of cell types and influence the regulatory functions of many diverse biological processes. These include inflammation, immune regulation, physiologic and pathophysiologic neovascularization, and cell replication (1Calandra T. Roger T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 2Baugh J.A. Bucala R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S27-S35Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Mitchell R.A. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This broad array of effects of MIF on cellular functions is difficult to understand. Perhaps one unifying interpretation might be that MIF is elaborated in response to tissue wounding. MIF affects both ends of the complex cascade of reactions caused by injury, from inflammation to reparative cell replication. In this same vein, MIF production following growth factor or extracellular matrix stimulation would also be in accord with its involvement in cell replication. In the case of neoplastic cells, internal (oncogenic) or external (growth factors, extracellular matrix) signals could serve to increase MIF production that, in turn, may facilitate anchorage independence and loss of contact inhibition.Our previous studies have established that MIF, a protein historically associated with inflammation and immune regulation, stimulates the proliferation of mouse fibroblasts (4Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This response is associated with the activation of the p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPKs. We further demonstrated that growth factors stimulate the rapid release of preformed MIF from adherent, quiescent fibroblasts. Importantly, the sustained activation of MAPK in serum-stimulated fibroblasts is dependent upon MIF autocrine action (4Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar).In addition to the discovery that MIF participates in growth factor signaling to ERK, we recently completed a study that describes a critical role for MIF in the modulation of adhesion-dependent activation of ERK, also in a sustained fashion (5Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding is particularly important in light of the fact that both growth factors and adhesion are required for efficient signaling to sustained ERK activation and subsequent cell cycle progression (6Roovers K. Davey G. Zhu X. Bottazzi M.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The requirement for sustained ERK activity in growth factor plus adhesion-dependent cell cycle control is now known to be at the level of cyclin D1 transcription and the subsequent activation of specific cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (7Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The regulation of G1 phase progression relies on cyclins, Cdks, and Cdk inhibitors (10Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar, 11Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2579) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor, which in turn releases free E2F transcription factors, resulting in the transcription of critical S phase enzymes and regulators (12Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar).A central role for RhoA GTPase in modulating sustained ERK activation and cyclin D1 expression in fibroblasts was recently described (7Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho by integrins and growth factors is essential for modulating the sustained activation of ERK and subsequent cyclin D1 transcription (7Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rho is also responsible for maintaining the correct timing of cyclin D1 expression in mid G1 phase of the cell cycle, in part by negatively regulating Rac1 activity (13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed that Rho-dependent Rho kinase activation contributes to adhesion/growth factor-dependent regulation of sustained ERK MAPK activity by promoting the formation of stress fibers and the consequent recruitment and clustering of integrins, leading to focal adhesion formation (13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this model, Rho, Rho kinase, and myosin light chain kinase enhance stress fiber formation/integrin clustering and, hence, the sustained activation of the canonical Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and ERK MAPK pathway.We now report that MIF positively induces cyclin D1 expression through a pathway dependent upon the activities of Rho and Rho kinase and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain. Moreover, this MIF-mediated pathway of activation results in the sustained stimulation of ERK MAPKs, leading to efficient cyclin D1 transcription and Rb inactivation. These findings are the first to demonstrate a requirement for Rho GTPase family members in the regulation of MIF-dependent cell cycle regulation and provide a long sought after link between MIF and its downstream signaling effectors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Drug Treatment—MIF–/– mice and their wild-type littermates were maintained on a mixed 129Sv × C57Bl/6 background (F3). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from embryos at day 14.5 and grown in DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics (5Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in low glucose DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics. For recombinant MIF (15Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) stimulation and inhibitor studies, NIH 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/6-cm plate and allowed to grow for 48–72 h in low glucose DMEM with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Without a medium change, the cells were then treated with either 10 μm ML-7 (Biomol), 10 μm Y27632 (EMD Biosciences), or 50 μm U0126 (Promega). After incubation with the specified inhibitor for 30 min, recombinant MIF (rMIF) was added at 50 ng/ml unless otherwise specified. For transient transfection experiments, NIH 3T3 cells were plated as above, and 24 h later, cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of either pcDNA3.1 GS or pcDNA3.1 GS/MIF using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (5Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar).For cell proliferation experiments, 1 × 104 NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated in each well of a 96-well plate in 0.5% serum containing low glucose media for 48 h. Without a media change, cells were treated with either 10 μm ML-7, 10 μm Y27632, or 50 μm U0126. After incubation with the specified inhibitor for 30 min, rMIF was added at 50 ng/ml and allowed to sit for 30 h. 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well for an additional 4 h, at which time the cells were harvested and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Packard Instrument Co.).For Rho inactivation experiments, pEXV-RhoN19 or pEXV vector alone were transfected into 1 × 105 NIH 3T3 cells/well of a 6-well plate at 4 μg/well using Fugene 6. rMIF was added to transfected cells 48 h later as indicated.For adhesion/growth factor induction of Rho activation assays, 2 × 106 MIF+/+ or MIF–/– p53H175 immortalized fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h. Cells were lifted and plated onto 10-cm fibronectincoated dishes (BD Biosciences) in the presence of 10% FCS for the indicated times.Immunoblotting Studies—Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells after the indicated treatments for the indicated times. Cells first were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (containing 1 mm NaVO4, 2 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. After microcentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min (4 °C), the supernatants were removed, and equal amounts of cellular proteins were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Immunoblotting was performed with antibodies directed against phospho-ERK MAPK, phospho-MLC (Cell Signaling Technology), cyclin D1, Cdk4, Myc epitope 9E10, HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and phospho-FAK (Tyr397) (BIOSOURCE International). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using Scion Image software.Rho GTPase Activity Assay—The rhotekin binding domain (RBD) and PAK binding domain-GST plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina). The plasmids were transformed into BL-21 Escherichia coli, and GST-PAK binding domain (for Rac1 and Cdc42) and GST-RBD (for Rho) were purified as described (17Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For active (GTP-loaded) Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 assays, ∼2 × 106 cells/sample were lysed in 10-cm dishes with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 300–500 μg of lysate/sample was incubated with 60 μlofa50% slurry of GST-RBD beads or 30 μl of GST-PAK binding domain beads pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After rotating for 30 min at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed once in lysis buffer, and released by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA GTP determination and total Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA from lysates were assessed by Western blot analyses using RhoA, Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) antibodies.Fluorescence Microscopy—5 × 104 cells/ml were plated onto fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) chamber slides (BD Biosciences) for 2 h, washed, and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing and permeabilization, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 h. After staining, cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with Vectastain (Vector Laboratories), and observed/photographed by fluorescence microscopy at ×20 magnification (Nikon).Luciferase Promoter Assays—NIH 3T3 or MIF+/+ and MIF–/– p53H175 immortalized cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/ml onto 24-well dishes. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of either serum response factor (SRF)-TA-Luc-, pRb-TA-Luc- (Clontech), or –1745 CD1-Luc- (a generous gift of Dr. Richard Pestell (Georgetown University)) sensitive luciferase promoter constructs using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 0.1 μg of Renilla pRL-null vector (Promega) was co-transfected with each of the above vectors. In some cases, pK.HA vector alone, pK.HA CPI-17 (18Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (generous gifts of Dr. Masumi Eto (University of Virginia)), pEXV alone, or pEXV RhoV14 (19Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) was co-transfected along with luciferase plasmids at 1 μg. Luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) on a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). For expression analysis of HA-tagged CPI-17, parallel samples were transfected in duplicate with pK.HA alone or pK.HA CPI-17, and lysates were assessed for HA expression by immunoblotting.Retroviral Plasmid Constructs and Infections—The p53H175 (a gift of Dr. Oleksi Petrenko, SUNY Stonybrook, Stonybrook, NY) retroviral expression vector is described elsewhere (20Petrenko O. Fingerle-Rowson G. Peng T. Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 105 fibroblasts were infected with the indicated retroviral supernatants for 24 h, washed, and refed normal media for the indicated times postinfection. The expression of p53H175 in primary fibroblasts resulted in efficient immortalization of both MIF+/+ and MIF–/– cells as evidenced by passaging for greater than 25 times with no evidence of cell senescence.RESULTSExogenously Added Recombinant and Ectopically Expressed MIF Induce Cyclin D1 Expression in Fibroblasts—Our previous studies revealed that both endogenous and exogenously added rMIF induce the sustained activation of ERK MAPK in NIH 3T3 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (4Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 5Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have additionally found that MIF-deficient cells display defective growth factor/adhesion-induced sustained ERK activation, leading to cyclin D1 expression, Rb inactivation, and S phase cell cycle progression (5Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, very little is known about how proximal signaling by extracellular MIF promotes the sustained activation of ERK, leading to cyclin D1 expression.To determine whether exposure of cells to exogenously added recombinant MIF was sufficient to induce cyclin D1 transcription/translation that is reportedly linked to the sustained activation of ERK (7Welsh C.F.

As shown in Fig. 1A, cyclin D1 protein expression was dose-dependently induced by treatment with rMIF. To verify this finding and to determine whether forced overexpression of MIF was also capable of inducing cyclin D1 expression, MIF was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1B, a transiently transfected MIF mammalian expression plasmid (16Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) dose-dependently induced the expression of cyclin D1 (top panel) concordant with increased intra- and extracellular expression of MIF (data not shown).Because the sustained activation of ERK promotes the expression of cyclin D1 through a transcription-dependent process (7Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 8Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), we then determined whether transfection of MIF was capable of driving the expression of a well characterized cyclin D1 promoter-linked luciferase reporter plasmid (21Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with an MIF-expressing plasmid and a luciferase plasmid driven by a 1,745-nucleotide region of the human cyclin D1 promoter (21Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) revealed that cyclin D1 promoter activity is increased almost 4-fold above the vector control at the highest concentration of MIF plasmid used (Fig. 1B). This finding strongly suggests that the increased expression of cyclin D1 observed with both rMIF and ectopically expressed MIF is due to enhanced transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter.MIF Activates RhoA, Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation, and ERK MAPK—Recent studies describe a link between Rho GTPase-dependent activation of ERK MAPK, cyclin D1 expression, and G1/S phase cell cycle progression in fibroblasts (7Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because we hypothesized that MIF-dependent cyclin D1 expression is linked to its ability to stimulate ERK activity, we examined the possibility that MIF may act to promote ERK activation and cyclin D1 expression by stimulating Rho GTPase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, recombinant MIF induces Rho GTP accumulation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts concomitant with its activation of ERK MAPK. Notably, we were unable to detect any effect of modulating levels of MIF on the activation states of either Rac1 or Cdc42 GTPases in mesenchymal cells (data not shown).Fig. 2Activation by rMIF of Rho GTPase, MAPK, and MLC phosphorylation.A, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated onto 10-cm dishes as in A. rMIF was added at the indicated concentrations for 2 h. 500-μg normalized samples were incubated with GST-RBD beads, and pull-down was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibody (Rho GTP). Remaining lysates were normalized and analyzed for total Rho protein, phospho-MAPK, and phospho-MLC (Thr18/Ser19) by Western blotting. B, results shown represent relative densities obtained from an autoradiogram by Scion Image of Rho GTP over total Rho for each sample and are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Roovers and Assoian (13Roovers K.

Rho kinase has previously been linked to enhanced myosin light chain phosphorylation and subsequent stress fiber formation by two distinct mechanisms. The first involves a direct Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MLC (22Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), and the second requires a Rho kinase-dependent inactivating phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) (23Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, enhanced phosphorylation of MLC is thought to lead to stress fiber formation, enhanced integrin clustering, and the subsequent focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent sustained activation of ERK MAPK (13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether MIF-induced Rho-GTPase activation results in enhanced myosin light chain phosphorylation, immunoblot analysis of MLC using phosphorylation-specific antibodies revealed that MLC phosphorylation increases in direct proportion to the MIF-induced stimulation of GTP-bound Rho (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that MIF induces ERK activation concomitant with Rho GTPase activation and enhanced myosin light chain phosphorylation.Inhibition of Rho, Rho Kinase, Myosin Light Chain Kinase, and MEK1 Prevents the Induction of MAPK, Cyclin D1, and DNA Synthesis by MIF in NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts—To investigate in more detail the precise requirements for this hypothesized pathway of cyclin D1 expression induced by MIF, we next sought to inhibit the key enzymes thought to be involved in this pathway. Because we hypothesize that MIF-dependent induction of cyclin D1 expression in fibroblasts is reliant upon sustained ERK MAPK activation, a well characterized inhibitor of the upstream activator of ERK1/2 was used. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, prevented the induction of cyclin D1 expression by MIF.Fig. 3Preferential inhibition of MEK1, myosin light chain kinase, Rho kinase, or Rho blocks MIF-induced MAPK activation, cyclin D1 expression, and cell proliferation. 3 days prior to the experiment, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated as in Fig. 1. On the third day after plating, U0126 (A) ML-7 (B), or Y27632 (C) was added at 10 μm, or 0.1% Me2SO was added as a vehicle control. 30 min later, recombinant MIF was added to cells at 50 ng/ml and allowed to incubate overnight. D, 2 days after plating, 4 μg of either pEXV plasmid alone or pEXV-RhoN19 were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells for 30 h, at which time rMIF was added at 50 ng/ml and allowed to incubate overnight. Lysates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and normalized samples were analyzed for the indicated proteins or phosphoproteins by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E, NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 0.5% FCS media, and 2 days later inhibitors were added as indicated for 30 min prior to the addition of 50 ng/ml rMIF. 30 h later, cells were pulsed for 4 h with [3H]thymidine, cells were harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Data shown for A–C are representative of at least two independent experiments, and data shown for D are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As mentioned above, one pathway by which Rho could promote signaling to ERK, leading to cyclin D1 expression, is through the inactivation of MLCP by Rho kinase (13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 24Roovers K. Klein E.A. Castagnino P. Assoian R.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 273-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The net result of MLCP inactivation by Rho kinase would be an enhancement of steady state MLC phosphorylation that is dependent upon myosin light chain kinase activity (13Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4283-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase could prevent MIF-mediated FAK and ERK activation, leading to cyclin D1 expression. As depicted in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of cells with the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7, blocked the induction/activation of these proposed MIF effectors, suggesting a strict requirement for MLC-dependent stress fiber formation and subsequent FAK activation in carrying out MIF signaling to cyclin D1 expression.To verify the importance of Rho kinase as a mediator of MIF-stimulated signaling to focal adhesion formation, sustained MAPK activation, and cyclin D1 expression, the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632, was tested for its ability to block MIF signaling events. As shown in Fig. 3C, inhibition of Rho kinase blocks MIF-induced MLC phosphorylation, FAK phosphorylation, and sustained ERK activation and, to a slightly lesser extent, inhibits the relative -fold induction of cyclin D1 induced by MIF. Finally, to verify that RhoA itself was required for MIF-mediated signaling to cyclin D1 expression, forced overexpression of RhoN19 was found to very effectively block the ability of exogenously added rMIF to induce MLC, FAK, and ERK MAPK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression. Together, these findings indicate that Rho, Rho kinase, MLC kinase, and ERK MAPK are all part of an MIF-induced signaling program that serves to enhance cyclin D1 expression"

https://openalex.org/W2053073622,"Glycogen metabolism has been the subject of extensive research, but the mechanisms by which it is regulated are still not fully understood. It is well accepted that the rate-limiting enzymes in glycogenesis and glycogenolysis are glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GPh), respectively.

Although the primary factors involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus are still unknown, it is clear that insulin resistance of skeletal muscle glucose metabolism plays a key role.

J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1998; 9: 255-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Damsbo P. Vaag A. Hother-Nielsen O. Beck-Nielsen H. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, since the mechanisms involved in muscle GS activation are still not fully understood, the defective steps in type 2 diabetic subjects have remained unidentified. A better understanding of skeletal muscle glycogen metabolism is needed to understand the primary factors involved in the development of the disease and to identify targets for new therapeutic strategies. The rate-limiting enzymes in glycogenesis and glycogenolysis are considered to be GS and glycogen phosphorylase (GPh), respectively. Both enzymes are regulated by reversible phosphorylation and by allosteric effectors. In vivo, nine GS sites susceptible to phosphorylation have been identified, which are phosphorylated by different protein kinases. In rabbit skeletal muscle GS, two sites (2 and 2a) are located near the N terminus, whereas the remaining seven (sites 3a-c, 4, 5, 1a, and 1b) are located within 100 residues of the C terminus. Phosphorylations at different sites have different effects on the enzyme activity. The most important sites involved in GS intrinsic activity regulation are 2, 2a, 3a, and 3b. Dephosphorylation of these sites increases GS activity much more than dephosphorylation of the remaining sites, which have little or no effect on the enzyme activity (3Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of protein kinases have been identified that can phosphorylate GS, including glycogen synthase kinase 3, casein kinases 1 and 2, protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and AMP-activated protein kinase (for review see Ref. 4Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of hierarchal phosphorylation of the N-terminal and C-terminal sites have been described. Phosphorylation of site 2 creates a recognition motif for casein kinase 1 to phosphorylate site 2a (5Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of site 5 by casein kinase 2 is a prerequisite for glycogen synthase kinase 3 to sequentially phosphorylate sites 4, 3c, 3b, and 3a (6Roach P.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Covalent regulation of GS by phosphorylation is complex and still not fully understood. The binding of the allosteric activator glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) reverses inactivation of GS by phosphorylation (7Rothman-Denes L. Cabib E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and increases the susceptibility of the enzyme to dephosphorylation by GS phosphatases (8Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GPh is regulated by reversible phosphorylation at Ser14 by phosphorylase kinase, resulting in activation of the enzyme. GPh is also subject to allosteric regulation, mainly by AMP (9Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 31-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the multiple GS sites and GPh Ser14 is mainly catalyzed by the glycogen-associated phosphatases of type 1 (10Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated forms of GS and the phosphorylated form of GPh are active in absence of the allosteric activators, Glc-6-P and AMP, respectively. Therefore, the ratio of the activities in the presence and absence of the allosteric activator is a useful measure of the phosphorylation state for both enzymes. Already in the 1960s, glycogen was proposed to be present in dynamic cellular organelles that were termed glycosomas (11Himes M. Pollister A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 175-185Crossref Google Scholar) but to date no such cellular entities have been clearly defined. Nevertheless, increasing evidence in the literature supports the concept of compartmentalized glycogen metabolism. In skeletal muscle, a fraction of glycogen particles have been found to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (12Entman M.L. Goldstein M.A. Schwartz A. Life Sci. 1976; 19: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Friden J. Seger J. Ekblom B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 135: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two glycogen fractions have been described that differ in molecular weight and protein content. Mature glycogen particles were termed macroglycogen, whereas smaller glycogen particles, detected as an intermediate product of macroglycogen, were termed proglycogen (14Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Structural differences between the free and the SR-associated glycogen particles have been reported (15Wanson J.C. Drochmans P. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 130-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which could be explained by differences in the proportions of proglycogen and macroglycogen. However, whether glycogen particles have different metabolic functions or are metabolized in different ways depending on their composition or intracellular localization is still not clear. Glycogen-protein and protein-protein interactions play an important role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism (for review see Refs 16Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). 95% protein content in glycogen particles comprises GS, GPh, debranching enzyme, and phosphorylase kinase (18Cohen P. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1978; 14: 117-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle at rest, GS is mainly found associated with glycogen particles (19Bergamini C. Buv H. Morange M. FEBS Lett. 1977; 81: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Calder P.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1335-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and myofibrils (21Lane R.D. Hegazy M.G. Reimann E.M. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 961-970PubMed Google Scholar). In three different cultured cell types, muscle GS translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol in response to glucose (22Ferrer J. Baque S. Guinovart J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in fully differentiated rat skeletal muscle, GS translocates from a glycogen-enriched to an actin-enriched fraction in response to glycogen depletion induced by muscle contraction (23Nielsen J. Derave W. Kristiansen S. Ralston E. Ploug T. Richter E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 757-769Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For an efficient start of glycogen resynthesis, GS needs to associate with glycogenin (24Pitcher J. Smythe C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the initiator protein of glycogen synthesis. Both of these proteins have been reported to be associated with the actin cytoskeleton (23Nielsen J. Derave W. Kristiansen S. Ralston E. Ploug T. Richter E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 757-769Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Baque S. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GPh, on the other hand, has been found associated to SR (26Entman M. Keslensky S. Chu A. Van Winkle B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6245-6252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interacting directly or indirectly with ryanodine receptors and acting as a negative regulator of SR Ca2+ release (27Hirata Y. Atsumi M. Ohizumi Y. Nakahata N. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the above support the concept of a complex, compartmentalized glycogen metabolism with different cellular compartments and pools of glycogen particles, which are dynamic entities subjected to constant synthesis and degradation and to which different proteins bind and dissociate depending on the metabolic state. Changes in the intracellular distribution of GS and GPh may constitute a new regulatory mechanism that could target their activity to different cellular compartments. However, the identity of the intracellular compartments involved and the molecular processes by which translocation of these enzymes are regulated are still unknown. If there was no compartmentalization of glycogen metabolism, variation in glycogen content should be fully explained by changes in the activation states of GS and GPh and variations in the concentration of the respective allosteric activators, Glc-6-P and AMP. Metabolic situations have been reported where this is not the case (28Ciudad C.J. Massague J. Salavert A. Guinovart J.J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1980; 30: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Katz J. Golden S. Wals P.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In a previous study (30Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we compared the time courses of changes in glycogen content and the activity ratio of GS, an indicator of the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. During continuous low frequency (CLF) stimulation of rabbit tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, we found that, after 30 min, muscle glycogen levels had reached a minimum. By that time the activity ratio of GS was already high; however, no net resynthesis of glycogen was detected until after 3 h of stimulation. The aim of the present study was to characterize the intracellular distribution of skeletal muscle GS and GPh and to monitor possible translocation processes that could explain this lack of correlation between glycogen content and the activation state of the enzyme. Animal Procedures—All of the experiments were approved by the Animal Experiments Inspectorate of the Danish Ministry of Justice. Female New Zealand rabbits were anesthetized, electrodes were implanted, and chronic low frequency (10 Hz) stimulation of TA muscle was performed as previously described (30Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In all of the experiments, the left leg was stimulated, whereas the right leg was used as control. Muscle Homogenate Fractionation Study—TA muscles were carefully exposed, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, powdered, and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, obtaining supernatant (S1) and pellet (P1). S1 was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, obtaining supernatant (S2) and pellet (P2). S2 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, obtaining supernatant (S3) and pellet (P3). Glycogen content, GS and GPh assays, and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (30Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, protein concentration in S1 was determined and 30 μg of protein from the S1 homogenate fraction were loaded. The same volume was loaded for the rest of the fractions. Particulate fractions were resuspended with a volume of homogenate buffer equal to the corresponding recuperated supernatant. GS and GPh were immunodetected with antibodies against GS (Chemicon) and GPh (generously provided by Dr. A. A. DePaoli-Roach, Indiana University). Quantification was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence and Transmission Electron Microscopy in Single Muscle Fibers—Muscles were fixed by perfusion, and single fibers were teased and processed for fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (31Ploug T. van Deurs B. Ai H. Cushman S.W. Ralston E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1429-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). GS and GPh were immunodetected with the same primary antibodies used for Western blot. Production of the antibodies against GS phosphorylated at sites 2+2a (Ser7 and Ser10) and sites 3a+3b (Ser640 and Ser644) has been previously described (32Hojlund K. Staehr P. Hansen B.F. Green K.A.

Antibodies recognizing GS phosphorylated at site 1a (Ser697) and site 1b (Ser710) were raised against the peptides CEWPRRApSCTSSTG (residues 692–703 of human GS) and CSGSKRNpSVDTATS (residues 704–716 of human GS), respectively. Peptides were synthesized with an additional cysteine at the N terminus coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize sheep as described previously (33Sugden C. Crawford R.M. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 439Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). F-actin was stained with Alexa-568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and antibodies against fast myosin (Sigma-Aldrich), β-actin (Abcam), γ-actin (Abcam), α-actinin (Abcam), vinculin (Abcam), gelsolin (Abcam), and tropomyosin smooth (Chemicon) were used for immunostaining of the corresponding proteins. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to either Alexa-568 or Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes). Image Acquisition and Manipulation—Confocal images were collected on a TCS SP2 microscope (Leica) through a Plan-Apo ×63/1.32 oil objective at 20 °C as previously described (31Ploug T. van Deurs B. Ai H. Cushman S.W. Ralston E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1429-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Confocal Z-stack images were collected from the surface of the muscle fibers 0.25-μm apart on the z-plane. Images were analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Muscle Fixation for TEM—For optimal structural preservation, vascular perfusion was performed with two different glutaraldehyde-based fixatives in succession, as previously described (34Rostgaard J. Qvortrup K. Poulsen S.S. J. Microsc. 1993; 172: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following perfusion-fixation, TA muscles were isolated and fixed in the secondary fixative overnight and subsequently postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.12 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h. The specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, transferred to propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon according to standard procedures. Ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome and collected on one-hole copper grids with Formvar supporting membranes. Staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate was performed, and sections were examined in a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Images were collected using a Megaview 2 camera and processed with the Analysis software package. Intracellular Redistribution of Muscle GS and GPh at the Beginning of Glycogen Resynthesis—The previously introduced lack of net glycogen synthesis after 30 min and 1 h of stimulation, when GS activity ratio was already high (30Prats C. Bernal C. Cadefau J. Frias J. Tibolla M. Cusso R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), could have been due to a counteracting high GPh activity ratio. To investigate whether that was the case, we measured GPh activity ratio at rest and after 30 min, 1, and 3 h of CLF stimulation in rabbit TA muscles. GPh activity ratio decreased from 0.67 ± 0.03 in resting muscle to 0.03 ± 0.01 and 0.03 ± 0.00 at 30 min and 1 h, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 6–9). By 3 h of stimulation, the GPh activity ratio had increased to 0.50 ± 0.09, which was not significantly different from basal levels. Thus, the lack of net glycogen synthesis was not due to a high rate of glycogenolysis because the activity ratio of GPh at 30 min and 1 h was very low. The question arose of whether GS required been associated with a particular cellular compartment to initiate glycogen resynthesis. To address this question, we performed subcellular fractionation by sequential centrifugation of basal and 3-h-stimulated muscle homogenates. We obtained a S1 and P1, S2 and P2, and S3 and pellet P3. To determine whether glycogen particles associated with the different fractions were differentially affected by stimulation, glycogen content was quantified in the different homogenate fractions from basal and stimulated muscles. The results show that glycogen levels are significantly decreased to a similar extent in all of the fractions of stimulated muscles compared with the respective basal fractions (Fig. 1A). To detect possible changes in the intracellular distribution of GS and GPh, total activities were measured and Western blots were performed on the different fractions. In response to stimulation, GS and GPh total activities did not change significantly in the different homogenate fractions, with the exception of the S3 fraction where a significant increase in the total activity of both enzymes was detected (Fig. 1B). Consistent with these results, the protein levels of both enzymes were significantly increased in the S3 fraction and significantly decreased in the P3 fraction of stimulated muscle homogenates (Fig. 1C). Thus, the above results show that, in response to 3 h of stimulation, muscle GS and GPh move from cellular structures that pellet at 100,000 × g (P3), probably glycogen particles, to cytosolic structures, which remain in the soluble fraction (S3). Furthermore, to determine whether there were any differences in the activation state of GS and GPh depending on their intracellular distribution, the activity ratio of both enzymes was measured on the different homogenate fractions. After stimulation, the activity ratio of GS significantly increased and the activity ratio of GPh significantly decreased in all of the fractions (Fig. 1D). No significant differences were detected in either GS or GPh activity ratios between the different fractions from either basal or stimulated muscles, indicating that the activity ratio or activation state of both enzymes is independent of their distribution between muscle homogenate fractions. Phosphorylation-dependent GS Translocation to a Spherical Structure, a Novel Glycogen Metabolism Intracellular Compartment—To visualize the cellular structures with which GS associates in basal and stimulated muscles, we performed a morphological study by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against total GS and antibodies designed and produced to recognize different specific phosphorylated forms of GS (Fig. 2). In Fig. 3A, representative images of muscle GS intracellular distribution in basal and 3-h-stimulated single muscle fibers are shown. In resting muscle, GS is mainly found in the perinuclear region with a polarized arrangement and at the myofibrillar cross-striations with a periodicity corresponding to that of sarcomeres. A total of 414 single muscle fibers from four stimulated muscles were analyzed. In 36% fibers, GS showed a clear association with spherical structures with maximum dimensions of 0.5–1 μm, which were found throughout the muscle fibers (Fig. 3A). To elucidate whether the observed redistribution of GS in response to 3-h CLF stimulation was phosphorylation-dependent, we studied the distribution of several phosphorylated forms of the enzyme in basal and stimulated muscle using phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 3B). When phosphorylated at site 1a (GS1a), GS was found in the perinuclear region and at the cross-striations in resting muscle fibers, whereas in the stimulated fibers, it was mainly found to be associated with the spherical structures. GS phosphorylated at sites 3a and 3b (GS3a+3b) showed a similar distribution pattern associated with perinuclear structures and the cross-striations in resting muscle and with the spherical structures after stimulation. On the other hand, when phosphorylated at site 1b (GS1b), GS was found only at the cross-striations in both basal and stimulated muscle. Finally, when phosphorylated at sites 2 and 2a (GS2+2a), GS presented a dotted distribution pattern not associated with perinuclear structures, cross-striations, or the spherical structures in both basal and stimulated muscle. Taken together, our results show that the fraction of total GS, which is associated with the spherical structures, can be phosphorylated at sites 1a and 3a+3b but is dephosphorylated at sites 1b and 2+2a. These results demonstrate for the first time an intracellular distribution of GS that is dependent on its phosphorylation state.Fig. 3Muscle GS phosphorylation-dependent intracellular redistribution.A, total GS intracellular distribution was analyzed by fluorescence immunostaining of single muscle fibers from basal and 3-h CLF-stimulated TA muscle (Bars, 10 μm). White squares represent the higher magnification regions taken to visualize the distribution of total GS (red) and the different phosphospecific GS forms (GS-P). B, distribution of GS phosphorylated at sites 1a (GS1a), 1b (GS1b), 2 and 2a (GS2+2a), and 3a-b (GS-3a+3b) is shown (green). On the right, a merged image is presented and co-localization between both signals can be seen in yellow (Bars, 2.5 μm). Note that when associated to the spherical structures, GS is not phosphorylated at sites 1b and 2+2a. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-568 and Alexa-488 were used to immunodetect total GS and the different phosphospecific forms of GS, respectively. The presented images are representative of four independent experiments. From each immunostaining, an average of 20 fibers was analyzed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study changes in the phosphorylation state of GS in response to stimulation, the percentage of the signal obtained with the antibody against total GS that overlapped with the signal obtained using each of the phosphospecific antibodies was quantified and taken as an indication of the percentage of GS phosphorylated at that site. The fraction of total GS overlapping with GS1a decreased from 28.8 ± 2.5 to 13.1 ± 1.8% (p < 0.05) after 3 h of stimulation. Phosphorylation at site 1b also decreased from 34.8 ± 2.1 to 14.7 ± 4.1% (p < 0.01) after stimulation. The percentage of total GS overlapping with GS2+2a decreased from 12.6 ± 0.8 to 5.8 ± 1.0% after stimulation (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected in the percentage of total GS overlapping with GS3a+3b upon stimulation (25.9 ± 8.6% and 30.3 ± 15.7% in rested and stimulated muscle fibers, respectively). Thus, stimulation for 3 h decreased phosphorylation of GS at sites 1a, 1b, and 2+2a without apparently changing phosphorylation at site 3a+3b. Glycogen Phosphorylase Translocates to the Same Spherical Structures in Response to Stimulation—To determine whether the spherical structures were also a target for the translocation of GPh shown by the above presented biochemical data, co-immunostaining of GS and GPh was performed in single muscle fibers from basal and stimulated muscles (Fig. 4). In basal muscles, GPh presented a dotted distribution found mainly in the perinuclear regions and at the cross-striations. After stimulation, a fraction of GPh translocated to the spherical structures at which GS was also associated, whereas the remainder gave an unchanged distribution. Quantification of GS and GPh co-localization showed no significant difference in the percentage of overlap in signals (83.2 ± 7.6% and 56.1 ± 19.2% in basal and stimulated muscles, respectively). A New Dynamic Intracellular Compartment Involved in Muscle Glycogen Metabolism—To identify the spherical structures to which GS and GPh translocate in response to stimulation, basal and stimulated muscles were fixed for transmission electron microscopy and Nanogold immunostaining for GS was performed on single muscle fibers. We show representative images of the spherical structures (Fig. 5A, arrows). Their average size was 0.25 × 0.04 μm with some measuring as much as 0.5 × 1 μm. These structures were mainly located in the subsarcolemmal region and in the I bands of the sarcomeres (Fig. 5, A and E). Most of the observed structures were found near transverse tubules and surrounded by SR elements (Fig. 5, A and C). These spherical structures were not membrane-limited, and they showed a triangular or hexagonal lattice pattern, indicating a repetitive crystalline structure (Fig. 5B). No such structures were observed in resting muscles. When immunogold staining against GS was performed, we observed that GS was clearly associated with these structures (Fig. 5, D and E), which is consistent with the finding that glycogen particles are also associated with the spherical structures (Fig. 5B, arrow). The Reported Spherical Structure Appears to Be a Product of Actin Cytoskeleton Reorganization—In the late 1960s, structures similar to these observed here were described in myopathic and non-myopathic skeletal muscle fibers and were termed c"

We have demonstrated that one underlying mechanism is induction of macrophage apoptosis mediated by polyamines. The transcription factor c-Myc has been linked to induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis. We determined whether H. pylori stimulates transcriptional activation of ODC in macrophages, whether this occurs via c-Myc, and whether these events regulate activation of apoptosis. H. pylori induced a significant increase in ODC promoter activity that peaked at 6 h after stimulation and was closely paralleled by similar increases in ODC mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity. By 2 h after stimulation, c-Myc mRNA and protein expression was induced, protein was translocated to the nucleus, and there was specific binding of a consensus probe for c-Myc to nuclear extracts. Both an antennapedia-linked inhibitor of c-Myc binding (Int-H1-S6A,F8A) and transfection of a c-Myc dominant-negative construct significantly attenuated H. pylori-induced ODC promoter activity, mRNA, enzyme activity, and apoptosis in parallel. Transfection of ODC small interfering RNA inhibited ODC activity and apoptosis to the same degree as inhibition of c-Myc binding. These studies indicate that c-Myc is an important mediator of macrophage activation and may contribute to the mucosal inflammatory response to pathogens such as H. pylori by its effect on ODC.

Arginase converts l-arginine to l-ornithine, which is metabolized by ODC to produce the polyamine putrescine that is converted to the polyamines spermidine and spermine. When spermine is metabolized by spermine oxidase (SMO; polyamine oxidase 1) it generates H2O2 that causes apoptosis (9Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A.

ODC activity can be regulated at multiple levels including promoter activation (10Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the transcription factor c-Myc has been shown to activate the ODC promoter by forming a heterodimer with Max and binding to c-Myc consensus binding sequences in the promoter (11Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bacterial LPS has been shown to induce expression of c-Myc (12Introna M. Hamilton T.A. Kaufman R.E. Adams D.O. Bast Jr., R.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2711-2715PubMed Google Scholar) and of ODC (13Salimuddin Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Isobe H. Mori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E110-E117PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of c-Myc in the host response to pathogens has not been defined. We now report that H. pylori induces ODC and causes apoptosis by activation of the ODC promoter and that this process is dependent on c-Myc expression and binding. These studies are the first to show that host innate immune response to a bacterial pathogen is compromised by the induction of c-Myc.

Assay for ODC Activity—ODC activity was determined by a radiometric analysis in which the amount of 14CO2 liberated from l-[14C]ornithine was measured as described (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y.

Immunoblotting for ODC and c-Myc—For ODC, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with HPL for 0–12 h. Cells were lysed and Western blotting performed as described (14Bussiere F.I. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Gobert A.P. Asim M. Blumberg D.R. Xu H. Kim P.Y. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2409-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For c-Myc, cells were treated with HPL for 0–4 h in the absence and presence of actinomycin D (2 μg/ml). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using an extraction kit from Pierce. Equal amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were loaded and immunoblotted with mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (1:2000; BIOSOURCE). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as above. 40-bp complimentary oligonucleotides (5′-TGCCTTAAGTCTAGTATCACGTGCAGATCGCTACAACGAC-3′) with the c-Myc consensus binding site as shown (underlined) were synthesized. 50 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Binding reactions were carried out with 20,000 cpm labeled oligonucleotides and 2 μg of nuclear protein. For competition experiments, 200-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides with either the c-Myc binding sequence or the AP-2 binding sequence was used. The entire reaction was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run at room temperature at 60 mA for 1 h. Gels were dried and visualized using a PhosphorImager (14Bussiere F.I. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y.

Transient Transfection of Dominant-negative c-Myc Plasmid in Macrophages—RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 1 μg dominant-negative c-Myc plasmid (pCMVMadMyc; provided by R.

For promoter activity, the c-Myc dominant-negative or control plasmid was cotransfected with pODC-Luc. Transient Transfection of ODC siRNA in Macrophages—RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with ODC siRNA duplex or scrambled siRNA exactly as described (14Bussiere F.I. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Gobert A.P.

Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was measured by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and flow cytometry as described (9Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P.

Spectral overlap was electronically compensated using single color control cells stained with propidium iodide or fluorescein isothiocyanate. Analysis of the multivariate data were performed with CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). The upper right (annexin V+/PI+) quadrant representing late apoptotic cells was used based on our previous findings that this was the most consistent indicator of apoptosis in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages (9Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In some experiments apoptosis was also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K.

Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by using analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test. H. pylori Stimulates Parallel Induction of ODC Promoter Activity, mRNA, Protein, and Enzyme Activity—Because we have reported that H. pylori can induce ODC expression and activity in macrophages (5Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Wang J.Y. Boucher J.L. Iyer R.K. Cederbaum S.D. Casero Jr., R.A. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4692-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we now sought to establish the mechanism by studying the time course and degree of initial induction. We compared each of the potential levels of regulation in response to H. pylori. As shown in Fig. 1A, H. pylori addition to RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in a time-dependent, 12-fold increase in ODC promoter activity that peaked at 6 h. There was a nearly identical degree and time course of induction of ODC mRNA expression by real-time PCR (Fig. 1B) and enzyme activity (Fig. 1C). The real-time data were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 1D), and Western blotting also showed a peak increase at 6 h. Taken together, these data indicate that the observed increase in ODC mRNA expression, protein expression, and functional ODC activity derives from H. pylori-induced ODC transcription. Induction of c-Myc Expression and Translocation to the Nucleus with H. pylori Activation—Increased c-Myc expression has been reported in H. pylori-stimulated gastric epithelial cells (17Yang Y. Deng C.S. Peng J.Z. Wong B.C. Lam S.K. Xia H.H. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 56: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the role of c-Myc in macrophage response to this infection has not been determined. When macrophage c-Myc expression was assessed, we found an 8–10-fold increase in mRNA levels that peaked earlier than ODC, with maximal levels reached at 2–4 h as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A) and RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). In parallel, H. pylori stimulation resulted in a marked increase in total c-Myc protein levels at 2–4 h (Fig. 2C). When nuclear accumulation of c-Myc was assessed (Fig. 2D) there was a similar increase at 2–4 h after stimulation. There was no increase in cytosolic c-Myc with H. pylori exposure and a decrease at 4 h. This raised the question as to whether the increase in c-Myc nuclear protein was due only to translocation from the cytosol or required de novo c-Myc synthesis. We therefore treated H. pylori-stimulated macrophages with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomcyin D and found that the nuclear accumulation was abolished. Thus, the expression of c-Myc mRNA is necessary to cause nuclear accumulation of c-Myc protein. Additionally, we used EMSA to demonstrate that there was significant binding to a c-Myc oligonucleotide probe by nuclear proteins extracted from H. pylori-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 2E). This provides further evidence that c-Myc is translocated to the nucleus, and since c-Myc must form a heterodimer with its partner protein Max to bind to consensus c-Myc binding sites, it also indicates that in response to H. pylori, functional c-Myc heterodimers are formed that are capable of binding to such sites. Prevention of c-Myc Binding to the ODC Promoter Inhibits ODC Promoter Activity, mRNA Expression, Enzyme Activity, and Apoptosis—Since ODC is a known transcriptional target of c-Myc, we sought to determine whether c-Myc caused the induction of ODC by H. pylori. As shown in Fig. 3A, transfection with a c-Myc dominant-negative construct resulted in a marked 87.7 ± 5.7% inhibition of H. pylori-stimulated ODC promoter activity. Similarly, inhibition of c-Myc binding with Int-H1-S6A,F8A caused a 78.2 ± 9.2% inhibition of ODC promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of ODC mRNA expression (Fig. 3, C and D) paralleled these changes in the ODC promoter activity. To determine the functional significance of inhibition of c-Myc interaction with the ODC promoter, we assessed the effect on ODC enzyme activity and determined how this related to changes in apoptosis (Fig. 4). The c-Myc dominant-negative reduced H. pylori-stimulated ODC activity by 72.4 ± 10.6% (Fig. 4A), which resulted in an 84.8 ± 13.1% inhibition of apoptosis relative to the empty vector and complete inhibition compared with unstimulated cells transfected with pCMVMadMyc (Fig. 4, B and C). Similarly the c-Myc binding inhibitor blocked stimulated ODC activity by 77.3 ± 11.7% (Fig. 4D) and apoptosis by 84.4 ± 7.6% (Fig. 4E, F). We confirmed these data by DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which revealed an 86.9 ± 9.6% inhibition of stimulated apoptosis with the c-Myc binding inhibitor (p < 0.01; n = 3 experiments in duplicate; data not shown). We also determined whether specific inhibition of ODC would mimic the effect of c-Myc inhibition. We have previously demonstrated effective knockdown of ODC expression with transient transfection of ODC siRNA (14Bussiere F.I. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Gobert A.P. Asim M. Blumberg D.R. Xu H. Kim P.Y. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2409-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We now determined that when ODC activity (Fig. 4G) is inhibited by this strategy to the same degree as achieved by the interference of c-Myc binding, there is an identical degree of inhibition of apoptosis (84.5 ± 2.2%; Fig. 4, H and I) as was observed with either the c-Myc dominant-negative or binding inhibitor. In the current report we have demonstrated that H. pylori induces substantial ODC promoter activation in macrophages that is closely paralleled by concomitant increases in ODC mRNA and protein, as well as functional enzyme activity. Thus, in this model of innate immune cell activation by bacterial exposure, ODC is transcriptionally regulated. ODC mRNA induction has been reported in T cell lines in response to IL-2 and phorbol esters (18Farrar W.L. Vinocour M. Cleveland J.L. Harel-Bellan A. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 967-971PubMed Google Scholar), and ODC promoter activation and mRNA expression have been demonstrated in murine myeloid cells in response to IL-3 (11Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There is also a report of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of ODC mRNA in mouse peritoneal macrophages (13Salimuddin Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Isobe H. Mori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E110-E117PubMed Google Scholar). The current study is the first to demonstrate that an important bacterial pathogen induces macrophage ODC via promoter activation and that H. pylori activates ODC via c-Myc. In addition to activation of the ODC promoter (10Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), c-Myc has been shown to mediate apoptosis of myeloid cells caused by IL-3 withdrawal and this has been attributed to the induction of ODC (19Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The major significance of our findings is that we have demonstrated that an underlying mechanism for the apoptosis of macrophages in response to H. pylori is mediated by c-Myc via its effects on ODC. This leads to the question as to how c-Myc is activated by H. pylori. Activation of MAP kinases by H. pylori has been demonstrated in gastric epithelial cells (20Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar), and these signaling pathways have been implicated in c-Myc induction (21Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have conducted studies of MAP kinase pathways in macrophages and found that induction of c-Myc, ODC, and apoptosis is inhibited by PD98059, an MEK1/2 inhibitor, and that H. pylori stimulated rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in these cells; in contrast, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or c-Jun N-terminal kinase had no effect. 2M. Asim, R. Chaturvedi, Y. Cheng, F. I. Bussière, H. Xu, R. A. Casero, Jr., and K. T. Wilson, manuscript in preparation. A related question is whether specific bacterial factors derived from H. pylori play a role in the induction of macrophage apoptosis and whether these factors work through the c-Myc/ODC pathway. Notably, we have reported that H. pylori LPS is not a significant activator of macrophages (4Wilson K.T. Ramanujam K.S. Mobley H.L.T. Musselman R.F. James S.P. Meltzer S.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1524-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) but that urease, a major protein product of H. pylori required for colonization of the organism in vivo, is a major inducing factor for inducible NO synthase in macrophages (6Gobert A.P. Mersey B.D. Cheng Y. Blumberg D.R. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6002-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we have found that urease-deficient mutant strains of H. pylori have attenuated ability to induce c-Myc, ODC, and apoptosis, and recombinant urease activates each of these pathways. 3Y. Cheng, R. Chaturvedi, M. Asim, F. I. Bussière, H. Xu, R. A. Casero, Jr., and K. T. Wilson, manuscript in preparation. A further issue for consideration is what is the specificity of the c-Myc and ODC response to H. pylori in macrophages? For comparison, we have studied the Gram-negative enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis in mice (22Gobert A.P. Cheng Y. Akhtar M. Mersey B.D. Blumberg D.R. Cross R.K. Chaturvedi R. Drachenberg C.B. Boucher J.L. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the effect of the chemical inducer of apoptosis, staurosporine, and found that both agents cause apoptosis in macrophages without inducing ODC or c-Myc (data not shown). Additionally, inhibition of H. pylori-induced apoptosis with catalase or cyclosporine A did not prevent induction of ODC or c-Myc (data not shown), indicating that the process of apoptosis itself is not required to stimulate this pathway of polyamine generation. The induction of ODC may not be a generalized phenomenon, since we have reported that ODC was not increased in gastric epithelial cells exposed to H. pylori (15Xu H. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Bussiere F.I. Asim M. Yao M.D. Potosky D. Meltzer S.J. Rhee J.G. Kim S.S. Moss S.F. Hacker A. Wang Y. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, in these cells there is significant basal expression of ODC, and the apoptosis is dependent on the induction of SMO(PAO1), which generates oxidative stress from the H2O2 production (15Xu H. Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Bussiere F.I. Asim M. Yao M.D. Potosky D. Meltzer S.J. Rhee J.G. Kim S.S. Moss S.F. Hacker A. Wang Y. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, in macrophages, our current data indicate that there is substantial induction of ODC and that this is required for apoptosis, along with the induction of SMO(PAO1) that is also needed (9Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussiere F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In terms of in vivo relevance, there are reports of increased levels of c-Myc and ODC in human H. pylori gastritis tissues; these studies have focused on the association of these genes with intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer (23Nardone G. Staibano S. Rocco A. Mezza E. D′Armiento F.P. Insabato L. Coppola A. Salvatore G. Lucariello A. Figura N. De Rosa G. Budillon G.

However, we have assessed c-Myc and ODC levels by real-time PCR in mouse H. pylori gastritis tissues in which atrophy and metaplasia are not evident and found consistent induction of both genes with this more sensitive technique (data not shown). In our recent reports we have also shown that spermine generation by ODC in stimulated macrophages contributes to H. pylori pathogenesis by inhibiting NO-dependent bacterial killing (14Bussiere F.I.

Our current results directly implicate c-Myc as a major mediator in ODC-associated immune dysregulation by its transactivation of the ODC promoter and provide a target for therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune response to this infection."

The genome of JCV comprises a double-stranded circular DNA molecule that contains three functional regions: the viral early and late genes and the noncoding regulatory sequence (1Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Cannella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early region of the JCV genome encodes the large T and small t antigens, which are responsible for the initiation of viral DNA replication and activation of late gene transcription (2Safak M. Gallia G.L. Ansari S.A. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10146-10157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell.

The late coding region encodes three structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) that are components of the viral capsid (5Major E.O. Amemiya K. Tornatore C.S. Houff S.A. Berger J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition, the leader sequence of late transcripts encodes agnoprotein, a viral auxiliary protein that contains 71 amino acids (6Safak M. Barrucco R. Darbinyan A. Okada Y. Nagashima K. Khalili K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The auxiliary proteins of various eukaryotic viruses have diverse effects on different stages of infection, including transcription (7Cohen E.A. Subbramanian R.A. Gottlinger H.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 219-235PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), viral assembly (9Michaud G. Zachary A. Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the release of viral particles (10Terwilliger E.F. Cohen E.A. Lu Y.C. Sodroski J.G.

Biol. 1999; 9: R459-R461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The agnoprotein of simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40), which belongs to the same polyomavirus family as does JCV, contributes to various stages of the viral lytic cycle. Mutation of the agnoprotein of SV40 was found to result in a moderate growth defect that was attributable to impairment of the viral maturation pathway (13Hou-Jong M.H. Larsen S.H. Roman A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 937-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Resnick J. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Carswell S. Resnick J. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 415-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SV40 agnoprotein facilitates the localization of VP1, the major capsid protein, to the nucleus and perinuclear region of infected cells (16Carswell S. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lack of agnoprotein led to inefficient release of mature SV40 virions from infected cells and impaired the ability of the virus to propagate in monkeys (14Resnick J. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to SV40, JCV is closely related to other polyomaviruses, including human BK virus. These viruses exhibit marked nucleotide sequence similarity, especially in the coding regions (1Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Cannella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All JCV proteins with the exception of agnoprotein are localized predominantly in the nuclei of infected cells (17Ressetar H.G. Walker D.L. Webster H.D. Braun D.G. Stoner G.L. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 287-296PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shishido-Hara Y. Hara Y. Larson T. Yasui K. Nagashima K. Stoner G.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1840-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas JCV agnoprotein is largely restricted to the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm (19Okada Y. Sawa H. Endo S. Orba Y.

Khoury G. Jay G. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 428-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that deletion of the agnogene of JCV results in a viral growth defect (21Okada Y. Endo S.

Furthermore, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for agnoprotein mRNA was found to inhibit JCV infection (22Orba Y. Sawa H. Iwata H. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7270-7273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the agnoprotein of JCV, like that of SV40, plays an important role in viral propagation, although the molecular mechanism of this action remains unknown. We have now identified fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) as a protein that interacted with JCV agnoprotein in a yeast-two hybrid assay. FEZ1 is a brain-specific coiled-coil protein that comprises 392-amino acid residues and is expressed in neurons (23Bloom L. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3414-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is related to Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-76, which is required for normal axonal bundling and outgrowth. We further demonstrate that agnoprotein inhibited the function of FEZ1 apparently by blocking the association of FEZ1 with microtubules, and overexpression of FEZ1 inhibited the intracellular spread of JCV. Our results suggest that agnoprotein promotes the intracellular translocation of viral particles on microtubules by inducing the dissociation of FEZ1. Construction of Plasmids—A full-length FEZ1 cDNA was amplified by the PCR from an adult human brain cDNA library and was subcloned into pCXN2-FLAG (24Tokui M. Takei I. Tashiro F. Shimada A. Kasuga A. Ishii M. Ishii T. Takatsu K. Saruta T. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences), and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA); the resulting expression vectors were designated pFLAG-FEZ1 (for expression of FEZ1 with an NH2-terminal FLAG tag), pGST-FEZ1 (for expression of FEZ1 fused at its NH2 terminus with glutathione S-transferase), and pFEZ1-GFP (for expression of FEZ1 fused at its COOH terminus to green fluorescent protein), respectively. Complementary DNAs for deletion mutants of FEZ1 were generated by PCR from pFLAG-FEZ1 and subcloned into pGEX6P1. For expression of JCV agnoprotein in mammalian cells, the agnoprotein cDNA was amplified by PCR from a plasmid containing the JCV genome, pJC1->4pJCV (HSRRB, Osaka, Japan), and subcloned into either pcDNA4HisMax (Invitrogen) or the bicistronic expression vector pERedNLS (kindly provided by M. Matsuda). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed with a Matchmaker System 3 and an adult human brain cDNA library obtained from Clontech. Yeast AH109 cells were transformed with both the brain cDNA library and a full-length cDNA for JCV agnoprotein subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pGBKT7. Plasmids isolated from positive colonies were introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α and sequenced, and the DNA sequence data were compared with sequences in the NCBI data base with the BLAST program. Cell Culture and Virus Preparation—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (HSRRB), SV40-transformed human glial SVG-A cells (kindly provided by W. J. Atwood) (25Ashok A. Atwood W.J. J.

Virol. 1995; 47: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Sigma). HEK293 cells that express JCV agnoprotein in an inducible manner (293AG cells) were established with the T-REx system (Invitrogen); agnoprotein expression was induced by exposure of the cells to doxycycline (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. To establish 293AG cells that stably express FEZ1-GFP, we transfected 293AG cells with pFEZ1-GFP and cultured the transfectants in the presence of Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 400 μg/ml. Several clones were expanded in the selection medium, after which expression of FEZ1-GFP was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Control 293AG cell lines were similarly established by stable transfection with pEGFP-N1. To establish SVG-A cells that stably express FLAG-FEZ1, we transfected SVG-A cells with pFLAG-FEZ1 and cultured the transfectants in the presence of Geneticin (100 μg/ml). Expression of FLAG-FEZ1 in selected cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Again, control SVG-A cell lines were similarly established by stable transfection with pCXN2-FLAG. PC12 cells stably expressing either FEZ1-GFP or GFP were kindly provided by T. Fujita (27Fujita T. Ikuta J. Hamada J. Okajima T. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and Geneticin (400 μg/ml). For virus preparation, JC virus-infected SVG-A cells were cultured for 2 weeks, harvested, and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were frozen and thawed three times and then treated for 16 h at 37 °C with neuraminidase type V (Sigma) at 0.05 unit/ml. After an additional incubation for 30 min at 56 °C, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was assayed for JCV by a hemagglutination assay (28Suzuki S. Sawa H. Komagome R. Orba Y. Yamada M. Okada Y. Ishida Y. Nishihara H. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Virology. 2001; 286: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C until use. Protein Preparation—Recombinant baculovirus bearing Agno was constructed using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). Briefly, the coding region of Agno was amplified by PCR using a specific primer set 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGGTTCTTCCGCCAGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTATGTAGCTTTTGGTTCA-3′ and pBR-Mad1 (30Okada Y.

PCR products were subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen), following cloning into pDEST10 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared according to manufacturer's instruction. The histidine-tagged agnoprotein (His-Agno) was purified as follows: a 500-ml culture of Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 3 days was harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of the lysis buffer (600 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.05 mg/ml DNase) using the Teflon homogenizer. After rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto the nickel-chelated Cellulofine (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) column pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer without PMSF and DNase, and the column was washed with same buffer. After extensively washing with the solution (600 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5), the bound proteins were eluted with the buffer (600 mm NaCl and 200 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5). The anti-Agno antibody-conjugated Sepharose resin was added into the eluate, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was transferred into an empty column and washed with TBS containing 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (TBST). The bound proteins were eluted with the solution (0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8), and the elute was immediately neutralized by addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-base. The fractions containing His-Agno were pooled and dialyzed against TBS. The purified His-Agno was stored at 4 °C until use. Primary Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to large T antigen (Ab-2), to α-tubulin, to pan-actin (MAB1501R), and to MAP2 (clone AP-20) were obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Uniondale, NY), Sigma, Chemicon International (Temecula, CA), and Roche Diagnostics, respectively. Goat polyclonal antibodies to GST were from Amersham Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to JCV agnoprotein and to JCV VP1 were produced as described previously (19Okada Y. Sawa H. Endo S.

Mochizuki. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (M2) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. Transfection, Immunoblot Analysis, and Immunoprecipitation—Cell transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For immunoblot analysis, cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), and mixed with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) (30Okada Y. Sawa H. Tanaka S. Takada A. Suzuki S. Hasegawa H. Umemura T. Fujisawa J. Tanaka Y. Hall W.W. Nagashima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17016-17023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filter was incubated with primary antibodies, and immune complexes were then detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The FLAG epitope was detected directly with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated primary antibodies. For detection of in vivo interaction between agnoprotein and FEZ1, 293AG cells were transfected with pFLAG-FEZ1, and, 48 h after transfection, lysed in buffer C (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm PMSF), mixed with Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. For detection of in vivo interaction between FEZ1 and tubulin, 293AG cells stably expressing FEZ1-GFP were lysed in PTN buffer (100 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.3), 30 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm PMSF), mixed with Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of cell lysates at 4 °C first for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose FF beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then, after removal of the beads, for 4 h with antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose FF beads. After washing with cell lysis buffer, the bead-bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated at room temperature with 5% dried skim milk in PBS (31Qu Q. Sawa H. Suzuki T. Semba S. Henmi C. Okada Y. Tsuda M. Tanaka S. Atwood W.J. Nagashima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27735-27742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For detergent extraction, cells were washed once with PBS and twice with PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.9; 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) before extraction with 0.2% Saponin in PHEM buffer for 3 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble cell components remaining on the coverslips were then washed with PHEM buffer and fixed with methanol for 4 min at -20 °C. The cells were then incubated first with primary antibodies and then with Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-labeled goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G or with Alexa 594-labeled goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (0.2 μg/ml), and the cells were then observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). GST Precipitation Assay—GST fusion proteins of FEZ1 or its deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli AD494 DE3 and purified with the use of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro GST precipitation assays, GST or GST fusion proteins (50 pmol) were mixed with 10 μl of the histidine-tagged agnoprotein in a final volume of 500 μl with binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 10 μl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-Sepharose 4B, the mixture was incubated for another 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were separated by centrifugation and washed with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to agnoprotein. Microtubule Cosedimentation Assay—Microtubule binding assays were performed as previously described (32Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E.

In brief, GST fusion proteins of FEZ1 or its deletion mutants (0.5 μg) in 50 μl of a MES-based buffer (100 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.8), 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm GTP) supplemented with 50 μm Taxol (Sigma) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25°C. Purified tubulin (Sigma) at 5 mg/ml in the MES-based buffer was polymerized by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm Taxol and GFP at a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and the polymerized microtubules were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatants containing the GST fusion proteins were then incubated with the polymerized microtubules (50 μg) for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the mixtures were each layered on top of 100 μl of 30% sucrose in the MES-based buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The resulting supernatants and pellets (washed once with the MES-based buffer) were subjected to immunoblot analysis. For examination of the interaction between agnoprotein and microtubules, JCI cells were lysed in PTN buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The resulting supernatant (60 μl containing 100 μg of protein) was added to a pellet of polymerized microtubules (50 μg) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μm Taxol. Samples were then layered over 100 μl of 30% sucrose in the MES-based buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The resulting supernatants and pellets (washed once with the MES buffer) were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Assay of Neurite Extension in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells stably expressing either FEZ1-GFP or GFP were transfected with pERedNLS-agno or the empty vector. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium and then maintained for 48 h in serum-free medium supplemented with nerve growth factor (NGF) (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and then washed three times with PBS. Cells expressing agnoprotein were identified on the basis of their DsRed-positive nuclei. A change in cell morphology characterized by neurite outgrowth, cell flattening, and an increase in the size of the cell body was defined previously (27Fujita T. Ikuta J. Hamada J. Okajima T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—For RNA extraction, cells grown in 6-well plates were washed once with PBS and harvested with trypsin-EDTA. Total RNA was isolated with the use of an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and portions (500 ng) were treated with 2 units of DNase I (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C in a 10-μl reaction mixture before incubation with 2.5 mm EDTA for 15 min at 65 °C. The treated RNA (4 μl) was subjected to RT with a Superscript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The absence of contamination with genomic DNA was verified by the addition of RNase-free water instead of Superscript II reverse transcriptase as a negative control for each sample. PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing cDNA, Gene Taq universal buffer, 2.5 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, Gene Taq polymerase (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and primers specific either for FEZ1 (5′-CACTGGTGAGTCTGGATG-3′ and 5′-CGAGGTCCTCCATGGACTTGAAG-3′) or for β-actin (5′-TTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAA-3′ and 5′-GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3′). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 94 °C for 1 min and then subjected to 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s with a GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All reactions were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. siRNA Preparation—The following stealth RNA duplexes were synthesized by Invitrogen: FEZ1–301 sense, 5′-GAGAAGCUCAAUGUCUGCUUUCGGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-UCCGAAAGCAGACAUUGAGCUUCUC-3′; FEZ1–352 sense, 5′-GCUCCCGUGAAGAACCAGUUACAGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-UCUGUAACUGGUUCUUCACGGGAGC-3′; Scramble sense, 5′-GCAUCGUACAGACAAUCUUCAGUUU-3′ and antisense, 5′-AAACTGAAGAUUGUCUGUACGAUGC-3′. Virus Inoculation and siRNAs Transfection—SVG-A sells were grown to 50% confluence on a 6-well plate and incubated with 1000 hemagglutination units of JCV in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, At 24 h post inoculation of JCV, transfection of siRNA (100 pmol) were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to the JCV-infected SVG-A cells. The cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot analysis at 96 h post transfection. The results were confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Identification of FEZ1 as an Agnoprotein-binding Protein— We first performed a yeast two-hybrid assay with full-length JCV agnoprotein as the bait to identify proteins that interact with agnoprotein. Several positive clones were isolated from a human brain cDNA library and were found to encode a portion of FEZ1 that contains the three poly-glutamic acid regions and the coiled-coil (CC) domain (Fig. 1A). The largest cDNA clone encoded amino acids 32–392 of human FEZ1. To examine the interaction between agnoprotein and FEZ1, we established a cell line, designated 293AG, that was derived from HEK293 cells and that expresses JCV agnoprotein (tagged with the hexahistidine and Myc epitopes at its NH2 terminus) under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. All 293AG cells expressed the recombinant agnoprotein (molecular size, ∼14 kDa) within 3 h of exposure to doxycycline (Dox). In the absence of Dox, we failed to detect agnoprotein in the cells by immunoblot or immunocytofluorescence analysis (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of 293AG cells transfected with an expression vector for FLAG epitope-tagged FEZ1 revealed that FLAG-FEZ1 coprecipitated with agnoprotein (Fig. 1B). The subcellular localization of exogenously expressed agnoprotein and FEZ1 in transfected HEK293 cells was examined by immunocytofluorescence analysis. Confocal microscopy revealed that agnoprotein immunoreactivity was present in the perinuclear region and extended into the cytoplasm in a mesh-like pattern (Fig. 1C). In most cells, FEZ1 was detected throughout the cytoplasm and colocalized with agnoprotein only in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1C, upper panels). However, in some cells the localization of FEZ1 is mirrored by that of agnoprotein and well colocalized with agnoprotein (Fig. 1C, lower panels). This suggests that FEZ1 was recruited to the same location as agnoprotein as a result of interactions between FEZ1 and agnoprotein. Association of Agnoprotein with Microtubules—Agnoprotein colocalized with microtubules in the perinuclear region of JCV-infected SVG-A cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with our previous observations (38Endo S. Okada Y. Orba Y. Nishihara H. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Sawa H. J. Neurovirol. 2003; 9: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To confirm the association between agnoprotein and microtubules, we performed a microtubule cosedimentation assay with lysates of JCI cells and microtubules polymerized in the presence of Taxol. Agnoprotein was indeed detected in the sedimented fraction only in the presence of microtubules (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the large T antigen of JCV, which was detected in the nucleus of JCV-infected cells (19Okada Y. Sawa H. Endo S. Orba Y. Umemura T. Nishihara H. Stan A.C. Tanaka S. Takahashi H.

https://openalex.org/W2008554228,"The ubiquitous glutaredoxin protein family is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and is closely related to the thioredoxins, which reduce their substrates using a dithiol mechanism as part of the cellular defense against oxidative stress. Recently identified monothiol glutaredoxins, which must use a different functional mechanism, appear to be essential in both Escherichia coli and yeast and are well conserved in higher order genomes. We have employed high resolution NMR to determine the three-dimensional solution structure of a monothiol glutaredoxin, the reduced E. coli Grx4. The Grx4 structure comprises a glutaredoxin-like α-β fold, founded on a limited set of strictly conserved and structurally critical residues. A tight hydrophobic core, together with a stringent set of secondary structure elements, is thus likely to be present in all monothiol glutaredoxins. A set of exposed and conserved residues form a surface region, implied in glutathione binding from a known structure of E. coli Grx3. The absence of glutaredoxin activity in E. coli Grx4 can be understood based on small but significant differences in the glutathione binding region, and through the lack of a conserved second GSH binding site. MALDI experiments suggest that disulfide formation on glutathionylation is accompanied by significant structural changes, in contrast with dithiol thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, where differences between oxidized and reduced forms are subtle and local. Structural and functional implications are discussed with particular emphasis on identifying common monothiol glutaredoxin properties in substrate specificity and ligand binding events, linking the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems.

Careful characterization of dithiol glutaredoxins shows that their main function is the reduction of functionally important protein disulfides, leading to activation and/or inactivation of biological activity. Glutaredoxin targets include the active site of ribonucleotide reductase (reviewed in Refs. 1Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar and 7Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 131-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the key enzyme in the reduction of sulfate to sulfite (sulfur assimilation), and the mixed disulfide between arsenate reductase and glutathione forming upon reduction of arsenate to arsenite ions (9Shi J.

Glutaredoxins can also maintain the activity of redox-sensitive proteins by deglutathionylating cysteines that may form mixed disulfides with glutathione upon oxidative conditions resulting in loss of biological activity (10Sodano P.

Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All of these glutaredoxins contain a thioredoxin-like α-β fold where the CPXC motif extends from the core in a loop-like structure, and the central β-sheet is composed of four strands compared with the five strands in thioredoxins (reviewed in Ref. 1Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Glutathione binding sites have been characterized in atomic detail for human Grx1, Escherichia coli Grx1, and E. coli Grx3, all of which involve covalent linkage of glutathione to the N-terminal cysteine in the active site loop (16Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dithiol glutaredoxins share the common property of reducing small molecular weight disulfides with GSH, as shown in the HED assay (17Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that, despite significant sequence similarities, monothiol glutaredoxin functionality is clearly distinct from that of dithiol glutaredoxins. The monothiol glutaredoxin motif occurs in multidomain arrangements in multicellular eukaryotic species, whereas in lower organisms, only single domain monothiol glutaredoxins have been conserved (19Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. De La Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 22Google Scholar, 20Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The monothiol Grx5 from yeast is localized in the mitochondria and performs thioloxidoreductase activity through deglutathionylation of carbonic anhydrase III (21Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Yeast Grx5 is also required for the activity of Fe-S cluster enzymes (21Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), which suggests a role in protecting the cell against oxidative stress by regulating the activity of Fe-S cluster proteins. A Plasmodium falciparum multidomain protein with a monothiol glutaredoxin domain reduces insulin dimers (22Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Neither of these monothiol glutaredoxins reduce small molecular weight disulfides with GSH, and thus appear to lack the classic glutaredoxin activity (22Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no substrate has been found for any of these proteins. Among eukaryotic proteins, the human PICOT protein, which is important in oxidative stress response (20Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Babichev Y. Isakov N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 495: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), contains two monothiol glutaredoxin domains, but their specific functions are still unknown. The only monothiol glutaredoxin in E. coli, glutaredoxin 4 (Grx4), was recently classified as being essential in a gene footprinting study (25Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. Campbell J.W. Balazsi G. Ravasz E. Daugherty M.D. Somera A.L. Kyrpides N.C. Anderson I. Gelfand M.S. Bhattacharya A. Kapatral V. D'Souza M. Baev M.V. Grechkin Y. Mseeh F. Fonstein M.Y. Overbeek R. Barabasi A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, several attempts to produce a knock-out of the gene have failed, which indicates that cells lacking Grx4 are not viable (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). Recombinantly expressed Grx4 (115 amino acids) is well folded and thermally stable, with similar biophysical properties as Grx1 (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). Grx4 lacks classic glutaredoxin activity toward small disulfides, and other known substrates for glutaredoxins or thioredoxins such as HED, insulin, and 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate reductase are not targets for this essential glutaredoxin (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). Grx4 also differs from the classic glutaredoxins by being a substrate for thioredoxin reductase and not for glutathione (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). However, Grx4 can be glutathionylated and is deglutathionylated with high selectivity by Grx1 (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). Thus, Grx4 is redoxactive, but with high substrate specificity. This may explain both why normal dithiol glutaredoxins cannot compensate for the activity of the Grx4 monothiol species in E. coli, as was observed for Grx5 in yeast (6Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and why the E. coli Grx4 monothiol is essential for cell growth and viability. Despite the close sequence homology between the monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins, the functionality of the monothiol glutaredoxins remains elusive. In particular, the essentiality of the monothiol glutaredoxins, despite their lack of observable activity in the standard glutaredoxin assays (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar), is intriguing. The distinct functionalities displayed by the monothiol glutaredoxins suggests that structural modeling of monothiol glutaredoxins using a dithiol template (19Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. De La Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 22Google Scholar) will not adequately predict functionalities of this novel motif. To further characterize the properties of essential monothiol glutaredoxins, we have employed high resolution NMR to determine the three-dimensional structure of a monothiol glutaredoxin, the reduced E. coli Grx4, which is described in this work. Structural and functional implications of the monothiol fold are discussed and analyzed with particular emphasis on substrate specificity and binding events. Protein Expression and Sample Preparation—Unlabeled Grx4 was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)grxA–grxB–grxC– using the T7 polymerase/promoter system (pET-15b), as described previously (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar). Isotopically labeled Grx4 was produced in rich growth OD2 media from Silantes, containing primary amino acids, some low molecular weight oligopeptides, and almost no carbohydrates. Cells from an overnight culture of unlabeled Silantes OD2 media were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled Silantes OD2 media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Both unlabeled and labeled protein samples were purified as described earlier (5Fernandes A.P. Fladvad M. Berndt C. Andrésen C. Lillig C.H. Neubauer P. Sunnerhagen M. Holmgren A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (April 15, 10.1074/jbc.M500678200)Google Scholar) and concentrated to 0.75 mm in 125 mm KCl and 5 mm PO4, pH 6.5. NMR Measurements and Spectral Evaluation—NMR experiments were performed at 28 °C, using Bruker DMX 600 and Varian Unity INOVA 800 NMR spectrometers. Unlabeled, 15N-labeled, and 13C/15N-labeled proteins were employed. The requirement for KCl in the purification of Grx4 was significant for obtaining spectra with narrow linewidths at near-millimolar protein concentrations. Sequence-specific resonance assignment was obtained from analysis of spin systems and sequential patterns in 15N-13C-HNCA, 15N-HSQC-NOESY, and 15N-HSQC-TOCSY spectra in H2O, together with analysis of homonuclear NOESY (mix 40 ms, 120 ms), TOCSY (mix 100 ms), and COSY spectra in H2O, and of double-quantum filtered COSY, TOCSY (mix 40 ms) and NOESY spectra in D2O. NOEs were obtained from NOESY spectra in H2O and D2O recorded with 40-ms mixing time at 800 MHz. Coupling constants were derived from HSQC and NOESY cross-peak line-fitting (26Szyperski T. Guentert P. Otting G. Wuethrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 552-560Google Scholar) and from the comparison of signal intensities in a pair of constant-time 15N,1H-HMQC spectra recorded with and without decoupling of the JHNHα coupling (27Ponstingl H. Otting G. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed with the program PROSA (28Guntert P. Dotsch V. Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 619-629Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). All spectra were analyzed, and peaks were integrated with the program XEASY (29Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—The program ARIA1.2 (Ambiguous Restraints for Interactive Assignment) (30Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), as an extension of CNS1.1, was used to compute the solution structure of Grx4. NOE cross-peaks from the two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional NOESY spectra and chemical shift assignments were used as input to ARIA together with 77 backbone ϕ angles, which were constrained to –60° ± 20°, –120° ± 40°, and –120° ± 20° for small (<5.5 Hz), large (8 ± 1 Hz), and very large (>9 Hz) 3JHNHα couplings, respectively. Floating chirality assignment was used for all methylene and isopropyl groups with separate chemical shifts. The experimentally determined distance and dihedral-angle restraints were applied in a simulated annealing protocol using the program CNS, where the starting structure consisted of an extended structure with random side-chain conformations. Optimization of the structure calculation protocol for ambiguous distance restraints and violation analysis was performed as previously described (31Nilges M. O'Donoghue S.I. Progr. NMR Spectr. 1998; 32: 107-139Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The NOEs were calibrated and largely automatically assigned during the structure calculation by ARIA. The NOEs assigned after eight cycles of structure calculation were subjected to a process of manual editing by a careful re-examination of the spectra to improve the quality of the data set used for structure calculations. The new list of 2703 edited NOEs was used as input for a new set of calculations. Finally, backbone torsion angle restraints derived from chemical shifts using TALOS (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) were added to further improve the already converged unique structure. The dihedral angle restraints were taken to be ±2 S.D. values or at least ± 20° from the average values predicted by TALOS. A short molecular dynamics simulation in a thin layer of explicit water was used to refine the final structure ensemble (33Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C. Bonvin A. Nilges M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The resulting 20 energy-minimized conformations were selected to represent the NMR structure of Grx4. Structure Evaluation—The quality of the structures were evaluated using the PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4470) Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (35Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) softwares. The structures were displayed and analyzed using the MOLMOL (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) program, which was also, together with PROCHECK, used to calculate root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.). WHATIF was used to identify hydrogen bonds from structural criteria as well as tentative hydrogen bonds made possible with minor side-chain adjustments (Optimal Hydrogen Bonding Network (35Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar)). The three-dimensional structural similarity was assessed using the programs DALI (37Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and VAST (38Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 39Madej T. Gibrat J.F. Bryant S.H. Proteins. 1995; 23: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the hits were evaluated using r.m.s.d. divided by the number of aligned residues (r.m.s.d./Nalign) as described elsewhere (40Sierk M.L. Pearson W.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The program Consurf (41Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) was employed to identify functionally important regions on the surface of the protein, based on the phylogenetic relations between close sequence homologues to Grx4. Protein Data Bank Accession Number—The coordinates of the 20 energy minimized conformers of Grx4 were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, with the accession number 1YKA. The Solution Structure of Grx4—The high resolution structure of Grx4 was calculated from experimental constraints (Table I) by the structure calculation program ARIA (30Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Grx4 was completely assigned except for the 4 N-terminal residues, for which no amide proton resonance was observed, and Pro25, where no resonances were observed, most likely due to broadening by exchange in cis-trans isomerization. The 10 lowest energy structures were chosen to represent the NMR structure of Grx4 (Fig. 1A). An evaluation of the structure statistics of the ensemble (Table I) shows a well defined core domain, where the r.m.s.d. values for the regular secondary structure and the backbone heavy atoms of the ensemble were 0.49 and 0.58 Å, respectively. Within this core domain, which comprises residues 5–115, 84% of the residues are well distributed in the most favored region in the Ramachandran plot. The N-terminal 4 residues were unassigned due to rapid amide exchange and are therefore not included in the structure statistics. Long and medium range NOEs are well distributed over the entire protein (see Supplemental Material).Table IStructural statistics of Grx4Structural characteristics for the 10 lowest energy structures of Grx4Distance restraintsIntraresidue1034Sequential607Medium range, i — j ≤ 5374Long range, i — j > 5688All unambiguous2491All ambiguous212Dihedral angles restraints3JHNHa-derived ϕ77TALOS-derived ϕ, φ82, 82r.m.s.d. from idealityaAverage values.Bonds (Å)0.0052 ± 0.0001Angles (°)0.75 ± 0.02Improper ones (°)1.80 ± 0.11r.m.s.d. from experimental dataaAverage values.Unambiguous NOEs (Å)0.048 ± 0.015Ambiguous NOEs (Å)0.056 ± 0.004All NOEs (Å)0.049 ± 0.014Torsion angles constraints (°)2.08 ± 0.22Ensemble r.m.s.d.

Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4470) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Grx4 has a glutaredoxin/thioredoxin-like fold, which consists of a four-stranded β-sheet, flanked by five α-helices (Fig. 1A). Regular secondary structure elements were identified for residue 5–14 (α1), 17–21 (β1), 33–43 (α2), 48–51 (β2), 56–66 (α3), 73–76 (β3), 79–80 (β4), 84–93 (α4), and 95–107 (α5) in the majority of the NMR conformers. Residues 81–82, together with residue 74, form a structure almost definable as a classic β-bulge, a conserved feature in the corresponding position of the thioredoxin fold, but distances between 74O and 82NH are slightly above the threshold formally required for the formation of a hydrogen bond. Helices α1 and α3 are located on the same side of the β-sheet and are oriented orthogonally to each other. Helices α2, α4, and α5 are located on the opposite side of the β-sheet, where α2 and α4 are essentially parallel. Helices α4 and α5 are almost continuous in sequence but are structurally tilted by 90°, most likely facilitated by the conserved Gly94 interspaced between the helices. The C terminus of α5 is connected to the short loop between β3 and β4 through a hydrogen bond involving Tyr107 Oη and Asp77 Oδ1, which may be important in defining the orientation of α5. Well ordered side chains (r.m.s.d. < 1) are predominantly found in the core, or are partly buried (Fig. 1B). Seven well ordered side chains are exposed (>30%), including Gln54 and Pro56, in an exposed loop preceding α3, Pro69, which is strictly conserved within the monothiol family, and residues 38, 42, 89, and 92, in the exposed C-terminal parts of α2 and α4 (Fig. 1B). A set of 26 residues with side-chain solvent exposures of <10% defines the core of Grx4 (Fig. 2A). This core includes all of β1, one face of α2, β3 and the preceding loop, and the conserved GG glutaredoxin signature sequence (17Nordstrand K. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (residues 82–83). Residues Ile8, Ile12, Leu62, Pro63, Val87, Leu96, Ile100, Thr103, and Thr104 connect α1, α3, α4, and α5 to the solvent-excluded core. Residues Leu44, Ile52, and Asp113 are buried but do not form part of any secondary structure element. The suggested active site of Grx4 (Cys30–Ser33) is located on the molecular surface, N-terminal to α2, and appears partially disordered in the structure ensemble. Indeed, NOEs are scarce for both the active site and several preceding residues, which may be due to conformational exchange and/or to the exposed nature of the loop. However, parts of the active site region are rigid, as suggested by the cis-conformation adopted by Pro72, which is in close spatial proximity. The cis-peptide conformation was deduced from the presence of sequential dαα and the absence of sequential dαβ NOE between residues 71 and 72. A corresponding cis-Pro close to the active site is found in most glutaredoxins/thioredoxins and is thought to play a role in folding and redox dynamics (15Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A.

Cox11 is tethered to the mitochondrial inner membrane by a single transmembrane helix. Domain mapping was carried out to determine the functional segments of the Cox11 protein.

Studies on a series of SCO1/COX11 chimeras reveal that the matrix domain of Cox11 lacks a specific function, whereas the Cu(I) binding/donating function requires the yeast Cox11 sequence.

Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) 1The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome c oxidase; IM, inner membrane; IMS, IM space; TAP, tandem affinity purification; TM transmembrane. is the terminal enzyme in the respiratory chain of eukaryotes. Electrons generated from the oxidation of nutrients are channeled through the respiratory chain within the mitochondrion to CcO, where molecular oxygen is reduced to water (1Beinert H. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 781-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mammalian CcO consists of a 13-subunit complex embedded within the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). The IM differs from the outer membrane in being highly convoluted, folding into tubular structures called cristae where respiratory complexes predominate. The core enzyme, homologous to prokaryotic CcO, consists of three subunits containing the necessary cofactors for the reduction of oxygen and proton pumping (2Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar, 3Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The three core subunits, Cox1–3, are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, whereas the remaining 10 subunits are small nuclear-encoded polypeptides that pack on the outside of the core complex (3Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The peripheral subunits are believed to be important in regulation of the CcO function (4Beauvoit B. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The assembly of functional CcO is a multistep process. Subunits are synthesized on cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes; therefore, coordinate recruitment of the various subunits to an assembly site must occur (5Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). CcO requires multiple cofactors. Two heme A moieties exist within Cox1. Copper ions exist in two centers designated CuA and CuB enfolded by Cox2 and Cox1, respectively. The CuA center in Cox2 is the site of initial reduction by cytochrome c (6Zhen Y. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38032-38041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CuB center is buried within Cox1, forming a binuclear site with one of the two heme A cofactors (heme A3). Mg(II) and Zn(II) ions are also inserted in Cox1 and Cox4, respectively. As the focus of the present study is on formation of the CuB center in Cox1, the assembly of Cox1 will be reviewed. COX1 translation occurs on mitochondrial ribosomes associated with the IM. The ribosomal association with the IM is mediated in part by recruitment of the COX1 mRNA to the IM by Pet309, and translation is dependent on Mss51 and ShyI (7Manthey G.M. Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. McEwen J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Perez-Martinez X. Broadley S.A. Fox T.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two hemes A and single copper and magnesium ions are inserted into Cox1 during the assembly process. The heme A cofactor is synthesized from heme B by the addition of a hydroxyethylfarnesyl group by the Cox10 farnesyl transferase and oxidation of a pyrrole methyl group to a formyl group by the Cox15 monooxygenase in reactions requiring Yah1 ferredoxin and Arh1 ferredoxin reductase (10Barros M.H. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Barros M.H. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9997-10002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two heme A cofactors are deeply buried within Cox1, suggesting that heme A insertion must occur at an early step in the assembly of CcO. Consistent with this prediction, Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutants lacking Cox2 and Cox3 contained a single heme A moiety in the free Cox1 subunit (13Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Anthroline W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CuB site formation is dependent on the Cox11 protein. The critical observation suggesting a role for Cox11 in CuB site formation was the demonstration that cytochrome c oxidase isolated from R. sphaeroides Δcox11 cells lacked CuB but contained both hemes; however, heme A3 showed an altered environment by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (14Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The magnesium content of CcO isolated from the Δcox11 mutant was also low. Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Cox11 have impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity and failed to assemble the holoenzyme, so delineation of the precise step defective in this mutant is not possible (15Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The evidence from R. sphaeroides suggests clearly that Cox11 is specific for CuB site formation and perhaps Mg(II) insertion without affecting the binding of other cofactors. S. cerevisiae Cox11 is an intrinsic membrane protein within the inner mitochondrial membrane (15Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The protein is predicted to contain a single transmembrane helix (residues 85–107) downstream of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 1–45). The C-terminal domain of 189 residues is predicted to be exposed within the soluble mitochondrial inner membrane space (IMS) and binds a single Cu(I) ion (16Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cox11 was recently shown to project into the IMS (17Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Three conserved Cys residues are ligands for the Cu(I) ion in yeast Cox11 (16Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these Cys residues reduces Cu(I) binding and confers respiratory incompetence and reduced CcO activity. Thus, the residues important for Cu(I) binding correlate with in vivo function, suggesting that Cu(I) binding is important in Cox11 function. This suggestion is confirmed by the recently reported structure of the soluble domain of a Cox11 homolog from Sinorhizobium meliloti. The protein adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold and dimerizes upon Cu(I) binding to form a binuclear Cu(I) thiolate cluster at the dimer interface (18Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Mangani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34833-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The steps in CcO assembly have been studied in mammalian cells using either inhibition of protein synthesis or mutant cell lines to trap assembly intermediates. Inhibition of protein synthesis in cultured human cells results in the appearance of complexes containing a subset of CcO subunits (19Nijtmans L.G. Taanman J.W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). One subcomplex contained Cox1 and Cox4. Additional support for assembly intermediates comes from cells of patients with mutations in CcO assembly factors. Cells from patients with mutations in SURF1 or SCO1 reveal a subcomplex of Cox1 associated with Cox4 and Cox5A (17Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Williams S.L. Valnot I. Rustin P. Taanman J-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This subcomplex is not observed in cells from patients with mutations in COX10, suggesting that a heme A insertion may occur prior to formation of the Cox1-Cox4-Cox5A subcomplex. Heme A3 site assembly was recently shown to require SURF1 (ShyI) (21Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, DOI10.1074/jbc.C500061200)Google Scholar). Mutations have not been observed in human COX11; thus, tools are not available to determine whether CuB site formation occurs prior to formation of the Cox1-Cox4-Cox5A subcomplex. However, because the CuB ion is buried and in a binuclear complex with heme A3, it is reasonable to assume that CuB formation is concurrent with heme A insertion. One clue as to the timing of CuB formation emerged from the observation that Cox11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe exists as a fusion protein, with the partner protein being homologous to the S. cerevisiae protein Rsm22. Rsm22 was recently found to be associated with a number of proteins of the small mitochondrial ribosome (22Saveanu C. Fromont-Racine M. Harington A. Ricard F. Namane A. Jacquier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15861-15867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of Rsm22 in mitochondrial translation, cells lacking Rsm22 are respiratory deficient. The presence of the Rsm22-like domain at the N terminus of the S. pombe Cox11 fusion protein suggests that Cox11 may function to form the CuB site in nascent Cox1 chains emerging from the mitochondrial ribosomes. The interrelationship of Cox11 and Rsm22 is explored in this present study. Yeast Strains—Δcox11 yeast cells were obtained from Research Genetics and were in the BY4742 background (mat α, Δleu2 Δlys Δhis3 Δura3). To prevent loss of mitochondrial function, the Δrsm22 strain was generated with a plasmid-borne functional copy of RSM22 fused to COX11. The Δrsm22 strain was generated by first transforming W303 with pRSM22/COX11, followed by integration of the KanMX cassette flanked by 350 bp 5′ and 3′ of the untranslated region of RSM22. Integration into the desired RSM22 locus was verified by PCR and sequencing of genomic DNA of positive transformants. Analysis of the null strain and RSM22 was permitted by transformation with the desired constructs on a HIS3-selectable vector followed by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. Strain LMA87, bearing TAP-tagged RSM22, was a generous gift from A. Jacquier and C. Saveanu. Plasmids—Two SCO1/COX11 chimeras were engineered. The matrix domain of Cox11, containing residues 55–75, was replaced with the corresponding segment of Sco1, residues 48–68. The resulting molecule contained the mitochondrial target sequence of Cox11, the matrix domain of Sco1, and Cox11 sequences downstream of Sco1 residue 68. Overlapping PCR was used to generate the COX11/SCO1/COX11 chimera containing a 2× Myc epitope tag at the 3′-end of the open reading frame, which was inserted into the YCp pRS416 with the MET25 promoter and the CYC1 terminator. The 5′ 98 codons of SCO1 were fused in-frame to codon 100 of yeast COX11 through a HindIII site. The restriction site created an Arg → Lys mutation that, in the context of SCO1, did not affect its ability to complement the Δsco1 phenotype. Yeast/human COX11 chimeras were engineered in vector pRS316 with the MET25 promoter cloned into the SacI-XbaI sites and the CYC1 terminator cloned into the XhoI-KpnI sites. Yeast COX11 from the ATG to 75 bp 3′ of the stop codon was amplified with primers containing XbaI and HindIII sites, respectively, and inserted into pRS416 (pHC10). The template for human COX11 was obtained from Research Genetics. Clone 5224659 contained a complete contig that aligned with the predicted sequence of human COX11. This construct was amplified with primers containing XbaI and HindIII sites and ligated into pRS416 under the control of the MET25 promoter and the CYC1 terminator (vector pHC11). pHC12 contains the sequence coding for a chimera containing the yeast COX11 up to the codon for Thr-84, followed by the sequence coding for the human COX11 from the codon for Thr-95 to the stop codon. pHC13 contains the sequence coding for a chimera containing the human COX11 up to the codon for Ser-110, followed by the yeast COX11 from the codon for Tyr-101 to the stop codon. Myc-tagged epitopes were generated by overlap extension PCR, inserting two Myc epitopes 5′ to the stop codons. Human COX17 was amplified and subcloned into Ycplac111 under the control of the MET25 promoter and the CYC1 terminator. Vector-encoded RSM22 was constructed by using a forward primer containing a XhoI site and 325 bp upstream of the start codon of RSM22 and a reverse primer containing a HindIII site and 300 bp 3′ to the stop codon. The expected 2.5-kb fragment was cloned into pRS426 (pHC6) and sequenced. The fusion RSM22-COX11 was generated by mutagenesis; a SpeI site was engineered 5′ to the stop codon of RSM22 in pHC6 and fused to codons for Leu-61 and Thr-62 in COX11. Positive transformants were sequenced to verify that there were no mutations and subcloned into pRS426 in separate steps to generate pHC7 with HIS3 selection. The fusion product was also cloned into pRS423 (URA3 selection) for plasmid shuffle experiments. General Methods—Yeast were grown in standard synthetic media lacking appropriate amino acids for the selection of positive clones. Mitochondrial isolations and CcO assays were performed as described previously (23Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), with the cells grown with galactose as the carbon source. Serial dilution drop tests were plated on glucose and glycerol as usual. PCR was performed using Taq or Pfu, depending on length of construct, followed by sequencing to verify the absence of undesirable mutations. Western blots were developed using the following dilutions of antibodies: 1:5000 anti-Myc and then 1:10,000 anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase or 1:15,000 anti-porin, 1:3000 anti-3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 1:5000 anti-superoxide dismutase-2, and 1:5000 anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Pierce were utilized for chemiluminescent detection. Mitochondrial localization was determined by trypsin digest of intact, hypotonically lysed, and detergent-solubilized mitochondria. 100–400 μg mitochondria were pelleted and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (0.6 m sorbitol and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), 50 mm HEPES, or 0.25% deoxycholate to 5 mg/ml. 12.5 μg of trypsin or buffer was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Proteolysis was halted by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 20 mm. Samples were centrifuged to separate soluble proteins from intact mitochondria. Pellets were resuspended in HEPES to the same volume as the supernatant, and 6× SDS buffer was added prior to Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were performed using mitochondria isolated from LMA87 (RSM22-TAP) transformed with pCOX11-Myc. Mitochondria were pelleted and resuspended in cross-linking buffer to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. The cross-linker dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate from Pierce was added to a final concentration of 2 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of Tris (pH 8) to a final concentration of 150 mm. Mitochondria were pelleted and resuspended in solubilization buffer and incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C. Insoluble material was separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation at 4 °C (16,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was cleared by incubation with Sepharose for 30 min. After clarification, the mitochondrial lysates were incubated with rabbit IgG agarose for 4–8 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were washed with 3 volumes of solubilization buffer. IgG beads were boiled in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol and SDS buffer, and Western blots were performed. Domain mapping was carried out on yeast Cox11 to determine which segment of the polypeptide is essential for its role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase. Cox11 contains a single transmembrane (TM) domain that separates a short N-terminal domain and a 22-kDa soluble domain that is predicted to project into the IMS (Fig. 1A). We initially sought to confirm this membrane orientation of Cox11. Mitochondria and mitoplasts isolated from Δcox11 cells containing the C-terminal Myc-tagged Cox11 were incubated in the presence and absence of trypsin prior to Western analysis. The Myc epitope was proteolytically cleaved in mitoplasts and detergent-solubilized mitochondria but not whole mitochondria, consistent with the C-terminal segment projecting into the soluble IMS (Fig. 2). To determine the functional significance of the three domains of Cox11, chimeric molecules were engineered by replacing each domain with a corresponding domain from a second CcO assembly protein, Sco1, which has a similar domain structure and also resides within the mitochondrial inner membrane (12Rentzsch A. Krummeck-Weiss G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal Cu(I)-binding domain projects into the IMS, the N-terminal segment upstream of the TM must exist within the matrix. To test whether this matrix domain is functionally important, the segment encoding the matrix domain of COX11 (codons 55–75) was replaced with the corresponding segment of SCO1 (codons 48–68). Cells (Δcox11) transformed with this fusion gene, designated mSCO1/COX11, were respiratory competent. Western blot analysis confirmed the accumulation of the Myc-tagged chimeric protein (Fig. 3B). The functionality of this chimera and the lack of sequence similarity in the matrix domain between yeast and human Cox11 (Fig. 1B) confirm that the matrix domain is nonessential for Cox11 function (Fig. 3A). The second domain, the TM domain of Cox11, shows sequence conservation among eukaryotic species. To determine whether the sequence of this segment is essential for the Cox11 physiological function, a segment of COX11 encoding the 3′ 100 codons was fused to the 5′ 98 codons of SCO1, resulting in a Sco1/Cox11 chimera containing the mitochondrial target sequence and the TM of Sco1 fused to the soluble Cu(I)-binding domain of Cox11. This chimeric gene failed to complement a Δcox11 strain of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 3A), even though the chimera was stably expressed within the mitochondrion (Fig. 3B). The third domain is the IMS Cu(I)-binding domain. As expected, the Cu(I)-binding domain of Sco1 cannot replace the Cu(I)-binding domain of Cox11. A chimeric protein consisting of residues 1–107 of Cox11 fused to residues 98–295 of Sco1 was nonfunctional (data not shown). As a more conservative approach, we tested whether the human COX11 can complement Δcox11 yeast cells. Transformants of Δcox11 cells with Myc-tagged human COX11 failed to grow on glycerol medium (Fig. 4B), but little Myc-tagged human Cox11 protein accumulated within mitochondria (Fig. 4C). Human COX11 failed to complement Δcox11 cells even when overexpressed. Although the Cu(I)-binding domains of human and yeast Cox11 are highly similar in sequence, the two proteins differ in that the yeast protein is considerably longer at the C-terminal end (Figs. 1B and 4A). However, the C-terminal extension in yeast Cox11 is functionally unimportant, as a C-terminal truncate of yeast Cox11 lacking the last 37 residues did not impair function (data not shown). The non-functionality of human Cox11 in yeast Δcox11 cells may arise from the sequence variation within the copper-binding domain. To test this prediction, a human/yeast chimeric Cox11 molecule was engineered with the boundary separating human and yeast sequences near the end of the TM domain where the two sequences are identical (residues 1–110 of human Cox11 fused to residue 101 of yeast Cox11) (see arrow in Fig. 1B; also see Fig. 4A). The chimeric gene was expressed in Δcox11 cells under the control of the yeast COX11 promoter and terminator. Fusion of the human Cox11 N terminus containing the TM to the yeast Cox11 Cu-binding domain (construct 3 in Fig. 4A) allowed weak glycerol growth (Fig. 4B) and cytochrome c oxidase activity of Δcox11 cells (data not shown). The weak complementation was improved by overexpression of this chimera (data not shown). To test whether the human Cu(I)-binding domain could functionally replace the yeast Cu(I)-binding domain, a yeast/human COX11 chimera was constructed with a similar junction to the partially functional human/yeast chimera. The yeast/human chimera (construct 4 in Fig. 4A) was unable to suppress the glycerol auxotrophy of a Δcox11 strain even though the protein was well expressed (Fig. 4, B and C). A yeast/human Cox11 chimera was constructed in which the boundary was moved further downstream of the TM (residue 161, chimera 5) (Fig. 4A). This chimera was nonfunctional when expressed in Δcox11 cells under the yeast COX11 promoter and terminator or when overexpressed (data not shown). The nonfunctional state of the human Cox11 Cu(I)-binding domain may arise from an inability of yeast Cox17 to deliver Cu(I) to the human Cox11 because of an attenuated interaction between the two proteins. We demonstrated that Cox17 is a physiological Cu(I) donor to Cox11 (26Horng Y-C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The addition of human Cox17 to yeast cells containing the yeast/human Cox11 chimera (construct 4 in Fig. 4A) failed to restore glycerol growth to Δcox11 cells containing the human Cox11 copper-binding domain (data not shown). These cells contained a wild-type yeast Cox17 that would be competent to transfer Cu(I) to Sco1. Suppression was observed only when yeast COX11 was transformed into these cells. It was not possible to test the prediction that human Cox11 requires a human Cox1 target, because COX1 is mitochondrially encoded and translational activators for human COX1 are not identified. The Cox11 homolog in S. pombe contains a 520-amino acid N-terminal extension (Fig. 5A). The extension sequence is highly similar that of to the S. cerevisiae protein Rsm22, which is associated with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (22Saveanu C. Fromont-Racine M. Harington A. Ricard F. Namane A. Jacquier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15861-15867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fusion is the only copy of the Rsm22-like sequence in S. pombe. To test whether a fusion of S. cerevisiae Rsm22 and Cox11 proteins can functionally replace each individual molecule, a chimeric protein was engineered such that the RSM22 open reading frame was fused in-frame to codon 61 of COX11. Removal of the first 60 codons of COX11 removes the mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fig. 1A). Thus, cleavage of the fusion protein prior to mitochondrial uptake would result in a failure of the Cox11 fragment to be properly imported into the mitochondrion. Cells lacking Cox11 (Δcox11) were transformed with an episomal RSM22-COX11 fusion gene and plated on medium containing the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol. Whereas Δcox11 cells fail to grow on glycerol-containing medium, Δcox11 transformants with pRSM22/COX11 grew as well as wild-type cells (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis of cells containing the Myc-tagged Rsm22/Cox11 fusion revealed a prominent band of the expected size for the chimeric protein (Fig. 5C). Quantitation of cytochrome c oxidase activity of purified mitochondria isolated from Δcox11 transformants with pRSM22/COX11 revealed levels of activity greater than those of wild-type (Fig. 5D). The functionality of the Rsm22/Cox11 fusion confirms that the N terminus of Cox11 projects into the matrix. Rsm22 is important for maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. Because cells lacking Rsm22 are petite, RSM22 was deleted in cells harboring a URA3-based vector encoding RSM22. Cells containing a disruption of the chromosomal RSM22 locus were transformed with the pRSM22-COX11 fusion gene on a HIS3-based vector prior to shedding the URA3-based RSM22 vector using 5-fluoroorotic acid. Cells (Δrsm22) containing only the pRSM22/COX11 plasmid were able to propagate on glycerol-containing medium (Fig. 5B). Mitochondria isolated from the transformants showed wild-type levels of cytochrome c oxidase activity, suggesting that the fusion protein was fully functional (Fig. 5D). The functionality of the fusion protein is consistent with a potential interaction in S. cerevisiae. To test for an interaction between the two proteins, cells containing a 3′ TAP-tagged chromosomal RSM22 locus was transformed with a MYC-tagged COX11 fusion. The TAP tag encodes a calmodulin-binding peptide followed by protein A (24Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Mitochondria isolated from the transformants were detergent-solubilized and precipitated with immunoglobulin beads either with or without cross-linking. Immunoprecipitation of TAP-Rsm22 was successful, and multiple proteins were copurified; however, Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate with anti-Myc antibodies did not reproducibly show co-immunoprecipitation of Cox11 and Rsm22. Thus, any potential interaction of endogenous Rsm22 and Cox11 may be only transient or indirect in S. cerevisiae. Cox11 is an intrinsic membrane protein with a single TM domain tethering the protein within the IM (15Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 189-residue C-terminal Cu(I)-binding domain was predicted to be exposed within the IMS (16Carr H.S. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and this orientation was confirmed by two independent approaches in the present study. First, insertion of a Myc-epitope tag at the C terminus of Cox11 resulted in proteolytic susceptibility in mitoplasts but not intact mitochondria. Second, the fusion of Cox11 with a candidate matrix ribosomal protein in S. pombe is consistent with the Cox11 N terminus being within the matrix. The corresponding partner protein in S. cerevisiae is the mitochondrial matrix protein Rsm22. A fusion of Rsm22 to the N terminus of Cox11 resulted in a stable fusion protein that was able to suppress the respiratory defect of both Δcox11 and Δrsm22 cells. The N terminus of Cox11 must project into the matrix resulting in the Cu(I)-binding domain of Cox11 projecting into the IMS. Studies of human/yeast Cox11 chimeric molecules revealed the importance of the yeast Cu(I)-binding domain sequence for function within S. cerevisiae. Replacing the yeast Cu(I)-binding domain by the human equivalent failed to generate a functional complex even though the chimeric protein was stable. Likewise, the Cu(I)-binding domains of human Sco1 and Sco2 fail to functionally replace the yeast domain (25Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, a segment of human Sco1 downstream of the CXXXC motif can replace the corresponding segment of yeast Sco1 (25Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A corresponding yeast/human chimera of Cox11 is nonfunctional. In the case of Cox11, sequence differences in the human copper domain may attenuate an important interaction for a Cu(I) donor protein or a Cox1-associated protein. The inability of human COX11 to complement yeast Δcox11 cells is not reversed by human COX17 that is weakly functional in yeast (27Amaravadi R. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that human Cox11 may be impaired in its interaction with another protein, perhaps Cox1 itself. The fusion of Cox11 with a candidate matrix ribosomal protein in S. pombe suggests that Cox11 function may occur during mitochondrial translation of the COX1 mRNA. COX1 translation is known to occur on ribosomes tethered to the inner membrane by an interaction with the inner membrane protein Pet309, which binds to a structural element in the 5′-untranslated region of COX1 (7Manthey G.M. Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. McEwen J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pet309 is associated with the other translational activators for COX1 and COX2 (28Naithani S. Saracco S.A. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One of the COX3 activators, Pet122, appears to directly interact with a ribosomal protein in the small subunit (29McMullin T.W. Haffter P. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4590-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, translation of COX1, COX2, and COX3 is tightly associated with the IM. It is likely that translation of COX1 is coupled with the insertion of heme A and copper cofactors, because the cofactors are buried and a candidate channel for copper addition in Cox1 is blocked when Cox1 associates with Cox2. Recently, ShyI was shown to be important for heme A3 site formation (21Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, DOI10.1074/jbc.C500061200)Google Scholar). Heme A3 and CuB site formation can occur independently of each other (14Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Smith D. Gray J. Mitchell L. Antholine W.E. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (March 11, DOI10.1074/jbc.C500061200)Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment of both ShyI and Cox11 to sites on the IM involved in COX1 translation is likely. The recruitment of Cox11 to sites of COX1 translation may be mediated by an interaction with Rsm22. We were unsuccessful in detecting any stable interaction between Cox11 and Rsm22. If an interaction exists, it is unlikely that the interaction interface consists of the matrix domain of Cox11, because a Sco1/Cox11 chimera containing the Sco1 matrix domain in place of the Cox11 matrix domain was fully functional and the human Cox11 matrix sequence was not conserved with the yeast sequence. Upon cleavage of the mitochondrial target sequence in yeast Cox11, only 39 residues protrude into the matrix. While this paper was under review, a report appeared showing a weak interaction of Cox11 with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein MrpL36 (30Khalimonchuk O. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Khalimonchuk et al. showed that Cox11 fractionates with mitoribosomes and suggested that CuB formation in Cox1 occurs cotranslationally (30Khalimonchuk O. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 2005; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data on domain mapping suggest that any interaction of Cox11 with a ribosomal protein would be indirect, because the matrix domain is non-essential. An interaction between Rsm22 and Cox11 may be mediated by another protein such as Pet309. Pet309 has multiple TM domains, so Cox11 may also be recruited to the site of Cox1 synthesis by interaction with IMS or TM segments of Pet309. Ribosomal proteins are abundant molecules, unlike Cox11, so it is curious that the S. pombe homolog is fused to a ribosomal protein. However, neither Rsm22 nor Cox11 appear to be stoichiometric with many S. cerevisiae ribosomal subunit proteins (22Saveanu C. Fromont-Racine M. Harington A. Ricard F. Namane A. Jacquier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15861-15867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Neither Rsm22 nor Pet309 have obvious homologs outside fungi, so it is unclear whether similar assembly steps occur in mammalian cells."

Although both PKCβII and PKCε can phosphorylate cTnI, only PKCβ expression and activity are elevated in failing human myocardium during end-stage heart failure. Furthermore, although increased cTnI phosphorylation was observed in mice with cardiac-specific PKCβ II overexpression, no differences were observed in cTnI phosphorylation status between wild type and cardiac-specific PKCε overexpression mice. A potentially important downstream effector of PKCs is p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), which plays an important role in cell growth by activating several transcription factors as well as Na+/H+ exchanger. Since both Ser23 and Ser24 of cTnI are contained in putative consensus sequences of p90RSK phosphorylation sites, we hypothesized that p90RSK is downstream from PKCβ II and can be a cTnI (Ser23/24) kinase. p90RSK, but not ERK1/2 activation, was increased in PKCβII overexpression mice but not in PKCε overexpression mice. p90RSK could phosphorylate cTnI in vitro with high substrate affinity but not cardiac troponin T (cTnT). To confirm the role of p90RSK in cTnI phosphorylation in vivo, we generated adenovirus containing a dominant negative form of p90RSK (Ad-DN-p90RSK). We found that the inhibition of p90RSK prevented H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 and PKCα/βII activation. Next, we generated cardiac-specific p90RSK transgenic mice and observed that cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation was significantly increased. LY333,531, a specific PKCβ inhibitor, inhibited both p90RSK and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation by H2 O2.

In particular, a strong correlation has been made between increased ROS, activation of specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and many functional consequences of diabetes (1Dhalla N.S. Liu X. Panagia V. Takeda N. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 2Malhotra A. Sanghi V. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This correlation has been strengthened by previous transgenic experiments in the heart, where overexpression of the PKCβ isoform, but not PKCε, decreased cardiac function (3Takeishi Y. Chu G. Kirkpatrick D.M. Li Z. Wakasaki H. Kranias E.G. King G.L. Walsh R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 5Takeishi Y. Ping P. Bolli R. Kirkpatrick D.L. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that distinct PKC isoforms may play differential functional roles in cell signaling pathways leading to cardiac dysfunction, but the exact significance of individual isoforms is not yet known.The family of PKCs includes at least 11 isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ), representing the major downstream targets for lipid second messenger or phorbol esters (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms are classified into classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ), which are Ca2+-dependent and contain two cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like motifs (C1 region) that bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester and a Ca2+/phospholipids binding domain (C2 region). Novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ, μ) are diacylglycerol-sensitive but Ca2+-independent because of the absence of the C2 region, and atypical PKCs (ζ, λ) are rather insensitive to diacylglycerol as they lack one cysteine-rich motif in their C1 region but can be activated by phosphatidylserine. Our colleagues have previously reported that in failing human myocardium with end-stage heart failure, the expression and activity of Ca2+-sensitive PKCα and -β isoforms are elevated (8Bowling N. Walsh R.A. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G.E. Fouts R.L. Mintze K. Pickard T. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Sabbah H.N. Mizrahi J.L. Gromo G. King G.L. Vlahos C.J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac-specific overexpression of PKCβII isoform in mice causes left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and decreased in vivo left ventricular performance (4Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Of note, these PKCβII transgenic mice have greater phosphorylation of the myofilament regulatory protein cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which decreases sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to Ca2+ and may lead to cardiac dysfunction (3Takeishi Y. Chu G. Kirkpatrick D.M. Li Z. Wakasaki H. Kranias E.G. King G.L. Walsh R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, cardiac-specific overexpression of a constitutively active PKCε mutant results in mild concentric hypertrophy, normal left ventricular performance, no change in cTnI phosphorylation, and an increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (9Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Solaro R.J. Moir A.J. Perry S.V. Nature. 1976; 262: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Since both PKCβ and PKCε could phosphorylate cTnI (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how PKCβII and PKCε can differently regulate cTnI phosphorylation.p90RSK has multiple functions. In quiescent cells, inactive p90RSK resides in the cytoplasm and is partially complexed with its upstream regulator, ERK1/2 (13Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cells by growth factors or ROS operating through Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/2 pathways leads to the activation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation and activation of p90RSK, and the import of these kinases into nucleus. It has been proposed that p90RSK is involved in activation of nuclear factor-κB by phosphorylation of Iκ-B (14Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or phosphorylates transcription factors, including c-Fos (15Chen R-H. Chung J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1861-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Nur77 (16Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and cAMP-response element-binding protein (17Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported that p90RSK is a serum-stimulated Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE-1) kinase and that p90RSK regulates its activity (18Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the role of p90RSK in the heart remains unclear.We have previously demonstrated that H2O2-mediated p90RSK activation is partially dependent on PKC activation in Jurkat cells (19Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the role of specific PKC isoforms on cardiac p90RSK activation in vivo, we utilized mice with cardiac-specific PKCβII and PKCε overexpression. We show here that p90RSK activation is specifically up-regulated in PKCβII transgenic (Tg) mice but not in PKCε-Tg mice. Since cTnI possesses putative phosphorylation sites of p90RSK at Ser23 and Ser24, and cTnI phosphorylation only increases in PKCβII-Tg mice, we hypothesized that cTnI (Ser23/24) was a p90RSK substrate. We demonstrate here that p90RSK can directly phosphorylate cTnI, and p90RSK activation is required for H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. To determine the role of p90RSK activation in vivo, we also generated cardiac-specific p90RSK overexpression mice, and we report here that cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation is increased in these mice. Taken together, these data support the importance of p90RSK activation in H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. The PKCβ-p90RSK-cTnI (Ser23/24) signaling pathway described here may present a new redox-sensitive mechanism to regulate cardiac function via cTnI phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that p90RSK activation regulates H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation by p90RSK. In addition, we found that p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation were increased in PKCβII-Tg but not in PKCε-Tg mice and that the PKCβ inhibitor prevented H2O2-mediated p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. These data support a critical role for PKCβII in regulating p90RSK activation and subsequent cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. It has been reported that specific PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser43/45 of cTnI plays an important role in regulating force development in cardiac muscle (9Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since p90RSK kinase, which is downstream of PKCβII, could phosphorylate Ser23/24 in N-terminal of cTnI, and PKC phosphorylation sites of Ser43/45 already exist on cTnI, there appears to be a novel complexity of PKCβII activation on cTnI function in vivo.p90RSK consists of three isoforms that show the same overall structure consisting of two kinase domains, a linker region, and short N-terminal and C-terminal tails. The C-terminal kinase belongs to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase group of kinases, but the only known function of the C-terminal kinase is the regulation of the activity of N-terminal kinases. The N-terminal kinase belongs to the AGC group of kinases, which include PKA and PKC. The N-terminal kinase is responsible for phosphorylating the RSK substrates and recognizes the basic consensus motif: (R/K)XRXX(S/T), or RRX(S/T), which fits to both Ser23 and Ser24 of cTnI (20RRRSSN25) (32Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).In the current study, we also determined that human cardiac TnI residues 41-45 can be phosphorylated by p90RSK using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. TnI residues 41-45 contains two Ser at positions 42 and 44, which have been reported as major PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in cardiac TnI (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although these sites do not show a consensus sequence of p90RSK phosphorylation sites, it is still possible that p90RSK can phosphorylate these Ser42 and Ser44 sites because the RSK amino-terminal kinase domain is homologous to the kinase domains in other members of the AGC family, including PKA, various PKCs, and p70RSK (34Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).It should also be mentioned that during the preparation of this study, Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have published that Ser23 or Ser24 of cTnI is the most permissive site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated cTnI with Ser42 and/or Ser44, previously reported as the phosphorylation sites of PKC (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), could not be detected. They explained the discrepancy of their data with a previous report (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by the different usage of their recombinant PKC (Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) instead of a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain (Noland et al. (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). Since we found that endogenous p90RSK activation was regulated by PKCβ (Fig. 6) and also detected coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous p90RSK with PKCβ (data not shown), it may be possible that activation of p90RSK is responsible for Ser42/44 phosphorylation in a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this issue.The activation of PKC and increased diacylglycerol levels initiated by hyperglycemia are associated with many vascular abnormalities in retinal, renal, and cardiovascular disease (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 37Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). It has been reported that increased PKC activity in diabetic rat hearts could be due to β and ζ isoforms (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect ERK1/2 activation in PKCβ-Tg mouse hearts, we observed significant activation of p90RSK activation. We have previously reported the presence of another ROS-stimulated pathway that activates p90RSK independently of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (19Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is possible that PKCβII directly phosphorylates p90RSK and activates p90RSK activation, but this is beyond the scope of this study.Desensitization of myofibrils to Ca2+ appears to oppose the inotropic effect produced by phospholamban and sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel phosphorylation, but several studies also indicate that cTnI phosphorylation by PKA plays an essential role in the rate of force production (10Solaro R.J. Moir A.J. Perry S.V. Nature. 1976; 262: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T. Layland J. Palmer S. Leiden J.M. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of cTnI increases the rates of cross-bridge cycling, and transgenic mouse hearts expressing constitutively phosphorylated cTnI at PKA phosphorylation sites exhibit augmented force production and faster relaxation (39Takimoto E. Soergel D.G. Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Kass D.A. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We generated cardiac-specific p90RSK transgenic mice and found that TnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation was increased as shown in Fig. 5. In the current study, we focused on the role of p90RSK to phosphorylate cTnI (Ser23/24), as a downstream event to PKCβII activation. Since we also found that p90RSK can phosphorylate and regulate NHE-1 activity, it would be intriguing to determine the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function via regulating cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation and NHE-1 activation, especially after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Since the cell localization of PKA and p90RSK is apparently different and compartmentation of kinase may be critical to determine its downstream effect (20Cavet M.E. Lehoux S. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18376-18383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Reinitz C.A. Bianco R.A. Shabb J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the effect of cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation on cardiac function may be also different between p90RSK and PKA, although they could phosphorylate the same sites of cTnI. Further studies will be required to clarify the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function and Ca2+ sensitivity via cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. IntroductionThere is increasing support for the idea that excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase; p90RSK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; NHE-1, Na+/H+ exchanger-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; NLC, non-transgenic littermate control; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tg, transgenic; DN, dominant negative. contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes. In particular, a strong correlation has been made between increased ROS, activation of specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and many functional consequences of diabetes (1Dhalla N.S. Liu X.

This correlation has been strengthened by previous transgenic experiments in the heart, where overexpression of the PKCβ isoform, but not PKCε, decreased cardiac function (3Takeishi Y. Chu G. Kirkpatrick D.M. Li Z. Wakasaki H. Kranias E.G. King G.L. Walsh R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R.

Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that distinct PKC isoforms may play differential functional roles in cell signaling pathways leading to cardiac dysfunction, but the exact significance of individual isoforms is not yet known.The family of PKCs includes at least 11 isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, λ, μ), representing the major downstream targets for lipid second messenger or phorbol esters (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 7Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms are classified into classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ), which are Ca2+-dependent and contain two cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like motifs (C1 region) that bind diacylglycerol or phorbol ester and a Ca2+/phospholipids binding domain (C2 region). Novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ, μ) are diacylglycerol-sensitive but Ca2+-independent because of the absence of the C2 region, and atypical PKCs (ζ, λ) are rather insensitive to diacylglycerol as they lack one cysteine-rich motif in their C1 region but can be activated by phosphatidylserine. Our colleagues have previously reported that in failing human myocardium with end-stage heart failure, the expression and activity of Ca2+-sensitive PKCα and -β isoforms are elevated (8Bowling N. Walsh R.A. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G.E. Fouts R.L. Mintze K. Pickard T. Roden R. Bristow M.R. Sabbah H.N. Mizrahi J.L. Gromo G. King G.L. Vlahos C.J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, cardiac-specific overexpression of PKCβII isoform in mice causes left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and decreased in vivo left ventricular performance (4Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schoen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9320-9325Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Of note, these PKCβII transgenic mice have greater phosphorylation of the myofilament regulatory protein cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which decreases sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to Ca2+ and may lead to cardiac dysfunction (3Takeishi Y. Chu G. Kirkpatrick D.M. Li Z. Wakasaki H. Kranias E.G. King G.L. Walsh R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, cardiac-specific overexpression of a constitutively active PKCε mutant results in mild concentric hypertrophy, normal left ventricular performance, no change in cTnI phosphorylation, and an increase in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (9Noland Jr., T.A.

Since both PKCβ and PKCε could phosphorylate cTnI (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how PKCβII and PKCε can differently regulate cTnI phosphorylation.p90RSK has multiple functions. In quiescent cells, inactive p90RSK resides in the cytoplasm and is partially complexed with its upstream regulator, ERK1/2 (13Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cells by growth factors or ROS operating through Ras/Raf-1/MEK1/2 pathways leads to the activation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation and activation of p90RSK, and the import of these kinases into nucleus. It has been proposed that p90RSK is involved in activation of nuclear factor-κB by phosphorylation of Iκ-B (14Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or phosphorylates transcription factors, including c-Fos (15Chen R-H. Chung J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we reported that p90RSK is a serum-stimulated Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE-1) kinase and that p90RSK regulates its activity (18Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the role of p90RSK in the heart remains unclear.We have previously demonstrated that H2O2-mediated p90RSK activation is partially dependent on PKC activation in Jurkat cells (19Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the role of specific PKC isoforms on cardiac p90RSK activation in vivo, we utilized mice with cardiac-specific PKCβII and PKCε overexpression. We show here that p90RSK activation is specifically up-regulated in PKCβII transgenic (Tg) mice but not in PKCε-Tg mice. Since cTnI possesses putative phosphorylation sites of p90RSK at Ser23 and Ser24, and cTnI phosphorylation only increases in PKCβII-Tg mice, we hypothesized that cTnI (Ser23/24) was a p90RSK substrate. We demonstrate here that p90RSK can directly phosphorylate cTnI, and p90RSK activation is required for H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. To determine the role of p90RSK activation in vivo, we also generated cardiac-specific p90RSK overexpression mice, and we report here that cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation is increased in these mice. Taken together, these data support the importance of p90RSK activation in H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. The PKCβ-p90RSK-cTnI (Ser23/24) signaling pathway described here may present a new redox-sensitive mechanism to regulate cardiac function via cTnI phosphorylation.

The PKCβ-p90RSK-cTnI (Ser23/24) signaling pathway described here may present a new redox-sensitive mechanism to regulate cardiac function via cTnI phosphorylation. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that p90RSK activation regulates H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation by p90RSK. In addition, we found that p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation were increased in PKCβII-Tg but not in PKCε-Tg mice and that the PKCβ inhibitor prevented H2O2-mediated p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. These data support a critical role for PKCβII in regulating p90RSK activation and subsequent cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. It has been reported that specific PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser43/45 of cTnI plays an important role in regulating force development in cardiac muscle (9Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since p90RSK kinase, which is downstream of PKCβII, could phosphorylate Ser23/24 in N-terminal of cTnI, and PKC phosphorylation sites of Ser43/45 already exist on cTnI, there appears to be a novel complexity of PKCβII activation on cTnI function in vivo.p90RSK consists of three isoforms that show the same overall structure consisting of two kinase domains, a linker region, and short N-terminal and C-terminal tails. The C-terminal kinase belongs to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase group of kinases, but the only known function of the C-terminal kinase is the regulation of the activity of N-terminal kinases. The N-terminal kinase belongs to the AGC group of kinases, which include PKA and PKC. The N-terminal kinase is responsible for phosphorylating the RSK substrates and recognizes the basic consensus motif: (R/K)XRXX(S/T), or RRX(S/T), which fits to both Ser23 and Ser24 of cTnI (20RRRSSN25) (32Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).In the current study, we also determined that human cardiac TnI residues 41-45 can be phosphorylated by p90RSK using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. TnI residues 41-45 contains two Ser at positions 42 and 44, which have been reported as major PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in cardiac TnI (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although these sites do not show a consensus sequence of p90RSK phosphorylation sites, it is still possible that p90RSK can phosphorylate these Ser42 and Ser44 sites because the RSK amino-terminal kinase domain is homologous to the kinase domains in other members of the AGC family, including PKA, various PKCs, and p70RSK (34Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).It should also be mentioned that during the preparation of this study, Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have published that Ser23 or Ser24 of cTnI is the most permissive site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated cTnI with Ser42 and/or Ser44, previously reported as the phosphorylation sites of PKC (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol.

They explained the discrepancy of their data with a previous report (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by the different usage of their recombinant PKC (Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) instead of a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain (Noland et al. (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). Since we found that endogenous p90RSK activation was regulated by PKCβ (Fig. 6) and also detected coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous p90RSK with PKCβ (data not shown), it may be possible that activation of p90RSK is responsible for Ser42/44 phosphorylation in a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this issue.The activation of PKC and increased diacylglycerol levels initiated by hyperglycemia are associated with many vascular abnormalities in retinal, renal, and cardiovascular disease (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 37Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). It has been reported that increased PKC activity in diabetic rat hearts could be due to β and ζ isoforms (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect ERK1/2 activation in PKCβ-Tg mouse hearts, we observed significant activation of p90RSK activation. We have previously reported the presence of another ROS-stimulated pathway that activates p90RSK independently of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (19Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is possible that PKCβII directly phosphorylates p90RSK and activates p90RSK activation, but this is beyond the scope of this study.Desensitization of myofibrils to Ca2+ appears to oppose the inotropic effect produced by phospholamban and sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel phosphorylation, but several studies also indicate that cTnI phosphorylation by PKA plays an essential role in the rate of force production (10Solaro R.J. Moir A.J. Perry S.V. Nature. 1976; 262: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ.

Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of cTnI increases the rates of cross-bridge cycling, and transgenic mouse hearts expressing constitutively phosphorylated cTnI at PKA phosphorylation sites exhibit augmented force production and faster relaxation (39Takimoto E. Soergel D.G. Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Kass D.A. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We generated cardiac-specific p90RSK transgenic mice and found that TnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation was increased as shown in Fig. 5. In the current study, we focused on the role of p90RSK to phosphorylate cTnI (Ser23/24), as a downstream event to PKCβII activation. Since we also found that p90RSK can phosphorylate and regulate NHE-1 activity, it would be intriguing to determine the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function via regulating cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation and NHE-1 activation, especially after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Since the cell localization of PKA and p90RSK is apparently different and compartmentation of kinase may be critical to determine its downstream effect (20Cavet M.E. Lehoux S. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 348: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the effect of cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation on cardiac function may be also different between p90RSK and PKA, although they could phosphorylate the same sites of cTnI. Further studies will be required to clarify the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function and Ca2+ sensitivity via cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. In the present study, we found that p90RSK activation regulates H2O2-mediated cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation by p90RSK. In addition, we found that p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation were increased in PKCβII-Tg but not in PKCε-Tg mice and that the PKCβ inhibitor prevented H2O2-mediated p90RSK activation and cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. These data support a critical role for PKCβII in regulating p90RSK activation and subsequent cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. It has been reported that specific PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser43/45 of cTnI plays an important role in regulating force development in cardiac muscle (9Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since p90RSK kinase, which is downstream of PKCβII, could phosphorylate Ser23/24 in N-terminal of cTnI, and PKC phosphorylation sites of Ser43/45 already exist on cTnI, there appears to be a novel complexity of PKCβII activation on cTnI function in vivo. p90RSK consists of three isoforms that show the same overall structure consisting of two kinase domains, a linker region, and short N-terminal and C-terminal tails. The C-terminal kinase belongs to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase group of kinases, but the only known function of the C-terminal kinase is the regulation of the activity of N-terminal kinases. The N-terminal kinase belongs to the AGC group of kinases, which include PKA and PKC. The N-terminal kinase is responsible for phosphorylating the RSK substrates and recognizes the basic consensus motif: (R/K)XRXX(S/T), or RRX(S/T), which fits to both Ser23 and Ser24 of cTnI (20RRRSSN25) (32Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the current study, we also determined that human cardiac TnI residues 41-45 can be phosphorylated by p90RSK using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. TnI residues 41-45 contains two Ser at positions 42 and 44, which have been reported as major PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in cardiac TnI (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although these sites do not show a consensus sequence of p90RSK phosphorylation sites, it is still possible that p90RSK can phosphorylate these Ser42 and Ser44 sites because the RSK amino-terminal kinase domain is homologous to the kinase domains in other members of the AGC family, including PKA, various PKCs, and p70RSK (34Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It should also be mentioned that during the preparation of this study, Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have published that Ser23 or Ser24 of cTnI is the most permissive site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated cTnI with Ser42 and/or Ser44, previously reported as the phosphorylation sites of PKC (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol.

They explained the discrepancy of their data with a previous report (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) by the different usage of their recombinant PKC (Kobayashi et al. (35Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) instead of a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain (Noland et al. (12Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L.

Since we found that endogenous p90RSK activation was regulated by PKCβ (Fig. 6) and also detected coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous p90RSK with PKCβ (data not shown), it may be possible that activation of p90RSK is responsible for Ser42/44 phosphorylation in a mixture of PKC isoforms from brain. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this issue. The activation of PKC and increased diacylglycerol levels initiated by hyperglycemia are associated with many vascular abnormalities in retinal, renal, and cardiovascular disease (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 37Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). It has been reported that increased PKC activity in diabetic rat hearts could be due to β and ζ isoforms (36Inoguchi T. Battan R. Handler E. Sportsman J.R. Heath W. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect ERK1/2 activation in PKCβ-Tg mouse hearts, we observed significant activation of p90RSK activation. We have previously reported the presence of another ROS-stimulated pathway that activates p90RSK independently of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (19Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is possible that PKCβII directly phosphorylates p90RSK and activates p90RSK activation, but this is beyond the scope of this study. Desensitization of myofibrils to Ca2+ appears to oppose the inotropic effect produced by phospholamban and sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel phosphorylation, but several studies also indicate that cTnI phosphorylation by PKA plays an essential role in the rate of force production (10Solaro R.J. Moir A.J. Perry S.V. Nature. 1976; 262: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ.

Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of cTnI increases the rates of cross-bridge cycling, and transgenic mouse hearts expressing constitutively phosphorylated cTnI at PKA phosphorylation sites exhibit augmented force production and faster relaxation (39Takimoto E. Soergel D.G. Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Kass D.A. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We generated cardiac-specific p90RSK transgenic mice and found that TnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation was increased as shown in Fig. 5. In the current study, we focused on the role of p90RSK to phosphorylate cTnI (Ser23/24), as a downstream event to PKCβII activation. Since we also found that p90RSK can phosphorylate and regulate NHE-1 activity, it would be intriguing to determine the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function via regulating cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation and NHE-1 activation, especially after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Since the cell localization of PKA and p90RSK is apparently different and compartmentation of kinase may be critical to determine its downstream effect (20Cavet M.E. Lehoux S. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18376-18383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Reinitz C.A. Bianco R.A. Shabb J.B. Arch. Biochem.

Further studies will be required to clarify the role of p90RSK activation on cardiac function and Ca2+ sensitivity via cTnI (Ser23/24) phosphorylation. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2071673084,"The leptin receptor (LR) complex is composed of a single subunit belonging to the class I cytokine receptor family and exists as a preformed complex. The extracellular portion contains two cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domains, separated by an Ig-like domain and followed by two membrane-proximal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains. The mechanisms underlying ligand-induced receptor activation are still poorly understood. LRs can exist as disulfide-linked dimers at the cell surface, even in the absence of leptin. We evaluated the role of the two unpaired cysteine residues (Cys-672 and Cys-751) in the FNIII domains in receptor clustering, leptin binding, and biological activity. Although mutation of cysteine on position 751 to serine has hardly any effect on ligand binding and receptor activation, the C672S mutant exhibits a marked reduction in STAT3-dependent signaling. The double mutant was completely devoid of biological activity, although leptin binding remained unaffected. Mutation of both residues resulted in complete loss of disulfide bridge formation of FNIII domains in solution. In contrast, no difference was observed in ligand-independent oligomerization of the membrane-bound receptor, suggesting a role for cysteines in the CRH2 domain in formation of the preformed LR complex. We propose a model wherein leptin-induced clustering of two preformed dimers forms the activated LR complex. Disulfide bridge formation involving Cys-672 and Cys-751 may be necessary for JAK activation and hence signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2031325295,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Its juxtamembrane domain (JX), the region located between the transmembrane and kinase domains, plays important roles in receptor trafficking.

It plays an important role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and epithelial organogenesis (1Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The receptor appears to be essential for normal cell development, as changes of epidermal growth factor receptor expression are observed in many human cancers (2Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 44: 195-217Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and EGFR-deficient transgenic mice have shown failures of normal development of several organ systems, including kidney (3Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. Barnard J.A. Yuspa S.M. Coffey R.J. Magnuson T. Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 4Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the EGFR activity is highly regulated by sophisticated cellular processes. These involve many components, including control of expression, control of localization using sorting signals from the receptor, modulation of downstream signaling events, interaction with other ErbB receptor family members, and cross-talk with other receptors (5Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For example, activated EGF receptors are rapidly internalized at the plasma membrane and transported through a series of specialized endocytic compartments terminating at the lysosome, where ligand-receptor complexes are degraded. This default trafficking pathway of EGF receptor can be altered, and in the absence of ligands, the receptors are only slowly internalized. Furthermore, they are sorted in the multivesicular bodies and rapidly recycle back to the cell surface (6Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the trafficking of EGF receptor between cell surface and intracellular compartments, specific sorting processes also control the distribution of EGF receptor between apical and basolateral surface of polarized cells. In most polarized epithelial cells, including the Madin-Darby canine kidney model, EGF receptors are predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane (7Brandli A.W. Adamson E.D. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8560-8566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The EGF receptor is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein of 1186 amino acids (reviewed by Wells et al. (9Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar)). It comprises an extracellular N-terminal ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a 50-amino acid residue juxtamembrane domain (JX), a tyrosine kinase domain, and a long C-terminal tail, which contains five autophosphorylation motifs. Several intrinsic sorting signals and protein binding sites have now been mapped to the JX region, which regulates receptor trafficking and inactivation. These include basolateral sorting signals (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a lysosomal sorting motif (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a nuclear localization signal (12Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), as well as binding sites for calmodulin (13Martin-Nieto J. Villalobo A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), α-subunits of heterotrimeric Gs proteins (14Poppleton H.M. Sun H. Mullenix J.B. Wiepz G.J. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and phosphoinositide kinases (15Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The JX region also includes post-translational modification sites; Thr654 is a known substrate for PKC (16Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and Thr669 and Ser671 are substrates for MAPK (17Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aifa S. Johansen K. Nilsson U.K. Liedberg B. Lundstrom I. Svensson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The sorting motifs in the JX region have recently been identified. The critical residues of a dominant basolateral sorting signal include a positively charged amino-terminal residue (Arg662) and a proline-rich core (667PXXP670) (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a motif that bears some similarity with SH3-domain binding motifs. The signal is sufficient to target receptor released at the trans-Golgi network directly to the basolateral plasma membrane, and to recycle endosomal receptor back to basolateral membrane. A second, basolateral sorting motif has been localized to positions 658/659. This signal appears functionally redundant, being active only when the 667PXXP670 signal is deleted or mutated (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Possibly, because phosphorylation of Thr654 of the activated receptor has been shown to enhance recycling, this feedback mechanism might also invoke the basolateral targeting signals (19Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A lysosomal sorting signal formed by two leucine residues is present in the juxtamembrane domain at residues 679 and 680 (679LL680) (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Kil S.J. Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3141-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As receptors with an inactive 679LL680 signal accumulate on the limiting membranes of multivesicular endosomes in ligand-stimulated cells, 679LL680 appears to be required for uptake to internal vesicles thereby enabling their delivery to lysosomes (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The presence of several sorting signals and protein interaction sites in one small protein domain is intriguing and prompts multiple questions regarding selection, as well as regulation of the comprised motifs. Structural information for this domain, however, remains sparse. This contrasts with the recent, exciting progress that has been made in the structural characterization of other EGF receptor domains.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) provided exciting insights into the ligand recognition and binding, and dimerization. Furthermore, NMR studies provided first characterizations of the transmembrane domains of EGFR (28Rigby A.C. Grant C.W. Shaw G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and ErbB2 (29Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24073-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The focus of this study is the structural characterization of the juxtamembrane domain of EGFR. This region has received less attention so far, partially due to its relatively small extent, the weak secondary structure predictions, and only the recent emergence of functional insight into this domain. Several regulatory protein-protein interaction motifs have now been located to this domain, and our interest focuses initially on the conformations of basolateral and lysosomal sorting signals, and the understanding of how sorting motifs may be regulated and activated. We previously studied peptides comprising selected regions of the JX domain of the EGF receptor, residues Arg645 and Ala674, by a combination of NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic methods (30Choowongkomon K. Hobert M.E. He C. Carlin C.R. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 21: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend that work and characterize the properties of the entire JX domain (residues 645-697). Utilizing isotopically labeled protein, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy provided details on the conformational properties of this region in aqueous, and particularly in DPC-micellar solution, and facilitated the generation of a structural model of the micelle-bound domain. Functionally, the data strongly suggest that the role of these signals may be regulated by their membrane association and their accessibility in the intact receptor.DISCUSSIONJuxtamembrane regions in tyrosine (and other) kinase receptors have been shown to play important regulatory functions. Their kinase activity is generally autoinhibited by its JX domain in the absence of ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, because the JX domain contains the inhibitory Tyr phosphorylation sites (reviewed in Ref. 61Hubbard S.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In EGFR, tyrosine kinase activity has been reported to be regulated by the JX domain despite the absence of an inhibitory tyrosine. Specifically, phosphorylation of Thr654 by PKC suppresses kinase activity (16Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, evidence of the JX domain directly binding the kinase domain in EGFR is not available. Second, receptor sorting and trafficking is another regulatory role of this domain. Several sorting signals located in the JX domain have been shown to regulate the trafficking pathways of EGFR, and similar signals have been either identified or suggested to be present in ErbB2 (62Dillon C. Creer A. Kerr K. Kumin A. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6553-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the JX domain of EGFR is essential for receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation (63Aifa S. Aydin J. Nordvall G. Lundstrom I. Svensson S.P. Hermanson O. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Although principally an independent domain, the deduced close proximity of the JX domain to the plasma membrane brought us to evaluate the effects of membrane interactions on the JX peptide structure by using DPC micelles. As shown, the structural properties of JX are strongly influenced by mimics of the plasma membrane. Our results provided evidence for the binding of JX domain peptide to micelles, causing the formation of three helical domains; from residues Lys652 to Arg662, Asn676 to Glu685, and Phe688 to Leu694. All helices were shown to be amphipathic and to use their hydrophobic sides for micelle-surface binding (Fig. 7).The C-terminal half of EGFR645-697 peptide comprises two of these helical regions separated by a kink. The position of helix 2 (residues 676-685) agrees well with secondary structure predictions, and the nascent helix in this region in aqueous solution. It also conforms with former observations on peptides comprising this region of the EGFR receptor and its ErbB2 homologues showing helical backbone conformations when bound to detergent micelles. 3L. Ma, personal communication. This region is included in the previously solved crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain (27Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). There, Asn676 to Glu685 were found in an extended conformation, packed adjacent to the following first β-sheet of the tyrosine kinase domain. Because the truncated tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR starting at residue 683 was shown to be active without the JX part (64Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and no other biochemical data supported the direct interaction between JX part and tyrosine kinase domain, the binding of this JX part to the tyrosine kinase domain may be caused by crystal packing rather than representing the physiological structure of this region. However, in conjunction with our findings the extended structure in the crystal demonstrates the structural flexibility of this region, which may be essential for or a reflection of its function ability to interact with variable partners such as the plasma membrane, the kinase domain, as well as the established interactions with other proteins such as calmodulin (13Martin-Nieto J. Villalobo A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and foremost the unknown protein recognizing the comprised dileucine sorting signal.The first residues of the adjacent tyrosine kinase domain, residues Phe688 to Gly697, were included in our JX peptide to avoid possible truncation effects on the structure of JX. Surprisingly, this part of the peptide was found to be structured and form helix 3. This two-turn helix contrasts the conserved β-strand conformation of this region in the crystal structure of EGFR (27Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), and known structures of the tyrosine kinase domains (65Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), but is likely only a direct consequence of removing this region from its native structural and folding context.The micelle binding of the N-terminal part of the JX peptide, including the stretch of charged N-terminal residues and the subsequent helix 1 agrees with previous conclusions made with the fragment of JX, EGFR645-672. Hydrophobic and charge-charge interactions of first seven residues, Arg and Lys, with the fatty acid and the zwitterionic headgroup, respectively, characterize the micelle binding of this region (30Choowongkomon K. Hobert M.E. He C. Carlin C.R. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 21: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The presence of the helical conformation between Lys652 and Arg662, however, was previously not observed. This altered conformation for the region in JX could be interpreted as a reflection of a long range structural effect, potentially by an interaction between the newly formed helix, helix 1, and the C-terminal part of peptide. Multiple NOEs compatible with this suggestion were identified in this study, and an intense investigation into evidence for a stable fold of the domain ensued. However, the ensemble of identified contacts was found to be inconsistent with a single fold and conformation. These data therefore suggest conformational flexibility and a dynamic structure and only transient interactions between the helices.EGFR is found as monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers depending on its activation state. The majority of unactivated receptor is monomeric, only slowly internalizing and recycling to the basolateral surface in polarized cells. Upon binding of ligands to extracellular domain, the EGFR dimerizes either into homo- or heterodimers and is rapidly internalized to early endosome. Because the JX domain in all of our experimental condition was always a monomer, our model is most likely to represent the structure of JX domain in the unactivated monomer EGFR.Both basolateral and lysosomal sorting signals determine the fate of endosomal EGFR were identified in the JX domains. Each signal was located in different structural units. The dominant basolateral signal, 667PXXP670, was located in the long flexible loop and not associated with micelles, whereas the recessive basolateral signal (658LL659) and lysosomal signal (679LL680) were located in the first helix and the second helix, respectively, facing the surface of micelles. The constitutively active recycling of the unactivated EGFR to the basolateral surface correlates with our model, in that only the PXXP-basolateral signal was accessible, whereas other signals were sterically obstructed from their sorting machineries. This suggests that membrane binding and steric accessibility modulate the activity of the sorting signals.Upon ligand binding, the lysosomal degradation becomes a default pathway for most of the activated homodimeric EGFR. The dimerization of the extracellular and transmembrane domains would thus be expected to remove the inhibition of the lysosomal signal. We hypothesize that dimerization brings both JX domains into closer proximity, changing the JX structure to expose the lysosomal signal for recognition. Also, the structure of JX domain of EGFR can be altered by other protein partners and post-translation modifications, similarly resulting in changes of trafficking and signaling. It is important to note that several binding motifs have been localized to the JX, to the vicinity but not overlapping with the lysosomal sorting signal. For example, Thr654 phosphorylation by PKC has been known to suppress the kinase activity (16Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and to reroute the receptor to recycle back to the basolateral surface (19Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This may be explained in our model by phosphorylation disrupting the helical structure and/or micelles binding of helix 1, causing the recessive basolateral signal (658LL659) to become accessible and thus strengthen the basolateral signal to dominate over the lysosomal sorting signal. This explanation also appears applicable to the effect of calmodulin on the trafficking of EGFR, as calmodulin binds to the helix at N-terminal of JX domain (13Martin-Nieto J. Villalobo A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), inhibits tyrosine kinase activity (66San Jose E. Benguria A. Geller P. Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15237-15245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is involved in the regulation of recycling and degradation of EGFR (67Tebar F. Villalonga P. Sorkina T. Agell N. Sorkin A. Enrich C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IntroductionThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ErbB2 and ErbB3, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 and 3, respectively; JX, juxtamembrane domain of EGFR; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; 5-DSA, 5-doxylstearic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; SH3, Src homology domain 3; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; 2D, two-dimensional; 3D, three-dimensional; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; RDC, residual dipolar coupling; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy. is the prototypic member of the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptor molecules. It plays an important role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and epithelial organogenesis (1Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The receptor appears to be essential for normal cell development, as changes of epidermal growth factor receptor expression are observed in many human cancers (2Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 44: 195-217Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and EGFR-deficient transgenic mice have shown failures of normal development of several organ systems, including kidney (3Threadgill D.W. Dlugosz A.A. Hansen L.A. Tennenbaum T. Lichti U. Yee D. LaMantia C. Mourton T. Herrup K. Harris R.C. Barnard J.A. Yuspa S.M. Coffey R.J. Magnuson T. Science. 1995; 269: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 4Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the EGFR activity is highly regulated by sophisticated cellular processes. These involve many components, including control of expression, control of localization using sorting signals from the receptor, modulation of downstream signaling events, interaction with other ErbB receptor family members, and cross-talk with other receptors (5Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For example, activated EGF receptors are rapidly internalized at the plasma membrane and transported through a series of specialized endocytic compartments terminating at the lysosome, where ligand-receptor complexes are degraded. This default trafficking pathway of EGF receptor can be altered, and in the absence of ligands, the receptors are only slowly internalized. Furthermore, they are sorted in the multivesicular bodies and rapidly recycle back to the cell surface (6Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the trafficking of EGF receptor between cell surface and intracellular compartments, specific sorting processes also control the distribution of EGF receptor between apical and basolateral surface of polarized cells. In most polarized epithelial cells, including the Madin-Darby canine kidney model, EGF receptors are predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane (7Brandli A.W. Adamson E.D. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8560-8566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The EGF receptor is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein of 1186 amino acids (reviewed by Wells et al. (9Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar)). It comprises an extracellular N-terminal ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a 50-amino acid residue juxtamembrane domain (JX), a tyrosine kinase domain, and a long C-terminal tail, which contains five autophosphorylation motifs. Several intrinsic sorting signals and protein binding sites have now been mapped to the JX region, which regulates receptor trafficking and inactivation. These include basolateral sorting signals (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a lysosomal sorting motif (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a nuclear localization signal (12Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), as well as binding sites for calmodulin (13Martin-Nieto J. Villalobo A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), α-subunits of heterotrimeric Gs proteins (14Poppleton H.M. Sun H. Mullenix J.B. Wiepz G.J. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and phosphoinositide kinases (15Cochet C. Filhol O. Payrastre B. Hunter T. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 637-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The JX region also includes post-translational modification sites; Thr654 is a known substrate for PKC (16Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and Thr669 and Ser671 are substrates for MAPK (17Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aifa S. Johansen K. Nilsson U.K. Liedberg B. Lundstrom I. Svensson S.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The sorting motifs in the JX region have recently been identified. The critical residues of a dominant basolateral sorting signal include a positively charged amino-terminal residue (Arg662) and a proline-rich core (667PXXP670) (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a motif that bears some similarity with SH3-domain binding motifs. The signal is sufficient to target receptor released at the trans-Golgi network directly to the basolateral plasma membrane, and to recycle endosomal receptor back to basolateral membrane. A second, basolateral sorting motif has been localized to positions 658/659. This signal appears functionally redundant, being active only when the 667PXXP670 signal is deleted or mutated (10He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Possibly, because phosphorylation of Thr654 of the activated receptor has been shown to enhance recycling, this feedback mechanism might also invoke the basolateral targeting signals (19Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A lysosomal sorting signal formed by two leucine residues is present in the juxtamembrane domain at residues 679 and 680 (679LL680) (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Kil S.J. Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3141-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As receptors with an inactive 679LL680 signal accumulate on the limiting membranes of multivesicular endosomes in ligand-stimulated cells, 679LL680 appears to be required for uptake to internal vesicles thereby enabling their delivery to lysosomes (11Kil S.J. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The presence of several sorting signals and protein interaction sites in one small protein domain is intriguing and prompts multiple questions regarding selection, as well as regulation of the comprised motifs. Structural information for this domain, however, remains sparse. This contrasts with the recent, exciting progress that has been made in the structural characterization of other EGF receptor domains.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) provided exciting insights into the ligand recognition and binding, and dimerization. Furthermore, NMR studies provided first characterizations of the transmembrane domains of EGFR (28Rigby A.C. Grant C.W. Shaw G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1371: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and ErbB2 (29Houliston R.S. Hodges R.S. Sharom F.J. Davis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24073-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The focus of this study is the structural characterization of the juxtamembrane domain of EGFR. This region has received less attention so far, partially due to its relatively small extent, the weak secondary structure predictions, and only the recent emergence of functional insight into this domain. Several regulatory protein-protein interaction motifs have now been located to this domain, and our interest focuses initially on the conformations of basolateral and lysosomal sorting signals, and the understanding of how sorting motifs may be regulated and activated. We previously studied peptides comprising selected regions of the JX domain of the EGF receptor, residues Arg645 and Ala674, by a combination of NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic methods (30Choowongkomon K. Hobert M.E. He C. Carlin C.R. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 21: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend that work and characterize the properties of the entire JX domain (residues 645-697). Utilizing isotopically labeled protein, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy provided details on the conformational properties of this region in aqueous, and particularly in DPC-micellar solution, and facilitated the generation of a structural model of the micelle-bound domain. Functionally, the data strongly suggest that the role of these signals may be regulated by their membrane association and their accessibility in the intact receptor."

The characteristic structural feature of the HNK-1 carbohydrate is 3-sulfo-glucuronyl residues attached to lactosamine structures (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) on glycoproteins and glycolipids. The biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate is regulated mainly by two glucuronyltransferases (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S) and a sulfotransferase. In this study, we found that GlcAT-S mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the kidney than in the brain, but that both GlcAT-P and HNK-1 sulfotransferase mRNAs, which were expressed at high levels in the brain, were not detected in the kidney. These results suggested that the HNK-1 carbohydrate without sulfate (non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate) is expressed in the kidney. We substantiated this hypothesis using two different monoclonal antibodies: one (anti-HNK-1 antibody) requires sulfate on glucuronyl residues for its binding, and the other (antibody M6749) does not. Western blot analyses of mouse kidney revealed that two major bands (80 and 140 kDa) were detected with antibody M6749, but not with anti-HNK-1 antibody. The 80- and 140-kDa band materials were identified as meprin α and CD13/aminopeptidase N, respectively. We also confirmed the presence of the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate on N-linked oligosaccharides by multistage tandem mass spectrometry. Immunofluorescence staining with antibody M6749 revealed that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate was expressed predominantly on the apical membranes of the proximal tubules in the cortex and was also detected in the thin ascending limb in the inner medulla.

We have been interested in the HNK-1 (human natural killer-1) carbohydrate, which is recognized by anti-HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (1Abo T. Balch C.M. J.

The carbohydrate is expressed predominantly in the nervous system in a wide range of species, and its expression is spatially and temporally regulated during development of the nervous system (2Schwarting G.A.

The HNK-1 carbohydrate has disappeared almost completely in the nervous system of GlcAT-P gene-deficient mice, and these mice exhibit reduced long-term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral CA1 synapses and defects in spatial memory formation. However, a trace of anti-HNK-1 antibody immunoreactivity remains on the surfaces of the soma and proximal dendrites of a subset of neurons in some limited regions. The remaining HNK-1 carbohydrate in GlcAT-P gene-deficient mice is assumed to be synthesized by GlcAT-S. More recently, we characterized the acceptor specificities of the two glucuronyltransferases using various oligosaccharides (13Kakuda S. Sato Y. Tonoyama Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results suggested the possibility that the two glucuronyltransferases synthesize structurally and functionally different HNK-1 carbohydrates.To elucidate the function of the HNK-1 carbohydrate synthesized by GlcAT-S, we examined GlcAT-S mRNA expression in various mouse tissues, including brain. To our surprise, Glc-AT-S mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the kidney than in the brain. In this study, we provide the first evidence that the HNK-1 carbohydrate is synthesized by GlcAT-S as the non-sulfated form in mouse kidney. The non-sulfated form of HNK-1 carbohydrate was expressed predominantly on meprin α and CD13/aminopeptidase N. We also examined in detail the distribution of the carbohydrate in mouse kidney. The results are important for understanding the functions of the HNK-1 carbohydrate other than those in the nervous system.DISCUSSIONThe HNK-1 carbohydrate is expressed at high levels in the nervous system. The HNK-1 carbohydrate structure on P0 and the neural cell adhesion molecule, the major carrier glycoproteins in the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively, has been determined (27Gallego R.G.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All of the HNK-1 carbohydrate structure determined was of the sulfated form, i.e. sulfoglucuronic acid attached to N-acetyllactosamine, the non-sulfated form of the HNK-1 carbohydrate not being found on these molecules. These results indicate that almost all of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the nervous system is expressed as the sulfated form. This is the first report that the HNK-1 carbohydrate is expressed at high levels in mouse kidney as the non-sulfated form. We have also demonstrated that GlcAT-S (but not GlcAT-P) is involved mainly in the expression of the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate in mouse kidney.Two glucuronyltransferases (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S) have so far been identified as HNK-1 biosynthetic enzymes (7Terayama K.

We have generated GlcAT-P gene-deficient mice and demonstrated that almost all of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the brain is synthesized by GlcAT-P because of the absence of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in GlcAT-P gene-deficient mouse brain (12Yamamoto S. Oka S. Inoue M. Shimuta M. Manabe T. Takahashi H. Miyamoto M. Asano M. Sakagami J. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Ono K. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27227-27231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the HNK-1 carbohydrate synthesized by GlcAT-P is involved in synaptic plasticity and in spatial learning (12Yamamoto S. Oka S. Inoue M. Shimuta M. Manabe T. Takahashi H. Miyamoto M. Asano M. Sakagami J. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Ono K. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27227-27231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the function of the HNK-1 carbohydrate regulated by GlcAT-S. It should be noted that these two enzymes have significantly different acceptor specificities. Thus, GlcAT-P specifically recognizes N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) at the nonreducing terminals of acceptor substrates. In contrast, GlcAT-S recognizes not only the terminal Galβ1-4GlcNAc structure, but also the Galβ1-3GlcNAc structure, and shows the highest activity to-ward triantennary N-linked oligosaccharides (13Kakuda S. Sato Y. Tonoyama Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may synthesize structurally and functionally different HNK-1 carbohydrates. To elucidate the function of the HNK-1 carbohydrate synthesized by GlcAT-S, it is important that GlcAT-S is expressed not only in the brain, but also in the kidney.Immunofluorescence staining of mouse kidney with antibody M6749 revealed that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate was expressed predominantly on the apical membranes of the proximal tubules in the cortex, where the GlcAT-S mRNA was also detected (Figs. 7 and 10). The non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate was expressed at high levels in the brush borders of the S2 and S3 segments of the proximal tubules. In comparison, no significant signal for antibody M6749 was observed in the S1 segment immediately after the glomerulus (Fig. 8). Protein kinases Cα and Cβ1 are another case of such segment-specific expression. The two isoforms of protein kinase C are localized only to the brush borders of the S2 and S3 segments of proximal tubules, whereas the S1 segment is negative (30Pfaff I.L. Wagner H.J. Vallon V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1861-1873PubMed Google Scholar). It is difficult to distinguish the segments of the proximal tubules with respect to protein absorption under normal conditions. However, lysosomal enzyme activities are increased in the S2 and S3 segments of proteinuric animals because of an increase in protein uptake (31Olbricht C.J. Cannon J.K. Garg L.C. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F1055-F1062PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the S2 and S3 segments might be more important under pathological conditions. In addition, antibody M6749 immunoreactivity was also detected in the thin ascending limb in the inner medulla, where no detectable level of either GlcAT-S or GlcAT-P mRNA was observed. These results suggest that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate detected in the inner medulla could be synthesized by another glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate. The carbohydrate structure expressed in the thin ascending limb could also be different from those on CD13/aminopeptidase N and meprin α expressed in proximal tubules.The meprin α-subunit and CD13/aminopeptidase N were identified as major carrier proteins of the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate. Meprins (α and β) are members of the astacin family of metalloproteases (32Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Meprins are capable of activation or degradation of bioactive peptides, growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and matrix proteins through limited proteolysis (33Villa J.P. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42545-42550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Meprin α contains 10 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and is extensively glycosylated; ~25% of the total molecular mass is carbohydrate (34Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CD13/aminopeptidase N is also an abundant metalloprotease in the brush borders of kidney proximal tubule cells (35Tauc M. Chatelet F. Verroust P. Vandewalle A. Poujeol P. Ronco P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and is the enzyme responsible for the extracellular conversion of angiotensin III to angiotensin IV (36Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). CD13/aminopeptidase N also has 10 potential N-glycosylation sites. Thus, the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate is commonly expressed on two major metalloproteases that are extensively glycosylated in the kidney. It has been reported that N-linked carbohydrates on meprin α are required for optimal enzyme activity and for secretion, as found in a series of mutation analyses of N-glycosylation sites (37Kadowaki T. Tsukuba T. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25577-25584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate may be involved in the regulation of metalloprotease activity, which leads to the functional diversity of these two molecules.Meprin α and CD13/aminopeptidase N are expressed on the apical membranes of the proximal tubules in the kidney cortex, but not in the inner medulla (33Villa J.P. Bertenshaw G.P. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42545-42550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Tauc M. Chatelet F. Verroust P. Vandewalle A. Poujeol P. Ronco P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that anti-CD13/aminopeptidase N antibody immunoreactivity is not detected in the inner medulla (data not shown). Therefore, the immunoreactivity of antibody M6749 in the inner medulla is not due to the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate expressed on meprin α and CD13/aminopeptidase N, but might be due to that expressed on minor glycoproteins (~90 and 180 kDa), which were detected upon Western blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 5A. Another possibility is that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate is expressed on glycolipids.The characteristic structural feature of the HNK-1 carbohydrate is sulfated glucuronic acid (4Chou D.K.

Vliegenthart J.F. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The important functional roles of the sulfate residue have been reported. Thus, the HNK-1 carbohydrate binds to laminin, but this binding is completely abolished upon desulfation of this carbohydrate (38Mohan P.S. Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2024-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Schmitz B. Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glyco-conj. J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene-deficient mice exhibit similar phenotypes compared with GlcAT-P gene-deficient mice, including a reduction in long-term potentiation and a defect in spatial learning (12Yamamoto S. Oka S. Inoue M. Shimuta M. Manabe T. Takahashi H. Miyamoto M. Asano M. Sakagami J. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Ono K. Kawasaki T. J. Biol.

Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, interesting evidence has been reported concerning the functional role of glucuronic acid in the HNK-1 carbohydrate. Senn et al. (40Senn C. Kutsche M. Saghatelyan A. Bosl M.R. Lohler J. Bartsch U. Morellini F. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) confirmed that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate is expressed in HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene-deficient mice brain using two different monoclonal antibodies (anti-HNK-1 and 412). mAb 412 recognizes both non-sulfated and sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrates, as does antibody M6749. They analyzed electrophysiologically perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal slices. Whereas application of anti-HNK-1 antibody to hippocampal slices from HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene-deficient mice did not change the perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents, administration of antibody 412 decreased the perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents to the same extent as did anti-HNK-1 antibody and mAb 412 in those from wild-type mice (40Senn C. Kutsche M. Saghatelyan A. Bosl M.R. Lohler J. Bartsch U. Morellini F. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 712-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reduction of the perisomatic inhibitory postsynaptic currents after application of antibody 412 in the HNK-1 sulfotransferase gene-deficient mice indicates that the absence of sulfation does not completely abolish HNK-1 carbohydrate-induced modulation of perisomatic transmission. These experimental results indicate that the glucuronic acid residue, like the sulfate group, is an important functional constituent of the HNK-1 carbohydrate. These results suggest that the non-sulfated HNK-1 carbohydrate (glucuronic acid residue) expressed on the meprin α-subunit and CD13/aminopeptidase N also plays important roles in the kidney. We are now trying to produce GlcAT-S gene-deficient mice to demonstrate and investigate the functional role of the glucuronic acid residue of the HNK-1 carbohydrate, especially in the kidney. IntroductionGlycosylation is one of the major post-translational protein modifications that play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, including recognition and adhesion. We have been interested in the HNK-1 (human natural killer-1) carbohydrate, which is recognized by anti-HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (1Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate is expressed predominantly in the nervous system in a wide range of species, and its expression is spatially and temporally regulated during development of the nervous system (2Schwarting G.A.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The characteristic structural feature of the carbohydrate is a sulfated trisaccharide, HSO3-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc 1The abbreviations used are: GlcA, glucuronic acid; GlcAT, glucuronyltransferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; AQP, aquaporin; pAb, polyclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MSn, multistage tandem mass spectrometry.

P4 shares sequence and structural similarities with hexameric helicases. A structure-based mechanism for mechano-chemical coupling has recently been proposed for P4 from bacteriophage φ12. However, coordination of ATP hydrolysis among the subunits and coupling with RNA translocation remains elusive. Here we present detailed kinetic study of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and product release by φ12 P4 in the presence of different RNA and DNA substrates. Whereas binding affinities for ATP and ADP are not affected by RNA binding, the hydrolysis step is accelerated and the apparent cooperativity is increased. No nucleotide binding cooperativity is observed. We propose a stochastic-sequential cooperativity model to describe the coordination of ATP hydrolysis within the hexamer. In this model the apparent cooperativity is a result of hydrolysis stimulation by ATP and RNA binding to neighboring subunits rather than cooperative nucleotide binding. The translocation step appears coupled to hydrolysis, which is coordinated among three neighboring subunits. Simultaneous interaction of neighboring subunits with RNA makes the otherwise random hydrolysis sequential and processive.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P4 proteins share sequence and structural similarities with hexameric helicases and some of them possess helicase activity (2Kainov D.E. Pirttimaa M. Tuma R. Butcher S.J. Thomas Jr., G.J.

The P4 hexamer is also used as a passive pore for the exit of nascent transcripts from the viral core (4Kainov D.E. Lisal J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A power stroke mechanism was proposed on the basis of P4 structures encompassing the key states of the catalytic cycle (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis was shown to induce concerted structural changes in two regions, namely the P-loop and the L2 loop-α6 helix segment. The P-loop (Walker A or H1a motif in hexameric helicases) interacts with α and β phosphates of the nucleotide bound within the catalytic site. The L2 loop (H3 motif) is directly connected to the α6-helix (H4 motif) and binds to RNA. In the pre-hydrolysis state (P4-MgAMP-CPP complex) the P-loop is in a “relaxed” configuration and the L2 loop/α6 helix is in an “up” configuration. After hydrolysis (P4-MgADP complex) the P-loop is in the “strained” configuration and the L2 loop/α6 helix is in the “down” configuration. In the absence of any nucleotide the P-loop is in the relaxed configuration and the L2 loop/α6 helix can swivel between the up and down configurations. Thus, it was proposed that the binding of ATP locks the L2 loop/α6 helix in the up configuration, where it engages the ssRNA. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the nucleotide binding P-loop strains, push against one end of the L2 loop, so that the rest of the L2 loop and the α6 helix are forced to pivot down, carrying along the engaged RNA (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed that nucleotides bind at the subunit-subunit interfaces (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Half of the adenine binding pocket and so called “arginine fingers” are contributed by neighboring subunits, whereas the rest of the binding site is contributed by the catalytic subunit. This provides the structural basis for cooperativity. However, the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis coordination within the P4 hexamer and RNA-dependent stimulation of hydrolysis remains elusive (4Kainov D.E. Lisal J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we present detailed enzymatic study of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and product release by φ12 P4 in the presence of different nucleic acids, nucleotides, and inhibitors. Using these data we delineate the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis coordination and cooperativity during RNA translocation. Protein Purification—φ12 P4 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (5Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Wei H. Gottlieb P. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Grimes J.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). P4 concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26,930 m-1 cm-1, which was calculated based on the amino acid composition. Phosphate Release Measurements—Phosphate release assays were done using the EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in the standard reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 75 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm MgCl2) as described (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Tuma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1343-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Absorbance values at 360 nm were converted to concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi) using calibration with KH2PO4 standards. AMP was used as a background control in all experiments. Steady-state kinetics of phosphate release were measured using a Victor2 plate reader (Wallac-PerkinElmer) with time resolution of 20 s at 28 °C. ATP, ADP, and UTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, AMP-PNP from Fluka, poly(rC) was from Sigma (concentration expressed as mole of base per liter), and oligoribocytidines of lengths 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 nucleotides were custom-made by Dharmacon (concentrations expressed as mole of oligonucleotide strand per liter). Rapid Kinetics of Nucleotide Binding—Fluorescent nucleotide analogs 2′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-3′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (2′-MANT-3′-dATP) and 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (3′-MANT-2′-dATP) were obtained from Jena Bioscience. 2′- (or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (MANT-ATP) and 2′- (or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5′-diphosphate (MANT-ADP) were purchased from Molecular Probes. All experiments were done in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 75 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm MgCl2 unless stated otherwise. Rapid mixing of fluorescence nucleotide analogs with P4 protein was achieved in a μSFM 20 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic) equipped with a F-15 flow cell (dead time approximately 6 ms). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the three P4 tryptophans and the MANT-labeled nucleotides was detected by a MOS 250 fluorometer (Bio-Logic) using λexc = 290 nm (20 nm slit) and λdet = 440 nm (20 nm slit) with a time step of 1 ms at 28 °C. Equilibrium Competitive Binding Assay—1 μm φ12 P4 was mixed with 50 μm 3′-MANT-2′-dATP in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 75 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm MgCl2 (final concentrations). The solution was aliquoted. Fluorescence spectra (310–550 nm, 10 nm slit) were recorded within seconds upon addition of appropriate concentrations of the competing nucleotide (ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, or UTP) to the aliquots using a MOS 250 fluorometer (Bio-Logic), λexc = 290 nm (20 nm slit), at 28 °C. Data Analysis—The steady-state rate of NTP hydrolysis (measured by phosphate release), v, is in the simplest case described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, υ[P]=kcat[S]Km+[S](Eq. 1) where [P] is the protein concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant. In the case of apparent cooperativity, the steady-state kinetics can be phenomenologically described by the Hill equation, υ[P]=kcat[S]nKmn+[S]n(Eq. 2) where the parameter n is the Hill coefficient. P4 translocates along the RNA strand of length L and falls off the RNA after an average of x bases because of limited processivity or limited substrate length. x is related to the processivity parameter M as follows: x = LM/(L + M). The processivity parameter M is an intrinsic property of the enzyme and reflects the average number of translocated bases at which half of the enzymes release RNA. Taking into account release and rebinding to RNA, the rate of phosphate release v during translocation along RNA is given by, 1/υ=1/(x kRNA)+1/kH(Eq. 3) where kRNA is the rate of RNA binding (which happens once per x bases translocated) and kH is the rate of ATP hydrolysis per one base translocated (i.e. rate of ATP hydrolysis divided by the number of bases translocated per one ATP molecule). Combining these two equations gives, υ[P]=MLkHkRNA(M+L)kH+MLkRNA(Eq. 4) if kRNA << kH/M (RNA binding is limiting) this equation simplifies into as follows. υ[P]=MLkRNAM+L(Eq. 5) Taking into account the footprint of the P4 on RNA, R (RNA longer than R bases must be bound to achieve translocation), and the basal ATPase activity, kB (in the absence of RNA), the final equation for obtaining the processivity parameter M is as follows. υ[P]=kB+(L−R)MkRNAM+L−R(Eq. 6) Fluorescence intensity traces, f, corresponding to binding of MANT-ADP, 3′-MANT-2′-dATP, and 2′-MANT-3′-dATP were approximated by a single exponential term, f=b−aexp(−kt)(Eq. 7) where a is the amplitude of fluorescence change, b is the fluorescence plateau at infinite times, k is the apparent first-order rate, and t is time. The kinetic fluorescence traces corresponding to MANT-ATP binding were described by two exponential terms. f=b−a1exp(−k1t)−a2exp(−k2t)(Eq. 8) In the case of a simple second-order reaction, the linear dependence of the apparent rate on substrate concentration [S] was described by, k=koff+kon[S](Eq. 9) kon and koff are the true second-order association and first-order dissociation rate constants. Equilibrium dissociation constants were estimated from the fluorescence change amplitudes a (corrected for the inner filter effect as previously described (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H.

The equilibrium competition assays against the fluorescent nucleotide analog were performed at low protein concentration and the fluorescence intensity was approximated by, f=d−e[S]Kapp+[S](Eq. 11) where d and e are constants. The correct dissociation constant Kd was calculated from the apparent dissociation constant Kapp as follows, Kd=Kapp1+[I]Kl(Eq. 12) where [I] is the concentration and KI is the dissociation constant of the fluorescent analog, respectively (7Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 3rd Ed. Portland Press, London2004Google Scholar). φ12 P4 Is a RNA Specific Motor with Low Translocation Processivity—P4 φ12 slowly hydrolyzed ATP in the absence of any nucleic acid, whereas ssRNA but not ssDNA stimulated the activity (Fig. 1A). RNA affected both kcat (∼3-fold increase) and Km (2-fold decrease), and induced cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis with an apparent Hill coefficient n = 2.7 ± 0.3 (Table I). ATP analogs AMP-PNP and AMP-CPP were not hydrolyzed by φ12 P4 (Fig. 1A, triangles). On the other hand, slow but detectable hydrolysis of AMP-PCP was observed (data not shown).Table IParameters of hydrolysis of ATP and its analogs by φ12 P4kcatKmns–1mmATP1.5 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.2No nucleic acid0.84 ± 0.12RNA2.52 ± 0.070.49 ± 0.022.7 ± 0.3DNA0.72 ± 0.031.3 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1AMP-PNPNo nucleic acid0RNA0MANT-ATPNo nucleic acid0.021 ± 0.0010.12 ± 0.011.5 ± 0.1RNA0.189 ± 0.0080.10 ± 0.012.0 ± 0.23′-MANT -2′-dATPNo nucleic acid0RNA02′-MANT -3′-dATPNo nucleic acid0.071 ± 0.0060.42 ± 0.041.9 ± 0.1RNA0.77 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.013.4 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Dependence of kcat on ssRNA concentration provided an indirect measure of RNA-P4 complex formation (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Tuma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1343-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant of the RNA-P4 complex was 0.40 ± 0.06 mm in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 0.39 ± 0.04 mm in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm ADP, respectively (Fig. 1B). Thus, the low affinity for RNA remained unaffected by ADP. Unfortunately, this method does not permit quantitative assessment of RNA affinity in the absence of ATP. However, no stable complex was detected by gel mobility shift (4Kainov D.E. Lisal J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and thus we conclude that the affinity in the nucleotide free state remained low. Fig. 1C shows the dependence of the kcat on the ssRNA length. RNA as short as a pentamer stimulated P4 activity. Extrapolation of the experimental data using Equation 6 suggested that (rC)4 would not stimulate and (rC)5 constitutes the shortest stimulating RNA. The saturation of ATPase activity with relatively short RNAs suggested low processivity of translocation. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was roughly the same when stimulated by a 20-mer RNA or by poly(C), which has a length of several thousand bases (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Tuma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1343-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using Equation 6 a processivity parameter (M) of 2.1 ± 0.7 was obtained indicating frequent dissociation of the P4-RNA complex. This is in contrast to φ8 P4 (Fig. 1C, open circles), which was stimulated by RNA longer than 8 bases and exhibited higher processivity (M ∼ 11). 2′-MANT-3′-dATP Is a Hydrolyzable Fluorescent ATP Analog—φ12 P4 contains three tryptophan residues that allowed for detection of nucleotide binding using FRET between the tryptophans and MANT-labeled nucleotides. MANT-ATP was hydrolyzed by φ12 P4 with kcat and Km approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than those for ATP hydrolysis. However, the relative stimulation by RNA and the apparent cooperativity were identical as for the hydrolysis of unlabeled ATP (Fig. 2A and Table I). Traces of MANT-ADP fluorescence upon mixing with P4 were single-exponential, whereas the traces corresponding to MANT-ATP binding had to be fitted by two exponential terms (Fig. 2, B and C). This suggested that MANT-ATP binding is either a two-step process or that there are two distinct classes of MANT-ATP binding sites. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that the two phases in MANT-ATP binding could arise from the two isomers of MANT-ATP present in the commercial preparation (i.e. the MANT group linked to the 2′-hydroxyl versus the 3′-hydroxyl group). Such an effect has been observed for MANT-ATP binding to the transcription termination factor Rho (8Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18370-18376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the interactions of P4 with two additional MANT-nucleotide derivatives, where the fluorophore was attached specifically to the 3′-hydroxyl (3′-MANT-2′-dATP) or the 2′-hydroxyl (2′-MANT-3′-dATP) of the deoxyribose ring. Both MANT-dATP analogs bound to P4 in a single kinetic phase. Only the 2′-MANT-3′-dATP was hydrolyzed by φ12 P4 (Fig. 2A and Table I). Thus, 2′-MANT-3′-dATP constitutes a suitable analog to study ATP binding, whereas 3′-MANT-2′-dATP can be used as a fluorescent ATPase inhibitor. 2′-MANT-3′-dATP Binding Is a RNA Independent, Single Step Second-order Process—ATP binding kinetics was determined using the 2′-MANT-3′-dATP analog (Fig. 3). Rate of FRET intensity change increased linearly with the 2′-MANT-3′-dATP concentration (Fig. 3A). Thus, 2′-MANT-3′-dATP binding was a single step second-order, reaction. No significant difference in 2′-MANT-3′-dATP binding in the absence and presence of RNA was detected. Concentration dependences of the measured apparent rate constants yielded the second-order rate constants and dissociation constant: kOFF = 64 ± 2 s-1, kON = 0.25 ± 0.02 μm-1 s-1, and Kd = 256 ± 30 μm in the absence of RNA, and kOFF = 64 ± 4 s-1, kON = 0.30 ± 0.03 μm-1 s-1, and Kd = 213 ± 39 μm in the presence of RNA. FRET amplitudes (Fig. 3B) yielded a similar value for the dissociation constants Kd = 210 ± 51 μm in the absence and Kd = 265 ± 52 μm in the presence of poly(C). Binding of the non-hydrolyzable 3′-MANT-2′-dATP (Fig. 3) appeared to be a single step, second-order association with kOFF = 18.5 ± 0.6 s-1 and kON = 0.102 ± 0.006 μm-1 s-1 giving the dissociation constant Kd = 181 ± 18 μm, which was in good agreement with the value yielded by amplitude fitting: Kd = 185 ± 26 μm. MANT-ADP Binding Is a RNA Independent, Single Step Second-order Process—Although the MANT-ADP used in this study was a mixture of 2′- and 3′-isomers, single exponential binding kinetics were obtained for all concentrations. This could be the result of identical binding of the two isomers or lack of binding or FRET signal for one isomer. Fig. 4A shows the apparent rate of FRET intensity increase upon MANT-ADP mixing with P4 as a function of MANT-ADP concentration. Linearity of this dependence (up to 200 μm MANT-ADP, i.e. about five times more than Kd for MANT-ADP) suggests that MANT-ADP binding is a single step second-order association. Fig. 4B represents the FRET amplitude upon MANT-ADP binding to P4 as a function of MANT-ADP concentration. The apparent dissociation constants were independent of RNA (Kd = 36 ± 5 and 41 ± 8 μm in the absence and presence of ssRNA, respectively). Similarly, inorganic phosphate had no effect on MANT-ADP binding (Kd = 43 ± 9 μm in the presence of ssRNA and 50 mm inorganic phosphate). AMP-PNP (non-hydrolyzable ATP analog) competed with MANT-ADP binding (Kd = 114 ± 19 μm in the presence of ssRNA and 1 mm AMP-PNP) demonstrating that MANT-ADP and ATP bind to the same set of sites. Mg2+Inhibits Nucleotide Binding—Under typical cellular conditions more than 99% of all ATP and ADP is found in a complex with Mg2+ (9Zhang W. Truttmann A.C. Luthi D. McGuigan J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown previously for φ6 P4 (10Paatero A.O. Syvaoja J.E. Bamford D.H. J.

Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and more recently for φ12 P4 (4Kainov D.E. Lisal J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Mg2+ at concentrations higher than 1 mm inhibits ATP hydrolysis. To shed light on this phenomenon we studied the influence of Mg2+ on nucleotide binding (Fig. 5A). The plot of the 2′-MANT-3′-dATP dissociation constant as a function of Mg2+ concentration was linear, suggesting a competitive inhibition of substrate (Mg:2′-MANT-3′-dATP) binding by free Mg2+ ions. The slope of the line revealed the inhibition constant KI = 5 ± 1 mm. The extrapolated Mg:2′-MANT-3′-dATP dissociation constant at zero free Mg2+ concentration is 95 ± 8 μm. Similarly, Mg:MANT-ADP binding was competitively inhibited by free Mg2+ ions (Fig. 5A) having the same inhibition constant KI = 5 ± 2 mm. The extrapolated Mg:MANT-ADP dissociation constant at zero free Mg2+ concentration was 15 ± 4 μm. Thus the inhibition by Mg2+ is because of competition for the same binding site. Nucleotide Affinities—P4 affinity for different nucleotides was measured using competition against the non-hydrolyzable fluorescence ATP analog 3′-MANT-2′-dATP. Fig. 5B shows the FRET intensity decrease as a result of increasing competition with ATP and UTP. Dissociation constants determined for different nucleotides are listed in Table II. P4 exhibited similar affinity for ATP, ADP, and AMP-PNP. Thus, under the cellular conditions, where ATP concentration is millimolar and ADP concentration is micromolar, most of the nucleotide binding sites would be occupied by ATP. The UTP binding was approximately 1 order of magnitude weaker than ATP binding. This is consistent with the previously reported purine specificity of φ12 P4 (4Kainov D.E. Lisal J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R.

Detailed characteristics of the inhibition could shed light on the catalytic mechanism. Therefore we measured steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis at different concentrations of ADP or AMP-PNP and in the absence as well as in the presence of RNA (Fig. 6). In the absence of RNA, ADP inhibited hydrolysis competitively (unchanged kcat, increased Km), whereas AMP-PNP inhibited non-competitively (decreased kcat, unchanged Km). In the presence of RNA the inhibition by ADP became a mixed type (decreased kcat, increased Km), whereas the inhibition by AMP-PNP remained noncompetitive. These results demonstrated that some configurations of ATP and AMP-PNP within the hexamer (and some configurations of ATP and ADP in the presence of RNA) led to inactive protein. To find which configurations were inhibitory we have performed a titration experiment. Fig. 7A shows all possible configurations (microstates) of the ATP and the inhibitor within the hexamer. Abundance of a particular microstate is equal to A = q6-i(1-q)i, where q = [I]/([ATP] + [I]) and parameter i is the number of subunits occupied by the inhibitor (in Fig. 7A, i = 0 for the first column, i = 1 for the second column, etc.). As discussed above only some of the microstates would lead to hydrolysis. For example, if three neighboring subunits are required to bind ATP before one of them is hydrolyzed, then only the configurations, highlighted in gray, will be active. Fig. 7B shows the predicted inhibition curves for several model cases. In the “trimer of dimers” model ATP is hydrolyzed by every other subunit, in a fashion similar to F1-ATPase mechanism (12Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The model “one in the row” describes ATP hydrolysis going in sequential steps around the P4 hexamer with only one of binding sites participating in ATP hydrolysis at a time (i.e. no cooperativity). “Two in the row” model requires that two neighboring subunits cooperate in ATP hydrolysis, whereas the rest of the hexamer may bind inhibitor without any loss of activity. In analogy, the “three in the row” model assumes cooperation of three neighboring subunits. An extreme case is the concerted ATP hydrolysis model of simultaneous binding and hydrolysis of all six ATPs, which was recently proposed for the SV40 large T antigen (13Gai D. Zhao R. Li D. Finkielstein C.V. Chen X.S. Cell. 2004; 119: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The experimental data obtained for P4 and AMP-PNP as inhibitor compared well with the three in the row model, whereas ADP inhibition was approximated by the two in the row model (Fig. 7B). This implicates that to get a catalytically active complex three binding sites in the row need to be occupied, two of which must be ATP, whereas one can be ADP. The remaining three subunits are dispensable for hydrolysis and may bind AMP-PNP or ADP. Note that the model is a steady-state approximation and does not take into account effects of nucleotide binding kinetics. That might explain why the match between the experimental data and the model was not perfect (e.g. equilibrium dissociation constant of ATP and ADP are equal but rates of ATP association and dissociation might be different from those of ADP). Comparison of φ12 P4 and φ8 P4—The packaging motor from a related bacteriophage φ8 has been characterized previously (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Tuma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1343-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and allows for detailed comparison. Similarly to φ8 P4, the φ12 P4 has comparable affinity for ATP and ADP and exhibits RNA-induced cooperativity. Thus, both molecular motors are driven by the difference in cellular concentrations of ATP and ADP. In contrast to φ8 P4, RNA binding to φ12 P4 has no effect on the kinetics of nucleotide binding and release. ATP hydrolysis is the only step affected by the presence of RNA. Thus, the translocation step seems coupled to hydrolysis in φ12. This is in agreement with the translocation mechanism inferred from the crystal structures, in which the largest changes were observed between the pre-hydrolysis (P4-AMP-CPP-Mg complex) and post-hydrolysis state (P4-ADP-Mg) (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Energetic considerations for ATP-driven motors have demonstrated that most of the free energy available throughout the catalytic cycle is released during ATP binding (14Antes I. Chandler D. Wang H. Oster G. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Oster G. Wang H. Schliwa M. Molecular Motors. Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim2003: 207-227Google Scholar). Thus, the translocation must be energetically coupled to ATP binding. Given that the power stroke of P4 is mechanistically coupled to the hydrolysis step the ATP binding energy is either stored in a strained conformation of the enzyme or the energy is relayed between neighboring subunits using the cooperative mechanism proposed below. An RNA pentanucleotide was able to stimulate φ12 P4 activity, whereas the RNA nonamer was required for φ8 P4 stimulation (Fig. 1C). φ12 P4 exhibits much lower RNA affinity and translocation processivity than φ8 P4 (Fig. 1, B and C). We suggest that these differences can be explained by the lower stability of the φ12 P4 ring, which in turn leads to spontaneous opening during translocation. Similar low processivity because of ring opening was observed for the bacteriophage T7 gp4 helicase (16Jeong Y.J. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spontaneous ring opening will also allow direct binding of short RNA oligonucleotides to the RNA binding site. On the other hand, φ8 P4 employs a ring opening mechanism for RNA loading (17Lisal J. Lam T. Kainov D.E. Emmett M.R. Marshall A.G. Tuma R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consequently, this mechanism requires longer RNA oligonucleotides that bind simultaneously to the primary and secondary binding sites (18Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Note that this difference applies only for P4 hexamers in solution. After attachment to the viral procapsid the ring is stabilized and the catalytic activity is regulated (2Kainov D.E. Pirttimaa M. Tuma R. Butcher S.J. Thomas Jr., G.J. Bamford D.H. Makeyev E.V. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3515-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Origin of Cooperativity and ATP Hydrolysis Coordination—The most striking finding is that P4 exhibits steady-state hydrolysis cooperativity without ATP binding cooperativity. In other words, RNA binding, which induces cooperativity, has no effect on nucleotide binding kinetics and affinity. On the other hand, RNA binding substantially increases the catalytic efficiency by lowering the apparent Km and increasing the kcat. Hence, P4 exhibits a special type of kinetic cooperativity (19Ricard J. Noat G. J. Theor. Biol. 1985; 117: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To explain the RNA-induced cooperativity we propose a “stochastic-sequential” model. The key feature of this model is that nucleotide and RNA binding to neighboring subunits facilitates formation of the transition state. This does not lead to a change in nucleotide affinity but increases the probability of ATP hydrolysis. Thus, nucleotide binding remains independent and stochastic under all conditions, whereas the hydrolysis step becomes sequential in the presence of RNA. In the absence of RNA, the higher Km than Kd (Table I) can be explained by the necessity for simultaneous but independent binding of three ATP molecules before one of them is hydrolyzed (Fig. 8A). Inhibitor titration experiments in the absence of RNA (not shown) showed results similar to those shown in Fig. 7, suggesting that three subunits in a row need to bind ATP before one is hydrolyzed. This is also consistent with AMP-PNP being a noncompetitive inhibitor (Fig. 6), presumably acting via binding to the subunits neighboring the catalytic one. The low hydrolysis rate reflects the stochastic nature of attaining the required configuration of ATP molecules within the hexamer. In addition, this configuration must also coincide with the subunit conformations to progress toward the transition state. When, randomly, three neighboring ATP-binding subunits reach the right configuration the middle ATP molecule is hydrolyzed (Fig. 8A). This mechanism is purely stochastic with little coordination between subunits and thus the apparent cooperativity is low. Stimulation of catalytic activity (kcat increase) in the presence of RNA indicates that RNA binding facilitates transition state formation. According to the structural model the RNA pentamer, which is the shortest oligonucleotide stimulating the activity, could interact with three neighboring subunits in the hexamer (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, we assume transient interaction of three neighboring P4 subunits with RNA (designated S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 8B). In the crystal structures only two distinct conformations of RNA binding loop L2 were resolved (3Mancini E.J. Kainov D.E. Grimes J.M. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Cell. 2004; 118: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Based on the geometry of RNA and the fact that RNA is transiently bound by three neighboring subunits we propose that a third distinct conformation is attained during the transition state. For example, the L2-loop could assume a middle configuration between the two limiting positions seen in the crystal. In agreement with the inhibition experiments (Fig. 7B), S1 subunit contains ADP (just after hydrolysis), whereas S2 and S3 bind ATP. The other subunits (S4, S5, and S6) may be empty or could be occupied by AMP-PNP or ADP without any effect on hydrolysis. However, under physiological conditions (high ATP concentration) inside the cell, all these sites would be occupied by ATP with the L2 loop up, i.e. poised to engage the incoming RNA (Fig. 8B). According to the crystallographic results, hydrolysis by the S1 subunit is accompanied by the down movement of its L2 loop. This motion is transmitted via the bound RNA strand to S2 and S3 L2 loops. Because these two loops are stabilized in the up position by ATP binding the forced movement causes stress accumulation. The stress is then used to reach the transition state and subsequently is relieved during hydrolysis at S2. There is evidence for stress accumulation in the φ8 P4, in which the tightly bound RNA is stretched during the stroke (6Lisal J. Kainov D.E. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Tuma R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1343-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In analogy to the F1-ATPase (20Oster G. Wang H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 482-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Sun S. Chandler D. Dinner A.R. Oster G. Eur. Biophys. J. 2003; 32: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 396: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) we envision the energy from ATP binding to a neighboring subunit is stored in a stress loop of which RNA is an integral part (Fig. 8B). The downward movement of the RNA during hydrolysis at S2 detaches RNA from the S1 subunit and brings the RNA to a suitable position for interaction with the S4 subunit (Fig. 8B). The hydrolysis cycle then repeats at the S3 subunit. Note that the hydrolysis step modulates RNA binding affinity (association at the S4, detachment from S1), whereas it does not change the nucleotide binding affinities. The ADP for ATP exchange at S1 remains stochastic as in the absence of RNA. The sequentially coordinated hydrolysis in the presence of RNA causes lowering of Km to a value comparable with Kd (Table I). This is because each hydrolysis cycle requires on average binding of only one additional ATP molecule. The stochastic binding mode dominates the kcat at low ATP concentrations ([ATP] < Kd) and hence the activity is low. At higher ATP concentrations the sequential coupling is efficient. Gradual switching between the two limiting modes leads to the apparent cooperativity. Kinetic study of hexameric packaging motor P4 from bacteriophage φ12 revealed RNA-induced ATPase cooperativity. We propose a stochastic-sequential cooperativity model to describe the coordination of ATP hydrolysis within the hexamer in the absence of nucleotide binding cooperativity. In this model the apparent cooperativity is a result of hydrolysis stimulation by ATP and RNA binding to the neighboring subunits rather than of cooperative nucleotide binding. The translocation step is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Simultaneous interaction of neighboring subunits with RNA makes the otherwise random hydrolysis sequential and processive. Given the structural and sequence similarity between P4 and hexameric helicases this mechanism may apply to other members within this large family of molecular motors.

Dean-Nystrom E. Svennerholm A-M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Valvatne H. Sommerfelt H. Gaastra W. Bhan M.K. Grewal H.M.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on various continents highlights the evolutionary adaptability of these fimbriae (21Honarvar S. Choi B-K. Schifferli D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 987P fimbria consists of the helical arrangement of protein subunits along a filamentous axis (22Isaacson R.E. Richter P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 784-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schifferli D.M. Abraham S.N. Beachey E.H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 923-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a heteropolymeric structure that is made up of one major subunit, FasA, and two minor subunits, FasF and FasG (24Khan A.S. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4233-4243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fimbriae are not produced in the absence of any of these subunits (25Schifferli D.M. Beachey E.H. Taylor R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1230-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and export studies indicated that FasG is the first exported subunit followed by FasF and FasA (26Cao J. Khan A.S. Bayer M.E. Schifferli D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because fimbriae grow from the base, FasG was proposed to be the tip subunit and FasF, a linker molecule. The 987P system has one outer membrane protein (FasD) proposed to fold in a β-barrel structure and act as the 987P usher molecule (27Schifferli D.M. Alrutz M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 987P was the first fimbrial system found to utilize two different subunit-specific periplasmic chaperones. The FasB chaperone interacts with the major fimbrial subunit, FasA (28Edwards R.A. Cao J. Schifferli D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but not with FasG, the adhesin subunit. Conversely, FasC interacts only with FasG, but not FasA. A third chaperone-like protein, FasE, was also located in the periplasm and was shown to be required for optimal export of FasG. In contrast to most fimbriae, 987P do not agglutinate mammalian red blood cells but bind to receptors only found on the relevant piglet intestinal cells (29Dean E.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Age-related resistance to 987P-fimbriated ETEC was related to the appearance of new receptors in the mucus of post-neonatal pigs (29Dean E.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dean E.A. Whipp S.C. Moon H.W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 82-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors were proposed to inhibit 987P-mediated bacterial colonization by competing with membrane-anchored receptors. Glycolipid receptors were identified and further characterized as sulfatide and hydroxylated ceramide monohexoside (31Khan A.S. Johnston N.H. Goldfine H. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dean-Nystrom E.A. Samuel J.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4789-4794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FasG was shown to be responsible for 987P fimbrial binding to the former molecule, whereas FasA mediated 987P binding to the latter receptor (31Khan A.S. Johnston N.H. Goldfine H. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of fasG identified several positive-charged residues as involved in sulfatide recognition (33Choi B-K. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One fasG mutant (K117A) did not bind to sulfatide, suggesting that the substituted lysine residue and possibly the other charged residues communicate with the sulfate group of sulfatide by hydrogen bonding and/or salt bridges. In addition to sulfatide, a group of piglet brush border proteins of ∼32–35 kDa were described to act as 987P protein receptors in ligand blotting assays (29Dean E.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by showing that FasG was the 987P adhesin responsible for this interaction (24Khan A.S. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4233-4243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the allelic FasG adhesins with reduced binding to sulfatide still interacted like wild-type FasG with the protein receptors (33Choi B-K. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with truncated FasG molecules indicated that at least two FasG segments (Glu-211—Ser-220 and Asp-20 —Ser-41) were involved in protein receptor recognition (34Choi B.K. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Different FasG residues participated in sulfatide and protein receptor binding. Thus, the FasG adhesin was proposed to harbor two different binding domains for its two types of receptors. In this study the porcine intestinal protein receptor for the 987P fimbriae was identified, and the domain most important for the interaction with 987P was characterized.

Strain B834(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for 35S-labeling of the 987P fimbriae. Strain BL21(DE3) was used for the expression of a porcine histone H1 protein and partial fragments of it. Cultures for colony isolation or plasmid purification were grown in LB medium. When appropriate, media were supplemented with the following antibiotics: ampicillin (200 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Culture media were purchased from Difco. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Unless specified, reagents were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of 987P Fimbriae and Brush Borders of Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Fimbriae expressed on the bacterial surface were prepared by heat extraction, and brush border vesicles were prepared from piglet enterocytes as described earlier (24Khan A.S. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4233-4243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, Western and Ligand Blotting— Bacterial pellets, isolated fimbriae, purified brush border vesicles, or histone H1 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents. Gel migration shift assays were undertaken with 987P-histone H1 or 987P-poly-l-lysine mixtures (4.5:1 concentration ratios) in native 5% polyacrylamide gels (0.75 mm thick, 8 cm long) by using a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7) and reversing the electrodes at the power supply so that the positively charged histone H1 proteins migrated to the negative cathode (30 mA constant current, 4–8 h) (36Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999: 1-11Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the histone H1 proteins were probed with a sheep anti-calf histone H1 polyclonal antibody (Fizgerald, Concord, MA) or with a rabbit anti-porcine histone polyclonal antibody (prepared by Cocalico Biologicals Inc., Reamstown, PA, using purified pig histone H1 proteins as antigen) using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) for detection (27Schifferli D.M. Alrutz M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the ligand blotting assays, the blots were probed with isolated 987P fimbriae (10 μg in PBS, 0.5% BSA) or with HRP-conjugated concanavalin A. Bound fimbriae were detected with 987P quaternary structure-specific monoclonal antibody E11 (23Schifferli D.M. Abraham S.N. Beachey E.H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 923-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and ECL. For some experiments, isolated 35S-labeled 987P fimbriae were prepared from E. coli B834(DE3)/pBKC1, pBKC2, and used for fluorography, as described previously (34Choi B.K. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the ligand blotting inhibition assay, nitrocellulose strips with SDS-PAGE separated histone H1 (5 μg) were incubated with different concentrations of inhibitors for 1 h at room temperature. After several washing steps, the strips were incubated with 35S-labeled fimbriae. Amino Acid Sequencing—Brush border vesicle proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands recognized by the 987P fimbriae were mapped by a ligand blotting assay of one of two gels run in parallel. The two major protein bands labeled by ligand blotting were cut out of the gel and separately subjected to in-gel proteolysis with trypsin. A blank control band from a parallel gel run without brush border proteins was subjected to the same treatment. Tryptic fragments of the two proteins and the mock control were separated by microbore reversed phase HPLC. Of the two analyzed protein bands giving the same HPLC profile, only samples from HPLC peaks of the top major band were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) (Proteonomics Facility, Dr. D. W. Speicher, The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania). Several samples specific for the brush borders (i.e. not present in the HPLC profile of the mock control band) and showing only one distinct peak by MALDI-MS were submitted to sequencing by Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems, Procise Protein Sequencing system, Model 494). Isolation of Porcine Histone H1 Proteins—Histone H1 proteins were isolated from intestinal epithelial cells of neonatal piglets by using a standard protocol (37Ofek I. Courtney H.S. Schifferli D.M. Beachey E.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 512-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Brix K. Summa W. Lottspeich F. Herzog V. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, epithelial cells were obtained by gently scraping the mucosa of washed segments of the small intestines of 1–3-days-old piglets and placing the material in iced-cold PBS, pH 7.2, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The mucosal cells were washed 3 times, and histone H1 proteins were extracted from the mucosa with 5% HClO4 at 4 °C for 30 min. The treated cells were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. The histone H1 proteins were obtained by precipitation in trichloroacetic acid (20%, final concentration) at 4 °C overnight. The precipitated histone H1 proteins were concentrated by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), washed with cold acetone three times, dried in a vacuum desiccator and dissolved in deonized H2O to determine the protein concentration (39Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Rat histones were from a rat nuclear extract. The quality of each batch was tested by SDS-PAGE to confirm at least 90% purity. Protein aliquots were stored at –70 °C for later use. Binding Assay in Microtiter Plates—Fimbriae (1 mg in 1 ml of PBS) were biotinylated with 2 μl of 10 mg/ml NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in deionized H2O for 2 h at room temperature. The fimbriae were dialyzed in PBS to remove unreacted biotin. Ninety-six-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (polyvinyl chloride; Falcon, BD Biosciences) were coated with porcine histone H1 proteins or BSA as a control (5 μg/ml 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.2, 100 μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The plates were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1.5 h, washed 4 times with PBS, and incubated with serial dilutions of biotinylated 987P fimbriae in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, 100 μl of streptavidin-HRP conjugate diluted 1/2000 in PBS, 0.5% BSA was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the last washing step, bound fimbriae were detected by using o-phenylenediamine as the chromogenic substrate analogue and reading the absorbance at 450 nm (37Ofek I. Courtney H.S. Schifferli D.M. Beachey E.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 512-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protease Treatments of Brush Border Vesicles or Histone H1—Isolated brush borders (10 mg protein/ml, 50 μl) were digested for 1 h at 56 °C with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science, 10 μg) in 100 μl of digestion buffer P (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) or for 2 h at 37 °C with TPCK-treated trypsin from bovine pancreas (25 μg) in 100 μl of digestion buffer TC (100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS). Histone H1 (36 μg) was digested for 4 h at 37 °C with TLCK-treated chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas (0.5 μg) in 40 μl of digestion buffer TC or for 24 h at 37 °C with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (0.6 unit) in 40 μl of digestion buffer V (50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.275 m urea). The digested brush border or histone H1 proteins were retaken in 2 × SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, as described above. Cloning and Expression of Porcine Histone H1 in E. coli—The following steps were taken to clone a full-length porcine histone H1 cDNA. Two expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the pig data base (AW415122 and B1185028) contained DNA that was similar to known human and murine histone H1 sequences. These EST sequences were used to design two similar pairs of oligonucleotide primers for PCR (UH1–2, 5′-CCCCCAGTGTCCGAGCTCATCAC-3′, and LH1–2, 5′-GGTCTGTACCAAGGTGCCCTTGCTCAC-3′; UH1–3, 5′CCTCCGGTGTCCGAGCTCATCAC-3′, and LH1–3, 5′-AGTCTGCACCAGGGTGCCCTTGCTCAC-3′. Using a λ ZAPII library of pig jejunal cDNA (40Halsted C.H. Ling E.H. Luthi-Carter R. Villanueva J.A. Gardner J.M. Coyle J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20417-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), two PCR fragments (both 177 bp) were obtained and cloned into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). The cloned DNA fragments were sequenced and shown to be 91.6 –100% similar to the corresponding region of the EST sequences. In a second step, the two 177-bp PCR fragments were purified and labeled in one reaction mix (Random Primer fluorescein labeling kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to probe the λ ZAPII library by plaque hybridization as recommended (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). From about 105 plaques, three positive plaques could be purified successfully in the following screenings. The inserts of the corresponding in vivo excised phagemids were sequenced, and one insert was shown to harbor the 5′ end of a histone H1 ORF. This 384-bp DNA fragment was amplified with a stop codon at its 3′ end using PCR and cloned into plasmid pET22b (Novagen) to get pZS384 (from amino acid residue Met-1 to Pro-128) (Table I). Third, a full-length porcine histone H1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR (Marathon cDNA amplification kit; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using primers designed to include the start and stop codons of porcine histone H1, as suggested by the EST sequences (UH1, 5′-ATGTCGGAGACCGCTCCAGTG-3′, and LH1, 5′-CTATTACTTCTTCTTGGAGACGGCTTTCT-3′), and isolated mRNA from piglet enterocytes as template (Micro-Trak 2.0 mRNA isolation system; Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T (pZSH1) and shown to represent a full-length 669-bp ORF by DNA sequencing. To express histone H1 or various continuous domains of it in E. coli, four PCR products incorporating histone H1 DNA were amplified from pZSH1 as template. For this three pairs of primers including NdeI at their 5′ end and BamHI at their 3′ end were used to amplify and clone corresponding fragments into the expression plasmid pET22b. The three resulting constructs were pZS669 (full-length histone H1), pZS444 (from residues Met-1 to Phe-148), and pZS212 (from residues Ala-36 to Leu-108). A fourth construct, pZS468, was prepared by inverse PCR (41Silver J. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 137-146Google Scholar) using pZS669 as template and two primers designed to delete residues Lys-30 to Asn-109 from the full-length histone H1 (Table I). The histone H1 protein and protein fragments were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (26Cao J. Khan A.S. Bayer M.E. Schifferli D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Choi B.K. Schifferli D.M. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry and Electron Microscopy—Several 1-cm-long intestinal segments were collected from neonatal piglets and fixed immediately after euthanasia following IACUC guidelines. For immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated, and paraffin-embedded. Glass slide-mounted serial sections were prepared for indirect immunohistochemistry using mouse anti-human histone H1 monoclonal IgG2a (clone AE-4; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). All reactions were performed at room temperature. Tissue sections were treated with H2O2 for 10 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidases and incubated with the primary antibody for 30 min followed by biotinylated anti-mouse antibody for 15 min at room temperature, HRP-conjugated streptavidin for 15 min, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen for 3 min. The counterstaining was obtained using Mayer's hematoxylin; the slides were then dehydrated, and coverslips were applied. The negative controls were obtained using N-Universal Negative Control (cocktail of mixture of nonspecific mouse IgG, IgM, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) instead of the primary antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy was undertaken at the Biomedical Imaging Core, University of Pennsylvania. Intestinal tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in LR-White (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), and UV-cured at –20 °C. 90-nm-thick sections were picked up on nickel grids for post-embedding immunostain with the mouse anti-human histone H1 monoclonal IgG2a (clone AE-4 described above) followed by an anti-mouse antibody gold particle (10- or 15-nm diameters) conjugate. A mouse monoclonal IgG2a was used as the isotype (negative) control (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were captured in Jeol JEM 1010 by an AMT 12-HR-aided Hamamatsu CCD camera (42Smith R.M. Jarett L. De Pablo F. Scanes C.G. Weintraub B.D. Handbook of Endocrine Research Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). All the supplies for electron microscopy were from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). Binding of 987P Fimbriae to Protein Receptors of Brush Border Vesicles—As shown previously, the 987P fimbriae, used as ligand, bind to a group of intestinal brush molecules migrating like globular proteins of 32–35 kDa (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 4). The proteinaceous nature of these receptors was confirmed by their susceptibility to the proteolytic activities of trypsin or proteinase K (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). N-Glycosidase F treatment of the isolated brush border vesicles did not affect the 987P binding activity and the migration properties of the receptor bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). To control for the activity of the enzyme, a known N-glycosylated protein (RNase B) was treated with the same N-glycosidase and probed with concanavalin A, a lectin known to recognize the N-glycosylated moiety of RNase B. In contrast to the untreated RNase B, N-glycosidase F-treated RNase B appeared smaller by SDS-PAGE analysis and was not recognized by concanavalin A on a ligand blot (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4), indicating that the enzyme was active. Moreover, dithiothreitol treatment of the isolated brush border vesicles did also not affect the 987P binding activity and the migration properties of the receptor bands (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). The activity of dithiothreitol was controlled with the major 987P fimbrial subunit which contains one disulfide bridge and migrates as an apparently larger protein when reduced (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicated that the studied intestinal 987P protein receptors do not involve N-linked carbohydrates or disulfide bridges that are important for their 987P fimbriae-specific receptor activity. Identification of the Protein Receptors for 987P—The identity of the 987P protein receptors was determined by protein sequencing. For this, brush border proteins from piglet intestinal epithelial cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the two major protein bands recognized by the 987P fimbriae were individually digested with trypsin. Tryptic fragments of the two protein bands separated by microbore reversed phase HPLC showed a similar peak profile. This indicated that the two protein bands represented partially degraded or post-translationally modified variants of the same protein. Thus, only the upper protein band was studied further. Samples of separate and distinctly unique peaks were analyzed by MALDI-MS. The samples containing a single peak by MALDI-MS were submitted to protein sequencing. Two samples contained one peptide each that could be sequenced successfully. The peptide sequences (ALAAAGYDVEK an"

One of the key enzymes in this pathway is glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) whose dysfunction in human causes primary hyperoxaluria type 2, a disease resulting in oxalate accumulation and formation of kidney stones. In this study, we provide evidence for a transcriptional regulation by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) of the mouse GRHPR gene in liver. Mice fed with a PPARα ligand or in which PPARα activity is enhanced by fasting increase their GRHPR gene expression via a peroxisome proliferator response element located in the promoter region of the gene. Consistent with these observations, mice deficient in PPARα present higher plasma levels of oxalate in comparison with their wild type counterparts. As expected, the administration of a PPARα ligand (Wy-14,643) reduces the plasma oxalate levels. Surprisingly, this effect is also observed in null mice, suggesting a PPARα-independent action of the compound. Despite a high degree of similarity between the transcribed region of the human and mouse GRHPR gene, the human promoter has been dramatically reorganized, which has resulted in a loss of PPARα regulation. Overall, these data indicate a species-specific regulation by PPARα of GRHPR, a key gene of the glyoxylate cycle.

As a major survival strategy, animals have developed metabolic pathways to store energy when food is abundant, which allows them to overcome periods of deprivation. Thus, they are able to switch from efficiently storing excess energy to its rapid mobilization to keep the organism alive when food is not available. Hormonal changes during fasting result in enhanced triglyceride hydrolysis in the adipose tissue, as well as glucose and ketone body production in the liver, to respond to the energy needs of the peripheral organs. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; AGT, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; FIAF, fasting-induced adipose factor; Luc, luciferase; h, human; m, mouse; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; UTR, untranslated region; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator response element; GRHPR, glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase; RPA, RNase protection assay; RT, reverse transcription. as members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, are involved in the transcriptional control of these metabolic pathways, including β-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism, which underscores their importance in energy homeostasis (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 2Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W.

Mandard S. Voshol P.J. Escher P. Tan N.S. Havekes L.M. Koenig W. Marz W. Tafuri S. Wahli W. Muller M. Kersten S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Upon activation by fatty acids and derivatives, they heterodimerize with the receptor for 9-cis-retinoid acid (retinoid X receptor, NR2B) and bind to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter region of the genes whose expression they regulate. Three PPAR isotypes have been identified: PPARα (NR1C1); PPARβ/δ (NR1C2); and PPARγ (NR1C3). They exhibit different expression patterns and functions in animals (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). PPARγ plays an important role in inflammation, lipid storage, and glucose homeostasis, whereas PPARβ/δ is important for skin functions, brain, and placenta development and also for energy homeostasis (3Shearer B.G. Hoekstra W.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PPARα, which is a part of this study, regulates peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, microsomal fatty acid hydroxylation, lipoprotein metabolism, bile and amino acid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, biotransformation, inflammation, hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents, and other pathways and processes (5Mandard S. Muller M. Kersten S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In particular, this PPAR has been implicated in the regulation of the expression of two enzymes involved in the glyoxylate pathway, namely alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) (2Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). AGT has a dual function, as alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and as serine: pyruvate aminotransferase, and is responsible for the conversion of glyoxylate into glycine and for the conversion of serine to hydroxypyruvate, respectively (see Fig. 1). Similarly, GRHPR functions both as glyoxylate reductase and as hydroxypyruvate reductase. GRHPR plays a key role in directing the carbon flux to gluconeogenesis by its ability to convert hydroxypyruvate into d-glycerate (see Fig. 1) (6Holmes R.P. Assimos D.G. J. Urol. 1998; 160: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of this enzyme by PPARα may contribute to the function of the receptor in energy homeostasis. Linked to their role in metabolism, AGT and GRHPR are associated to primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and type 2, respectively, which are caused by an overproduction of oxalate. Oxalate is an inorganic acid that, when combined with calcium, produces insoluble calcium oxalate, which is the most common constituent of kidney stones (7Ogawa Y. Miyazato T. Hatano T. World J. Surg. 2000; 24: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deficiency in these two enzymes results in glyoxylate accumulation (see Fig. 1) and consequently to oxalate overproduction (8Holmes R.P. Goodman H.O. Assimos D.G. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9Leumann E. Hoppe B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1986-1993PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a decrease in glycolate oxidase activity and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity were observed after clofibrate treatment in rats, which results in an increase in oxalate concentration in urines (10Sharma V. Schwille P.O. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 135-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the involvement of PPARα in the regulation of glyoxylate metabolism and consequently in oxalate production. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) on a 10-h dark, 14-h light cycle. Pure-bred wild type or PPARα knock-out (11Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) mice of age 8-10 weeks were used for all of the experiments. Animal experiments were approved by the Service Veterinaire of the Canton de Vaud. Fasted animals were deprived of food for 24 h starting at the beginning of the light cycle. The PPARα ligand Wy-14,643 (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose) were administrated by gavage for 5 days (RNase protection assay (RPA) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)) or mixed to the food (0.1%) for 5 days (oxalate assay). Full-length mouse GRHPR cDNA was amplified using the following primer: 5′-ACCGCTCGAGCATGAAACCGGCGCGAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTTACAGCTTGAGTTC-3′. The amplification product was digested with XhoI/KpnI and subcloned into pEGFP-N2 or pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences). The mouse promoter region was amplified from a λ-phage containing a genomic fragment of the mouse promoter region. The different fragments of the promoter were obtained using the common downstream primer (5′-GGGGTACCCCAAGACCCGGAGCAGCAAACA-3′) and three different upstream primers (5′-TCCCCCGGGGGAGGTTGTAAGCCACCATTTGGT-3′, 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGACTGGTGGGGATATGTGTTT-3′, and 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGATCTACCCGTGGCTCAGCATA-3′) for amplification and subcloned in plasmids p2500-Luc, p1100-Luc, and p400-Luc, respectively. Similarly, the human promoter was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from HepG2 cells. A common downstream primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCATGAGTCGCACCGGTCTCATC-3′) and the upstream primers (5′-GGGGTACCCCTCAAGGAAACCAACCCTGGTGC-3′, 5′-GGGGTCCCCCGGGACTCAGCCACCAC-AACCA-3′, and 5′-GGGGTACCCCGAGGCGGGAGGATCAT-TGGAGCAC-3′) were used for the amplification of the fragments subcloned in plasmids p4500-Luc, p3000-Luc, and p2000-Luc, respectively. PCR was performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 4 min; 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s; 55 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 2 min with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were digested with KpnI and SmaI for the mouse fragments and with KpnI and XhoI for the human fragments and subcloned in front of the luciferase reporter gene into the ΔpGL2 basic vector (Promega). HepG2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 1 × minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates the day before transfection. For cotransfections, 1.5 μg of reporter vector, 0.1 μg of PPARα (pCDNA3.1/hPPARα), and 0.4 μg of pEF1/Myc-His expressing β-galactosidase (Invitrogen) were used for each well. The total amount of DNA was adjusted with pCDNA3.1 to 3 μg. Transfections were performed using the Superfect™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 h after transfection, serum was removed and cells were treated with 10 μm Wy-14,643 (ChemSyn Laboratories) or Me2SO. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate buffer and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). For the β-galactosidase assay, lysis solution was mixed with 2× assay buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2; 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The solution was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 420 nm. Luciferase was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). γ-32P-End-labeled primers 5′-CATGAGTCGCGCCGGTTTCATAAGAC-3′ (mouse) and 5′-ACCTGGCAGTACAGAAGCTGGC-3′ (human) were used for reverse transcription (RT) and sequencing. The sequencing was carried out using the fmol DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega). 50 μg of total RNA was mixed with the labeled primer (3 μm) in hybridization buffer (150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA). The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then placed at 65 °C for 1 h and 30 min at room temperature for 1 h and 30 min and finally at 4 °C overnight. Reverse transcription was then performed with the Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed using 30 μg of total RNA according to standard protocols (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mouse GRHPR cDNA probe was random-primed-labeled using the High Prime kit (Roche Applied Science). RT-PCR/RPA—Gene-specific probes for the mouse GRHPR, AGT, and lactate dehydrogenase A were obtained by RT-PCR from mouse liver total RNA and cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). RT-PCR was performed with the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Applied Science). 100 ng of total RNA was used for each PCR. The number of cycles was first determined to find the exponential phase of each set of primers. Gene-specific antisense riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with either T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerase (Ambion). For all of the riboprobes with the exception of L27, a ratio of 1:1 of [α-32P]UTP to cold UTP was used, whereas a ratio of 1:20 was used for L27 probe. RPA was carried out using the Direct Protect lysate RPA kit (Ambion) with the following modifications. 15 μg of total RNA were resuspended in 45 μl of lysis buffer and incubated with 5 × 104 cpm of gene-specific and L27 riboprobes. RPA products were resolved in a 6% electrolyte gradient-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Pure-bred wild type or PPARα null mice on a sv129 background were used. Mice were fed by gavage with either Wy-14,643 (PPARα ligand; 50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) for 5 days. After the indicated treatment, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver was rapidly perfused with prewarmed (37 °C) phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min followed by 0.2% collagenase for 10 min. The liver then was diced and forced through a 60 μm stainless steel sieve, and the hepatocytes were collected directly into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% formaldehyde. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the hepatocytes were pelleted and ChIP was performed using PPARα antibody as previously described (13Di Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). PCR was performed using primers flanking the mGRHPR PPREs. The primers flanking the mouse PPREs were as follows: 5′-CCCATGGGACAGATAAGGAAGACA-3′ and 5′-CCACCCAGGCGAGCTAGACACAA-G-3′ for PPRE1; 5′-AGGCTGGCCACAAACTCAC-TCT-3′ and 5′-CTGCCACCGGACCTTCATT-TT-3′ for PPRE2; and 5′-CTGGCCTGGGGACACGAAAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGCGCCAAGGACAA-CACAGT-3′ for the negative control. HepG2 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and transfected with a PPARα-expressing construct. 16 h post-transfection, cells were induced with either 0.01% Me2SO (vehicle) or 10 μm Wy-14,643 for 6 h and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde. After 15 min at 37 °C, cells were pelleted and ChIP was performed using a PPARα antibody as previously described (13Di Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The PCR primers for the putative human PPREs were 5′-TTGCCAAGGACCCACTTTGTACTGAG-3′ and 5′-TGGACTGGGCCAGGAAAGATAAGGT-3′ for hPPRE3; and 5′-CCCTGTGAATGTGGGAAAGCTCTT-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGCCCTCAGGAGAAGCAGGA-3′ for hPPRE4; 5′-TCAAAGTCATCAGCACCATGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-ATAACACCTGCCTTTGCTACTTCAAG-3′ for hPPRE5; and 5′-AAGTTCAGAGCTGGGAAGGCGAACAG-3′ and 5′-TAGAGGGAGAGGAGGCAGGGTTGAG-3′ for the fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF)-positive control PPRE. Mouse plasma was acidified by dilution 1:1 with 0.15 n HCl to dissociate oxalate from plasmatic proteins. Plasmatic proteins were then removed by ultrafiltration and by centrifugation at 14,000 × g (1 h, room temperature) in a Microcon YM30 column (Amicon). The measure of oxalate in ultrafiltrate was done using the oxalate oxidase/peroxidase method (Kit Oxalate, Dialine) on a Cobas FARA automate (Roche Applied Science). Using SABRE (selective amplification via biotin and restriction-mediated enrichment) (14Lavery D.J. Lopez-Molina L. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6831-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we previously isolated the cDNA of a novel target gene for PPARα whose identity and regulation are studied herein. The full-length cDNA was amplified using 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR, cloned, and sequenced. A comparison of these mouse cDNA and derived protein sequences with those present in the NCBI data base indicated a very high similarity with the human GRHPR sequence. This analysis also revealed the presence of a region presenting a high homology with the d-isomer 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase consensus motif (PROSITE accession number PS00671) and a putative binding site for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). These characteristics suggested that the gene encodes a protein with an enzymatic activity, most likely mouse GRHPR. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed a Leu-Lys-Leu motif at the protein C terminus, which is close to the consensus motif of the peroxisomal targeting signal-1 that typically consists of these three amino acids or a conservative variant thereof (15Gould S.J. Collins C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the cloned cDNA might encode a peroxisomal protein. To determine the subcellular localization of this gene product, fusion proteins with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized either at the C-terminal (GRHPR N2) or at the N-terminal (GRHPR C2) end of GRHPR were generated. When transfected into HEK 293 cells, the constructs produced cytoplasmic fusion proteins (Fig. 2). As a control, a GFP fusion acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) was targeted to peroxisomes as expected, whereas the mutation of the peptide signal Ser-Lys-Leu into Leu-Lys-Leu, as found in GRHPR, resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of the mutated ACO. These results suggested that the cloned cDNA encodes a protein localized in the cytoplasm. We then examined the expression profile of the gene in different organs by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, high expression levels were detected in the liver and a much lower expression was also found in the kidney. Thus, based on the high percentage of identity, cytoplasmic localization, identical gene organization (see below), and expression profile in liver and kidney as human GRHPR (16Giafi C.F. Rumsby G. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 35: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we concluded that the identified gene encodes the mouse GRHPR.Fig. 3Expression pattern of mouse GRHPR. Northern blot analysis of mouse total RNA (30 μg/lane) from various tissues was performed using a GRHPR-specific probe. The mRNA level of the L27 ribosomal protein (L27) was used as control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then investigated the genomic organization of this GRHPR gene. Genomic DNA was obtained by screening a mouse λ-phage genomic library using two probes: one from the 5′ end (nucleotides 40-370) and one from the 3′ end (nucleotides 938-1237) of the cDNA. Two overlapping clones were identified containing the entire gene and ~10 kb of DNA upstream of the translation initiation codon ATG (data not shown). After sequencing, a comparison of the cDNA and the genomic sequences allowed determination of the organization of the gene (Fig. 4A), which was recently mapped on mouse chromosome 4 B2 (17Waterston R.H.

The gene spans over ~10 kb and is composed of 9 exons. The different exon lengths range from 73 (Exon 3) to 321 bp (Exon 9) in size corresponding to a total coding region of 987 bp for a transcribed region of 9369 bp (see below). The ATG start codon was located in Exon 1, 80 bp downstream of the transcription initiation site (see below). The last exon, Exon 9, contains the stop codon TAA and a 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of 199 bp in which a polyadenylation signal, AUUAAA, was found 19 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. The eight introns are ranging in size from 489 bp (Intron III) to 1568 bp (Intron VII). All of the exon-intron boundaries have the canonical GT/AG motif with the exception of the splice donor of Exon 2, which has a non-canonical site TA/AG (Fig. 4B). A comparison with the human GRHPR gene localized on chromosome 9q12 (18Huang T. Yang W. Pereira A.C. Craigen W.J. Shih V.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) revealed an identical genomic organization with eight introns flanked by nine exons. The location of the eight introns is strictly conserved, and the length of the coding sequence of the human gene is the same (987 bp) as that of the mouse gene (Fig. 4B). However, the length of the introns varies between the two species. Furthermore, the 5′-UTR (106 bp) and the 3′-UTR (207 bp) of the human transcript are longer than in the mouse (80 and 199 bp, respectively). Firstly, the transcription initiation site of the two genes was determined. Primer extension analysis showed that the transcription start sites were 24 bp upstream in mouse (Fig. 5A) and 26 bp upstream in human (Fig. 5B) of the 5′ends of cDNAs contained in GenBank™ data base (accession numbers BY353228 and CB998056). In human, two primer extension products separated by only 1 bp were detected, possibly reflecting 5′-cap methylation of the mRNA, which may cause incomplete reverse transcription of some of the mRNA molecules. Secondly, the alignment of the two promoter sequences showed a surprisingly poor homology at first sight but further analysis revealed that the proximal region of the mouse promoter (~-300 to ~-2000) is found in a reverse orientation in the human gene 4 kb upstream the transcription initiation site (~-3900 to ~-5600) (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the functional PPRE in the mouse promoter (mPPRE1) (see below) was also found but less conserved in human in this shifted region (Fig. 5C). To know whether this displacement and inversion of promoter region was specific to human, the GRHPR promoter of other species was also analyzed. Comparison with the rat (Ensemble data base accession number RNOR03291619), dog (Ensemble data base contig 55728.1.64020), and chimpanzee (Ensemble data base accession number AADA01236509) promoter showed that the rearrangement is also present in the chimpanzee but not in the rat and dog promoter (Fig. 5D). The alignment in the same orientation of the rearranged promoter fragment from the mouse, rat, chimpanzee, and human promoter revealed conserved regions among the four species, which may suggest that regulatory functions have been maintained after reconfiguration of the promoter in primates (Fig. 6). Interestingly, however, the functional PPRE identified in the mouse sequence (see below) was not conserved in any of the other species, not even in the rat where the half-sites of the response element are separated by 12 nucleotides (Fig. 6). Further analysis of the promoter demonstrated a high level of sequence repeats in the human promoter between the transcription initiation site and the boundary of the inverted region. Indeed, this region contains 64% repeated elements (41.5% short interspeed elements, 16.5% long interspeed elements, and 6% long terminal repeat elements), whereas the average of the human genome is 46%. In comparison, only 21% of the mouse promoter region is constituted of such elements (21% short interspeed elements), which is under the average of 37.5% for the complete genome (17Waterston R.H.

Interestingly, the percentage of repeats in the shifted region is 25 and 20% for the human and the mouse, respectively. These results suggest that even though the shifted region may have some regulatory function, the promoter region in primates underwent dramatic rearrangements also attested by its high content in repeated elements and might have lost PPAR responsiveness (see below). However, an analysis of the human and mouse 5′ region over 4500 bp revealed several putative PPREs (NUBIScan algorithm) (19P"

Cdk1/cyclin B kinase activation is also known to be required for mitosis entry. More recently, MAP kinase activity has also been shown to increase during mitosis. In sea urchin embryos, both kinases show a similar activation profile, peaking at the time of mitosis entry. We tested whether the activity of both kinases is required for mitosis entry and whether either kinase controls mitotic calcium signals. We found that reducing the activity of either mitotic kinase prevents nuclear envelope breakdown, despite the presence of a calcium transient, when cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity is alone inhibited. When MAP kinase activity alone was inhibited, the calcium signal was absent, suggesting that MAP kinase activity is required to generate the calcium transient that triggers nuclear envelope breakdown. However, increasing intracellular free calcium by microinjection of calcium buffers or InsP3 while MAP kinase was inhibited did not itself induce nuclear envelope breakdown, indicating that additional MAP kinase-regulated events are necessary. After MAP kinase inhibition early in the cell cycle, the early events of the cell cycle (pronuclear migration/fusion and DNA synthesis) were unaffected, but chromosome condensation and spindle assembly are prevented. These data indicate that in sea urchin embryos, MAP kinase activity is part of a signaling complex alongside two components previously shown to be essential for entry into mitosis: the calcium transient and the increase in cdk1/cyclinB kinase activity.

The rapid cycling from interphase to mitosis in early embryos follows the activity of the highly conserved maturation-promoting factor (1Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Maturation-promoting factor consists of a regulatory subunit, cyclin B, and a catalytic subunit, cdk1 (2Dunphy W.G. Brizuela L.

Cell. 1990; 60: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Activation of cdk1 is dependent on it binding to its regulatory subunit, cyclin B, and subsequent phosphorylation events. Levels of cyclin B begin to rise during G2. Once the cdk1/cyclin B kinase complex is formed, it is maintained in an inactive state through phosphorylation of cdk1 at Thr14 and Tyr15 by protein kinases Wee1/Mik1 and Myt1 (5Lew D.J. Kornbluth S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Activation is a consequence of Thr161 being phosphorylated by the Cdk activating kinase (6Docommun B. Brambilla P.

During interphase, the complex maintains an overall cytoplasmic localization, but during late prophase, as the cell approaches mitosis, active cdk1/cyclin B kinase accumulates in the nucleus (12Hagting A. Karlsson C. Clute P. Jackman M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4127-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) 1The abbreviations used are: NEB, nuclear envelope breakdown; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; XCL100, Xenopus MAP kinase phosphatase-1; MAP, microtubule-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; DIC, differential interference contrast; MBP, myelin basic protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. is thought to entail depolymerization of lamins, which are integral proteins of the nuclear membrane (13Newport J. Spann T. Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since cdk1 has been shown to phosphorylate nuclear lamins in vitro (14Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 15Peter M. Heitlinger E. Haner M. Aebi U. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), one possibility is that NEB occurs as the result of lamin phosphorylation by cdk1/cyclin B kinase when it translocates to the nucleus (16Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, in sea urchin embryos, it has been shown that a second mitotic kinase, MAP kinase, displays a similar activation profile and localization to that of cdk1/cyclin B kinase, prior to NEB (17Chiri S. De Nadai C. Ciapa B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAP kinase has also been shown to be active during mitosis in somatic cells in culture and in Xenopus cell-free cycling extracts (19Guadagno T.M. Ferrell J.E.

The activity increase and relocalization of MAP kinase to the nucleus just prior to NEB suggest a possible role in mitosis entry (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sea urchin embryos, a cell messenger signaling event is involved in mitosis entry. Increases in [Ca2+]i have been observed just before and during mitosis in oocytes, embryos, and mammalian somatic cells (23Whitaker M. Patel R. Development. 1990; 108: 525-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hepler P.K. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Berridge M.J.

We have shown that these transients are signals that control entry into mitosis (27Wilding M. Wright E.M. Patel R. Ellis-Davies G. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and chromatid disjunction (28Groigno L. Whitaker M. Cell. 1998; 92: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in the early cell cycles of sea urchin embryos. The mitotic Ca2+ signals are generated by activation of phospholipase Cγ, which leads to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release from internal stores (29Ciapa B. Pesando D. Wilding M. Whitaker M. Nature. 1994; 368: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Shearer J. De Nadai C. Emily-Fenouil F. Gache C. Whitaker M. Ciapa B. Development. 1999; 126: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the mitotic Ca2+ transients in other oocytes and embryos and in mammalian somatic cells is less clear than it is in the sea urchin embryo (31Tombes R.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Tombes R.M. Simerly C. Borisy G.G. Schatten G. J.

Biol. 2001; 12: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), However, there is no doubt that Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ oscillations are frequently detected as the cell approaches and passes through mitosis (34Steinhardt R.A. Alderton J. Nature. 1988; 332: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35Kao J.P.Y. Alderton J. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, stimulation of the activating mitotic phosphatase Cdc25C is dependent on a calmodulin-regulated kinase, calmodulin kinase II (37Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7958-7968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Calmodulin kinase II activation is essential for NEB in the sea urchin embryo (38Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has been shown that chromosome condensation and NEB can be caused prematurely in sea urchin embryos by injecting InsP3 and Ca2+-EGTA buffers (39Twigg J. Patel R. Whitaker M. Nature. 1988; 332: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, preventing protein (cyclin) synthesis abolishes cell cycle-associated Ca2+ changes and renders the nucleus insensitive to these exogenously generated Ca2+ increases (39Twigg J. Patel R. Whitaker M. Nature. 1988; 332: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), confirming that cdk1/cyclinB activation is downstream of the calcium signal. It is not known how the cell cycle kinase/phosphatase cascades cause the essential increase in [Ca2+]i just before mitosis. It has been suggested from first principles that incipient activation of cdk1 may modulate Ca2+ release mechanisms to trigger a Ca2+ signal that coordinates and amplifies cdk1 activation (40Swanson C.A. Arkin A.P. Ross J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the observation that Cdc25C is in turn activated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-calmodulin kinase II pathway (37Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J.

Cell Sci. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Google Scholar). It too may be required for mitosis entry and may modulate Ca2+ release. We determined whether cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity, MAP kinase activity, or both are required for mitosis entry and capable of modulating the Ca2+ transient associated with NEB in early sea urchin embryos. We found that inhibiting either mitotic kinase prevents NEB. Preventing increases in MAP kinase activity alone abolished the Ca2+ increase that precedes NEB, indicating that it modulates the Ca2+ release mechanism. The role of MAP kinase during first mitosis in sea urchin embryos extends beyond controlling Ca2+ release since injection of InsP3 or Ca2+-EGTA buffer after inhibition of MAP kinase did not rescue the NEB block. Monitoring chromatin and microtubules in embryos treated with MAP kinase inhibitors revealed that MAP kinase activity is also required for chromosome condensation and bipolar spindle assembly. Chemicals and Treatments—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and materials were obtained from Sigma. Chemicals used in the treatment of embryos were dissolved in Me2SO so that the final chamber concentration of Me2SO (<1%) did not affect the cell cycle (data not shown). U0126 (100 μm; Promega, Southampton, UK) and roscovitine (20 μm) were added to embryos at 12 and 35 min after fertilization, respectively. Roscovitine was a kind gift from Dr L. Meijer. Gamete Handling and Fertilization—Eggs from the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus (Marinus, CA) were obtained by intracoelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl and collected in artificial sea water (435 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 15 mm MgSO4, 11 mm CaCl2, 10 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, osmolarity 950–1000 mosmol). All chemicals were of analytical grade and came from BDH (Poole, UK). Sperm was collected “dry” and stored at 4 °C for no more than 2 days. Eggs were dejellied by passage through a Nitex mesh and attached to glass coverslips with polylysine, as described previously (42Becchetti A. Whitaker M. Development. 1997; 124: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments on fertilized eggs, dejellied eggs were fertilized, stripped of their fertilization envelopes (by Nitex mesh), and then attached to coverslips (as above). Nuclear envelope breakdown was scored using DIC microscopy. Time to NEB in controls was normalized to 70 min in all experiments in which intracellular Ca2+ concentration was monitored. Expression and Purification of His-tagged XCL100 Fusion Protein and p13suc1 Protein—Plasmid DNA encoding XCL100 was obtained from Dr. X. Wang (43Wang X.M. Zhai Y. Ferrel Jr., J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The fragment was excised from the original construct and subcloned into pBAD/gIII (Invitrogen) before being used to transform LMG194 bacterial cells for expression of the His-tagged fusion protein. An overnight culture of bacteria was diluted 1:10 and grown to an A600 of 0.5 before being induced with a final concentration of 0.2% arabinose for 5 h. After harvest and lysis, purification was carried out on a nickel column (ProBond™ resin, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The majority of the XCL100 was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. Following purification, the imidazole elution buffer was exchanged with phosphate-buffered saline, and the proteins were concentrated using Microcon® 30 microconcentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to 20–25 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA reagent assay (Pierce). The construct was injected to a volume of 0.5–0.8% egg volume with a pipette concentration of 20–25 mg/ml, resulting in a cytoplasmic concentration of ≥100 μg/ml. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe p13suc1 expression vector pET21b.p13suc1 was a kind gift of Dr T. Hunt (ICRF Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, UK). After purification by gel filtration, the protein was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The final beads contained about 8 mg p13/ml gel. Microinjection Experiments—All compounds injected were made up in microinjection buffer (0.5 m KCl, 20 mm PIPES, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8). Cytoplasmic concentrations were determined by evaluating cytoplasmic displacement (27Wilding M. Wright E.M. Patel R. Ellis-Davies G. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (0.1–1.0% pipette concentration). The microinjection procedure was performed using drawn borosilicate glass micropipettes (Clark Electromedical Instruments, GCF150F-10), which were manipulated with a hydraulic micromanipulator and a piezoelectric advance (Märzhäuser Wetzlar, Wetzlar-Steindorf, Germany). Solutions were then injected using gas pressure, and the micropipette was withdrawn. The borosilicate glass capillaries with inner filament were pulled by a standard vertical puller (BioScience, Sheerness, Kent, UK) and backfilled using a Hamilton syringe. Ratiometric Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Fura dextran pentapotassium salt (Fura, Mr 10,000; Molecular Probes, Oregon) was used to avoid internalization of the dye into intracellular compartments. The dye was introduced into the egg by microinjection (final concentration ≈ 10 μm). Two interference band pass filters (350 and 380 nm, bandwidth of 10.3 and 11.3 nm, respectively; Ealing Optics, Watford, UK) were used to illuminate the eggs with light emitted from a 75-watt Xenon short arc lamp (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK). Controlling the 350- and 380-nm filters was a filter wheel (Cairn Research) set to sample every 4 s by acquisition software (UMANS) provided by Dr. C. Regan of Bio-Rad. Fluorescence emission was collected from a 400-nm dichroic mirror and filtered through a 510-nm long pass filter and detected on a PMT (Thorn EMI, Middlesex, UK). The [Ca2+]i concentration was determined using ratiometric analysis (44Swann K. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Confocal images were acquired using the Leica TCS4D system, as described previously (27Wilding M. Wright E.M. Patel R. Ellis-Davies G. Whitaker M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mix of calcium green and tetramethyl rhodamine dextrans (Mr 10,000; Molecular Probes) were microinjected to a final concentration of 10 μm. Images were acquired every 15 s using a 16-scan line average. Topographical representations were generated using IDL software (Research Systems) on an Indigo2 work station (Silicon Graphics). All experiments were undertaken at 17 °C. In Vitro Protein Kinase Assays, Western Blotting, and Immunoprecipitations—Preparation of sea urchin cell lysates, MAP kinase and hH1 kinase assays, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation to determine kinase activity in embryos at various times after fertilization were carried out as described previously (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of active MAP kinase was carried out by using an anti-active MAPK antibody (Promega). The immune complexes were not boiled. Instead, they were left for 15 min at room temperature in sample buffer and then frozen or loaded on gel for electrophoresis and blotting. The blotted complexes were probed with another, monoclonal anti-dual phosphorylated MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs). Cdk1 activity was measured also after isolation of cdk1/cyclin B kinase from sea urchin extracts using p13suc1-Sepharose binding (45Edgecombe M. Patel R. Whitaker M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3769-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The isolated cdk1/cyclin B complexes were used in hH1 kinase assays. Manipulation of MAP Kinase and cdk1/Cyclin B Kinase Activities and Their Effect on NEB—It was initially thought that there was no increase in MAP kinase activity during mitosis (46Ferrell J.E. Wu M.

More recently, an ERK1-like MAP kinase activity has been detected during mitotic divisions in sea urchin embryos (17Chiri S. De Nadai C. Ciapa B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian cell lines (20Shapiro P.A. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whaken A.M. McIntosh J.R. Ahn N.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Google Scholar), and cycling Xenopus extracts (19Guadagno T.M. Ferrell J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 1312-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase activity peak correlates closely with the timing of NEB (mitosis entry) in sea urchin embryos (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We blocked MAP kinase activation by microinjecting a specific recombinant inhibitor (MAP kinase phosphatase: XCL100). We also used a small molecule-based approach (MEK inhibitor: U0126). The usefulness of such soluble, fastacting, small molecule inhibitors to examine dynamic cellular pathways has been demonstrated recently in dissecting the spatial and temporal control of cytokinesis (80Straight, A. F., Cheung, A., Limouze, J., Chen, I., Westwood, N. J, Sellers, J. R., and Mitchison, T. J. Science 299, 1743-1747Google Scholar). We have recently used XCL100 and U0126 to show that the rapid, transient increase in MAP kinase activity at fertilization controls the onset of DNA synthesis (50Philipova R. Kisielewska J. Lu P. Larman M. Huang J-Y. Whitaker M.J. Development. 2005; 132: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that inhibiting MAP kinase activation later in the cell cycle with either treatment prevented NEB. The MAP kinase activity identified in intact sea urchin embryos contains a peptide sequence with 92% identity to ERK1 (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used a recombinant MAP kinase-specific phosphatase, Xenopus MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (XCL100), to prevent MAP kinase activation. XCL100 inactivates MAP kinases by dephosphorylating the phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine regulatory sites and is highly specific for ERK1 and ERK2 (43Wang X.M. Zhai Y. Ferrel Jr., J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 51Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 52Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2885-2896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the first sharp peak that follows fertilization, the activity of ERK1 quickly subsides. At 10–15 min after fertilization, it reaches its lowest level. At about 20–25 min, it slowly increases again to reach its second maximum at NEB (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XCL100 protein was microinjected 12–20 min after fertilization to block this second, NEB-associated increase in MAP kinase activity, whereas sparing the first. A final intracellular concentration of 1.8 μm delayed NEB significantly; ≥2.8 μm caused a complete block over a 3-h observation period and was used in subsequent experiments (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1Blocking MAP kinase activity with XCL100 or U0126 prevents NEB. a, recombinant XCL100 (pipette concentration: 20–25 mg/ml) or control vehicle buffer (0.5× phosphate-buffered saline) were microinjected into sea urchin embryos 12–20 min after fertilization. Experiments were terminated after 180 min. Cell volume injections of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6% give final concentrations of ∼1.8, 2.3, and 2.8 μm, respectively. *, statisticallysignificant at 5%, Student's t test between control and XCL100-injected embryos. 5–15 embryos were injected for each treatment. b, blocking cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity with 20 μm roscovitine prevents NEB. Roscovitine was added to sea urchin embryos 35 min after fertilization (57Alessi F. Quarta S. Sario M. Riva F. Rossi L. Stivala L.A. Scovassi A.I. Meijer L. Prosperi E. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Embryos were scored for NEB using DIC optics. 100 embryos were counted for each time point. Note that 10 μm roscovitine substantially delays but does not block NEB. c, control and U0126-treated embryos. Varying concentrations of U0126 were added to sea urchin embryos 12 min after fertilization; a comparison of the effect of 100 μm U0126 and its inactive analogue (U0124) showed U0124 to have no effect on NEB. 100 embryos were counted for each point. Embryos were scored for NEB using DIC optics. d, images of control and treated embryos with DIC optics at 70 and 220 min after fertilization.

U0126 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for the MEK1 and MEK2 ATP binding sites (54Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Vandyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A.

The inhibitor was added at 12 min, again to spare the fertilization-associated MAP kinase increase (we found that addition at later times before mitosis did not produce consistent inhibition). Three different concentrations of U0126 were tested (Fig. 1c). 25 and 50 μm concentrations delayed NEB in all embryos by 20 and 30 min, respectively. A concentration of 100 μm blocked the cell cycle in 75–85% of the embryos and delayed NEB by 1 h in the rest of them (data from 16 experiments). Treatment with 100 μm U0124, the negative control for U0126, at 12 min did not inhibit NEB, and the embryos proceeded through the cell cycle normally. These data with U0126 confirmed the results obtained with the recombinant XCL100 protein and further demonstrated that MEK inhibition also prevents entry into mitosis. As with MAP kinase, there are two peaks of cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity following fertilization (18Philipova R. Whitaker M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first is very small and may represent G1 activation of other cdks. The second increase begins around 30–40 min post-fertilization and peaks during mitosis. The requirement for an increase in cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity in sea urchin embryos has already been shown using roscovitine, a specific cdk inhibitor (56Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J.

Roscovitine was added at 35 min post-fertilization to spare the minor post-fertilization increase but inhibit the second increase in cdk1/cyclin B kinase activity (it was effective when added up to 60 min after fertilization (56Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcors J-G. Moulinoux J.-P. Eur. J.

This is similar to a concentration previously reported to block NEB in the sea urchin species Shaerechinus granularis (56Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M.

Growth arrest of normal diploid cells by contact inhibition resulted in an induction of p27kip1 and reduction of CDK2 levels. Interestingly, we observed concomitantly in growth-arrested cells, there was a reduction of nuclear p12 and the appearance of a nuclear 25-kDa molecule (p25) recognized by anti-p12 polyclonal antibody. Biochemical analysis showed that bacterial His-tagged p12 could be converted into a dimeric p25 in a reducing agent-dependent manner, and mutating the only cysteine residue of p12 (Cys105 → Ala105) abolished the dimerization. Transient transfection of wild type p12 into U2OS cells showed a reducing agent-sensitive dimerization that was also abolished by the C105A mutation. Furthermore, reduction of p12 expression by a short interfering RNA resulted in a parallel reduction of p25. These data supports the possibility that p25 is a homodimeric form of p12 through the cysteine residue. More interestingly, transient transfection of p12 (C105A) into the normal diploid lung fibroblast CCD18LU cells resulted in a reduction of the growth-inhibitory effect of p12 and abolished the inhibitory effect of p12 on CDK2 kinase activity. In addition, we found that the C105A mutation did not alter nuclear localization of p12, but it prevented association with CDK2. Taken together, our data suggest that p12 forms a nuclear homodimers in contact inhibited normal diploid cells and dimerization of p12 is a necessary process for the growth inhibition effect by p12. p12CDK2-AP1 (p12) is a CDK2-associated protein that negatively regulates its kinase activity.

Cellular proliferation is governed by elaborate interplay between mitogens and inhibitors. Growth arrest signals, such as serum reduction, medium depletion, contact inhibition, and other growth inhibiting agents can elicit cellular signaling pathways that target common cell cycle-regulating molecules, but it also seems that they might follow their own distinct pathways (1Amsler K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cellular growth arrest in normal cells is followed by cell cycle exit or apoptosis, which are frequently disrupted in neoplastic cells; however, the mechanisms that control these processes are not completely understood (2Fornace Jr., A.J.

Mostly DNA binding molecules, such as several known important transcription factors, are shown to form either homo- or heterodimers upon activation (12Soucek L. Helmer-Citterich M. Sacco A. Jucker R. Cesareni G. Nasi S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2463-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is well established that cytoplasmic domains of certain receptors are dimerized upon activation by ligand binding and autophosphorylation (13Lundin L. Ronnstrand L. Cross M. Hellberg C. Lindahl U. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Zhu H.J. Iaria J. Orchard S. Walker F. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 2003; 21: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein molecules localized in the cytoplasm can form homodimers by self-association or heterodimers by binding to other molecules and for transport into the nucleus (15Dimberg A. Nilsson K. Oberg F. Blood. 2000; 96: 2870-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In acute myelogenous leukemia cells, STAT1 and -3 factors form stable heterodimers during constitutive STAT3 activation by hematopoietic growth factors, which induce proliferation and differentiation (16Spiekermann K.

All-trans-retinoic acid induction leads to activation of STAT1 by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701, dimerization, and subsequent nuclear translocation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and differentiation of human monoblastic U-937 cells (15Dimberg A. Nilsson K. Oberg F. Blood. 2000; 96: 2870-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a 25-kDa molecule that is recognized by anti-p12 polyclonal antibody in contact inhibited diploid cells. By using biochemical and molecular biological approaches, we have shown that p25 is a homodimer of p12, and its level is increased in the nucleus of contact-inhibited cells. Also, we have observed that there is an inverse correlation between the levels of p25 and active CDK2. We further have shown that the dimerization is mediated by the Cys105 residue of p12. More interestingly, eliminating the ability to form dimer by mutating Cys105 residue resulted in a suppression of the growth-inhibitory effect exerted by p12 along with a sustained CDK2 kinase activity. These findings suggest that p12 dimerizes in the nucleus of diploid cells upon growth arrest induced by contact inhibition and that dimerization may be a cellular process to form an active growth-inhibitory p12 targeting CDK2. Cell Culture—Normal diploid cell lines were cultured for p12 study. HaCaT (spontaneously immortalized human normal skin keratinocytes), CCD18Lu (human lung fibroblasts), Mv1Lu (mink lung epithelial cells), and C3HA (mouse liver fibroblast cells) were cultured. The cells were harvested at log phase as well as contact-inhibited conditions. At log phase, the cells were 50% confluent, whereas at contact-inhibited conditions, the cells were cultured for another 48–96 h after they were 100% confluent. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml lactacystin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Proteins (30 μg) from whole cell lysates were loaded onto 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The anti-p12 polyclonal antibody 86, anti-CDK2 antibody (C18520 Clone 55 from Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-p27 (C-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-actin (A-2066) from Sigma, and anti-Oct-1 (C-21) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used for immunodetection. The blots were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Elution—Total cell lysate from CCD18Lu was fractionated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate, and one set of fractions was stained with Coomassie Blue staining (GELCODE® Blue Stain Reagent; Pierce), and the other was subjected to Western analysis. The relative location of p12 and p25 bands was measured from Western blot by using Quantity One imaging software (Bio-Rad), and the bands corresponding to the estimated locations were excised from the blue-stained gel. After the gel slices were cut out, the elution was performed using an Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of p12 Cysteine Mutants—To generate the bacterial fusion protein, an N-terminal His-tagged p12 DNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification using a specific primer set containing NdeI or EcoRI. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and subsequently subcloned into pET-17b vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Cysteine mutant of His-tagged p12 was generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the mammalian fusion construct, the p12 coding region was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). FLAG-tagged p12 was used as a template to generate a cysteine mutant by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). A specific primer set (primer 1, 5′-CTGGTTCGGGAGGCCTTGGCAGAAACG-3′; primer 2, 5′-CGTTTCTGCCAAGGCCTCCCGAACCAG-3′) was used to replace cysteine with alanine. The final clones were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Expression and Purification of Prokaryotic p12 Fusion Protein—pET-His-p12 was transformed into BL21 competent cells (Novagen), and recombinant clones were analyzed for the induction of His-tagged protein after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment. For purification of His-tagged p12 WT or C105A protein, clones were grown in 500 ml of LBAmp medium and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A650 was about 0.3. After a 3-h induction, the cells were pelleted, and total protein was exacted by using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a nickel column equilibrated with RIPA buffer. After washing with 2 column volumes of RIPA buffer, the bound protein was eluted with a step gradient of immidazole and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Finally, the eluted protein was dialyzed against RIPA buffer overnight at 4 °C. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation—CCD18Lu cellular homogenate was produced by Dounce homogenization in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to separate the nuclei and the F1 fraction. The nuclei were washed with homogenization buffer and resuspended in RIPA buffer to obtain the nuclear fraction (N). The F1 fraction from 800 × g centrifugation was further separated by differential centrifugation steps. After spinning at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in RIPA to obtain Fraction 2 (F2). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer to obtain Fraction 3 (F3). The final supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction (Cy). Transient Transfection and Proliferation Analysis—CCD18Lu cells were seeded on a 60-mm dish and transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV2, pFLAG-p12 WT, or pFLAG-p12 C105A plasmid by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After a 24-h transfection, cells were collected, and 5,000 cells were seeded per well on a 96-well plate. The next day, the proliferation of the cells was measured by using the CCK-8 assay reagent (Alexis Biochemical Corp., San Diego, CA) for 4 days following the manufacturer's instructions. CCK-8 assay reagent of 10% of the cell culture medium was added to each well and mixed gently. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, 1% SDS of a one-tenth volume of the culture medium was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. All of the assays were done in 16 replicates, and the growth rate was presented as -fold increase over the day 1 value. CDK2 Kinase Activity Assay—Total cell lysate was prepared with 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An in vitro CDK2 kinase assay was done as described previously (20Kim Y. McBride J. Zhang R. Zhou X. Wong D.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of total cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of anti-CDK2 antibody (Clone 55; BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. After incubating with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with 1× cell lysis buffer and then twice with 1× kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2). The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 2× kinase buffer, and a kinase activity assay was done by adding 1 μg of Rb-C substrate (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm ATP. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and dried before autoradiography. Increased Expression of p25 Related to p12 in Contact-inhibited Diploid Cells—p12 is ubiquitously expressed in most of the human tissues, and a polyclonal antibody raised against a GST fusion of p12 recognizes a 12-kDa molecule (6Tsuji T. Duh F.M. Latif F. Popescu N.C. Zimonjic D.B. McBride J. Matsuo K. Ohyama H. Todd R. Nagata E. Terakado N. Sasaki A. Matsumura T. Lerman M.I. Wong D.T. J. Biol.

Int. J. Oral Biol. 2001; : 87-91Google Scholar). Its cellular expression has been further confirmed by immunoprecipitation, partial chromatographic purifications, and peptide sequencing analysis on proteins from mouse and human cell lysates (19Kim Y. Tsuji T. Elovic A. Shintani S. Mihara M. Salih E. Kohno Y. Chin B.R. Patel V. Wong D.T.W. Todd R. Int. J. Oral Biol. 2001; : 87-91Google Scholar). The most definitive evidence that the detected 12-kDa molecule is the protein product of p12 was that, when both alleles of p12 were disrupted in murine embryonic stem cells, the anti-p12 antibody (polyclonal antibody 86) no longer detected the 12-kDa protein (20Kim Y. McBride J. Zhang R. Zhou X. Wong D.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although previous studies suggest that p12 may function as a growth suppressor by inhibiting CDK2 and that it also can interact with the DNA polymerase-α-primase complex, its cellular significance has not yet been elucidated (9Matsuo K. Shintani S. Tsuji T. Nagata E. Lerman M. McBride J. Nakahara Y. Ohyama H. Todd R. Wong D.T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine the role of p12 during growth arrest induction in cells, we used several normal diploid cells (rodent C3HA and Mv1Lu; human HaCaT and CCD18Lu) that exhibit growth arrest induced by cell-cell contact inhibition. After the cells reached full confluence, the levels of p12 and CDK2 were monitored at different time points (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) along with the level of the known growth arrest marker p27kip1 (21Fuse T. Tanikawa M. Nakanishi M. Ikeda K. Tada T. Inagaki H. Asai K. Kato T. Yamada K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated three times independently to avoid any experimental biases. As expected, as the cells went into the growth arrest phase, the level of p27kip1 increased substantially (Fig. 1A). Based on our previous data, which show that ectopic overexpression of p12 resulted in inhibition of CDK2 and growth suppression, we expected to see increased levels of p12 in growth-arrested cells (8Shintani S. Ohyama H. Zhang X. McBride J. Matsuo K. Tsuji T. Hu M.G. Hu G. Kohno Y. Lerman M. Todd R. Wong D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6300-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1A, contact-inhibited normal diploid cells showed a reduced level of p12 compared with the log phase cells. In addition to the expected 12-kDa molecule, the polyclonal anti-p12 antibody also recognized a higher molecular weight species with an estimated size of 25 kDa. Interestingly, we observed an increased level of p25 in contact-inhibited cells compared with the log phase cells as the cells went into the growth-arrested state. It was further noted that the cellular level of p25 was inversely correlated with the level of p12 in contact-inhibited cells (Fig. 1B). The level of p25 consistently paralleled the level of p27kip1, whereas the level of CDK2 was reduced as the cells went into the growth-arrested stage. Therefore, the cellular level of CDK2 parallels that of p12 and is inversely correlated with p25. The Formation of Dimerized p25 Is Increased in the Nucleus upon Contact-inhibited Growth Arrest—It has been reported that dimerization of certain proteins can be related to either molecular binding to form an active complex or be involved in subcellular trafficking of a molecule to a different cellular compartment (15Dimberg A. Nilsson K. Oberg F. Blood. 2000; 96: 2870-2878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a way of understanding the physiological significance of dimerization of p12 in the cell, we first tested whether two different forms of molecules are localized in the same or different cellular compartments. We fractionated CCD18Lu cellular proteins by the differential centrifugation method. After fractionation, an equal amount of protein was analyzed by Western blotting analysis with anti-p12 polyclonal antibody that recognizes both 12- and 25-kDa forms. The efficiency of fractionation was confirmed by Western analysis of the fractions with antibody against nuclear Oct-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, p12 was predominantly localized in the nucleus of the log phase cells, whereas p25 was exclusively present in the microsomal compartment (F2 fraction). Nuclear localization of p12 assessed by anti-p12 polyclonal antibody was consistent with the previously reported immunohistochemical data in human oral tissues, showing a predominant nuclear staining (5Shintani S. Mihara M. Terakado N. Nakahara Y. Matsumura T. Kohno Y. Ohyama H. McBride J. Kent R. Todd R. Tsuji T. Wong D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2776-2782PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the cells were forced into a contact-inhibited growth arrest state, there was a significant increase of p25 and concomitant decrease of p12 only in the nucleus. Interestingly, there was no change at the level of microsomal p25. This finding suggests that the appearance of p25 in the nucleus of contact-inhibited cells is from the dimerization of nuclear p12 but not from the nuclear import of the microsomal pool of p25. p25 Is a Homodimeric Form of p12 through the Cysteine Residue—In order to assure that p25 is related to p12 and that it is a homodimer of p12, we performed biochemical characterization of p25. First, we performed an immunodepletion analysis by blocking the polyclonal antibody with either purified GST or GST-p12 recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 3A, the detection of both 12- and 25-kDa bands was completely abolished by preincubating the antibody with GST-p12 but not with GST alone. Analysis of the deduced p12 protein sequence indicates that there is only one cysteine residue at position 105 that may mediate the dimerization of p12 into p25. If the dimerization is solely through this cysteine residue, the dimer formation should be at least partly reversible by reducing agent. In order to see if p25 formation was sensitive to reducing reagent treatments, we isolated endogenous cellular p12 and p25 by gel elution as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 3B, the gel-eluted p12 could also form a dimer in solution when analyzed by Western blotting, and the association was decreased by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (about 50%), which suggests that dimerization is sensitive to reducing conditions. In parallel, the gel-eluted p25 in solution dissociated into the monomeric p12, and the extent of dissociation was significantly higher in the presence of reducing agent. The possible reason for incomplete association or dissociation could be that the endogenous p12 or p25 might have been irreversibly denatured during the gel elution process and did not maintain the proper physicochemical property to permit reversible intermolecular conversion. It is also possible that an additional irreversible cellular modification process exists in the formation of p25. Nonetheless, these results confirm that p12 produced in mammalian cells can form a dimer in a reducing agent-sensitive manner, firmly implicating the involvement of the cysteine residue in the dimerization process. To further validate whether p25 is a dimeric form of p12, we generated a bacterial recombinant His-tagged p12 and examined whether the purified protein could form a dimer. As shown in Fig. 3C, the purified His-tagged p12 formed a dimer recognized by Western analysis with anti-p12 antibody (lane 1). The dimerization was also sensitive to β-mercaptoethanol treatment (lane 2), which suggests that the dimerization involves the cysteine residue of the p12. We explored whether the dimerization was actually through the cysteine residue at 105 present in p12 protein by site-directed mutagenesis. We replaced the cysteine residue of His-tagged p12 WT with an alanine to produce the C105A mutant and purified it through a nickel column. Compared with the p12 WT, the mutated p12 C105A did not form any dimer as shown in Fig. 3C either in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol (lanes 3 and 4). This finding convincingly indicates that intermolecular association through the cysteine residue mediates the homodimerization of p12. Dimerization of p12 mediated by cysteine 105 was further confirmed in mammalian cells. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with either FLAG-p12 WT or mutated FLAG-p12 C105A (Fig. 4). To visualize specifically the FLAG-tagged recombinant molecule, the blot was probed with anti-FLAG antibody, and the result clearly showed dimer formation only in FLAG-p12 WT (lane 2) and not in the C105A mutant (lane 3). Interestingly, there was a doublet of the dimer, suggesting posttranslational modification. It should be noted that we also observed the formation of a doublet with the monomer (data not shown). Furthermore, in the presence of the reducing agents (β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol), the dimer formation was distinctively reduced (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8).Fig. 4Dimerization of p12 in U2OS cells. Dimer formation of p12CDK-AP1 was confirmed in mammalian cells. U2OS cells transfected with FLAG-tagged p12CDK2-AP1 wild type (lane 2) showed a formation of dimer recognized by anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Treatment of cell lysate with either β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) or dithiothreitol (DTT) abolished dimerization. Transfection with either pFLAG-CMV2 null vector (lane 1) or C105A mutant construct (lane 3) did not show dimer formation. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to the validation of dimer formation in mammalian cells by transient transfection, we further examined the consequence of down-regulating endogenous p12 in the formation of p25. We generated stable gene silencing clones of p12 from human normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6tert1) by using short interfering RNA (siRNA) (20Kim Y. McBride J. Zhang R. Zhou X. Wong D.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, stable p12 siRNA clones showed a reduced level of p12 protein expression (up to 80%) as compared with control. In parallel, there was a reduced level of p25 in proportion to the level of p12 reduction as determined by densitometric analysis (Fig. 5B). This result further supports that the p25 is a dimeric form of p12. We also performed peptide-sequencing analysis of purified cellular p12 and p25 by using an anion exchange column, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrum analyses (data not shown). The results showed that both the p12 fraction and the p25 fractions contained the actual peptide sequences deduced from the p12 gene. This series of biochemical and molecular characterizations of p12 and p25 confirmed that p25 is a dimeric form of p12 and that this dimer can form through the cysteine under physiological conditions. Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation by Wild Type p12 but Not by the C105A Mutant—Our previous work has shown that transfection of wild type FLAG-p12 resulted in an inhibition of cellular proliferation (8Shintani S. Ohyama H. Zhang X. McBride J. Matsuo K. Tsuji T. Hu M.G. Hu G. Kohno Y. Lerman M. Todd R. Wong D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6300-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To evaluate a functional consequence of the dimerization of p12, the effect of the mutation of the cysteine residue on cellular proliferation was examined. Human normal diploid lung fibroblast CCD18LU cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or the C105A mutant construct of FLAG-p12, and cellular proliferation was measured (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, substitution of alanine for the cysteine residue that we have shown to be involved in dimerization of p12 in this report resulted in a significant reduction of the growth-inhibitory effect (p < 0.001). In fact, cellular proliferation of transfectant with FLAG-p12 C105A mutant was not significantly distinguishable from a null vector control transfectant. It has been previously demonstrated that the growth-inhibitory function of p12 is accounted for through modulation of CDK2 activity. In order to examine whether the dimerization of p12 has any effect on CDK2 activity, we have measured CDK2 kinase activity after transiently transfecting either WT or the C105A mutant form of FLAG-p12 into CCD18Lu cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, ectopic overexpression of WT p12 resulted in a reduction of CDK2 kinase activity against Rb-C substrate. In contrast, the C105A mutant showed a sustained CDK2 kinase activity. Although we observed relatively moderate inhibition of CDK2 activity, probably due to low transfection efficiency (about 30% as monitored by control green fluorescent protein expression), the result showed significant differences between WT and the C105A mutant (p = 0.01705 between vector and WT; p = 0.001451 between WT and C105A). These results suggest that dimerization of p12 may be a prerequisite event for p12 to play a role as a growth suppressor through modulation of CDK2 activity. It also suggests that nuclear dimerization of p12 in growth-inhibited diploid cells by contact inhibition may mediate this important cellular process. C105A Mutation Inhibits Its Binding to CDK2—To address how the prevention of dimerization by C105A mutation resulted in a reduced inhibition of CDK2 activity by p12, the cellular localization of p12 C105A and its association with CDK2 were examined. CCD18Lu cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged p12 constructs (WT, C105A, or A3 CDK2 binding mutant) and fractionated by using a NucBuster protein extraction kit (EMD Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA). It has been previously reported that A3 (mutation of TER residues 109–111 to AAA) prevented p12 from binding to CDK2 (8Shintani S. Ohyama H. Zhang X. McBride J. Matsuo K. Tsuji T. Hu M.G. Hu G. Kohno Y. Lerman M. Todd R. Wong D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6300-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, the C105A mutation did not affect the cellular localization of p12, and both expressed p12 mutants (C105A and A3) and WT were exclusively localized in the nuclear fraction. The integrity of cellular fractionation was confirmed by using an antibody against Oct-1 nuclear protein, and loading of protein was visualized by probing with anti-actin antibody. We then examined whether C105A mutation could affect the physical association with CDK2 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 7B, p12 WT formed a dimer, and there was a reduction of dimer formation from the p12 A3 mutant, whereas p12 C105A did not form a dimer. We were able to pull down CDK2 with p12 WT and a greatly reduced level of CDK2 with p12 A3 mutant. Interestingly, p12 C105A failed to associate with CDK2. This result suggests that an ability of p12 to form a dimer is correlated to its ability to associate with CDK2. The expression of p12CDK2-AP1 (p12), previously known as the DOC-1 gene has been shown to be down-regulated in oral cancers and microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers (5Shintani S. Mihara M. Terakado N. Nakahara Y. Matsumura T. Kohno Y. Ohyama H. McBride J. Kent R. Todd R. Tsuji T. Wong D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2776-2782PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yuan Z. Sotsky Kent T. Weber T.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6304-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that p12 can exert its cellular effect in cell cycle regulation through interaction with important cell cycle-regulatory molecules such as CDK2 and/or possible other unidentified molecules. Also, it has been found that the other related member of p12 exists in the genome and is expressed as a possible functional molecule. There has been significant evidence correlation between decreased or abolished p12 expression and oral cancer development (5Shintani S. Mihara M. Terakado N. Nakahara Y. Matsumura T. Kohno Y. Ohyama H. McBride J. Kent R. Todd R. Tsuji T. Wong D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2776-2782PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been directly shown that the deletion or reduction of p12 expression causes cellular transformation and in turn tumorigenesis in vivo. Most scientifically proven data on the possible function of p12 is the interaction with an important cell cycle-regulatory molecule, CDK2, and down-regulation of its activity (5Shintani S. Mihara M. Terakado N. Nakahara Y. Matsumura T. Kohno Y. Ohyama H. McBride J. Kent R. Todd R. Tsuji T. Wong D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2776-2782PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shintani S. Ohyama H. Zhang X.

We have previously demonstrated that p12 can interact with CDK2 and DNA polymerase-α-primase; however, the mechanisms of these interactions have not been fully elucidated. Also, the physiological consequences of the interactions have not been completely understood. Based on the growth-inhibitory effect of p12, we hypothesized that p12 is present as an active molecule when the cells are in growth arrest or at the onset of the growth arrest phase. In order to see the fate of p12 protein product in the growth arrest stage, we investigated the regulation of p12 in contact-inhibited growth-arrested cells. It is well known that normal diploid cells can be growth-arrested through contact inhibition, and several important cell cycle regulators are known to be involved in this process (2Fornace Jr., A.J.

Suppl. 2002; 61 (Suppl. 1): 99-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of growth arrest induced by contact inhibition has not been established. It may share some common cellular mechanism governing growth arrest induced by other causes, such as serum starvation, medium depletion, or treatment with transforming growth factor-β, but it may also follow its own distinctive cellular pathway (28Wu F. Buckley S. Bui K.C. Yee A. Wu H.Y. Liu J. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L879-L888PubMed Google Scholar, 29Taipale M. Tiihonen E. Heiskanen A. Laiho M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that p12 was a negative S phase regulator, and its expression peaked at the S phase. Deletion of p12 in murine embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination resulted in an increased cellular proliferation and a shift in cell cycle profile (20Kim Y. McBride J. Zhang R. Zhou X.

In this report, we have shown that p12 could form a dimer in contact-inhibited diploid cells, and the dimerization is through an intermolecular association via the cysteine residue. Furthermore, we have shown that the dimerization of p12 is a functionally significant event, since an abolishment of dimerization by mutating a cysteine residue abolished its growth-inhibitory effect in CCD18Lu cells. We have further shown that abolishing dimer formation by C105A mutation abrogated its CDK2 inhibitory function. These data suggest that dimerization of p12 is functionally significant in the modulation of CDK2 activity and cell growth inhibition. In addition, we have shown that C105A mutation did not alter nuclear localization of p12, but it prevented p12 from forming a complex with CDK2. However, it is still not clear whether the dimer is directly associated with CDK2. Considering that the A3 mutant that has an intact Cys105 showed a reduced dimerization, it is speculated that p12 forms a dimer through Cys105, but it is significantly affected by a neighboring molecular structure. We have observed that in asynchronous cell culture, the dimer is exclusively in the cytoplasm. It is still not clear how this cytoplasmic dimer is formed from its monomer or whether it has a different function compared with the nuclear dimer. Also, it needs to be addressed how the dimerization affects the association p12 with CDK2 and how mechanistically the nuclear dimer functions in the modulation of CDK2 activity. Based on our previous data showing an in vitro association of monomeric p12 and the inactive cytoplasmic form of CDK2, it was speculated that p12 might play a role in sequestering a pool of CDK2 and might also be involved in cellular trafficking of CDK2 in and out of the nucleus (8Shintani S. Ohyama H. Zhang X. McBride J. Matsuo K. Tsuji T. Hu M.G. Hu G. Kohno Y. Lerman M. Todd R. Wong D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6300-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it needs to be further validated, it is possible that dimerization of p12 might be a way of sequestering an active pool of CDK2 and involved in the cellular trafficking process. It will be intriguing to examine a cellular localization of p12 WT or C105A by immunocytochemistry and also its co-localization with CDK2 by confocal microscopy to determine whether a mutation of cysteine has any effect on this process. These future studies on the process of p12 in the formation of dimer will reveal the cellular and molecular mechanism of p12 in the regulation of CDK2 and its subsequent effect on cell cycle regulation."

In this report, we have used a recently developed directed evolution method called “codon shuffling” for the synthesis and selection of bioactive proteins. The selection of such proteins was based on the creation of an inducible library of “codon-shuffled” genes that are constructed from the ligation-based assembly of judiciously designed hexamer DNA duplexes called dicodons. Upon induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, some library members were found to express dicodon-incorporated proteins. Because of this, the host cells, in our case Escherichia coli, were unable to grow any further. The bactereostatic/lytic nature of the dicodon proteins was monitored by growth curves as well as by zone clearance studies. Transmission electron microscopy of the affected cells illustrated the extent of cell damage. The proteins themselves were overexpressed as fusion partners and subsequently purified to homogeneity. One such purified protein was found to strongly bind heparin, an indication that the interaction of the de novo proteins may be with the nucleic acids of the host cell, much like many of the naturally occurring antibacterial peptides, e.g. Buforin. Therefore, our approach may help in generating a multitude of finely tuned antibacterial proteins that can potentially be regarded as lead compounds once the method is extended to pathogenic hosts, such as Mycobacteria, for example.

The objective of recasting or constructing proteins from scratch to achieve altogether new entities that are then able to carry out a preordained catalytic or structural function is currently an area of intense scientific research. That small proteins or peptides can be constructed based on the first principles of secondary structure design has been known for some time, largely through some seminal contributions of DeGrado and co-workers (1Regan L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1988; 241: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and others (2Cordes M.H. Walsh N.P. McKnight C.J. Sauer R.T. Science. 1999; 284: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Hecht M.H. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Ogden R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This so-called de novo protein design is the rational approach toward the creation of functional proteins, and it is perhaps only now, with the realization of the hitherto unreachable requirements of computational power, that one is witness to an increasing number of functional peptides and proteins being successfully generated de novo (4Schneider G. Schrodl W. Wallukat G. Muller J. Nissen E. Ronspeck W. Wrede P. Kunze R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12179-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Dahiyat B.I. Mayo S.L. Science. 1997; 278: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). On the other hand, non-rational and part-rational approaches toward creating de novo proteins designed for specific purposes seem to be much more powerful methods at generating functional proteins, especially for in vivo biological requirements (6Taylor S.V. Walter K.U. Kast P. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10596-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Roberts R.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Methods like the “phage display” (8Rodi D.J. Makowski L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 87-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and “mRNA display” (9Keefe A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 2001; 410: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) increasingly allow one to effectively generate and then subsequently pan non-rational peptide and protein libraries in order to select for the right protein. In situations where an effective assay-based selection system is available, part-rational and non-rational approaches may be more effective than a rational approach in the isolation of a functional protein, largely because the part-rational and non-rational approaches mimic evolutionary pathways of selection (of the fittest). In this context, two such studies are worthy of special attention. A little more than a decade ago, Hecht and co-workers (10Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) put forth a most novel hypothesis, that of binary patterning of proteins. According to this simple concept, it is the binary patterning of polar (○) and non-polar (●) amino acids in the designed protein and not the exact identity of those amino acids that eventually dictates the secondary structure of the designed protein. The binary-patterning concept may be viewed as a part-rational approach, whereby one can predetermine the library folds but not the exact folds of its individual members. Indeed, de novo protein libraries based on binary patterning have furnished many functional as well as structural proteins (11Moffet D.A. Hecht M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3191-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Rojas N.R. Kamtekar S. Simons C.T. McLean J.E. Vogel K.M. Spiro T.G. Farid R.S. Hecht M.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2512-2524PubMed Google Scholar), although problems of a suitable assay system, as well as the limitation of a fixed length of library members, have yet to be addressed satisfactorily. The second seminal study by Mekalanos and co-workers (13Blum J.H. Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) involves the generation of nonrational peptide libraries based on degenerate oligonucleotide design. Their work elegantly demonstrated that an inducible non-rational DNA library, once translated in vivo, could lead to the selection of a functional peptide. This so-called ABBIS approach was successfully used for isolation of a number of peptides that, upon overexpression in the host cell, led to severe growth attenuation of the host. The ABBIS method too has its limitations that are primarily because of its use of fixed-length degenerate oligonucleotides as a starting point for making a peptide library. Nonetheless, it remains a powerful example of a non-rational approach toward the de novo synthesis of useful proteins, in their case antimicrobial peptides (AMP). 1The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; trx, thioredoxin; DC, dicodon; HPDN, hairpin-encapsulated DC fragment; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; ds, double-stranded. Of late, there is an urgent need for generating newer more potent AMPs, given their newfound importance in the context of widespread antibiotic resistance among human pathogens (14Boman H.G. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 254: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 15Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar, 16Lehrer R.I. Devine D.A. Hancock R.E.W. Advances in Molecular and Cellular Microbiology: Mammalian Host Defense Peptides. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2004: 5-8Google Scholar). AMPs have been isolated from a variety of species, including around 40 odd AMPs from humans (15Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar, 17Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar). Thus far, around 700 AMPs have been isolated and characterized (18Wang Z. Wang G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 590-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and many among them are in advanced clinical trials as drug candidates against bacterial and fungal infections (15Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar, 19Hancock R.E. Lehrer R.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). A general characteristic of AMPs is their net positive charge that is believed to be crucial for gaining entry into negatively charged bacterial outer membranes, although lately, some anionic AMPs have also been isolated (20Lai R. Liu H. Hui Lee W. Zhang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Brogden K.A. Ackermann M. Huttner K.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5948-5954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, many models for bacterial entry have been postulated (17Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar, 22Powers J.P. Hancock R.E. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). However, recent DNA-microarray studies on bacteria affected by AMPs have suggested that cell wall lysis may not be the sole mode of AMP action, given that the expression of a host of cytoplasmic genes is severely affected upon AMP cell entry (23Tomasinsig L. Scocchi M. Mettulio R. Zanetti M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3260-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Hong R.W. Shchepetov M. Weiser J.N. Axelsen P.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding their action, it is clear that AMPs represent a class of molecules that may in the near future provide an effective alternative to the currently used antibiotics (14Boman H.G. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 254: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that an approach that leads to the synthesis of a diverse pool of AMPs and one that addresses the earlier problems associated with AMP synthesis would be of considerable help. In this report, we describe one such approach that is based on the application of a directed-evolution technique that we recently developed called codon shuffling (25Chopra S. Ranganathan A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We also describe how, through codon shuffling, libraries are generated that: (a) can be both non-rational as well as part-rational; (b) have members large enough to be classified as proteins and not just peptides; (c) are not restricted by limits of length of their corresponding genes; and (d) can be preferentially skewed in amino acid attributes like charge and hydrophobicity, thereby narrowing down the search for a successful AMP. Construction of Expression Plasmid pDNp28 —An unrelated DNA fragment of 875 bp in length from the plasmid pET21c was PCR-amplified using pfu polymerase and the oligonucleotides 5′-aaccatgggttacgtacatttccgtgtcgccctt-3′ and 5′-aactcgagtacgtaccaatgcttaatcagtgaggc-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was cloned in pBluescriptSRF vector, and the fragment was excised using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned in pET28a vector previously cut with the same two enzymes. The resulting plasmid was isolated and digested with SnaBI to finally yield the expression plasmid pDNp28. Plasmid pDNp28 carries the SnaBI site into which dicodon (DC) fragment libraries can be inserted. The site is immediately downstream of the ATG start codon and just upstream of the His6 tag. Construction of ds Hairpin-encapsulated DC Fragment (HPDN) Library—For the initial part of library construction, the protocol followed was as described earlier (25Chopra S. Ranganathan A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with one variation. Immediately after the mixing of 14 DCs, the solution was made to 7.5% polyethylene glycol and the DC mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. To this mixture was added 100 pmols of 5′-phosphorylated and PAGE-purified ds hairpin (5′-tttaaacacgtggcggccgctctagaggcccgcgcgggcctctagagcggccgccacgtgtttaaa-3′) that had been self-annealed earlier. The ligation temperature was increased to 16 °C, and the incubation prolonged for another 12 h. The ligation mixture DNA was precipitated and extracted once with phenol/chloroform. The resuspended DNA was digested with XbaI for 4 h at 37°C, after which 1 μl of the digested DNA was used as a template for PCR using the 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide 5′-agcggccgccacgtgtttaaa-3′ that served both as a forward and reverse primer. The PCR products were eluted using DEAE membrane and fractionated based on their lengths (50–400 bp). The purified fragments were used directly as inserts for creation of de novo libraries. Construction of Expression Plasmid pTEMDNp28 —A 420-bp long DNA fragment from the TEM-1 gene of plasmid pSC1 (25Chopra S. Ranganathan A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using pfu polymerase and the oligonucleotides 5′-aagcatgcaaggagatggcgcccaacagtccc-3′ and 5′-cctacgtatgcacccaactgatcttcagcatc-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR product was cloned in pBluescriptSRF vector, and the fragment was excised using NcoI and SnaBI restriction enzymes and cloned in pDNp28 vector previously cut with the same two enzymes. The resulting plasmid was designated pTEMDNp28. Plasmid pTEMDNp28 carries the SnaBI site into which DC fragment libraries can be inserted. The site is immediately downstream of the TEM-1 secretion signal sequence and just upstream of the His6 tag. Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell lysates of EQAMP1–3 cultures were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto supported nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone and then probed with anti-His monoclonal antibody (1:7500 dilution). The blot was developed by using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega). Heparin Binding Studies—Procedures relating to the construction of GST-SKAMP1 gene and subsequent purification of the corresponding protein are described under supplemental data. 20 μg of pure GST-SKAMP1 protein was loaded onto a column containing heparin-Sepharose. The column was washed extensively with buffer C. Elution buffer (buffer C with an NaCl gradient from 250 mm to 1 m) was then poured over the column, and fractions were collected. Western Blot—The eluted fractions, as well as the heparin resin, were probed with anti-GST antibodies (1:25000 dilution) for 1 h. Nitrocellulose membrane was then washed four times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (each wash of 5-min duration). Secondary probing was done with anti-rabbit IgG heavy and light chain AP-conjugated antibodies (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h. After washing the membrane with 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20, the blot was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. Exploring the Possibility of Using Codon Shuffling for Constructing de Novo Protein Libraries—The codon-shuffling method was initially conceptualized by us as a directed-evolution technique. However, because the method is based not on the selection of a progeny through inducement of random mutations in the parent gene as in gene shuffling (26Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) but rather on extending a truncated parent gene with new DNA fragments that are constructed de novo, codon shuffling can also be viewed as a method for creating stand-alone new DNA fragments. This is because codon shuffling fundamentally entails randomly assembling 6-bp DNA duplexes (called DCs) from a set containing 14 such dicodons (Table I), each of which are judiciously chosen to encode amino acid pairs, such that in an equimolar dicodon pool, all 20 natural amino acids are represented and in proportions that mirror their usage in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, there is no restriction on the lengths of the resulting DNA fragments. Consequently, the amount of degeneracy achievable from ligation of the dicodons in making DNA fragments of ~250–300 bp in length is astronomically high and much beyond what may be required to exhaust all of the possible protein folds. Therefore, at first glance, codon shuffling represents a useful method for generating de novo protein libraries.Table IListing of DC search-string occurrences within protein sequences in the PDB crystal structure databasea DCs that have high preferences within each fold element have their percentages depicted in bold. Open table in a new tab a DCs that have high preferences within each fold element have their percentages depicted in bold. Here, it is pertinent to mention one disadvantageous feature of peptide libraries made from degenerate oligonucleotides. In addition to the problems of length restriction (the upper limit being 100 nt on average, resulting in 30–40-amino acid-long peptides) as well as random appearances of stop codons, such peptide libraries yield few folded peptides, thereby severely limiting their usefulness (27Corey M.J. Corey E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11428-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Prijambada I.D. Yomo T. Tanaka F. Kawama T. Yamamoto K. Hasegawa A. Shima Y. Negoro S. Urabe I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One reason why few peptides from such libraries are able to fold properly may be the completely non-rational nature of their parent DNA fragments that may result in a peptide that contains a string of polar (○○○○○○...) or non-polar (●●●●●●...) residues, rather than an arrangement of such residues that promotes a secondary structure feature (○●○●○●○●○●○ or ○●○○●●○○●○○). Indeed, by predetermining the degeneracy of parent oligonucleotides, such that the resulting peptides may possess polar/non-polar arrangements, Hecht and coworkers (10Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 29Wei Y. Hecht M.H. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were able to generate a library of peptides wherein most members displayed a well-folded behavior. Consequently, the library size in such situations may not be necessarily large to begin with, much like in codon shuffling. One possible explanation in the codon-shuffling context may be that the 14 dicodons themselves possess a range of inherent secondary structure-forming attributes because of the manner in which they are paired, such as polar/non-polar, non-polar/polar, non-polar/turn, non-polar/non-polar, and other such combinations (Table I). For example, Glu-Leu or Asp-Ile repeats yield a binary pattern (○●○●○●○●○●○●) that represents β-sheet structure, whereas the string Met-His-Asp-Ile-Met-His-Glu-Leu-Ser-Thr yields a binary pattern (●○○●●○○●○○) that would preferentially form an α-helix. Additionally, the appearance of the dicodons Trp-Pro, Pro-Gly, or Gly-Ala may induce turns or breaks, whereas sputtering of Cys-Ala within the DC protein sequence may create intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bridges. To further investigate this hypothesis, we undertook a search of all of the proteins in the Protein Data Bank to find the location of dicodon pairs within protein structures. The search string was established as a dicodon-dicodon pair (DC-DC) amounting to a search of a total of 196 DC-DC motifs (14DC × 14DC). The DC preferences for particular secondary structure elements are listed in Table I. Predictably, the proline-containing DCs (Trp-Pro and Pro-Gly) were preferentially found in turn elements, whereas DCs that were formed of amino acid pairs of high α-helix forming propensity, such as Phe-Glu, for example, were found to be embedded in α-helices. Noteworthy, only 11% DC-DC pairs were found in unstructured and random coil elements. This may indicate that a de novo DC protein library would contain proteins that possess secondary structure elements and are therefore well folded as opposed to proteins from a degenerate oligonucleotide library. To test our hypothesis, we cloned codon-shuffled genes in specially designed vectors (see “Experimental Procedures”) using the equimolar DC-protocol described previously (25Chopra S. Ranganathan A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two representative clones were sequenced and shown to be wholly DC incorporates (Supplemental Fig. S1A). When overexpressed in E. coli, the clones yielded DC proteins that were preferentially found in the insoluble fractions. Nonetheless, because of reasonably good expression, the proteins could be routinely purified by metal-affinity chromatography in 8 m urea buffer. Postdialysis, one of the proteins could be solubilized in as little as 300 mm urea (Supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicated to us that de novo DC protein libraries were viable at generating reasonably large quantities of proteins of expected sizes and that subsequent application of a selection system could fish out desirable proteins. However, one caveat needed to be addressed before codon shuffling could be used efficiently for constructing de novo protein libraries. Because codon-shuffled DNA fragments were ligated directly to expression vectors for their eventual translation, the numbers of such fragments available for cloning were not all exhaustibly represented in the DC library since there was only one ds DNA fragment (i.e. insert fragment) of each type available. In other words, the impossibility of experimentally cloning each and every ds DNA fragment meant that the available complexity of the DC library was being compromised. Use of ds DNA Hairpins for Amplification of Codon-shuffled Fragments—To address the above-mentioned problem, we envisaged the use of ds DNA hairpin that would firstly cap the two exposed ends of the DC-assembled DNA fragment and then be used as a template for fragment amplification using oligonucleotides that are complementary to the hairpin sequence (30Bittker J.A. Le B.V. Liu D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1024-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ds hairpin, in addition to its primary role of amplifying DC fragments, could also be used as a scaffold for encapsulating DC proteins. Protein scaffolds have previously been employed to tighten randomly generated de novo peptides in hopes that the peptides may fold better as their N and C termini are no longer free (31Klevenz B. Butz K. Hoppe-Seyler F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1993-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Walker J.R. Altman R.K. Warren J.W. Altman E. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One such scaffold, the thioredoxin (trx) protein, has been employed on numerous occasions (13Blum J.H. Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Butz K. Denk C. Fitscher B. Crnkovic-Mertens I. Ullmann A. Schroder C.H. Hoppe-Seyler F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6579-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, whether the peptides are as effective once they are removed from their scaffolds or, more worringly, whether the de novo peptide activity is partly due to the scaffold itself are some of the issues that remain largely unaddressed. However, one could be prudent and reduce the deleterious effects of the scaffold, simply by keeping its size to a minimum. Using a large protein scaffold may stimulate the de novo protein to take a shape that without the scaffold would be altogether different. Therefore, in designing the ds hairpin, we focused on what was our initial goal: to isolate proteins that act as an antibacterial. A significant number of isolated AMPs are α-helical in nature, and many that are not become so once they interact with bacterial membranes (15Ganz T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar, 35Giangaspero A. Sandri L. Tossi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5589-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be helpful to construct AMPs over an α-helical scaffold. As a starting point, we envisaged that the ds hairpin should code for a string of 6–7 amino acid residues. After a preliminary study of exploring binary patterns for the scaffold, we settled on the pattern shown in Fig. 1. The binary pattern, ○●○○●●○, along with its “antisense” pattern, ●○○●●○●, are both predicted to form an α-helix based on the Hecht hypothesis (10Kamtekar S. Schiffer J.M. Xiong H. Babik J.M. Hecht M.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We then searched the Protein Data Bank to document the presence of these two patterns in the various fold elements. Interestingly, both patterns show a generous preference for α-helices, thereby confirming the practicability of using Hecht binary patterning for de novo peptide design (Fig. 1). As a next step, we embedded some unique restriction enzyme (RE) sites (none of which appears in any given DC fragment) within the ds hairpin sequence, such that they would not disturb the binary pattern of the translated hairpin (Fig. 1B). The final sequence of the designed hairpin (shown in Fig. 1) coded for the following two sequences, “SGRHVFK” and “FKHVAAA,” depending upon which hairpin strand was translated. Importantly, both these sequences conform to an α-helix-forming Hecht pattern. Construction of de Novo DC Protein Libraries with the Hairpin Scaffold—Our next objective was to experimentally investigate the merit of using ds hairpin for amplifying DC fragments as well as for ably providing a scaffold for the DC proteins. As a starting point, we added a molar excess of ds hairpin to a mixture of equimolar DC pool (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This was followed by amplification of encapsulated DC fragments with a 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide that was complimentary to the ds hairpin and therefore could act as both forward and reverse primers for the purposes of amplification. The PCR products were separated based on their length (50–400 bp) and ligated directly with SnaBI-cut expression vector pDNp28. Upon transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) followed by selection on kanamycin, we obtained colonies roughly to the order of 104. We selected and sequenced some representative clones and found all of them to indeed contain DC sequences that were flanked on either end by the ds hairpin. The corresponding DC protein library showed little sequence similarity among its members and was vastly variant in terms of length and primary sequence attributes (Fig. 2A). To test the protein expression levels of our DC library, we induced growing cultures of a representative clone HPDN5 with IPTG. We observed overexpression of HPDN5 protein and were subsequently able to purify the protein using Ni-NTA chromatography (Fig. 2B). These results firmly indicated to us that the generation of DC proteins from ds hairpin-encapsulated DC fragment library represents a viable route toward isolation of de novo proteins that are expressed from their corresponding genes at good levels and therefore can be easily purified. Finally, we wanted to explore a case where the DC protein is encapsulated by the traditional, often employed trx scaffold. Therefore, we ligated the hairpin-encapsulated DC fragment library with an expression vector (pTRXDNp21) that carried the modified trx gene wherein a unique SnaBI site had been positioned within the trx sequence that corresponded to the region between the two cystines (see supplemental data for details). The DNA of many of the obtained clones was sequenced and found to contain hairpin-encapsulated DC fragment sequences expectedly positioned within the SnaBI site (Supplemental Fig. S2A). One representative member of the trx-DC library was further analyzed to check for protein expression. Upon induction with IPTG, the protein trxHPDN3 was found to be generously overexpressed. However, most of the protein was found to be in the insoluble fractions, albeit the protein could be purified to homogeneity under de"

Mutational analysis of potential PKC sites unique to the α1 2.3 subunit revealed several sites in the II-III linker that are specific to MCh (Kamatchi, G., Franke, R., Lynch, C., III, and Sando, J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4102–4109). To identify sites responsive to PMA, Ser/Thr → Ala mutations were made in potential PKC sites homologous to the α1 2.3 and 2.2 subunits, both of which respond to PMA. Wild type α1 2.3 or mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes in combination with β1b and α2/δ subunits and muscarinic M1 receptors. Inward current (IBa) was recorded using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. Thr-365 of the I-II linker was identified as the primary site of PMA action, and this site also was required, along with the previously identified MCh-selective sites, for the MCh response. Ser-369 and Ser-1995 contributed to current enhancement only if Thr-365 also was available. Mutation of the essential sites to Asp increased the basal IBa and caused a corresponding decrease in the PMA or MCh responses, consistent with possible regulation of these sites by phosphorylation. These results suggest that PMA and MCh both activate a pathway that can regulate the common PMA-sensitive sites in the I-II linker but that MCh also activates an additional pathway required for regulation of the MCh-unique sites, especially in the II-III linker.

The family of voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels comprises a pore-forming α1 subunit and auxiliary β, α2/δ, and γ subunits. The α1 subunit determines the respective class of Cav channels because it has the binding sites for the agonists and antagonists; the auxiliary β, α2/δ, and γ subunits modify the expression of the channels and the kinetics of the current (2Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Three families of α1 subunit, each with several splice variants, have been identified. The α1 1.0 family encodes the L-type channels; α1 2.1 encodes P/Q-type channels; α1 2.2 encodes N-type channels; α1 2.3 encodes R-type channels; and α1 3.0 encodes T-type channels (3Ertel E.

The intracellular segments of the α1 subunit, viz. the N and C termini and the intracellular loops between domains I and II, II and III, and III and IV, possess the binding/recognition sites for second messengers such as G-protein βγ subunits or intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) as well as sites that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, classic PKC; nPKC, novel PKC; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; MCh, acetyl-β-methylcholine; DAG, diacylglycerol; WT, wild type.

The classic PKCs (cPKCs; α, βI, βII, and γ) require calcium and are stimulated by phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (DAG). Novel PKCs (nPKCs; δ, ε, η, and θ) are calcium-independent but still stimulated by phosphatidylserine and DAG. Members of the third category, atypical PKCs (ξ and λ/ι), are Ca2+- and DAG-independent. PKC activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced Cav 2.2 or 2.3 currents, whereas Cav 1.2c (from rat brain) or 2.1 currents were not affected (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P.

Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, acetyl-β-methylcholine (MCh), another activator of PKC, potentiated Cav 2.3 currents, decreased Cav 1.2c currents, and failed to modulate Cav 2.1 or 2.2 currents (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The differential responses of the Cav currents to the PKC activators may be attributed to the presence of PKC isozyme-selective phosphorylation sites in the α1 subunit of the Cav channels. In a recent study (9Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we suggested that cPKCs were responsible for the potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents by 1 μm MCh (EC50), the M1 receptor agonist. In contrast, nPKCs were implicated in PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents (9Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The above findings led us to hypothesize the existence of PMA-selective and MCh-selective potential PKC phosphorylation sites in the α1 2.3 subunits. The MCh-selective sites (Ser-888, Ser-892, Ser-894, and Ser-1987) are unique to the α1 2.3 subunits, whereas the PMA-selective sites (Thr-365, Ser-369, Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011) are homologous to α1 2.2 subunits. In our previous study, we showed that Ala mutation of the MCh-selective Ser sites inhibited MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents while leaving the PMA response intact (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As a follow-up, the specificity of PMA-selective sites to PMA was investigated in the current study. Putative PMA-selective potential PKC phosphorylation sites of α1 2.3 subunits were mutated to Ala, and the mutants were coexpressed with M1 receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Contrary to expectations, Ser/Thr → Ala mutation of the sites predicted to be PMA-selective inhibited both PMA- and MCh-induced enhancement of Cav 2.3 currents. The MCh response seems to require the sites necessary for the PMA response in addition to the previously identified MCh-specific sites. Construction of Mutants—Selected Ser/Thr were mutated to Ala by primer extension employing PCR with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild type rat brain α1 2.3 subunit subcloned in the pMT vector was used as the template. The PCR product was treated with DpnI, a restriction enzyme specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA, to digest the template DNA. The digested PCR product was transformed in Escherichia coli using the protocol from the supplier, and the DNA from the selected transformants was processed for sequencing. The whole coding region of the construct was sequenced (Biomolecular Research Facility, University of Virginia) to confirm the planned mutation and the absence of unwanted mutations contributed by the PCR reaction. Harvesting of Oocytes and cDNA Injection—Mature female Xenopus laevis frogs were obtained from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI), housed in an established frog colony, and fed regular frog brittle on alternate days. For the removal of oocytes, a frog was anesthetized in 500 ml of 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma) in water until unresponsive to a painful stimulus. The anesthetized frog was placed supine on ice, and an incision of ~1.5 cm in length was made through both the skin and muscle layers of one lower abdominal quadrant. A section of the ovary was exteriorized, and a lobule of oocytes (~500) was removed. The wound was closed in two layers, and the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia, kept in a separate tank overnight, and returned to the colony the following day. The oocytes were washed twice in a calcium-free OR2 solution (in mm: NaCl 82.5, KCl 2, MgCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, pH 7.5) and transferred to OR2 solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 1A; Sigma). The dish containing the oocytes in collagenase solution was agitated for a period of 2–3 h at room temperature to remove the follicular cell layer. Defolliculation was confirmed by microscopic examination. Then the oocytes were washed in OR2 solution and transferred to modified Barth's solution (in mm: NaCl 88, KCl 1, NaHCO3 2.4, CaCl2 0.41, MgSO4 0.82, HEPES 15, pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. The oocytes were allowed to recover by incubation at 16 °C for 3–10 h before cDNA injection. Nuclear (germinal vesicle) injection was performed (Drummond “Nanoject,” Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA) using a maximum of 4 ng of cDNA containing 3 ng of a 1:1:1 mix (molar ratio) of Cav α1 2.3, β1B, α2/δ cDNA subunits and 1 ng of rat M1 receptor cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The oocytes were returned to Barth's solution and incubated at 16 °C for 6–8 days before the recording of current. Current Recording—Macroscopic currents with Ba2+ (IBa) as the charge carrier were recorded employing a two-electrode voltage clamp technique using Oocyte Clamp OC-725C (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The amplifier was linked to an interface and an IBM PC-compatible computer equipped with pClamp software (version 8.2; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for data acquisition and analysis. Leak currents were subtracted using the P/4 procedure. Microelectrodes with an agarose cushion were filled with 3 m CsCl; typical resistances were 0.5–2.5 megohms. KCl-agar bridges were used as ground electrodes to minimize any junction potential attributable to changes in ionic composition of the bath solution. The oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (~500-μl volume) and superfused with the recording solution containing (in mm): Ba(OH)2 40, NaOH 50, KOH 2, HEPES 5, using methanesulfonate as the anion to adjust the pH to 7.4. Niflumic acid (0.4 mm) was included to block intrinsic chloride channels. Oocytes were held at –80 mV before being depolarized 0 mV, the test potential for a duration of 850 ms. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship of oocytes expressing the wild type Cav 2.3 channel or the mutant was determined wherever necessary. I-V was recorded for a duration of 450 ms using step depolarizations from –50 to 100 mV in 10-mV increments. Drug Treatment—All of the oocytes exhibiting IBa greater than 400 nA underwent control, treatment, and wash protocols. The control IBa was recorded at 8 min after the oocyte was impaled. Following the recording of the control IBa, either PMA or MCh was perfused for 60 s, and the current was recorded after another 60 s, thus exposing the oocyte to the agonist for a period of 2 min. Chemicals—PMA (Calbiochem) and MCh (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO (0.05%) and distilled water, respectively. The concentrated stock solutions of MCh and PMA were stored frozen at –20 °C. These agents were diluted to their final concentration in recording solution on the day of the experiment. To block endogenous Cl– currents, niflumic acid (Sigma) was added to the recording solution, which was stirred overnight in order for it to dissolve. Data Analysis—The data are shown as means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. The peak IBa represented the maximum amplitude of the inward current. The current inactivation rate was fit by a single exponential function using the equation, y=A×exp(−t/τ)+R(Eq. 1) where A is the coefficient of the exponential, t is time (ms), τ is the time constant (ms), and R is the fraction of residual current. Statistical significance was determined using the t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Selection of Potential PKC Phosphorylation Sites—The strategy employed for the selection of potential PKC phosphorylation sites from the α1 subunits of Cav channels was described in detail previously (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sites were chosen based on the existence of a linear and/or helical motif for PKC recognition and sequence differences between the various α1 subunits. These potential PKC phosphorylation sites were chosen from the intracellular regions (a total of 13 regions) only, as they could be expected to have access to PKC. A set of four unique MCh-selective sites (Ser-888, Ser-892, Ser-894, and Ser-1987) and five putative PMA-selective sites (Thr-365, Ser-369, Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011) was identified in the α1 2.3 subunit (Fig. 1). The PMA-selective sites in the α1 2.3 subunit are homologous to those in the α1 2.2 subunit. Ser/Thr → Ala Substitution of the Predicted PMA-selective Sites Inhibit PMA-induced Potentiation of Peak Cav 2.3 Currents—A quintuple Ser/Thr → Ala mutation of the predicted PMA sites was constructed as a first step toward examining our prediction. Expressed IBa through the Cav 2.3 channel quintuple mutant, T365A/S369A/T879A/S1995A/S2011A, or the Cav 2.3 WT channel were studied and analyzed in parallel. The IBa peaked between –10 and 20 mV in both the wild type and the quintuple mutant. The peak current amplitude was observed at 75.8 ± 0.3 ms (mean ± S.E., n = 28) and 76 ± 0.3 ms (mean ± S.E., n = 23) in the WT and the quintuple mutant, respectively. Analysis of the I-V plot revealed that the IBa appeared at –40 mV and reversed between 70 and 90 mV in both the wild type and the quintuple mutant. The kinetic properties of the currents from the oocytes expressing the quintuple mutant, T365A/S369A/T879A/S1995A/S2011A, were compared with those of the Cav 2.3 WT. IBa through the WT (inactivating current (A1) = 1437 ± 154 nA (82 ± 1% of total current), τ = 111 ± 10 ms, and non-inactivating residual current (R) = 154 ± 15 nA (mean ± S.E.; n = 29)) and the quintuple mutant (A1 = 1790 ± 187 nA (84 ± 1% of total current), τ = 123 ± 4 ms, and R = 177 ± 16 nA (mean ± S.E.; n = 24)) channels showed similar mono-exponential inactivation. PMA potentiated the IBa through the Cav 2.3 WT channels significantly. In contrast, PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents was significantly decreased in the oocytes expressing the quintuple mutant (Fig. 2A and Table I). Oocytes expressing the quintuple mutant were exposed to MCh to investigate the specificity of the PMA-selective sites. Surprisingly, MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents was also significantly inhibited by the quintuple mutant (Fig. 2B and Table I). To narrow down the possible sites mediating the PMA and MCh responses, several mutants incorporating only some of the sites were constructed. Because the Ser/Thr residues of predicted PMA sites are located in the I-II linker (Thr-365, Ser-369), II-III linker (Thr-879), and the C terminus (Ser-1995, Ser-2011), three sets of Ala mutants comprising the I-II linker, II-III linker, and the C-terminal sites were constructed. PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 current was inhibited by the I-II linker double mutant, T365A/S369A, not by the II-III linker mutant T879A or the C-terminal mutant S1995A/S2011A (Fig. 3A and Table I). Similarly, MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 current was decreased by T365A/S369A and unaffected by T879A or S1995A/S2011A (Fig. 3B and Table I). To determine whether only one of the I-II linker sites was required, the single Ala mutations of Thr-365 and Ser-369 were constructed. Although T365A significantly inhibited the effect of PMA or MCh, S369A failed to modulate their responses (Fig. 4). Thus the inhibition of PMA or MCh response by the quintuple mutant was narrowed down to Thr-365 of the I-II linker. However, a contribution by the other sites (Ser-369, Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011) is possible, because greater inhibition of PMA- or MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents was observed with the quintuple mutant than with T365A (see Figs. 2 and 4, Table I). Hence, several mutants with or without Thr-365 were constructed to examine the contribution of additional sites in the action of PMA or MCh.Table ISummary of PMA or MCh effects on the Cav 2.3 WT or selected Ala mutant channelsS/T/A atIncrease (current)I-II 365/369II-III 879C-terminal 1995/2011Peak IBa, PMA (100 nm)nPeak IBa, MCh (1 μm)n%%T/STS/S83 ± 210556 ± 2127A/AAA/A26 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.,bP < 0.001 compared with T365A.1113 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.,cP < 0.01 compared with T365A.12A/STS/S42 ± 3dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.1028 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.12A/ATS/S43 ± 4dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.1122 ± 5aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.9A/SAS/S52 ± 5dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.824 ± 6aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.8A/STA/S52 ± 5aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.827 ± 4aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.10A/STS/A39 ± 1eP < 0.05 compared with the respective WT control.523 ± 4dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.6A/AAS/S39 ± 5fP < 0.02 compared with the respective WT control.620 ± 3dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.6A/ATA/S28 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.,cP < 0.01 compared with T365A.1113 ± 4aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.,cP < 0.01 compared with T365A.13A/ATS/A44 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.1124 ± 3aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.8A/SAA/S45 ± 9dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.1032 ± 6eP < 0.05 compared with the respective WT control.7A/SAS/A40 ± 6aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.1218 ± 5aP < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.7A/STA/A41 ± 6dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.832 ± 4dP < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.9a P < 0.001 compared with the respective WT control.b P < 0.001 compared with T365A.c P < 0.01 compared with T365A.d P < 0.01 compared with the respective WT control.e P < 0.05 compared with the respective WT control.f P < 0.02 compared with the respective WT control.

The Ala quadruple mutation including Ser-369, Thr-879, Ser-1995, and Ser-2011 failed to significantly modify the effect of PMA or MCh (Fig. 5). In consideration of the possibility that some of these other sites contribute only with Thr-365, several double and triple mutants including Thr-365 and the other selected PKC sites were constructed. All of the double mutants, viz. T365A/S369A, T365A/T879A, T365A/S1995A, and T365A/S2011A, decreased PMA-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 current compared with their controls. However, they failed to match the effect of the Ala quintuple mutant quantitatively (Table I). The triple mutants, viz. T365A/S369A/T879A, T365A/S369A/S1995A, T365A/S369A/S2011A, T365A/T879A/S1995A, T365A/T879A/S2011A, and T365A/S1995A/S2011A, also significantly inhibited the PMA response (Table I). The inhibition of the PMA response produced by one of the triple mutants, T365A/S369A/S1995A, was significantly greater than that of T365A and was equivalent to that of the Ala quintuple mutant (Fig. 6 and Table I). MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents was also decreased in a similar manner by T365A/S369A/S1995A, as the inhibition of the MCh response by this triple mutant was significantly greater than that produced by T365A (Fig. 6 and Table I). Similarly, another triple mutant involving Thr-365 and the MCh-specific sites Ser-892 and Ser-1987 (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), T365A/S892A/S1987A, showed inhibition similar to that of the Ala quintuple mutant or the triple mutant T365A/S369A/S1995A. In contrast the effect of PMA with T365A/S892A/S1987A was similar to that of T365A (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Effect of PMA (A) (100 nm) or MCh (B) (1 μm) on the Cav 2.3 currents expressed by single, triple, or quintuple mutants of α1 2.3 subunit.

The IBa through T365D or 2.3 WT channels was analyzed in parallel. Compared with the 2.3 WT, IBa through T365D channels was significantly larger (Fig. 7, A–C). Coincident with this increase in the size of the basal current in T365D, the effect of PMA or MCh (Fig. 7D) was decreased significantly. To further analyze the mechanism of interaction between Thr-365 and the other potential PKC sites, we constructed a quintuple mutant in which Thr-365 was mutated to Asp and the other sites to Ala (T365D/S369A/T879A/S1995A/S2011A). The IBa through this Asp (one)/Ala (four) quintuple mutant was significantly larger compared with 2.3 WT analyzed in parallel (Fig. 8, A–C). The increase in the basal current in this Asp (one)/Ala (four) quintuple mutant was accompanied by a decrease in the PMA- or MCh-induced potentiation of Cav 2.3 currents of greater magnitude than that observed with just the T365D mutant (Fig. 8D). Because the inhibition produced by the triple mutant T365A/ S369A/S1995A matched the inhibition produced by the quintuple mutant T365A/S369A/T879A/S1995A/S2011A, the triple Asp mutant T365D/S369D/S1995D was constructed. The IBa through this Asp triple mutant was significantly greater compared with the current through 2.3 WT acquired and analyzed in parallel (Fig. 9, A–C). The increase in the IBa with the Asp triple mutant was accompanied by a decrease in the PMA or MCh response. Moreover, the decrease in PMA or MCh response observed with the Asp triple mutant was significantly more than that seen with T365D (Fig. 9D). PKC has been implicated in the regulation of various Cav channels on the basis of enhancement of current in response to treatment with PMA and agonists of some G-protein-coupled receptors (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and by inhibition of the responses with some PKC inhibitors (9Kamatchi G. Tiwari S. Chan C. Chen D. Do S.-H. Durieux M. Lynch III, C. Brain Res. 2003; 968: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In previous work (1Kamatchi G. Franke R. Lynch III, C. Sando J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4102-4109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) we identified sites in the II-III linker of the α1 2.3 subunit that are required for the unique response of Cav 2.3 currents to MCh. Here we have identified sites in the α1 2.3 subunit that are required for the enhancement of Cav 2.3 currents by PMA and found that the most critical site is required for the response to MCh as well. Two sites in the I-II linker of α1 2.3 subunit (Thr-365 and Ser-369) that are homologous to those previously identified in the PMA-responsive α1 2.2 subunit (6Hamid J. Nelson D. Spaetgens R. Dubel S. Snutch T. Zamponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6195-6202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were targeted along with one site in the II-III linker (Thr-879) and two in the C terminus (Ser-1995 and Ser-2011) (Fig. 2). The most critical site was identified as Thr-365 in the I-II linker. T365A eliminated most of the response (Fig. 4), and Ala mutation of the other four sites was without effect (Fig. 5). A more complete loss of the response was obtained when Thr-365, as well as Ser-369 and Ser-1995, was mutated to Ala (Fig. 6), suggesting that the other sites may contribute to the effect but only if Thr-365 in the I-II linker is available. Mutation of Thr-365 to Asp to mimic the negative charge of a phosphorylated residue significantly increased the basal current when the rest of the channel was WT or when the other four sites were mutated to Ala and caused a corresponding decrease in the response to PMA (Figs. 7 and 8). These results support the possibility that the PMA response involves phosphorylation of Thr-365. The facts that the PMA response was more completely diminished when Thr-365 was mutated to Asp and the other four sites were mutated to Ala or when Ser-369 and Ser-1995 also were mutated to Asp are again consistent with a secondary role of these latter sites in generating the full PMA response. Because single amino acid mutations may affect the trafficking efficiency of assembled multi-subunit channels, the results obtained with the Asp mutations may be related to the altered surface expression levels. The fact that all of the relevant Asp mutants showed an increase in the basal current accompanied by a decrease in the response to PMA or MCh argues against altered expression as an explanation for the changes in the current. The observation that mutation of the primary Thr-365 site and the secondary Ser-369 and Ser-1995 sites caused similar loss of the MCh response (Figs. Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) was surprising because the α1 2.2 subunit has comparable I-II linker sites (Thr-422 and Ser-425), and it responds only to PMA and not to MCh. However, combination of the I-II linker mutation T365A with Ala mutation of the previously identified MCh-selective sites in the II-III linker (Ser-892) and C terminus (Ser-1987) showed a more dramatic loss of the MCh response than of the PMA response (Fig. 6). Thus, the MCh response seems to require the Thr-365 in the I-II linker in common with the PMA response, but in addition it requires especially Ser-892 in the II-III linker as well as Ser-1987 in the C terminus. Collectively, these results may hint at possible ordering of putative phosphorylation events with the phosphorylation of Thr-365 required before the participation of other modulating sites, Ser-369 and Ser-1995 in the case of common PMA/MCh responses, or Ser-892 and Ser-1987 in the case of MCh-selective responses. Alternatively, phosphorylation at the secondary sites may occur but, in the absence of phosphorylation at Thr-365, cause no effect. The identification of common sites through which both MCh and PMA act suggests the involvement of common PKC isozymes activated by both stimuli. The identification of unique sites required for MCh action suggests that MCh may activate additional PKC isozymes (or other pathways) not activated by PMA. Because MCh activates phospholipid hydrolysis with the generation of both DAG and inositol triphosphate, which can release [Ca2+]i stores (10van Koppen C. Kaiser B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), it would be expected to cause activation of Ca2+-dependent cPKCs as well as Ca2+-independent nPKCs. Some members of all three classes of PKC isozymes have been identified in Xenopus oocytes (11Johnson J. Capco D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 67: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PMA is a much more potent agonist at the DAG binding site of cPKCs and nPKCs, but because it does not lead directly to release of [Ca2+]i, it would not be expected to provide good activation of the Ca2+-dependent cPKCs. Thus we hypothesize that both PMA and MCh may activate nPKCs, which may phosphorylate the critical I-II linker Thr-365 site as well as some secondary sites required for common PMA and MCh enhancement of Cav 2.3 currents, but that only MCh may activate cPKCs, which may phosphorylate the critical II-III linker site Ser-892 and others that selectively regulate the MCh response. The mechanisms by which phosphorylation affects channel conductance are yet to be established. Hall et al. (12Hall K.E. Browning M.D. Dudek E.M. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6069-6076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested an increase in channel conductance or channel open time in response to PKC activation. Based on single channel studies, others have postulated that Cav channels may exist in different states that are more or less excitable (13Boland L.M. Bean B.P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 516-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Delcour A.H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1993; 259: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that the action of PKC is to switch the channel to a more easily excited state (15Yang J. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The localization of PMA- and MCh-selective sites in the I-II and II-III linkers is significant because these linkers represent regions of alternative splicing and binding sites for the β subunit and receptor proteins required for the release of neurotransmitters (2Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Rettig J. Sheng Z-H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The understanding of the susceptibility of the PKC phosphorylation sites to various PKC isozymes may help to explain the basis for the differential responses of Cav channels to various agonists, neurotransmitters, and hormones.

We investigated the role of SPEC2 in T cell function due to its high mRNA expression in lymphocytes. Western blot analysis revealed abundant SPEC2 protein in lymphocytes, which in glutathione S-transferase-capture experiments specifically interacted with only GTP-bound Cdc42. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the SPEC2 protein was diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane in unstimulated Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells. Recruitment of SPEC2 within Jurkat T cells to the antigen-presenting cell interface occurred following incubation with staphylococcal enterotoxin E superantigen-loaded B cells and colocalized there with F-actin and Cdc42. T cell receptor (TCR) activation studies using anti-CD3 antibody-coated polystyrene beads showed that SPEC2 was recruited to the site of bead contact, which was not observed with anti-major histocompatibility complex antibody-coated beads. Accumulation of SPEC2 following TCR engagement occurred as early as 5 min, before obvious F-actin accumulation. Biochemical studies with Jurkat T cells demonstrated that N-terminal cysteine residues in SPEC2 were palmitoylated. Overexpression studies of the related SPEC1 showed that it also was recruited to the activated TCR. Mutational analysis revealed that localization of SPEC1 to the TCR required two N-terminal cysteine residues. Furthermore, a SPEC1 Cdc42 Rac-interacting binding mutant, containing an intact N terminus but defective in Cdc42 binding, completely blocked F-actin accumulation at the activated TCR. Taken together these results suggest that SPECs may play important roles in Cdc42-mediated F-actin accumulation at the immunological synapse.
