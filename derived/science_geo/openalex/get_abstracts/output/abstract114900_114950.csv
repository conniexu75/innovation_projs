https://openalex.org/W2121642311,"The Huntington's disease (HD) gene has been mapped in 4p16.3 but has eluded identification. We have used haplotype analysis of linkage disequilibrium to spotlight a small segment of 4p16.3 as the likely location of the defect. A new gene, IT15, isolated using cloned trapped exons from the target area contains a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. A (CAG)n repeat longer than the normal range was observed on HD chromosomes from all 75 disease families examined, comprising a variety of ethnic backgrounds and 4p16.3 haplotypes. The (CAG)n repeat appears to be located within the coding sequence of a predicted approximately 348 kd protein that is widely expressed but unrelated to any known gene. Thus, the HD mutation involves an unstable DNA segment, similar to those described in fragile X syndrome, spino-bulbar muscular atrophy, and myotonic dystrophy, acting in the context of a novel 4p16.3 gene to produce a dominant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2083685529,"The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain (IL-2R gamma) is a component of high and intermediate affinity IL-2 receptors that is required to achieve full ligand binding affinity and internalization. We have localized the IL-2R gamma gene to human chromosome Xq13. Genetic linkage analysis indicates that the IL-2R gamma gene and the locus for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) appear to be at the same position. Moreover, we demonstrate that each of three unrelated patients with XSCID has a different mutation in his IL-2R gamma gene resulting in a different premature stop codon and predicted C-terminal truncation. These data establish that XSCID is associated with mutations of the IL-2R gamma gene product. Since XSCID is characterized by absent or markedly reduced numbers of T cells, our findings imply that IL-2R gamma plays a vital role in thymic maturation of T cells. These results also have important implications for prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, carrier female detection, and gene therapy for XSCID."
https://openalex.org/W1982527304,"Coat colors in the chestnut horse, the yellow Labrador retriever, the red fox, and one type of yellow mouse are due to recessive alleles at the extension locus. Similarly, dominant alleles at this locus are often responsible for dark coat colors in mammals, such as the melanic form of the leopard, Panthera pardus. We show here that the murine extension locus encodes the melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) receptor. In mice, the recessive yellow allele (e) results from a frameshift that produces a prematurely terminated, nonfunctioning receptor. The sombre (Eso and Eso-3J) and tobacco darkening (Etob) alleles, which both have dominant melanizing effects, results from point mutations that produce hyperactive MSH receptors. The Eso-3J receptor is constitutively activated, while the Etob receptor remains hormone responsive and produces a greater activation of its effector, adenylyl cyclase, than does the wild-type allele."
https://openalex.org/W2010050518,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports the survival of a specific set of neurons in the vertebrate nervous system. Here we show that the rat BDNF gene consists of four short 5' exons and one 3' exon encoding the mature BDNF protein. Eight different BDNF mRNAs with four different 5' ends and two alternative polyadenylation sites are transcribed from this gene. BDNF mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III are expressed predominantly in the brain, whereas exon IV transcripts predominate in the lung and heart. mRNAs containing exons I, II, and III increase markedly in the brain after kainic acid-induced seizures, whereas exon IV mRNA increases only slightly. Several transcription initiation sites were mapped upstream of the four 5' exons, and transfection of promoter-reporter gene constructs confirmed that these sequences act as promoters. Combined, the data demonstrate that alternative usage of four promoters within the BDNF gene and differential splicing control tissue-specific and seizure-induced expression of BDNF mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2008506955,"We performed a large-scale screen for mutations that affect the development of CNS axon pathways in the Drosophila embryo. We screened embryos from over 13,500 balanced lines and saved over 250 mutant lines whose phenotypes suggest possible defects in growth cone guidance. Here we focus on two new genes: commissureless (comm) and roundabout (robo). Mutations in comm lead to an absence of nearly all CNS axon commissures, such that growth cones that normally project across the midline instead now extend only on their own side. Mutations in robo lead to the opposite misrouting, such that some growth cones that normally extend only on their own side instead now project across the midline. The phenotypes of these two genes suggest that they may encode components of attractive and repulsive signaling systems at the midline that either guide growth cones across the midline or keep them on their own side."
https://openalex.org/W2010792988,"The mouse insulin-like growth factor type 2 receptor (Igf2r) is imprinted and expressed exclusively from the maternally inherited chromosome. To investigate whether methylation could function as the imprinting signal, we have cloned 130 kb from the Igf2r locus and searched for sequences methylated in a parental-specific manner. Two regions have been identified: region 1 contains the start of transcription and is methylated only on the silent paternal chromosome; region 2 is contained in an intron and is methylated only on the expressed maternal chromosome. Methylation of region 1 is acquired after fertilization, in contrast with the methylation of region 2, which is inherited from the female gamete. Methylation of region 2 may mark the maternal Igf2r locus in a manner that could act as an imprinting signal. These data suggest that the expressed locus carries a potential imprinting signal and imply that methylation is necessary for expression of the Igf2r gene."
https://openalex.org/W2073146277,"A Drosophila gene (drk) encodes a widely expressed protein with a single SH2 domain and two flanking SH3 domains, which is homologous to the Sem-5 protein of C. elegans and mammalian GRB2. Genetic analysis suggests that drk function is essential for signaling by the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase. Drk biological activity correlates with binding of its SH2 domain to activated receptor tyrosine kinases and concomitant localization of drk to the plasma membrane. In vitro, drk also binds directly to the C-terminal tail of Sos, a Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (GNRP), which, like Ras1 and drk, is required for sevenless signaling. These results suggest that drk binds autophosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases with its SH2 domain and the Sos GNRP through its SH3 domains, thereby coupling receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras activation. The conservation of these signaling proteins during evolution indicates that this is a general mechanism for linking tyrosine kinases to Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2071434138,"Excessive accumulation of neurofilaments in the cell bodies and proximal axons of motor neurons is a major pathological hallmark during the early stages of many human motor neuron diseases. To test directly the consequence of overexpression of the major neurofilament subunit NF-L, we produced transgenic mice that accumulate NF-L to âˆ¼4-fold the normal level in the sciatic nerve. In young animals, the motor neurons of the ventral horn of the spinal cord have massive accumulations of neurofilaments, swollen perikarya, and eccentrically localized nuclei. NF-L accumulation is accompanied by an increased frequency of axonal degeneration, proximal axon swelling, and severe skeletal muscle atrophy. These data indicate that extensive accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger the neurodegenerative process."
https://openalex.org/W1986234504,"We generated four transgenic mice with a 34 kb genomic fragment including the complete human neurofilament heavy (NF-H) gene. This human NF-H fragment contained all regulatory elements for tissue-specific expression, and in two transgenic lines, human NF-H proteins were produced at levels up to 2-fold the levels of endogenous mouse NF-H protein. By 3-4 months of age, these NF-H transgenics progressively develop neurological defects and abnormal neurofilamentous swellings that are highly reminiscent of those found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose that a modest up-regulation of NF-H cross-linkers can result in an impairment of neurofilament transport, causing neuronal swellings with ensuing axonopathy and muscle atrophy, a mechanism of pathogenesis pertinent to the possible etiology of ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2015913211,"Activation of the sevenless protein-tyrosine kinase is required for the proper specification of R7 photoreceptors in the Drosophila eye. The activation of a Ras protein, p21Ras1, is a crucial early event in the signaling pathway, and constitutive activation of p21Ras1 is sufficient to induce all of the effects of sevenless action. Here we report that another gene, E(sev)2B, required for proper signaling by sevenless encodes a protein of the structure SH3-SH2-SH3. We further provide evidence that the E(sev)2B protein is required for activation of p21Ras1 but not for any subsequent events, and that this protein can bind in vitro to sevenless and to Son of sevenless (Sos), a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor for p21Ras1. These results suggest that the E(sev)2B protein may act to stimulate the ability of Sos to catalyze p21Ras1 activation by linking sevenless and Sos in a signaling complex. We have renamed the E(sev)2B locus downstream of receptor kinases (drk)."

https://openalex.org/W2030885475,"A family of genes encoding neuronal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits has been identified and cloned from vertebrates. Expression studies have implied that as few as one or two kinds of subunits may be sufficient to construct neuronal AChRs and that multiple pair-wise combinations of the gene products are capable of generating functional receptors. We show here that a class of AChRs with a predominantly synaptic location on neurons contains receptors having at least three types of subunits and that the subunits are encoded by the alpha 3, beta 4, and alpha 5 AChR genes. In addition, we show that a class of extrasynaptic AChRs on the same neurons contains the alpha 7 subunits but lacks the alpha 3, beta 4, and alpha 5 subunits. The results demonstrate that native AChRs on neurons are more complex in composition than previously appreciated and suggest that constraints on subunit interactions limit the kinds of receptor species produced."

https://openalex.org/W1964629933,"We describe the nuclear organization of pre-mRNA processing components in HeLa cells upon adenovirus 2 infection and their relationship to the localization of viral RNA sequences. We observe a redistribution of cellular splicing factors as well as RNA polymerase II and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle proteins to sites of viral RNA transcription. Similar results were obtained in cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing a portion of the Î²-tropomyosin gene. Our findings demonstrate a very close association between RNA transcripts and transcription and pre-mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that these processes are both temporally and spatially linked in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, these data suggest a recruiting mechanism that regulates the localization of transcription and splicing factors in response to the initiation of active transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2053926890,"Quaternary ammonium (QA) compounds inhibit K+ conductance by entering and occluding the open pore of voltage-activated K+ channels. We characterized the effects of a series of alkyl-triethylammonium blockers on the Shaker K+ channel and tested them on a series of site-directed mutants of the channel protein in order to define the structural features of the binding sites. We found that mutations in two regions of the channel protein, the pore (P) region and the last transmembrane sequence (S6), appear to alter QA binding, not through their effects on gating but perhaps through direct effects on the binding site. Several mutations in the P region affect tetraethylammonium binding but have minimal effects on longer blockers, suggesting that the hydrophobic tail contributes to binding in a nonadditive fashion. Binding of the longer blockers can be affected by varying the hydrophobicity of 1 residue within S6 by site-specific substitution, in a manner consistent with a direct hydrophobic interaction between the side chain at this site and the alkyl chains of the blocker."
https://openalex.org/W2049874412,"Gridded on high density filters, a P1 genomic library of 17-fold coverage and a cosmid library of 8 genome equivalents, both made from S. pombe strain 972h-, were ordered by hybridizing genetic markers and individual clones from the two libraries. Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones covering the entire genome were used to subdivide the libraries, and hybridization of short oligonucleotides and DNA pools made from randomly selected cosmids provided further mapping information. Restriction digests were generated as an independent confirmation of the clone order. The high resolution clone map was aligned to the genetic map and the physical Notl and YAC maps. The usefulness of the various mapping techniques and cloning procedures could be assessed upon the different data sets."
https://openalex.org/W1585483493,"DNA fragmentation was evaluated in three instances of programmed cell death, interdigital cell death in embryonic mouse limbs, and metamorphic death of both the labial glands and intersegmental muscle in the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexto. In the mouse, we evaluated both developmental cell death and expandedrange cell death induced by retinoic acid. The status of DNA was examined in several ways. Nuclei were examined by electron microscopy and Feulgen staining. Quantitative assessment of total DNA content in Feulgenstained degenerating nuclei was made for the gland. In the labial gland, DNA content does not drop during the early phases of cell death; nor is an endonucleolytic ladder seen when DNA was examined by ethidium bromide staining or prelabeling with [3H]thymidine. Only by using end labeling of DNA could we detect DNA fragmentation at a very late stage in cell death, day 4 of the collapse of the gland. In contrast, WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells display an early and extensive ladder after treatment with glucocorticoids. In mouse limb, for which cell death follows a more classic apoptotic morphology, a ladder is likewise not seen. We conclude that activation of an endonudease is neither a trigger nor a necessary or defining component of the early phases of developmental programmed cell death, and that reported failure by others to find such a ladder may depend on limitations in the system that is under investigation.â€” Zakeri, Z.

https://openalex.org/W1966323687,"This paper shows that yeast can be a host for the replication of a higher eukaryotic viral genome. Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of animal and plant positive strand RNA viruses. Yeast expressing BMV RNA replication genes 1a and 2a support RNA-dependent replication and transcription of BMV RNA3 derivatives. RNA3 derivatives with the coat gene replaced by a reporter gene expressed that gene in a fashion dependent on 1a and 2a expression in trans and on BMV RNA replication and transcription signals in cis. RNA3 derivatives carrying the yeast URA3 gene complemented ura3- yeast to prototrophy and were maintained as persistent RNA episomes. Thus, all cellular factors essential for BMV RNA replication and transcription must be present in yeast, and yeast genetics should facilitate their identification."
https://openalex.org/W2040041182,"Human, mouse, and Xenopus mRNAs encoding the U1 snRNP-specific U1A protein contain a conserved 47 nt region in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). In vitro studies show that human U1A protein binds to two sites within the conserved region that resemble, in part, the previously characterized U1A-binding site on U1 snRNA. Overexpression of human U1A protein in mouse cells results in down-regulation of endogenous mouse U1A mRNA accumulation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that excess U1A protein specifically inhibits polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs that contain the conserved 3' UTR from human U1A mRNA. Thus, U1A protein regulates the production of its own mRNA via a mechanism that involves pre-mRNA binding and inhibition of polyadenylation."

https://openalex.org/W2028752380,"The rod photoresponse is triggered by an enzyme cascade that stimulates cGMP hydrolysis. The resulting fall in cGMP leads to a decrease in Ca2+, which promotes photoresponse recovery by activating guanylate cyclase, causing cGMP resynthesis. In vitro biochemical studies suggest that Ca2+ activation of guanylate cyclase is medicated by recoverin, a 26 kd Ca(2+)-binding protein. To evaluate this, exogenous bovine recoverin and two other homologous Ca(2+)-binding proteins from chicken and Gecko retina were dialyzed into functionally intact Gecko rods using whole-cell recording. All three proteins prolonged the rising phase of the photoresponse without affecting the kinetics of response recovery. These results suggest that recoverin-like proteins affect termination of the transduction cascade, rather than mediate Ca(2+)-sensitive activation of guanylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1586179871,"Ca2+ accumulates in the nucleus and DNA undergoes enzymatic cleavage into internucleosome-length fragments before acetaminophen and dimethylnitrosamine produce hepatic necrosis in vivo and toxic cell death in vitro. However, Ca(2+)-endonuclease fragmentation of DNA is characteristic of apoptosis, a type of cell death considered biochemically and functionally distinct from toxic cell death. The present studies investigate DNA fragmentation as a critical event in toxic cell death by testing whether the Ca(2+)-calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine and the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil prevent acetaminophen-induced hepatic necrosis by inhibiting Ca2+ deregulation and DNA damage. Acetaminophen overdose in mice produced accumulation of Ca2+ in the nucleus (358% of control) and fragmentation of DNA (250% of control) by 6 h, with peak release of ALT occurring at 12-24 h (38,000 U/l). Pretreatment with chlorpromazine prevented increases in nuclear Ca2+ and DNA fragmentation and nearly abolished biochemical evidence of toxic cell death. Verapamil pretreatment also decreased Ca2+ accumulation and DNA damage while attenuating liver injury. The Ca2+ antagonists did not protect against toxic cell death through hypothermia because neither produced the delay in toxicity that is customarily associated with hypothermia. Nor did chlorpromazine or verapamil protect through inhibiting acetaminophen bioactivation. Chlorpromazine failed to diminish glutathione depletion in whole liver and isolated nuclei. Verapamil (250 microM) also failed to alter glutathione depletion in whole liver and had no effect on acetaminophen-glutathione adduct formation by mouse liver microsomes and by cultured mouse hepatocytes. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that Ca(2+)-induced DNA fragmentation plays a significant role in cell necrosis produced by acetaminophen and may contribute to toxic cell death caused by other alkylating hepatotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W2076349092,"Postsynaptic peripheral membrane proteins at the neuromuscular junction have been proposed to participate in the immobilization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the synapse. An 87 kd cytoplasmic peripheral membrane protein has been demonstrated to colocalize with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the Torpedo electric organ and at the mammalian neuromuscular junction. We have cloned the cDNA encoding the 87K protein from Torpedo electric organ, and the predicted protein sequence is homologous to the C-terminal domains of dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene. The 87K protein displays a restricted pattern of expression detected only in electric organ, brain, and skeletal muscle. Analysis of the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of the 87K protein indicates that it is multiply phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The 87K protein is in a complex with other proteins associated with the post-synaptic membrane, including dystrophin and a 58 kd protein. These results suggest that the 87K protein is involved in the formation and stability of synapses and is regulated by protein phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2139164174,"We present the application of a nonrandom sequence-tagged site (STS) content detection method in mapping an entire genome, that of fission yeast. The novelty of our strategy is in the use of STS probes made from both ends of cosmid clones, selected on the basis of ""sample without replacement"" (only library clones that show no previous positive hybridization are selected and made into probes). We developed powerful techniques, based on consistency analysis, for error detection and contig assembly. In addition, we probed our library with genetically mapped markers and Notl or Sfil linking clones, thereby anchoring contigs onto chromosomes. Our map contains more than 1000 sites, including genes (most were previously unmapped), occurrences of known repetitive elements, and Notl-Sfil restriction sites."
https://openalex.org/W2012831549,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an ether phospholipid that serves as an autacoid in a wide range of biological processes. We found that when PAF was added to hippocampal slices, it induced a stable and concentration-dependent increase in excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike recordings (long-term potentiation [LTP]). The PAF effect was blocked by the PAF receptor antagonists BN 52021 and WEB 2086 and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists MK 801 and 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. However, these PAF receptor antagonists did not block LTP induced by high frequency stimulation. The facilitation induced by PAF could not be reversed by PAF receptor antagonists. Induction of either PAF-or tetanus-triggered facilitation occluded the subsequent expression of the other, suggesting a common pathway. LTP is a type of synaptic plasticity associated with the formation of memory, and PAF may play an important modulatory role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2026939082,"Developing rice endosperm cells display two distinct rough endoplasmic reticula (ER), cisternal ER (C-ER) and protein body ER (PB-ER), the latter delimiting the prolamine Protein bodies. These ER membranes are utilized for the simultaneous synthesis of glutelin and prolamine storage proteins, which are subsequently routed into separate Protein bodies. We demonstrate by blot hybridization, and by visualization of the spatial distributions and densities of these transcripts in endosperm cells via high resolution in situ hybridization analysis, that prolamine transcripts are associated primarily with the PB-ER, while glutelin mRNAs are enriched on the C-ER. The results suggest that the initial targeting Process of these storage proteins into distinct protein bodies is the segregation of their transcripts on the ER membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2148316753,"We examined the potential role of fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5) as a target-derived trophic factor for spinal motoneurons. Northern analysis of total RNA from rat skeletal muscle revealed an FGF-5 mRNA transcript both during the period of embryonic motoneuron death and in the adult. Recombinant human FGF-5 supported the survival of highly enriched cultures of embryonic chick motoneurons. Significant proportions of the motoneuron survival activity of rat skeletal muscle extracts could be immunoprecipitated using an antiserum to FGF-5. The immunoprecipitable activity was present in soluble and matrix-bound forms in embryonic muscle, but bound exclusively to the extracellular matrix in adult muscle. These results, along with the secretory nature of FGF-5, suggest that FGF-5 may act as a target-derived trophic factor for motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1547755899,"We have previously used an overlay assay technique to detect proteins that interact with protein kinase C (PKC) (Hyatt, S. L., Klauck, T., and Jaken, S. (1990) Mol. Carcinogenesis 3, 45-53). In some cases, binding proteins were also identified as substrates. Therefore, we used the overlay assay approach to screen a rat kidney lambda gt11 cDNA library to isolate and identify additional PKC substrates. Two clones have now been characterized. 35A is the rat homologue of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS)-related F52 cDNA, whereas 35H is a partial cDNA with substantial homology to the 3' end of beta-adducin. Both cDNAs encode proteins that bind phosphatidyl-serine (PS) and are substrates for PKC. Phosphorylation decreased both PS and PKC binding activities. Both proteins contain high density positive charge domains similar to that found in the major PKC substrate MARCKS. These results demonstrate that PKC interactions with certain substrate proteins are of sufficiently high affinity to facilitate their isolation via interaction cloning."
https://openalex.org/W1481543280,"The aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) in adherent rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. We examined whether focal adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase, pp125FAK, is one of these proteins. Anti-pp125FAK monoclonal antibody immunoblotted and precipitated a 115-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. In the absence of Fc epsilon RI aggregation, pp125FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated only in adherent cells. Aggregating Fc epsilon RI in adherent cells markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. This increase was detectable within 1 min of Fc epsilon RI aggregation and was maximal by 15 min. In contrast, in nonadherent cells Fc epsilon RI aggregation did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. The enhanced influx of calcium by calcium ionophore or the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol myristate acetate induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK only in adherent cells. Thus, Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK could be mediated by the activation of protein kinase C and/or the induction of calcium influx. The data indicate that cell adherence is essential for Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK."
https://openalex.org/W1594024004,"Upon agonist exposure, most membrane receptors internalize into the cell as part of an adaptation process. Receptor domains that mediate internalization have been defined for several receptor classes, e.g. growth factor and transport receptors, but not yet for any of the numerous members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), having seven putative transmembrane helices. With the use of deletion mutations, we previously showed that a small region in the middle of the third intracellular loop (i3) appears to be required for the agonist-induced internalization of the Hm1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (Lameh, J., Philip, M., Sharma, Y. K., Moro, O., Ramachandran, J., and Sadee, W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13406-13412). Using point mutations, we now demonstrate that domain 286-292 (ESLTSSE) is required, with TSS playing a crucial role. Although the i3 loops of GPCRs share minimal overall sequence identity, even among closely related subtypes, small domains containing multiple S/T residues are also present in several other GPCRs, e.g. peptide, catechol, and all the muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes. S/T-->A mutations in analogous i3 domains also prevented receptor internalization in the case of Hm3 and attenuated internalization of Hm2. We propose that an S/T-rich domain in the i3 loop, possibly via phosphorylation reactions, regulates one pathway of GPCR internalization."

To address this problem, we analyzed the splicing of transcripts containing chimeric introns or splice site duplications derived from two natural yeast genes. Our experiments indicate that there are strong context effects that influence splicing efficiency and relative splice site strength. Cis-competition experiments showed that the context effects are not only local, as the source of the 3â€² splice site region influences 5â€² splice site selection and the source of the 5â€² splice site affects 3â€² splice site selection.

INaS was dependent upon extracellular Na+, but was not affected by 0 mM extracellular Ca2+ or by Ca2+ channel blockers (Mn2+ Cd2+, or Co2+). A tetrodotoxin-insensitive, Na+-dependent plateau potential that was likely generated by INaS was shown to underlie DAPS during intracellular recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.

In 140 mM LiCl, Ca2+ influx via the exchanger was completely dependent upon the presence of extracellular K+ (Km approximately 1 mM). In 140 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), Ca2+ influx was stimulated by K+ but was not absolutely dependent upon it; the inclusion of 20 mM NaCl in the NMDG medium restored the K+ dependence of Ca2+ influx. Stimulation of Ca2+ influx by K+ was confirmed by 45Ca2+ flux studies. 86Rb+ fluxes were measured to determine if Ca2+ and Rb+ were co-transported by the exchanger. The presence of extracellular Ca2+ stimulated 86Rb+ influx in ouabain-treated platelets in 160 mM LiCl or NMDG. The Rb+/Ca2+ influx ratio was 0.42 +/- 0.04 (n = 3) at [Rb+] = 0.2 mM and 0.89 at [Rb+] = 1.3 mM. Neither K(+)-dependent Ca2+ influx nor Ca(2+)-dependent Rb+ influx was observed in 160 mM NaCl or in platelets that had not been pretreated with ouabain, indicating that these fluxes resulted from Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux was also shown to be dependent upon the presence of internal K+. These properties are similar to those of the Na+/Ca(2+)-K+ exchanger found in retinal rods, as distinct from the more widely distributed cardiac-type exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1521022175,"Troponin C regulates contraction in striated muscle by alternating between the Ca(2+)-bound and apo conformations. We report here that spontaneous formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-35 and Cys-84, or dimerization via an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys-84 in cardiac troponin C, renders the protein Ca(2+)-independent when assayed in fast skeletal muscle myofibrils but to a much lesser extent in cardiac myofibrils. Formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond appears to expose hydrophobic surfaces, as indicated by an increase in fluorescence from hydrophobic fluorescent dyes, but does not alter the affinity of Ca(2+)-binding site II. These disulfide bonds constrain the protein into a conformation that either resembles or can substitute for the Ca(2+)-bound form of cardiac troponin C in fast skeletal muscle myofibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1505744573,"There are at least two picosecond kinetic components in the rebinding of NO to native sperm whale myoglobin. Petrich et al. (Petrich, J. W., Lambry, J.-C., Kuczera, K., Karplus, M., Poyart, C., and Martin, J.-L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3975-3987) attribute the slowing of the reaction to a movement of the iron atom out of the plane of the heme following ligand dissociation. In contrast, Gibson et al. (Gibson, Q. H., Regan, R., Elber, R., Olson, J. S., and Carver, T. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22022-22034) have explained multiphasic geminate reactions by diffusion of NO into the distal heme pocket as determined by its detailed structure. O2 and NO rebinding to iron and cobalt derivatives of native, V68F, and V68I sperm whale myoglobin has been examined. Each iron protein shows a biphasic time course of NO rebinding reactions with widely different rates and amplitudes. Although cobalt does not move out of the plane of the porphyrin on ligand removal, the reactions of the iron and cobalt derivatives of each protein were closely similar. The time course of O2 rebinding to cobalt was also similar to that of NO rebinding to iron. These results are consistent with a primary role for the structure of the distal pocket in determining diffusion of ligands away from the metal atom and as a result the time course of picosecond ligand rebinding."
https://openalex.org/W2136159343,"Molecular conjugate vectors may be constructed that accomplish high efficiency gene transfer by the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. In order to mediate escape from lysosomal degradation, we have incorporated adenoviruses into the functional design of the conjugate. In doing so, however, we have introduced an additional ligand, which can bind to receptors on the cell surface, undermining the potential for cell specific targeting. To overcome this, we have treated the adenovirus with a monoclonal anti-fiber antibody, which renders the virus incapable of binding to its receptor. The result is a multi-functional molecular conjugate vector, which has preserved its binding specificity while at the same time being capable of preventing lysosomal degradation of endosome-internalized conjugate-DNA complexes. This finding indicates that adenoviral binding is not a prerequisite for adenoviral-mediated endosome disruption."
https://openalex.org/W1551476823,"It has been reported that alteration of deletion of critical residues within one of the two homologous protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase)-like domains of CD45 completely abolishes all activity, suggesting that only the more N-terminal domain is catalytically active. However, we now demonstrate, by two independent techniques, that the second (C-terminal) domain is also a viable phosphatase. Limited proteolysis by endoproteinase Lys-C or trypsin increased the phosphatase activity toward reduced, carboxymethylated, and maleylated lysozyme approximately 8-fold. A 50-kDa fragment, isolated by ion exchange chromatography, was found to be responsible for this activity. N-terminal sequencing revealed that this fragment includes less than half of the first phosphatase domain and most, if not all, of the second. In a second experiment, 109 residues, including the presumed catalytic region, were removed from domain I by site-directed mutagenesis. Expression of this construct in a mammalian cell line resulted in increased PTPase activity over nontransfected control cells. Isolation of the recombinant CD45 by immunoprecipitation and immunoaffinity chromatography revealed that it had phosphatase activity. Both of these experimental approaches demonstrate that the second conserved PTPase domain of CD45 is a functioning PTPase, but that external regulation may be required to express its activity in the context of the native molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1581754894,"Uteroferrin (Uf) is a purple acid phosphatase with a bi-iron center. It is the major secretory product of the porcine uterus under the influence of progesterone and supplies iron to the developing fetuses during pregnancy. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAP) are clearly similar to Uf in many of their properties but are generally located intracellularly in lysosomes. To determine whether Uf and intracellular TRAP are distinct gene products, cDNA for the TRAP from pig spleen were compared with Uf cDNA. Although no full-length cDNA for the former were isolated, a TRAP cDNA of 1.1 kilobases was identical in nucleotide sequence to a Uf cDNA (1.42 kilobases) in the region of overlap, which included the entire 3'-end of the transcript and most of the open reading frame. TRAP purified from porcine spleen also had an NH2-terminal amino acid sequence that corresponded to that of Uf purified from uterine secretions and was also similar in sequence to intracellular TRAP isolated from tissues of other species, including ones from human osteoclastomas and spleen. Finally, Southern hybridization analysis with two probes specific for exons 1 and 2 of the Uf gene strongly suggested the presence of only a single gene for acid phosphatases of this class in the pig. A similar analysis performed on human DNA with an exon-specific probe for human TRAP was also consistent with a single gene. It is concluded that the difference in trafficking between a secreted TRAP, such as Uf, and TRAP located in lysosomes is not the result of distinctive primary sequence of the polypeptides and that the variability within species ascribed to such enzymes is most likely the result of minor posttranslational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1542910811,"Peptides derived from a sequence within the loop structure of human platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa (integrin beta 3) were previously shown to inhibit fibrinogen binding to purified GPIIb-IIIa. In this study a series of peptides based on the GPIIIa sequence 211-221 (SVSRNRDAPEG) was synthesized. The most active peptide was determined to be RNRDA, and its inhibitory potency was 4-fold greater (IC50 = 4.8 microM) than that of SVSRNRDAPEG. These GPIIIa peptides also inhibited the binding of two monoclonal antibodies, pl-55 and PAC-1, which are directed against the activated conformer of GPIIb-IIIa. To determine whether these peptides bound directly to GPIIb-IIIa, an affinity matrix was prepared by coupling RNRDAPEGC to Sepharose. Fibrinogen or purified GPIIb-IIIa was applied to the affinity column. Only GPIIb-IIIa was retained on the column, and it could be specifically eluted by GPIIIa peptide or RGDV but not by an irrelevant peptide. Additionally, we observed that the binding of GPIIIa peptides to purified GPIIb-IIIa induced exposure of a neoepitope on GPIIb that was recognized by the monoclonal antibody pl-80. These data suggest that sequences within the loop structure of GPIIIa can interact with the ligand binding domain of GPIIb-IIIa. Thus, this GPIIIa domain may be involved in regulating the accessibility of ligands to GPIIb-IIIa following platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1518430682,"A substrate protein of protein kinase C with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa has been purified from bovine brain. This protein shares several properties with a major substrate of protein kinase C (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; MARCKS). It is heat-stable and copurifies with MARCKS during various steps (ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration). However, its elution from a calmodulin affinity column is different from that of MARCKS. It can be eluted by high ionic strength in the presence of calcium, whereas MARCKS can be eluted only in the absence of calcium. Its earlier elution from a reversed phase column suggests that p70 is less hydrophobic than MARCKS. The electrospray mass spectrum revealed an actual mass of 31,550 +/- 6.5 Da, very far from the apparent molecular mass in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (70,000 Da). This mass is about 200 Da smaller than that of MARCKS determined by mass spectrometry analysis (Manenti, S., Sorokine, O., Van Dorsselaer, A., and Taniguchi, H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22310-22315), close to the value expected for the change due to N-terminal myristoylation (210 Da). N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the N terminus is not blocked, and the sequence found for the 10 first amino acids is identical to that deduced from the cDNA sequence of bovine MARCKS. These data clearly establish that this protein is a non-myristoylated form of MARCKS and that the absence of the myristoyl moiety at the N terminus lowers the affinity to calmodulin. The purification performed both from the membrane and the cytoplasmic fractions of bovine brain indicated that this non-myristoylated form represents 20-30% of the MARCKS protein in the cytoplasmic fraction, and less than 5% in the membrane one."
https://openalex.org/W1589638018,"Three amino acids were identified in the catalytic (C) subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase that are involved in interaction with regulatory (R) subunit, but not with the specific protein kinase inhibitor, PKI. In a functional assay for gene induction, a C expression vector with serine or arginine substituted for Leu-198 and the double mutant C, His-87-->Gln/Trp-196-->Arg (Orellana, S. A., and McKnight, G. S. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U.S.A. 89, 4726-4730), retained activity in the presence of an excess of RI or RII. In contrast, cotransfection of a full-length PKI expression vector completely inhibited the activity of both mutant and wild type C subunits. These data suggest that although the substrate/pseudosubstrate sites of R and PKI interact with C at the catalytic site, there is an additional domain on the C subunit that is involved in holoenzyme formation with R subunit and is distinct from sites specifying high affinity PKI binding."
https://openalex.org/W2027234795,"We have identified a gene, hikaru genki (hig), whose mutant phenotype includes abnormal locomotor behavior. Mutant first instar larvae have uncoordinated movements, and both larvae and adults have reduced locomotion. Sequence analyses revealed that this gene encodes a novel type of protein with a signal sequence, but without transmembrane regions. One of its domains has similarities with immunoglobulin domains; three or four regions are similar to a complement-binding domain found in complement-related proteins and selectins. In situ hybridization to embryos revealed that accumulation of the hig transcripts is restricted to subsets of cells in the CNS. Our data suggest that hig has a role in the development of CNS functions involved in locomotor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1534969332,"gp114 is a major sialoglycoprotein expressed on the apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells. We investigated its distribution in two lectin-resistant mutant cell lines derived from MDCKII cells, MDCKII-RCAr and MDCKII-ConAr cells. gp114 was present on the apical membrane of MDCKII-ConAr cells but was predominantly basolateral in MDCKII-RCAr cells. No change of polarity was observed for several apical and basolateral markers in this cell line. Reversal of polarity of gp114 mainly resulted from a modification of its intracellular sorting. gp114 showed altered endocytosis in MDCKII-RCAr cells. In MDCKII cells gp114 was slowly endocytosed, whereas in MDCKII-RCAr cells endocytosis of gp114 was highly increased. Using mannosidase I and II inhibitors we found that N-glycosylation only slightly affects gp114 sorting and endocytosis. Our results suggest that gp114 or an associated component in MDCK-RCAr fails to express apical information or that a mutation creates a basolateral sorting signal which could be related to endocytic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1567519287,"These studies examined the ability of ATP to stimulate transport of the organic cation tetraethylammonium (TEA) into proximal tubular brush border membrane vesicles. ATP markedly enhanced TEA uptake for 1 h or more to values severalfold above those observed in the absence of ATP. The poorly hydrolyzable analogue of ATP, AMP-PNP (adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate), reduced the effect of ATP but alone did not stimulate TEA uptake. GTP and ITP also stimulated TEA uptake, whereas other nucleotides did not. ATP-stimulated TEA uptake was saturable, temperature-dependent, and markedly reduced by the organic cations amiloride, quinidine, cimetidine, and verapamil, but only modestly reduced by the organic cations N'-methylnicotinamide and choline. Some inhibitors of other transport ATPases, including N-ethylmaleimide, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and oligomycin, reduced the effect of ATP, whereas ouabain, vanadate, and azide did not. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid also reduced TEA uptake in the presence of ATP. Vinblastine, but not actinomycin D and colchicine (all inhibitors of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport), reduced TEA uptake. The reduction of TEA transport by amiloride and cimetidine was most consistent with competitive inhibition, whereas the inhibition produced by N-ethylmaleimide and vinblastine evidently was not. ATP also stimulated uptake of N'-methylnicotinamide but not that of vinblastine. These studies have identified a previously unrecognized process by which ATP hydrolysis may directly energize the reabsorption of organic cations from the renal tubule lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1482596135,"In many vertebrates, metabolic enzymes have been directly recruited to an additional structural role as crystallins in the eye lens. In some species the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (alpha ENO) attains high concentrations in the lens, as tau-crystallin (tau CRY). A line of transgenic mice was constructed containing the entire duck alpha ENO/tau CRY gene with 5'- and 3'-flanking regions and all introns. Full-sized duck alpha ENO mRNA was expressed in the transgenic mice with the same pattern as the endogenous mouse alpha ENO isozyme. Although there was no evidence for tissue preference, the concentration of enolase increased markedly in transgenic lens as well as in other tissues. In spite of this, transgenic lenses were transparent and the animals were normal in appearance. The increase in enolase levels in the transgenic lens mimics the stepped increase that might occur in the early stages of enzyme crystallin recruitment. These results demonstrate that lens transparency is sufficiently robust to be refractory to some increase in metabolic enzyme concentration without the need for compensatory adaptation."
