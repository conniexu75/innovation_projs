https://openalex.org/W1974399844,"Video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast microscopy has revealed new features of axonal transport in the giant axon of the squid, where no movement had been detected previously by conventional microscopy. The newly discovered dominant feature is vast numbers of ""submicroscopic"" particles, probably 30- to 50-nanometer vesicles and other tubulovesicular elements, moving parallel to linear elements, primarily in the orthograde direction but also in a retrograde direction, at a range of steady velocities up to +/- 5 micrometers per second. Medium (0.2 to 0.6 micrometer) and large (0.8 micrometer) particles move more slowly and more intermittently with a tendency at times to exhibit elastic recoil. The behavior of the smallest particles and the larger particles during actual translocation suggests that the fundamental processes in the mechanisms of organelle movement in axonal transport are not saltatory but continuous."
https://openalex.org/W2036698502,"Development of video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast for light microscopy has permitted study of both orthograde and retrograde fast axonal transport of membranous organelles in the squid giant axon. This process was found to continue normally for hours after the axoplasm was extruded from the giant axon and removed from the confines of the axonal plasma membrane. It is now possible to follow the movements of the full range of membranous organelles (30-nanometer vesicles to 5000-nanometer mitochondria) in a preparation that lacks a plasma membrane or other permeability barrier. This observation demonstrates that the plasma membrane is not required for fast axonal transport and suggests that action potentials are not involved in the regulation of fast transport. Furthermore, the absence of a permeability barrier surrounding the axoplasm makes this an important model for biochemical pharmacological, and physical manipulations of membranous organelle transport."
https://openalex.org/W2036523570,"Infection of hypophysectomized mice with Newcastle disease virus caused a time-dependent increase in corticosterone and interferon production. Prior treatment with dexamethasone completely inhibited the virus-induced elevation in corticosterone concentration, but did not significantly alter the interferon response. Lymphocytes appear to be the most likely source of an adrenocorticotropin-like substance that is responsible for the increased corticosterone, since spleen cells from the virus-infected, but not from control or dexamethasone-treated, hypophysectomized mice showed positive immunofluorescence with antibody to adrenocorticotropin-(1-13 amide). Thus the adrenocorticotropin-like material and interferon appear to be coordinately induced the differentially controlled products of different genes. These findings strongly suggest the existence of a lymphoid-adrenal axis."
https://openalex.org/W1490547051,"Earlier we reported on the presence of a specific phenolic glycolipid (Phenolic Glycolipid-I) in Mycobacterium leprae, and in infected armadillo tissues (Hunter, S. W., and Brennan, P. J. (1981) J. Bacteriol. 147, 728-735). It had an inherent oligosaccharide, composed of 3-O-Me-rhamnose, 2,3-di-O-Me-rhamnose, and 3,6-di-O-Me-glucose, glycosidically linked to the phenol substituent. The structure of the oligosaccharide has now been determined, by partial acid hydrolysis, permethylation, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR as: 3,6-di-O-Me-Glcp(1 beta leads to 4)2,3-di-O-Me-Rhap(1 alpha leads to 2)3-O-Me-Rhap1 alpha leads to phenol (assuming that the glucose substituent is in the D-enantiomeric configuration, and the two methylated rhamnoses are L). Acid hydrolysis of deacylated Phenolic glycolipid-I yielded a phenolic phthiocerol core, and mass spectrometry and proton NMR of the permethylated core suggested the following structure: (formula, see text) Combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed three tetramethyl branched mycocerosic acids, C30, C32 and C34, with molecular weights (as methyl esters) of 466, 494, and 522, respectively. These are esterified to the hydroxyl functions of the branched glycolic chain. Evidence is also presented that the glycolipid is immunologically active, reacting with rabbit antisera to M. leprae and with sera from lepromatous leprosy patients."

https://openalex.org/W1662971183,The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase has been isolated by complementation of a pyk mutant with DNA from a wild type yeast genomic library. Pyruvate kinase enzyme activity is 20-fold higher in the transformant compared to the parental strain and is glucose inducible. The cloned gene has been localized by hybridization of DNA fragments to yeast poly(A+) RNA and by complementation of the mutant defect with select subclones. A DNA sequence of 2885 nucleotides encoding a protein of 499 amino acids is reported. A polypeptide chain of 34 residues of the deduced yeast amino acid sequence closely resembles a peptide sequence at the ADP binding site of bovine muscle pyruvate kinase. The 5' end of the pyruvate kinase mRNA has been mapped and starts within the DNA sequence CAAG at -38 to -27 nucleotides upstream from the first ATG. We note that the sequence PyAAPu in this region appears to be a common consensus site for yeast RNA polymerase II transcriptional starts.

https://openalex.org/W1528262319,"In studies on antinucleolar antibodies in sera from 24 patients with scleroderma, an autoimmune disease, one serum, designated anti-To, contained antibodies against a nucleolar 7-2 ribonucleoprotein and a novel cytoplasmic 8-2 ribonucleoprotein. The 7-2 and 8-2 RNAs are distinct RNAs with a pppG terminus. They are partially conserved between rat and human species and are present in distinct ribonucleoprotein particles. Eight sera contained antibodies that precipitated particles containing nucleolar U3 RNA; these antibodies appear to be directed against preribosomal particles containing U3 ribonucleoprotein, rather than the U3 ribonucleoprotein particles alone. All these ribonucleoproteins required proteins for antigenicity. These antibodies will be of use in studies on the structure and function of these novel small ribonucleoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1874832326,"We have isolated by molecular cloning the gene coding for the alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.1.) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and determined its complete nucleotide sequence. The gene cloned in the plasmid pUB110 using Bacillus subtilis as a host, was contained in a 2.3-kilobase insert. Starting from an ATG initiator codon, an open reading frame comprising a total of 514 amino acids (1542 base pairs) was found within the cloned DNA fragment. The gene region encoding the COOH terminus of alpha-amylase was located by direct COOH-terminal analysis of the purified exoenzyme. The NH2-terminal portion of the gene encodes a 31 amino acid-long signal peptide (Palva, L., Pettersson, R. F., Kalkkinen, N., Lehtovaara, P., Sarvas, M., Soderlund, H., Takkinen, K., and Kaariainen, L. (1981) Gene 15, 43-51). Since the signal peptide is correctly cleaved in the new host, as shown here by direct NH2-terminal sequence analysis, the exoamylase consists of 483 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular weight of 54,778. The reading frame used to deduce the amino acid sequence was found to be correct by comparison with partial amino acid sequence data published previously (Detera, S. D., and Friedberg, F. (1979) Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 14, 364-372; Chung, H., and Friedberg, F. (1980) Biochem. J. 185, 387-395). Several differences between the sequence presented here and the partial ones published previously, however, were found. The nucleotide sequences both 5' and 3' to the alpha-amylase gene revealed palindromic structures including a stretch of six T-residues, suggesting transcription termination signals on both sides of the gene. Thus, it appears that alpha-amylase is translated from a monocistronic mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2062955020,"Starvation of Salmonella typhimurium for folate in six different ways triggers the intracellular accumulation of a novel ribotide, 5-amino 4-imidazole carboxamide riboside 5â€²-triphosphate (ZTP). Numerous other starvations not involving folate do not cause ZTP to accumulate. We propose that ZTP is an alarmone for C-1-folate deficiency and present evidence that it is formed from ZMP, an intermediate in purine biosynthesis. ZMP accumulates rapidly in cells when 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, a substrate for ZMP transformylase, is depleted. We review previous evidence that Z-ribotides may be involved in physiological processes in many types of cells, including sporulation of Bacillus subtilis. We also discuss the implications of ZTP synthesis for chemotherapy and other pharmacological uses of antifolates and analogs of Z-ribosides."
https://openalex.org/W1512281550,"Poly(A) RNA from eel electroplax was used to construct a full length cDNA complementary to calmodulin (CaM) mRNA which was cloned in the PstI site of pBR322 DNA. Recombinant plasmids containing sequences complementary to CaM mRNA were identified by hybridization using a 32P-labeled CaM cDNA (pCM109). Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that the clone from the plasmid pCM116 contains a 5' nontranslated region of 26 nucleotides, the entire coding region, and a 3' nontranslated region of 408 nucleotides. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence is similar to those previously reported for CaM from other species. Comparison between the nucleotide sequence of the functional domains of the protein shows extensive homology between all four domains. pCM116 was utilized to determine and compare the populations of RNA present in different tissues. In eel electroplax, three species of cytoplasmic RNAs at 820, 1100, and 2000 nucleotides hybridize to the cDNA probe. The nucleus contains an additional CaM RNA molecule of 5500 nucleotides which may represent a primary transcript of the calmodulin gene. Sequence analysis of the 3' noncoding region of pCM116 reveals 3 possible polyadenylation sites (AATAAA) at positions 573, 580, and 855. The mRNA of 820 nucleotides was derived by polyadenylation at the first site whereas the mRNA of 1100 nucleotides was derived by poly(A) addition at position 855. These data are compatible with the idea that at least 2 of the 3 CaM mRNAs in eel electroplax tissue are derived from a single nuclear transcript by differential polyadenylation during processing."

https://openalex.org/W2155250395,"Anti-Th serum from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus immunoprecipitates from both human and mouse cell extracts small ribonucleoproteins containing 7-2 RNA, 8-2 RNA, and the Ro RNAs. Human 7-2 RNA, which must be complexed with protein to be antigenic, is about 300 nucleotides long and has mostly pG at its 5' end. A related 7-2 RNA, precipitated by anti-La antibody, gives identical Tl and pancreatic RNase fingerprints, but has more pppG at its 5' end. La 7-2 RNA is, therefore, likely to be a precursor of Th 7-2 RNA. The synthesis of 7-2 RNA in isolated nuclei exhibits a pattern of sensitivity to alpha-amanitin that is characteristic for RNA polymerase III transcription. Thus, 7-2 RNA can be added to the list of mammalian RNA polymerase III transcripts that initially bind the La protein and then become incorporated into other types of antigenic RNP particles."
https://openalex.org/W1540633274,"Myelin basic protein of rabbit brain (Mr = 18,200) was initially freed of the bulk of the nonphosphorylated species (mainly component 1) by Cm-cellulose chromatography at high pH. The remainder of the protein was subjected to peptic digestion at pH 6.00, which resulted in specific, essentially complete cleavage at several bonds (Phe-44--Phe-45, Phe-87--Phe-88, Leu-109--Ser-110, and Leu-151--Phe-152) and partial cleavage at the Tyr-14--Leu-15 bond. Gel filtration of the digest through Sephadex G-25 (fine) yielded three fractions, the first containing primarily peptides 1-44 and 45-87, the second peptides 15-44, 88-109, and 110-151, and the third peptides 1-14 and 152-168. Each fraction was chromatographed on Cm-cellulose at pH 8.2, and the resulting subfractions and partially purified peptides were analyzed for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Materials containing significant amounts of the phosphoamino acids were subsequently chromatographed on Cm-cellulose at pH 4.65, and the analyses for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were repeated. The resulting purified peptic phosphopeptides were identified by amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping. Comparison of the maps with those of the unphosphorylated counterparts located the tryptic phosphopeptides. These were recovered and their identities were established by amino acid analysis. In those cases where the phosphopeptide contained 2 Ser residues, the position of the phosphoserine was established by aminopeptidase M digestion. Five phosphorylation sites were found: Ser-7, Ser-56, Thr-96, Ser-113, and Ser-163. Only a small fraction of these sites was phosphorylated in the total basic protein, with values ranging from about 2 (ser-113) to 6% (Thr-96). With the possible exception of Ser-56, these sites are not the ones that have been reported to be phosphorylated in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1526215777,"Using Mossbauer spectroscopy, we have examined iron-bleomycin in various oxidation states and in complexes with dioxygen or carbon monoxide. Ferrous bleomycin is a high spin ferrous complex. Addition of O2 converts it into an EPR-silent oxygenated complex. Mossbauer studies in strong applied magnetic fields show that oxygenated bleomycin is diamagnetic. At 4.2 K, the quadrupole splitting delta EQ = -2.96 mm/s and the isomer shift delta = 0.16 mm/s suggest that its electronic structure is best described as low spin ferric iron bound to superoxide anion. A single electron reduction yields activated bleomycin, an EPR-active form that still retains oxygen and which is kinetically competent to initiate DNA cleavage. We have produced this complex by exposing ferrous bleomycin to O2 or by reacting ferric bleomycin with H2O2. The Mossbauer spectra give convincing evidence that the iron of activated bleomycin is low spin ferric. The decay of activated bleomycin yields low spin ferric bleomycin, a complex with Mossbauer parameters nearly identical with those reported for ferric cytochrome P-450. Although iron bleomycin does not have a polyaromatic structure like heme, many features of its electronic structure at the iron are very similar to those produced by the sulfur-coordinated heme iron of ferric cytochrome P-450, a protein that catalyzes a similar oxygen-dependent reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484921247,"Using several biochemical approaches, we have characterized the relatedness of the various glycoprotein components of the bovine epidermal desomosome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of purified epidermal desmosomes reveals 12 proteins, of which 8 are glycosylated. Analysis with monoclonal antibodies indicates that the 8 glycoproteins comprise 3 antigenically distinct protein families. Members of the highest molecular weight glycoprotein family (a triplet of Mr = 150,000) were not distinguishable by partial proteolytic peptide mapping. At least 6 different monoclonal antibodies have been identified that recognize unique antigenic determinants shared by these proteins. Members of a 97,000-118,000-dalton glycoprotein family (about 4 bands) generate very similar but not identical partial proteolytic peptide maps. At least 3 different monoclonal antibodies have been identified that recognize unique antigenic determinants shared by these proteins. A Mr = 22,000 glycoprotein is immunologically unrelated to either of the high molecular weight glycoprotein families. Lectin-binding profiles indicate that within each immunologically related family the glycoproteins are similar in their oligosaccharide composition. Some lectins distinguish among the families. These glycoproteins probably mediate the specific intercellular recognition and adhesive functions of the desmosome."
https://openalex.org/W2094595216,"An influenza A reassortant virus that contained the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of a virulent human virus, A/Udorn/72 (H3N2), and the six other influenza A virus genome segments from an avirulent avian virus, A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 (H2N2), was evaluated for its level of replication is squirrel monkeys and hamsters. In monkeys, the reassortant virus was as attenuated and as restricted in its level of replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract as its avian influenza virus parent. Nonetheless, infection with the reassortant induced significant resistant to challenge with virulent human influenza virus. In hamsters, the reassortant virus replicated to a level intermediate between that of its parents. These findings suggest that the nonsurface antigen genes of the avian parental virus are the primary determinants of restriction of replication of the reassortant virus in monkeys. Attenuation of the reassortant virus for primates is achieved by inefficient functioning of the avian influenza genes in primate cells, while antigenic specificity of the human influenza virus is provided by the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes derived from the human virus. This approach could lead to the development of a live influenza A virus vaccine that is attenuated for man if the avian influenza genes are similarly restricted in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1596622788,"The gene for the MspI modification enzyme from Moraxella was cloned in Escherichia coli using the plasmid vector pBR322. Selection of transformants carrying the gene was based on the resistance of the modified plasmid encoding the enzyme to cleavage by MspI. Both chromosomal and plasmid DNA were modified in the selected clones. None of the clones obtained produced the cognate restriction enzyme which suggests that in this system the genes for the restriction enzyme and methylase are not closely linked. Crude cell extracts prepared from the recombinant strains, but not the host (E. coli HB101), contain an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase specific for the MspI recognition site, CCGG. Production of the enzyme is 3-4-fold greater in the transformants than in the original Moraxella strain. 5-Methylcytosine was identified as the product of the reaction chromatographically. The outer cytosine of the recognition sequence, *CCGG, was shown to be the site of methylation by DNA-sequencing methods. This modification blocks cleavage by both MspI and its isoschizomer HpaII. HpaII, but not MspI, is able to cleave the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated substrate. The relevance of these results to the use of MspI and HpaII to analyze patterns of methylation in genomic DNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1966166167,"The transforming gene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) is a phosphoprotein encoded by combined viral and cellular sequences. Previous work has shown the existence of a serologically crossreactive normal cellular phosphoprotein called NCP150. We have utilized two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis to compare the structures of NCP150 and wild-type and mutant forms of the A-MuLV protein labeled in vivo with 32P-orthophosphate. This analysis demonstrated clear homology between NCP150 and wild-type A-MuLV protein, but a number of phosphorylation differences were seen. Among them, two specific tyrosine phosphorylations present in all transformation-competent Abelson proteins were not observed in NCP150. No other phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were detected. In addition, transformation-defective mutants isolated from either the P120 or P160 wild-type strain lack phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Double-infection studies with such transformation-defective and transformation-competent A-MuLV strains show that Abelson viral proteins may be substrates for their own tyrosine-specific kinase activity in vivo. These observations suggest that the phosphotyrosine kinase activity of the abl region may be controlled, and may function, differently in its viral and cellular forms."
https://openalex.org/W1542995590,"Friend erythroleukemic cells contain both type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases. The amounts of type I and type II regulatory subunits (R I and R II) were established by a combination of the equilibrium binding of cyclic [3H]AMP and specific immunoprecipitation. In control cells the total specific cAMP-binding activity was 9.8 pmol/mg of cytosolic protein and the ratio of R II to R I was 1.2. After the induction of differentiation by growth in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, the total cAMP-binding capacity doubled, but larger and opposing changes in R II and R I levels were observed. The concentration of R II tripled (to 16.6 pmol/mg) while R I content (1.5 pmol/mg) declined to one-third of the control cell level, resulting in an R II:R I value of 11.1. Treatment of Friend cells with 0.5 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) and 0.2 mM methylisobutyl xanthine for 2 days did not stimulate cell differentiation. however, the cAMP-binding capacity nearly doubled and the cells accumulated a high level of R II while R I declined. This resulted in a distribution of R subunits closely resembling that of differentiated cells. Cyclic AMP-stimulated histone kinase activity increased in proportion to cAMP-binding activity during differentiation; no such increase was seen following 8-Br-cAMP treatment. Fractionation of cytosolic extracts by DEAE-cellulose chromatography revealed that both R I and R II were fully associated with the catalytic subunit (C) of protein kinase before and after differentiation. In extracts of 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells all of R I and 40 to 60% of R II were not associated with C. Free R II isolated from these cells was indistinguishable from RII present in holoenzyme. Thus, erythroid differentiation of Friend cells results in a coordinate accumulation of R II and C subunits as well as a decline in R I content. In contrast, chronic exposure to 8-Br-cAMP elicits similar changes in R subunit levels but disrupts the coordinate regulation of R and C content."
https://openalex.org/W1486421330,"The binding of the intermediate filament protein vimentin to a variety of naturally occurring RNAs and DNAs was studied. The relative capacities of the various nucleic acids to associate with pure [3H]vimentin were determined in competition experiments with 28 S rRNA from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The reaction products were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation at low ionic strength and in the presence of EDTA. Under these ionic conditions, vimentin reacted preferentially with single-stranded nucleic acids, particularly with those of high (G + C) content. The vimentin binding potentials of single-stranded RNAs and DNAs were largely comparable. However, when the concentrations of mono- and divalent cations were raised to physiological and higher values, only single-stranded DNA retained its vimentin binding capacity. With increasing KCl concentrations at 0 to 1 mM Mg2+, increasing amounts of vimentin were detected in complexes which sedimented considerably faster than the bulk of the DNA, suggesting cooperative binding of vimentin. The salt optimum of this cooperativity was at 200 mM KCl. Thus, the capability of vimentin to discriminate between single-stranded RNA and DNA under physiological ionic conditions points to specificity of the interaction of vimentin with nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1542368139,"Protein synthesis was inhibited in one line of interferon-treated HeLa cells (line 2) upon infection with reovirus, but not in different HeLa cells (line 1) treated in the same way. The inhibition resulted in polysome runoff, suggesting that it was due to an impairment of peptide chain initiation. Interferon induces the synthesis of a protein kinase, which is activated in cell-free systems by double-stranded RNA and phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, thus inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis. Therefore, we measured the level of this protein kinase in extracts prepared from the two HeLa cell lines. Cells of line 2 showed about 3-4 times more protein kinase activity than cells of line 1. The inhibition of protein synthesis upon infection with reovirus was correlated with an increased phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 in interferon-treated cells labeled with 32P. The kinase was presumably activated in intact cells by viral double-stranded RNA, but this activation resulted in inhibition of protein synthesis only in cells with elevated levels of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1521861424,"Enhancement between two monoclonal antibodies directed against the same antigen is when binding of one antibody, the enhancing antibody, increases the measured binding of the other antibody. This phenomenon has been observed for monoclonal antibodies against a variety of molecules including histocompatibility antigens. The mechanism of enhancement for monoclonal antibodies against HLA-A2 has been studied with purified preparations of IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab. Enhancement was only observed between antibodies against different antigenic sites. It requires bivalency of both antibody species and involves formation of stable, cyclic, tetramolecular complexes consisting of two antigen molecules and one each of the two antibody molecules. Conformational changes of either antigen or antibody do not appear to be important in this system, nor is the formation of combinatorial determinants between antigen and enhancing antibody. The enhancing properties of the antibodies studied are adequately explained in terms of their affinities and association and dissociation constants."

https://openalex.org/W1514044987,"In order to clarify the role of bleomycin functional groups in action mechanism, the metal-binding, dioxygen activation, and DNA cleavage of several synthetic analogues and biosynthetic intermediates of bleomycin have been investigated. The present results support that 1) the beta-aminoalaninepyrimidine-beta-hydroxyhistidine portion of the bleomycin molecule substantially participates in the Fe(II) and dioxygen interactions, 2) the transposition of the pyrimidine (or pyridine) and imidazole groups in the Fe(II)-coordination is essential for the effective binding and activation of molecular oxygen by the bleomycin ligands, and 3) the gulose-mannose moiety plays an important role as an environmental factor for the efficient dioxygen reduction and DNA cleavage, although the sugar portion does not contribute significantly to the nucleotide specificity in the DNA strand scission. Certain oligopeptides are able to mimic the metal-binding and dioxygen activation by bleomycin, but not induce the effective DNA cleavage. Probably, the bithiazole DNA interaction site of bleomycin delivers the iron/dioxygen chemistry to particularly the DNA (formula, see text) nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1603042576,"Starting with an enriched alpha-amylase mRNA preparation, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription and was cloned at the Pst I site of plasmid vector pBR322 by the G-C tailing procedure. Clones containing alpha-amylase cDNA sequences were identified among the recombinant clones by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA followed by immunoprecipitation of translation products with antiserum to alpha-amylase. The longest alpha-amylase cDNA clone isolated was 630 base pairs long and was characterized by digestion with restriction enzymes. Using this clone as a labeled nucleic acid hybridization probe, we observed that multiple bands of DNA with alpha-amylase sequences were present in restriction digests of barley embryo DNA. This indicates the presence of a family of barley alpha-amylase or alpha-amylase-like genes. Analysis of RNA blots with the cloned alpha-amylase hybridization probe indicated that alpha-amylase mRNA is synthesized de novo in barley aleurones after addition of gibberellic acid. The gibberellic acid-induced accumulation of alpha-amylase mRNA is blocked by cycloheximide which suggests the requirement of a newly synthesized protein factor for efficient expression of alpha-amylase gene."

https://openalex.org/W1501557066,"The transport inhibitor, eosin 5-maleimide, reacts specifically at an external site on the membrane-bound domain of the anion exchange protein, Band 3, in the human erythrocyte membrane. The fluorescence of eosin-labeled resealed ghosts or intact cells was found to be resistant to quenching by CsCl, whereas the fluorescence of labeled inside-out vesicles was quenched by about 27% at saturating CsCl concentrations. Since both Cs+ and eosin maleimide were found to be impermeable to the red cell membrane and the vesicles were sealed, these results indicate that after binding of the eosin maleimide at the external transport site of Band 3, the inhibitor becomes exposed to ions on the cytoplasmic surface. The lifetime of the bound eosin maleimide was determined to be 3 ns both in the absence and presence of CsCl, suggesting that quenching is by a static rather than a dynamic (collisional) mechanism. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of erythrocyte membranes was also investigated using anion transport inhibitors which do not appreciably absorb light at 335 nm. Eosin maleimide caused a 25% quenching and 4,4'-dibenzamidodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) caused a 7% quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. Covalent labeling of red cells by either eosin maleimide or BIDS (4-benzamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) caused an increase in the susceptibility of membrane tryptophan fluorescence to quenching by CsCl. The quenching constant was similar to that for the quenching of eosin fluorescence and was unperturbed by the presence of 0.5 M KCl. Neither NaCl nor Na citrate produced a large change in the relative magnitude of the tryptophan emission. The tryptophan residues that can be quenched by CsCl appear to be different from those quenched by eosin or BIDS and are possibly located on the cytoplasmic domain of Band 3. The results suggest that a conformational change in the Band 3 protein accompanies the binding of certain anion transport inhibitors to the external transport site of Band 3 and that the inhibitors become exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the red cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1483347364,"A DNA-directed coupled transcription-translation system has been developed in cell-free extracts from the facultative phototroph, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. The in vitro protein-synthesizing system was active when prepared from either chemoheterotrophically or photoheterotrophically grown cells. Optimal activity was dependent upon: use of extracts prepared freshly from early exponential phase cells, the method of cell breakage, and the length of preincubation of the extract (S-30), as well as the concentrations of S-30, template, and cations. The R. sphaeroides cell-free system was compared to one prepared from Escherichia coli. DNA templates tested included R. sphaeroides phage RS1 DNA and E. coli phages T4 and T7 DNA, as well as plasmids RSF1010, pBR322, pSL25 (a pBR322 derivative), and a chimeric plasmid of pSL25 and RSF1010. One RNA template, phage R17, was also employed to test translational fidelity. Transcriptional-translational specificity was observed between R. sphaeroides and E. coli and these observations are discussed in terms of differential gene expression among phylogenetically distinct groups of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1599588465,"The in vivo kinetics of hepatic clearance of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid and 125I-asialofetuin was determined with a portal vein injection technique in barbiturate-anesthetized rats. Nonlinear regression analyses of saturation data gave the following parameters for asialo-orosomucoid, Km = 0.26 +/- 0.06 mg/ml, Vmax = 320 +/- 70 micrograms/min/g, and for asialofetuin, Km = 0.32 +/- 0.07 mg/ml, Vmax = 240 +/- 40 micrograms/min/g. Unlabeled asialofetuin inhibited the clearance of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid with a Ki = 0.25 +/- 0.04 mg/ml. Based on a model assuming that in vivo receptor concentration much greater than receptor KD, then the maximal binding capacity of the external surface of liver cells in vivo for asialo-orosomucoid is 2Km or 520 micrograms/ml or 52 micrograms/g of liver, assuming the liver interstitial space is 0.1 ml/g. Our estimate of in vivo binding capacity approximates in vitro estimates of total hepatic binding capacity, but is 10-fold greater than in vitro estimates of binding capacity on the external surface of liver cells. These results suggest the large majority of asialoglycoprotein receptors are located on the external surface of liver cells. The saturability of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid clearance was also demonstrated with a portal vein double bolus technique, wherein the portal injection of 20-1000 micrograms of unlabeled asialo-orosomucoid was followed 30 s later by the portal injection of tracer. Maximal inhibition of uptake was obtained with a portal vein injection of greater than or equal to 500 micrograms of asialo-orosomucoid. The specific extraction of the 125I-asialo-orosomucoid, which was near zero shortly after a 400-micrograms loading dose, gradually increased toward normal levels with a t1/2 of 21 min. This t1/2 may represent the in vivo rate of receptor recycling, since the gradual increase in unoccupied receptor sites is consistent with the model of receptor binding, internalization, and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1647939231,"The ligand-binding activity of the galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific receptor (Gal/GalNAc receptor) present on the surface of hepatocytes can be modulated under a number of conditions in the intact cell. The carboxylic acid ionophores monensin and nigericin inhibit endocytosis by the Gal/GalNAc receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. Monensin at a concentration of 100 microM reduces the number of binding sites for asialo-orosomucoid and a tri-branched glycopeptide (F2) 5-10-fold; however, the number of Gal/GalNAc receptor subunits detected at the cell surface by a competitive radioimmunoassay and by immunoprecipitation of surface labeled receptor is not significantly altered. Replacement of NaCl in the medium with either N-methylglucamine or sorbitol to isotonicity also inhibits binding and endocytosis. The monensin, nigericin, N-methylglucamine, and sorbitol treatments have in common the ability to alkalinize the cytosol of the hepatocyte. None of these agents has any effect on binding by the isolated Gal/GalNAc receptor nor is the intracellular pH shift of such a magnitude that it would alter binding by the isolated Gal/GalNAc receptor. This has led us to conclude that the ligand-binding properties of the Gal/GalNAc receptor at the cell surface can be modulated in a transmembrane fashion by events other than those involving pH or Ca2+ regulation at the ligand-binding site itself. Such transmembrane modulation of ligand binding by the Gal/GalNAc receptor may provide a rapid and efficient mechanism for mediating ligand release and immediate return of the receptor to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1566630225,"The long term effect of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on the synthesis of adrenodoxin in bovine adrenocortical cells was investigated. Primary, confluent monolayer cultures of adult bovine adrenocortical cells were incubated in the presence or absence of ACTH (10(-6) M) for periods up to 72 h. The amount of adrenodoxin precursor synthesized in a cell-free translation system programmed with RNA isolated from ACTH-treated cells increased to approximately 3 times the control level by 36 h. Similarly, ACTH increased the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into mature adrenodoxin in radiolabeled adrenocortical cells, an effect that was maximal 36 h after initiation of ACTH treatment. At longer times (48-72 h), the stimulatory effect of ACTH was not maintained, and adrenodoxin synthesis in both radiolabeled cells and cell-free translation systems declined to control levels. The content of adrenodoxin in cells treated with ACTH for 36 h, as measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, was approximately twice that in control cells. The results indicate that ACTH induces the synthesis of adrenodoxin in bovine adrenocortical cells. Based on the present results as well as those previously reported with respect to the induction of cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 by ACTH (DuBois, R. N., Simpson, E. R., Kramer, R. E., and Waterman, M. R. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7000-7005), it is proposed that the synthesis of the mitochondrial components of the adrenocortical steroid hydroxylase system is controlled by ACTH in a coordinate fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1518684746,"Hypophysectomy completely abolishes and thyroidectomy results in a 90% reduction in the hepatic content of alpha 2u-globulin and its mRNA in the male rat. Thyroid hormone is also known to be required for the synthesis and secretion of pituitary growth hormone. In the hypothyroid rat either thyroxine or growth hormone was found to increase the activity and number of sequences of the mRNA for alpha 2u-globulin (measured by translational assay and hybridizational analysis with a cloned cDNA probe) to the euthyroid level. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with a hormone combination containing growth hormone but not thyroxine increased the hepatic level of the mRNA for alpha 2u-globulin to that of normal animals. From these results we conclude that thyroxine indirectly influences the hepatic concentration of the mRNA for alpha 2u-globulin through its effect on pituitary growth hormone. Although administration of growth hormone to hypothyroid animals raised the hepatic concentration of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA to the euthyroid level, synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin remained low (50% of the normal). Complete recovery of alpha 2u-globulin synthesis required thyroxine. Therefore, in addition to an indirect effect on the hepatic level of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA, thyroxine also directly influences the synthesis of this protein. This direct effect of thyroxine on alpha 2u-globulin synthesis seems to be exerted at a step distal to the formation of mature mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1584626186,"The antigenic determinants recognized by two monoclonal antibodies were mapped on LamB, an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli. The procedure consisted of performing immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts of strains which produced truncated fragments of LamB, either in a free form (deletion and nonsense mutants) or fused to another polypeptide (malK-lamB and lamB-lacZ fusion strains). The conclusion is that the two antigenic determinants are located within 70 residues from the COOH-terminal end of LamB, which contains a total of 421 amino acids. Since these two antigenic sites were previously demonstrated to be exposed at the cell surface, it follows that a COOH-terminal portion of LamB must be located on the outer surface of the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1541892611,"We investigated the apparent requirement that Q beta replicase must add a nontemplated adenosine to the 3' end of newly synthesized RNA strands. We used abbreviated MDV-1 (+)-RNA templates that lacked either 62 or 63 nucleotides at their 5' end in Q beta replicase reactions. The MDV-1 (-)-RNA strands synthesized from these abbreviated (+)-strand templates were released from the replication complex, yet they did not possess a nontemplated 3'-terminal adenosine. These results imply that, despite observations that all naturally occurring RNAs synthesized by Q beta replicase possess a nontemplated 3'-adenosine, the addition of an extra adenosine is not an obligate step for the release of completed strands. Since the abbreviated templates lacked a normal 5' end, it is probable that a particular sequence at the 5' end of the template is required for terminal adenylation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1564877589,"Cell-free translations of ovine pituitary RNA were used to examine the amount of alpha subunit synthesized in the presence and absence of physiological levels of gonadal steroids. Two animal groups were used: 1) no feedback-castrate ewes exhibiting high serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 2) negative feedback-castrate ewes treated with estradiol and progesterone which suppressed LH and FSH secretion. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from the pituitaries, translated in a wheat germ cell-free system, and alpha subunit identified by specific immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Low amounts of alpha subunit (0.06% of total incorporated trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cpm) were seen in steroid-treated castrate ewes which also exhibited low serum LH and FSH concentrations. The amount of alpha translated by pituitary RNA from untreated castrates was significantly higher than those amounts from the steroid-treated castrates (p less than 0.02). The decreased amount of translated alpha subunit in steroid-treated castrates was probably not due to unique in vitro translation properties since the isotope incorporated/microgram of RNA and the amount of translated growth hormone and prolactin were similar for all RNAs. The results obtained from this animal model system suggest that the chronic negative feedback action of gonadal steroids on the gonadotropic hormones is effected, in part, via inhibition of synthesis of the alpha subunit of LH and FSH."
https://openalex.org/W1557694007,"The regulation of the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine aminotransferase, by estrogen and triiodothyronine (T3) in rat kidney was examined using a cloned cDNA probe and in vitro translation of poly(A+) RNA. After a single, acute dose of either 17 beta-estradiol or T3, the rate of enzyme synthesis and the levels of translatable and hybridizable ornithine aminotransferase mRNA all increase in parallel. Levels of hybridizable mRNA were estimated by hybridization of randomly 32P-labeled RNA to filter-bound plasmid DNA. Maximal levels of induction by estrogen and T3 were about 15- and 3-fold, respectively. Lag times of at least 5 h and less than 3 h were observed for induction by T3 and estrogen. T3 and estrogen exert a synergistic effect in increasing ornithine aminotransferase mRNA levels. 16 h after T3 administration and 24 h after estrogen administration, a 1.6- and 13-fold increase in mRNA levels were observed. Both of these treatments in combination for the indicated time periods resulted in a 21-fold increase in ornithine aminotransferase mRNA. From the mRNA accumulation curves, half-lives of 10 to 14 h and 12 to 16 h were estimated for the mRNA after estrogen and T3 induction, respectively. These similar half-lives suggest that an increase in the rate of mRNA production is primarily responsible for the induction observed after estrogen administration."

https://openalex.org/W1502168554,"Total RNA was isolated from parietal endoderm cells of 131/2-day mouse embryos that synthesize large amounts of type IV procollagen. In vitro translation of this RNA in the reticulocyte lysate supplemented with a ribonuclease inhibitor yielded two equally prominent polypeptides of Mr = 165,000 and 168,000, immunoprecipitable with anti-mouse type IV collagen serum. The Mr = 165,000 polypeptide was shown by one-dimensional peptide mapping to represent an unmodified chain of type IV procollagen. The Mr = 168,000 polypeptide, the in vitro synthesis of which was barely detectable in the absence of a ribonuclease inhibitor, most likely represents the other genetically distinct chain of type IV procollagen. Similar results to those described were also obtained using poly(A) + RNA prepared from murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells induced to differentiate in vitro into parietal endoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1536787738,"Two murine monoclonal antibodies (H5 and B6) generated against bovine heart type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were shown to cross-react equally well with the homologous subunit from porcine heart. The antibodies demonstrated specificity for only the type II regulatory subunit and showed negligible cross-reactivity with the type I regulatory subunit, the catalytic subunit, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Following limited proteolysis of type II regulatory subunit with chymotrypsin, the H5 monoclonal antibody was shown to cross-react with the Mr = 37,000 cAMP-binding domain corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. To more specifically localize the antigenic sites, the porcine type II regulatory subunit was carboxymethylated and cleaved with cyanogen bromide. Both monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with the NH2-terminal CNBr peptide, and this peptide demonstrated affinities similar to native bovine type II regulatory subunit in competitive displacement radioimmunoassays. Tryptic cleavage of this CNBr fragment destroyed all antigenicity for both monoclonal antibodies, whereas antigenicity was retained following chymotryptic digestion. A single major immunoreactive chymotryptic fragment that cross-reacted with H5 was isolated by gel filtration and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. this peptide retained the complete antigenic site and had the following sequence: Asn-Pro-Asp-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Asp-Thr-Asp-Pro-Arg-Val-Ile-His-Pro-Lys-Thr-Asp-Gl n. This antigenic site was localized just beyond the major site of autophosphorylation, approximately a third of the distance from the NH2-terminal end of the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1538172021,"Binding sites having the characteristics of receptors for activated alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) have been solubilized with octyl-beta-D-glucoside from fibroblast membranes. When the detergent was removed by dialysis, the resulting insoluble extract was shown to bind 125I-alpha 2M specifically. Analysis of the binding data using a nonlinear curve-fitting program suggests that the solubilized preparation contains two classes of binding sites (KD = 0.34 nM and KD = 104 nM). Membranes or solubilized extracts from KB cells which lack alpha 2M binding sites did not specifically bind 125I-alpha 2M. The solubilized binding sites from fibroblasts were inactivated by boiling and trypsin treatment, and required Ca+2 for maximal binding. In addition, the high affinity binding of 125I-alpha 2M to the solubilized receptor was inhibited by bacitracin and by alpha-bromo-5-iodo-4-hydroxy-3-nitroacetophenone, two agents which interfere with the uptake of alpha 2M in cultured fibroblasts. Using a combination of ion exchange and gel permeation chromatography, we have purified the high affinity alpha 2M binding site approximately 100-fold from membrane derived from NIH-3T3 (spontaneously transformed) fibroblasts grown as tumors in mice. The receptor is apparently an acidic protein and the receptor octyl-beta-D-glucoside complex has a Stokes radius of 45-50 A as measured by gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1538126745,"A fraction of the viral mRNA synthesized in interferon-treated HeLa cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacks the 7-methyl group in the 5'-terminal guanosine of the cap; this mRNA is not associated with polyribosomes and does not bind to ribosomes in an assay for initiation of protein synthesis (de Ferra, F., and Baglioni, C. (1981) Virology 112, 426-435). To establish whether this defect in methylation is due to changes in the level of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and of its competitive inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), we measured the concentration of these compounds in HeLa cells treated with interferon. An increase in both AdoMet and AdoHcy was detected 3 to 6 h after addition of interferon. The level of these compounds increased gradually and in proportion to the interferon concentration used. With 125 reference units/ml of beta interferon, for example, the AdoHcy concentration increased more than 3-fold and that of AdoMet about 1.5-fold with a consequent change in the AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio. An increased AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio was also found in HeLa cells treated with pure alpha 2 interferon produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA techniques. When the methylation of VSV mRNA was measured in assays carried out with permeabilized virions at the AdoHcy and AdoMet concentrations found in interferon-treated cells, a preferential inhibition of the viral (guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity was observed. Such an inhibition may account for the synthesis of VSV mRNA lacking the 7-methyl group of guanosine in the cap."
https://openalex.org/W1654984422,"Type V collagen was first isolated in 1976; there is still controversy as to how many molecular species of type V collagen exist. Although its structural and functional roles remain unclear, reports of changes in the relative amount of type V collagen from that present in normal tissue have been reported in such diverse pathologic conditions as atherosclerotic aortas, prolapsed mitral valves, and fibrotic lungs. Methods for quantitating type V collagen relative to other collagens have consisted of solubilizing the collagen with pepsin and then analyzing the ratios of the intact chains by gel electrophoresis or by column chromatography. In tissues in which only a small percentage of the total collagen can be solubilized by pepsin, such analyses may not accurately reflect changes in the total collagen present. In this report, a method for quantitating type V collagen relative to types I and III collagens based on CNBr peptide mapping is presented. CNBr solubilizes virtually all the collagen present in any tissue. The method is applied to a model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. It was found that type I collagen increased relative to types III and V collagens, which seemed to remain at values comparable to those observed in lungs from control (normal) rats, both in terms of newly synthesized collagen (collagen synthesized by lung minces during 4 h in culture) and total unlabeled lung collagen (collagen synthesized during the life of the animal)."

https://openalex.org/W1503472805,Portions of at least nine distinct rat amylase genes or pseudogenes have been isolated. Cloned rat genomic DNA fragments containing complete or major portions of seven of these have been examined by heteroduplex analysis and fall within two separate groups based on their degree of homology. Four gene sequences comprising one of these groups are closely related to pancreatic amylase mRNA. The other group shows significant nonhomology to both pancreatic and parotid amylase cDNAs and may represent an additional gene type(s). All of the cloned amylase gene sequences are found in rat genomic DNA. Additional amylase sequences which have not yet been cloned are also detected. Comparison of DNA from individual Sprague-Dawley rats by Southern blotting techniques indicates allelic variation at multiple amylase loci.
