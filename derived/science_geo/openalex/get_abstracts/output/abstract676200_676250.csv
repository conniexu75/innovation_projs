https://openalex.org/W3176932752,"The development of cancer is intimately associated with genetic abnormalities that target proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In human haematological malignancies, recurrent chromosomal translocation of nucleoporin (NUP98 or NUP214) generates an aberrant chimera that invariably retains the nucleoporin IDR—tandemly dispersed repeats of phenylalanine and glycine residues1,2. However, how unstructured IDRs contribute to oncogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that IDRs contained within NUP98–HOXA9, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor chimera recurrently detected in leukaemias1,2, are essential for establishing liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) puncta of chimera and for inducing leukaemic transformation. Notably, LLPS of NUP98–HOXA9 not only promotes chromatin occupancy of chimera transcription factors, but also is required for the formation of a broad ‘super-enhancer’-like binding pattern typically seen at leukaemogenic genes, which potentiates transcriptional activation. An artificial HOX chimera, created by replacing the phenylalanine and glycine repeats of NUP98 with an unrelated LLPS-forming IDR of the FUS protein3,4, had similar enhancing effects on the genome-wide binding and target gene activation of the chimera. Deeply sequenced Hi-C revealed that phase-separated NUP98–HOXA9 induces CTCF-independent chromatin loops that are enriched at proto-oncogenes. Together, this report describes a proof-of-principle example in which cancer acquires mutation to establish oncogenic transcription factor condensates via phase separation, which simultaneously enhances their genomic targeting and induces organization of aberrant three-dimensional chromatin structure during tumourous transformation. As LLPS-competent molecules are frequently implicated in diseases1,2,4–7, this mechanism can potentially be generalized to many malignant and pathological settings. The NUP98–HOXA9 oncogenic fusion protein found in leukaemia undergoes phase separation in the nucleus, which helps to promote activation of leukaemic genes and to establish aberrant chromatin looping."

Because rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do not contribute to development of treatment-induced emergent resistance. To this end, we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence of virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients treated with the two-antibody combination REGEN-COV, as well as in preclinical in vitro studies using single, dual, or triple antibody combinations, and in hamster in vivo studies using REGEN-COV or single monoclonal antibody treatments. Our study demonstrates that the combination of non-competing antibodies in REGEN-COV provides protection against all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest and also protects against emergence of new variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical setting."

Flying alone and often over great distances, they use various directional cues including, crucially, a light-dependent magnetic compass2,3. The mechanism of this compass has been suggested to rely on the quantum spin dynamics of photoinduced radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins located in the retinas of the birds4-7. Here we show that the photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula) is magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and pigeon (Columba livia). Site-specific mutations of ErCRY4 reveal the roles of four successive flavin-tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and in stabilizing potential signalling states in a way that could enable sensing and signalling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds."
https://openalex.org/W3176831639,"All biological pumps are autonomous catalysts; they maintain the out-of-equilibrium conditions of the cell by harnessing the energy released from their catalytic decomposition of a chemical fuel1-3. A number of artificial molecular pumps have been reported to date4, but they are all either fuelled by light5-10 or require repetitive sequential additions of reagents or varying of an electric potential during each cycle to operate11-16. Here we describe an autonomous chemically fuelled information ratchet17-20 that in the presence of fuel continuously pumps crown ether macrocycles from bulk solution onto a molecular axle without the need for further intervention. The mechanism uses the position of a crown ether on an axle both to promote barrier attachment behind it upon threading and to suppress subsequent barrier removal until the ring has migrated to a catchment region. Tuning the dynamics of both processes20,21 enables the molecular machine22-25 to pump macrocycles continuously from their lowest energy state in bulk solution to a higher energy state on the axle. The ratchet action is experimentally demonstrated by the progressive pumping of up to three macrocycles onto the axle from bulk solution under conditions where barrier formation and removal occur continuously. The out-of-equilibrium [n]rotaxanes (characterized with n up to 4) are maintained for as long as unreacted fuel is present, after which the rings slowly de-thread. The use of catalysis to drive artificial molecular pumps opens up new opportunities, insights and research directions at the interface of catalysis and molecular machinery."
https://openalex.org/W3175680574,"The key to advancing lithium-ion battery technology-in particular, fast charging-is the ability to follow and understand the dynamic processes occurring in functioning materials under realistic conditions, in real time and on the nano- to mesoscale. Imaging of lithium-ion dynamics during battery operation (operando imaging) at present requires sophisticated synchrotron X-ray1-7 or electron microscopy8,9 techniques, which do not lend themselves to high-throughput material screening. This limits rapid and rational materials improvements. Here we introduce a simple laboratory-based, optical interferometric scattering microscope10-13 to resolve nanoscopic lithium-ion dynamics in battery materials, and apply it to follow cycling of individual particles of the archetypal cathode material14,15, LixCoO2, within an electrode matrix. We visualize the insulator-to-metal, solid solution and lithium ordering phase transitions directly and determine rates of lithium diffusion at the single-particle level, identifying different mechanisms on charge and discharge. Finally, we capture the dynamic formation of domain boundaries between different crystal orientations associated with the monoclinic lattice distortion at the Li0.5CoO2 composition16. The high-throughput nature of our methodology allows many particles to be sampled across the entire electrode and in future will enable exploration of the role of dislocations, morphologies and cycling rate on battery degradation. The generality of our imaging concept means that it can be applied to study any battery electrode, and more broadly, systems where the transport of ions is associated with electronic or structural changes. Such systems include nanoionic films, ionic conducting polymers, photocatalytic materials and memristors."
https://openalex.org/W3177080894,"Diet is a major factor that shapes the gut microbiome1, but the consequences of diet-induced changes in the microbiome for host pathophysiology remain poorly understood. We conducted a randomized human intervention study using a very-low-calorie diet (NCT01105143). Although metabolic health was improved, severe calorie restriction led to a decrease in bacterial abundance and restructuring of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of post-diet microbiota to mice decreased their body weight and adiposity relative to mice that received pre-diet microbiota. Weight loss was associated with impaired nutrient absorption and enrichment in Clostridioides difficile, which was consistent with a decrease in bile acids and was sufficient to replicate metabolic phenotypes in mice in a toxin-dependent manner. These results emphasize the importance of diet–microbiome interactions in modulating host energy balance and the need to understand the role of diet in the interplay between pathogenic and beneficial symbionts. Severe caloric restriction in humans leads to reversible changes in the gut microbiota that promote weight loss and the expansion of an enteric pathogen in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3177362856,"Although SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are promising therapeutics against COVID-19, little is known about their mechanism(s) of action or effective dosing windows. We report the generation and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, isolated from a convalescent patient. Antibody-mediated neutralization occurs via an epitope within the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SC31 exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in multiple animal models. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, treatment with SC31 greatly reduced viral loads and attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, a comparison of the efficacies of SC31 and its Fc-null LALA variant revealed that the optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires Fc-mediated effector functions that promote IFNγ-driven anti-viral immune responses, in addition to its neutralization ability. A dose-dependent efficacy of SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when administered before viral-induced lung inflammatory responses. In addition, antibody-dependent enhancement was not observed even when infected mice were treated with SC31 at sub-therapeutic doses. In SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, SC31 treatment significantly prevented weight loss, reduced viral loads, and attenuated the histopathology of the lungs. In rhesus macaques, the therapeutic potential of SC31 was evidenced through the reduction of viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts to undetectable levels. Together, the results of our preclinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of SC31 in three different models and its potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic candidate."
https://openalex.org/W3163704450,"As COVID-19 dramatically changes human social life, restrictive lockdown periods to slow the spread of the virus have been suggested to particularly affect the psychological well-being of children and their families. To capture lockdown-related effects on a large scale, the present study used an online questionnaire completed by parents of 3-10-year-olds during the most restrictive lockdown period in Germany thus far ( N = 2,672). Parents reported their stress level, their child’s well-being, and their child’s problem behaviors among others. Results showed that most parents and children experienced lockdown-related stress. Concerning children, not being able to meet with friends and family members outside the household emerged as the primary challenge. Older children (7–10 years) evidenced more emotional symptoms as well as less conduct problems and hyperactivity than younger children (3–6 years). Children’s own and their parents’ stress level, the degree to which children missed other children, and children’s age all showed to be negatively related to children’s general life satisfaction. Single parenthood and being an only child were associated with higher levels of child problems. Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychological well-being of children and their families during governmental lockdown measures, as well as on relations between children’s coping and demographic background. They have implications for possible avenues for interventions, inter alia by encouraging policies that facilitate the maintenance of social relationships and focus particularly on children from single parent families, on only children as well as on families in challenging housing situations."
https://openalex.org/W3175892313,"Progress in defining genomic fitness landscapes in cancer, especially those defined by copy number alterations (CNAs), has been impeded by lack of time-series single-cell sampling of polyclonal populations and temporal statistical models1-7. Here we generated 42,000 genomes from multi-year time-series single-cell whole-genome sequencing of breast epithelium and primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), revealing the nature of CNA-defined clonal fitness dynamics induced by TP53 mutation and cisplatin chemotherapy. Using a new Wright-Fisher population genetics model8,9 to infer clonal fitness, we found that TP53 mutation alters the fitness landscape, reproducibly distributing fitness over a larger number of clones associated with distinct CNAs. Furthermore, in TNBC PDX models with mutated TP53, inferred fitness coefficients from CNA-based genotypes accurately forecast experimentally enforced clonal competition dynamics. Drug treatment in three long-term serially passaged TNBC PDXs resulted in cisplatin-resistant clones emerging from low-fitness phylogenetic lineages in the untreated setting. Conversely, high-fitness clones from treatment-naive controls were eradicated, signalling an inversion of the fitness landscape. Finally, upon release of drug, selection pressure dynamics were reversed, indicating a fitness cost of treatment resistance. Together, our findings define clonal fitness linked to both CNA and therapeutic resistance in polyclonal tumours."
https://openalex.org/W3138193095,"Dragging of light by moving media was predicted by Fresnel1 and verified by Fizeau's celebrated experiments2 with flowing water. This momentous discovery is among the experimental cornerstones of Einstein's special relativity theory and is well understood3,4 in the context of relativistic kinematics. By contrast, experiments on dragging photons by an electron flow in solids are riddled with inconsistencies and have so far eluded agreement with the theory5-7. Here we report on the electron flow dragging surface plasmon polaritons8,9 (SPPs): hybrid quasiparticles of infrared photons and electrons in graphene. The drag is visualized directly through infrared nano-imaging of propagating plasmonic waves in the presence of a high-density current. The polaritons in graphene shorten their wavelength when propagating against the drifting carriers. Unlike the Fizeau effect for light, the SPP drag by electrical currents defies explanation by simple kinematics and is linked to the nonlinear electrodynamics of Dirac electrons in graphene. The observed plasmonic Fizeau drag enables breaking of time-reversal symmetry and reciprocity10 at infrared frequencies without resorting to magnetic fields11,12 or chiral optical pumping13,14. The Fizeau drag also provides a tool with which to study interactions and nonequilibrium effects in electron liquids."
https://openalex.org/W3177046384,"Fizeau demonstrated in 1850 that the speed of light can be modified when it is propagating in moving media1. However, such control of the light speed has not been achieved efficiently with a fast-moving electron media by passing an electrical current. Because the strong electromagnetic coupling between the electron and light leads to the collective excitation of plasmon polaritons, it is hypothesized that Fizeau drag in electron flow systems manifests as a plasmonic Doppler effect. Experimental observation of the plasmonic Doppler effect in electronic systems has been challenge because the plasmon propagation speed is much faster than the electron drift velocity in conventional noble metals. Here we report direct observation of Fizeau drag of plasmon polaritons in strongly biased monolayer graphene by exploiting the high electron mobility and the slow plasmon propagation of massless Dirac electrons. The large bias current in graphene creates a fast-drifting Dirac electron medium hosting the plasmon polariton. This results in non-reciprocal plasmon propagation, where plasmons moving with the drifting electron media propagate at an enhanced speed. We measure the Doppler-shifted plasmon wavelength using cryogenic near-field infrared nanoscopy, which directly images the plasmon polariton mode in the biased graphene at low temperature. We observe a plasmon wavelength difference of up to 3.6 per cent between a plasmon moving with and a plasmon moving against the drifting electron media. Our findings on the plasmonic Doppler effect provide opportunities for electrical control of non-reciprocal surface plasmon polaritons in non-equilibrium systems."
https://openalex.org/W3175365912,"Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that predisposes individuals to many age-associated diseases, but its exact effects on organ dysfunction are largely unknown1. Hair follicles—mini-epithelial organs that grow hair—are miniaturized by ageing to cause hair loss through the depletion of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs)2. Here we report that obesity-induced stress, such as that induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), targets HFSCs to accelerate hair thinning. Chronological gene expression analysis revealed that HFD feeding for four consecutive days in young mice directed activated HFSCs towards epidermal keratinization by generating excess reactive oxygen species, but did not reduce the pool of HFSCs. Integrative analysis using stem cell fate tracing, epigenetics and reverse genetics showed that further feeding with an HFD subsequently induced lipid droplets and NF-κB activation within HFSCs via autocrine and/or paracrine IL-1R signalling. These integrated factors converge on the marked inhibition of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signal transduction in HFSCs, thereby further depleting lipid-laden HFSCs through their aberrant differentiation and inducing hair follicle miniaturization and eventual hair loss. Conversely, transgenic or pharmacological activation of SHH rescued HFD-induced hair loss. These data collectively demonstrate that stem cell inflammatory signals induced by obesity robustly represses organ regeneration signals to accelerate the miniaturization of mini-organs, and suggests the importance of daily prevention of organ dysfunction. Obesity in mice, caused by a high-fat diet, induces hair loss as a result of changes in the differentiation of hair follicle stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3175504106,"Climate change is forcing the redistribution of life on Earth at an unprecedented velocity1,2. Migratory birds are thought to help plants to track climate change through long-distance seed dispersal3,4. However, seeds may be consistently dispersed towards cooler or warmer latitudes depending on whether the fruiting period of a plant species coincides with northward or southward migrations. Here we assess the potential of plant communities to keep pace with climate change through long-distance seed dispersal by migratory birds. To do so, we combine phenological and migration information with data on 949 seed-dispersal interactions between 46 bird and 81 plant species from 13 woodland communities across Europe. Most of the plant species (86%) in these communities are dispersed by birds migrating south, whereas only 35% are dispersed by birds migrating north; the latter subset is phylogenetically clustered in lineages that have fruiting periods that overlap with the spring migration. Moreover, the majority of this critical dispersal service northwards is provided by only a few Palaearctic migrant species. The potential of migratory birds to assist a small, non-random sample of plants to track climate change latitudinally is expected to strongly influence the formation of novel plant communities, and thus affect their ecosystem functions and community assembly at higher trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W3177323989,"Abstract The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that partially evade neutralizing antibodies poses a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines 1,2 . The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine expresses a stabilized spike protein from the WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2, and has recently demonstrated protective efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in humans in several geographical regions—including in South Africa, where 95% of sequenced viruses in cases of COVID-19 were the B.1.351 variant 3 . Here we show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Ad26.COV2.S induced lower binding and neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 as compared to WA1/2020, but elicited comparable CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against the WA1/2020, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. B.1.351 infection of control rhesus macaques resulted in higher levels of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs than did WA1/2020 infection. Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against both WA1/2020 and B.1.351, although we observed higher levels of virus in vaccinated macaques after B.1.351 challenge. These data demonstrate that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Our findings have important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
https://openalex.org/W3173878905,"A promising approach to study condensed-matter systems is to simulate them on an engineered quantum platform1-4. However, the accuracy needed to outperform classical methods has not been achieved so far. Here, using 18 superconducting qubits, we provide an experimental blueprint for an accurate condensed-matter simulator and demonstrate how to investigate fundamental electronic properties. We benchmark the underlying method by reconstructing the single-particle band structure of a one-dimensional wire. We demonstrate nearly complete mitigation of decoherence and readout errors, and measure the energy eigenvalues of this wire with an error of approximately 0.01 rad, whereas typical energy scales are of the order of 1 rad. Insight into the fidelity of this algorithm is gained by highlighting the robust properties of a Fourier transform, including the ability to resolve eigenenergies with a statistical uncertainty of 10-4 rad. We also synthesize magnetic flux and disordered local potentials, which are two key tenets of a condensed-matter system. When sweeping the magnetic flux we observe avoided level crossings in the spectrum, providing a detailed fingerprint of the spatial distribution of local disorder. By combining these methods we reconstruct electronic properties of the eigenstates, observing persistent currents and a strong suppression of conductance with added disorder. Our work describes an accurate method for quantum simulation5,6 and paves the way to study new quantum materials with superconducting qubits."

https://openalex.org/W3176281018,"Science has been at the centre of attempts by major industries, including tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical, to delay progress in tackling threats to human and planetary health by, inter alia, obscuring industry harms, and opposing regulation. Some aspects of this influence are well documented, others remain poorly understood, and similarities between industries remain underexplored. This study, therefore, aims to synthesise the literature to develop an evidence-based typology and model of corporate influence on science in order to provide an overview of this multi-faceted phenomenon. We obtained literature examining corporate attempts to influence science and the use of science in policy and practice from: database searches, bibliographies, expert recommendations, and web alerts; using a modified scoping review methodology (n = 68). Through interpretive analysis we developed the Science for Profit Typology and Model. We identified eight corporate sectors repeatedly engaging in activities to influence science, including: manipulation of scientific methods; reshaping of criteria for establishing scientific ""proof""; threats against scientists; and clandestine promotion of policy reforms that increase reliance on industry evidence. The typology identifies five macro-level strategies used consistently across the eight industries, comprising 19 meso-level strategies. The model shows how these strategies work to maximise the volume, credibility, reach, and use of industry-favourable science, while minimising these same aspects of industry-unfavourable science. This creates doubt about harms of industry products/practices or efficacy of policies affecting industry; promotes industry-favoured policy responses and industry products as solutions; and legitimises industry's role as scientific stakeholder. These efforts ultimately serve to weaken policy, prevent litigation, and maximise use of industry products/practices-maximising corporate profitability. We provide an accessible way to understand how and why corporations influence science, demonstrate the need for collective solutions, and discuss changes needed to ensure science works in the public interest."
https://openalex.org/W3176276662,"The polybromo-associated PBAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, which includes PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7, regulates cell differentiation and genomic integrity. MUC1-C is an oncogenic protein that drives lineage plasticity in prostate cancer (PC) progression. The present work demonstrates that MUC1-C induces PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7 expression by the previously unrecognized E2F1-mediated activation of their respective promoters. The functional significance of the MUC1-C→PBAF pathway is supported by demonstrating involvement of MUC1-C in associating with nuclear PBAF and driving the NRF2 antioxidant gene transcriptome in PC cells. Mechanistically, MUC1-C forms a complex with NRF2 and PBRM1 on the NRF2 target SLC7A11 gene that encodes the xCT cystine-glutamate antiporter, increases chromatin accessibility and induces SLC7A11/xCT expression. We also show that MUC1-C and PBRM1 are necessary for induction of other NRF2 target genes, including G6PD and PGD that regulate the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results further demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates activation of PBRM1 with the regulation of antioxidant genes, ROS levels, pluripotency factor expression and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. These findings reveal a role for MUC1-C in regulating PBAF, redox balance and lineage plasticity of PC CSC progression. Our findings also uncover involvement of MUC1-C in integrating the PBAF and BAF pathways in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3175096850,"Background The COVID 19 pandemic created a global public health crisis. Physical distancing, masks, personal protective equipment worn by the doctors created difficulties in effective doctor-patient communication. Objectives This study was conducted to assess the difficulties faced by patients in communicating with their doctors due to the COVID 19 preventive measures, and its impact on the trust on their doctors. Methods A cross sectional study of 359 persons attending a tertiary care center in Chennai, sampled in a non-probabilistic manner selected from the outpatient department, wards, and isolation facilities, was conducted using a questionnaire containing items covering three dimensions namely difficulties faced in accessing the health facility, difficulties in doctor-patient communication and trust in the doctors. The data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed using GNU PSPP open-source statistical software version 1.4.0. Results More than 60% of the participants complained of difficulty in accessing the health facility. More than 60% had difficulties in communicating with the doctors. There was a high level of trust in doctors among more than 80% of the participants. Comparison of the mean scores revealed that accessibility was a problem across ages, sexes, education and occupation groups. Communication barriers decreased with age and increased with education, but trust increased with age, but reduced with increasing education. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that difficulties in communication had a negative impact on trust (β = -0.63, p&lt;0.001) and increasing education had a negative impact on trust (β = -0.42, p = 0.034). Conclusions The COVID 19 pandemic and the preventive strategies such as lock-down, physical distancing, face mask and personal protective equipment created barriers to effective doctor patient communication and led to some compromise in trust in doctors during this time."
https://openalex.org/W3174201109,"Prodigiosin, a red linear tripyrrole pigment, has long been recognised for its antimicrobial property. However, the physiological contribution of prodigiosin to the survival of its producing hosts still remains undefined. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the biological role of prodigiosin from Serratia marcescens, particularly in microbial competition through its antimicrobial activity, towards the growth and secreted virulence factors of four clinical pathogenic bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Prodigiosin was first extracted from S. marcescens and its purity confirmed by absorption spectrum, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS). The extracted prodigiosin was antagonistic towards all the tested bacteria. A disc-diffusion assay showed that prodigiosin is more selective towards Gram-positive bacteria and inhibited the growth of MRSA, S. aureus and E. faecalis and Gram-negative E. coli. A minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 μg/μL of prodigiosin was required to inhibit the growth of S. aureus, E. coli and E. faecalis whereas > 10 μg/μL was required to inhibit MRSA growth. We further assessed the effect of prodigiosin towards bacterial virulence factors such as haemolysin and production of protease as well as on biofilm formation. Prodigiosin did not inhibit haemolysis activity of clinically associated bacteria but was able to reduce protease activity for MRSA, E. coli and E. faecalis as well as decrease E. faecalis, Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli biofilm formation. Results of this study show that in addition to its role in inhibiting bacterial growth, prodigiosin also inhibits the bacterial virulence factor protease production and biofilm formation, two strategies employed by bacteria in response to microbial competition. As clinical pathogens were more resistant to prodigiosin, we propose that prodigiosin is physiologically important for S. marcescens to compete against other bacteria in its natural soil and surface water environments."
https://openalex.org/W3174075679,"The primary chemotherapy of ovarian cancer (OC) often acquires chemoresistance. Sorcin (SRI), a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein, has been reported to be an oncogenic protein in cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of SRI regulation and the role and aberrant expression of SRI in chemoresistant OC remain unclear. Here, we identified SRI as a key driver of paclitaxel (PTX)-resistance and explored its regulatory mechanism. Using transcriptome profiles, qRT-PCR, proteomics, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatics analyses, we found that SRI was overexpressed in PTX-resistant OC cells and the overexpression of SRI was related to the poor prognosis of patients. SRI was a key molecule required for growth, migration, and PTX-resistance in vitro and in vivo and was involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-142-5p directly bound to the 3'-UTR of SRI to suppress its expression, whereas a transcription factor zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) inhibited the transcription of miR-142-5p by directly binding to the E-box fragment in the miR-142 promoter region. Furthermore, ZEB1 was negatively regulated by SRI which physically interacted with Smad4 to block its translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel homeostatic loop of SRI that drives the PTX-resistance and malignant progression via Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p in human OC. Targeting this SRI/Smad4/ZEB1/miR-142-5p loop may reverse the PTX-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3175827193,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest cancer mainly owing to its proclivity to early metastasis and the lack of effective targeted therapeutic drugs. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying early invasion and metastasis by PDAC is imperative for improving patient outcomes. The present study identified that upregulation of TSPAN8 expression in PDAC facilitates metastasis in vivo and in vitro. We found SOX9 as a key transcriptional regulator of TSPAN8 expression in response to EGF stimulation. SOX9 modulation was sufficient to positively regulate endogenous expression of TSPAN8, with concomitant in vitro phenotypic changes such as loss of cell–matrix adherence and increased invasion. Moreover, increased SOX9 and TSPAN8 levels were shown to correlate in human pancreatic cancer specimens and downregulated in vitro by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. High expression of SOX9 and TSPAN8 has been associated with tumor stage, poor prognosis and poor patient survival in PDAC. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of the EGF-SOX9-TSPAN8 signaling cascade in the control of PDAC invasion and implies that TSPAN8 may be a promising novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3173908120,"Background Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) for fear of transmission while breaking social distancing rules. The latest guidelines recommend hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and facemask use. However, public willingness in this setup remains unknown. Methods A cross-sectional, unrestricted volunteer Internet survey was conducted to assess individuals’ attitudes and behaviors toward performing BCPR, pre-existing CPR training, occupational identity, age group, and gender. The raking method for weights and a regression analysis for the predictors of willingness were performed. Results Among 1,347 eligible respondents, 822 (61%) had negative attitudes toward performing BCPR. Healthcare providers (HCPs) and those with pre-existing CPR training had fewer negative attitudes (p &lt; 0.001); HCPs and those with pre-existing CPR training and unchanged attitude showed more positive behaviors toward BCPR (p &lt; 0.001). Further, 9.7% of the respondents would absolutely refuse to perform BCPR. In contrast, 16.9% would perform BCPR directly despite the outbreak. Approximately 9.9% would perform it if they were instructed, 23.5%, if they wore facemasks, and 40.1%, if they were to perform hands-only CPR. Interestingly, among the 822 respondents with negative attitudes, over 85% still tended to perform BCPR in the abovementioned situations. The weighted analysis showed similar results. The adjusted predictors for lower negative attitudes toward BCPR were younger age, being a man, and being an HCP; those for more positive behaviors were younger age and being an HCP. Conclusions Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on attitudes and behaviors toward BCPR. Younger individuals, men, HCPs, and those with pre-existing CPR training tended to show fewer negative attitudes and behaviors. Meanwhile, most individuals with negative attitudes still expressed positive behaviors under safer measures such as facemask protection, hands-only CPR, and available dispatch instructions."

https://openalex.org/W3175923284,"Previous study demonstrated that most long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as competing endogenous RNAs or molecular sponges to negatively modulate miRNA and regulate tumor development. However, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in cancer are not fully understood. Our study describes the role of the lncRNA SPRY4 intronic transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) in cancer metastasis by mechanisms related to Staufen1 (STAU1)-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). Briefly, we found that, high SPRY4-IT1 expression was associated with aggressiveness and poor outcome in human colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, functional assays revealed that SPRY4-IT1 significantly promoted colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, microarray analyses identified several differentially-expressed genes upon SPRY4-IT1 overexpression in HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells. Among them, the 3'-UTR of transcription elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1) mRNA can base-pair with the Alu element in the 3'-UTR of SPRY4-IT1. Moreover, SPRY4-IT1 was found to bind STAU1, promote STAU1 recruitment to the 3'-UTR of TCEB1 mRNA, and affect TCEB1 mRNA stability and expression, resulting in hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) upregulation, and thereby affecting cancer cell metastasis. In addition, STAU1 depletion abrogated TCEB1 SMD and alleviated the pro-metastatic effect of SPRY4-IT1 overexpression. Significantly, we revealed that SPRY4-IT1 is also transactivated by NF-κB/p65, which activates SPRY4-IT1 to inhibit TCEB1 expression, and subsequently upregulate HIF-1α. In conclusion, our results highlight a novel mechanism of cytoplasmic lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 in which SPRY4-IT1 affecting TCEB1 mRNA stability via STAU1-mediated degradation during cancer metastasis."

With thousands already detected, our search is entering a new era of discovery with upcoming large telescopes that will look for signs of 'life' in the atmospheres of transiting worlds. Previous work has explored the zone from which Earth would be visible while transiting the Sun1-4. However, these studies considered only the current position of stars, and did not include their changing vantage point over time. Here we report that 1,715 stars within 100 parsecs from the Sun are in the right position to have spotted life on a transiting Earth since early human civilization (about 5,000 years ago), with an additional 319 stars entering this special vantage point in the next 5,000 years. Among these stars are seven known exoplanet hosts, including Ross-128, which saw Earth transit the Sun in the past, and Teegarden's Star and Trappist-1, which will start to see it in 29 and 1,642 years, respectively. We found that human-made radio waves have already swept over 75 of the closest stars on our list."
https://openalex.org/W3173869906,"The understanding of the spatial variation of soil chemical properties is critical in agriculture and the environment. To assess the spatial variability of soil chemical properties in the Fogera plain, Ethiopia, we used Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), pair-wise comparisons, descriptive analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA). In 2019, soil samples were collected at topsoil (a soil depth of 0–20 cm) from three representative land-uses (cropland, plantation forestland, and grazing lands) using a grid-sampling design. The variance analysis for soil pH, available phosphorus (avP), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable potassium (exchK), exchangeable calcium (exchCa), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) revealed significant differences among the land-uses. The highest mean values of pH (8.9), avP (32.99 ppm), OC (4.82%), TN (0.39%), EC (2.28 dS m −1 ), and exchK (2.89 cmol (+) kg -1 ) were determined under grazing land. The lowest pH (6.2), OC (2.3%), TN (0.15%), and EC (0.11 dS m −1 ) were recorded in cultivated land. The PCA result revealed that the land-use change was responsible for most soil chemical properties, accounting for 93.32%. Soil maps can help identify the nutrient status, update management options, and increase productivity and profit. The expansion of cultivated lands resulted in a significant decrease in soil organic matter. Thus, soil management strategies should be tailored to replenish the soil nutrient content while maintaining agricultural productivity in the Fogera plain."

While knowledge on the genetic diversity of CWR can facilitate breeding and conservation strategies, it has poorly been assessed. Cultivated bananas are a major part of the diet and income of hundreds of millions of people and can be considered as one of the most important fruits worldwide. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity and structure of Musa balbisiana, an important CWR of plantains, dessert and cooking bananas. Musa balbisiana has its origin in subtropical and tropical broadleaf forests of northern Indo-Burma. This includes a large part of northern Vietnam where until now, no populations have been sampled. We screened the genetic variation and structure present within and between 17 Vietnamese populations and six from China using 18 polymorphic SSR markers. Relatively high variation was found in populations from China and central Vietnam. Populations from northern Vietnam showed varying levels of genetic variation, with low variation in populations near the Red River. Low genetic variation was found in populations of southern Vietnam. Analyses of population structure revealed that populations of northern Vietnam formed a distinct genetic cluster from populations sampled in China. Together with populations of central Vietnam, populations from northern Vietnam could be subdivided into five clusters, likely caused by mountain ranges and connected river systems. We propose that populations sampled in central Vietnam and on the western side of the Hoang Lien Son mountain range in northern Vietnam belong to the native distribution area and should be prioritised for conservation. Southern range edge populations in central Vietnam had especially high genetic diversity, with a high number of unique alleles and might be connected with core populations in northern Laos and southwest China. Southern Vietnamese populations are considered imported and not native."
https://openalex.org/W3173438664,"Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that targets the iron exporter ferroportin, thereby limiting iron entry into the bloodstream. It is generated in hepatocytes mainly in response to increased body iron stores or inflammatory cues. Iron stimulates expression of bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which in turn binds to BMP receptors on hepatocytes and induces the SMAD signaling cascade for transcriptional activation of the hepcidin-encoding HAMP mRNA. SMAD signaling is also essential for inflammatory HAMP mRNA induction by the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Herein, we utilized human Huh7 hepatoma cells and primary murine hepatocytes to assess the effects of iron perturbations on signaling to hepcidin. Iron chelation appeared to slightly impair signaling to hepcidin. Subsequent iron supplementation not only failed to reverse these effects, but drastically reduced basal HAMP mRNA and inhibited HAMP mRNA induction by BMP6 and/or IL-6. Thus, treatment of cells with excess iron inhibited basal and BMP6-mediated SMAD5 phosphorylation and induction of HAMP, ID1 and SMAD7 mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner. Iron also inhibited IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and induction of HAMP and SOCS3 mRNAs. These responses were accompanied by induction of GCLC and HMOX1 mRNAs, known markers of oxidative stress. We conclude that hepatocellular iron overload suppresses hepcidin by inhibiting the SMAD and STAT3 signaling pathways downstream of their respective ligands."
https://openalex.org/W3174658737,"This study looks at population response to government containment strategies during initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in four high-trust Northern European countries–Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden–with special emphasis on expressions of governmental trust. Sentiment analysis and topic modeling analysis were performed using Twitter data from three phases during the initial European lockdown, and results were compared over time and between countries. Findings show that, in line with existing theory, assertive crisis responses and proactive communication were generally well-received, whereas tentative crisis responses or indications by the authorities that the crisis was manageable were generally met with suspicion. In addition, while government support was high in all countries during the height of the crisis, messages critical of the government as well as conspiracy theories were nevertheless widely circulated. Importantly, countries with the least assertive strategies, rather than clear negative responses, saw heightened polarization of sentiment in the population. Furthermore, in the case of Sweden, a laissez-faire strategy was generally accepted by the population, despite strong criticism from other countries, until mortality rates started to rise. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed with an emphasis of prior trust as a potential explanatory factor. Future research should seek to replicate these findings in other countries with different levels of prior governmental trust or with a different severity of the COVID-19 outbreak than the countries in this study as well as triangulate the findings of this study using alternative methods."

In China, a high prevalence of the QoI fungicides resistance has been reported in the last decade. The study aimed to discuss factors determining rapid development of pyraclostrobin-resistance and its resistance mechanisms.To determine the resistance stability and fitness of pyraclostrobin resistance in L. theobromae, three phenotypes of pyraclostrobin resistance were compared and analyzed for the EC50 values, mycelial growth, virulence and temperature sensitivity and osmotic stress sensitivity. The relative conductivity and enzyme activities of different phenotypes were compared under fungicide stress to explore possible biochemical mechanisms of pyraclostrobin resistance in L. theobromae. The Cytb gene sequences of different phenotypes were analysed.All isolates retained their original resistance phenotypes during the 10 subcultures on a fungicide-free PDA, factor of sensitivity change (FSC) was approximately equal to 1. The resistance-pyraclostrobin of the field isolates should be relatively stable. Two pyraclostrobin-resistant phenotypes shared similar mycelial growth, virulence and temperature sensitivity with pyraclostrobin-sensitive phenotype. After treated by pyraclostrobin, the relative conductivity of the sensitive phenotype was significantly increased. The time of Pyr-R and Pyr-HR reached the most conductivity was about 8-10 times than that of Pyr-S, the time for the maximum value appearance showed significant differences between sensitive and resistant phenotypes. The activities of Glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) of Pyr-HR were 1.78, 5.45 and 1.65 times respectively, significantly higher than that of Pyr-S after treated by 200 mg/l pyraclostrobin.The results showed that the pyraclostrobin-resistant phenotypes displayed high fitness and high-risk. The nucleotide sequences were identical among all pyraclostrobin-resistant and -sensitive isolates. The pyraclostrobin resistance was not attributable to Cytb gene alterations, there may be some of other resistance mechanisms. Differential response of enzyme activity and cell membrane permeability were observed in resistant- and sensitive-isolates suggesting a mechanism of metabolic resistance."

Experiences of discrimination in healthcare can impact healthcare use, including postpartum visits. However, it is unknown whether discrimination is associated with postpartum visit content. This study aimed to examine the relationship between perceived discrimination during the childbirth hospitalization and postpartum visit attendance and content.Data were from Listening to Mothers in California, a population-based survey of people with a singleton hospital birth in California in 2016. Adjusted logistic regression models estimated the association between perceived discrimination during the childbirth hospitalization and 1) postpartum visit attendance, and 2) topics addressed at the postpartum visit (birth control, depression and breastfeeding) for those who attended.90.6% of women attended a postpartum visit, and 8.6% reported discrimination during the childbirth hospitalization. In adjusted models, any discrimination and insurance-based discrimination were associated with 7 and 10 percentage point (pp) lower predicted probabilities of attending a postpartum visit, respectively. There was a 7pp lower predicted probability of discussing birth control for women who had experienced discrimination (81% vs. 88%), a 15pp lower predicted probability of being asked about depression (64% vs. 79%), and a 9 pp lower predicted probability of being asked about breastfeeding (57% vs. 66%).Amid heightened attention to the importance of postpartum care, there is a need to better understand determinants of postpartum care quality. Our findings highlight the potential consequences of healthcare discrimination in the perinatal period, including lower quality of postpartum care."
https://openalex.org/W3174304768,"Prevalence of different respiratory allergies is increasing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Environmental risk factors of respiratory allergy vary regionally, hence the prevalence. This necessitates the needs for regional studies. This article reports prevalence and symptoms of respiratory allergies in the Qassim region, and the factors associated with the prevalence.Eight hundred and fifty individuals aged ≥18 years and were living in the Qassim region filled up our structured online questionnaire between September and December 2020. We estimated the prevalence of different respiratory allergies with 95% confidence intervals. Multi-variable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the risk factors of respiratory allergies.The prevalence of any respiratory allergy in the Qassim region was 28.8%. Most families (58.1%) had at least one member with respiratory allergy. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma were 13.5% and 11.2% 4.1% respectively. The reported symptoms included runny nose (13.6%), red, watery, and itchy eyes (10.4%), difficulty sleeping at night (10.2%), difficulty breathing in cold weather (9.2%), noisy breathing (8.5%), sneezing (8%), repeated coughing (7.5%) and shortness of breath (6.4%). Individuals with a family history were more likely to report any respiratory allergy (OR: 7.8), bronchial asthma (OR: 4.2) and allergic rhinitis (OR: 8.1) compared to the individuals without such family history. Odds of respiratory allergies was higher among males (OR: 1.5). Saudi nationals were less likely to report allergic rhinitis than the non-Saudis (OR: 0.4). Among those who reported a respiratory allergy, most (73.5%) received treatment and majority (61.7%) demonstrated compliance to the treatment, 8.8% needed hospitalization, and 23.1% needed emergency nebulization.Prevalence reported in our study is different than that reported in other regions. Variability in the environmental exposures might explain this. We recommend a meta-analysis to estimate the national prevalence of respiratory allergies."
https://openalex.org/W3174125408,"Stakeholder participation is particularly important when dealing with mobility problems in touristic remote areas, in which there is a need to find sustainable solutions to increase transport accessibility. However, the literature lacks research linking the issues of establishing stakeholder groups with the most desirable level of involvement and methods ensuring involvement on the indicated level. The aim of the paper is to fill this gap on example of project dedicated to six Baltic Sea Regions. In the first stage key stakeholder groups were identified, then different methods and tools were proposed depending on levels of engagement of given group of stakeholders on solving the problems of local mobility. Two research methods were implemented-the case study and the content analysis of documents. The results of the research point to the existence of five key groups of stakeholders interested in solving transport problems of touristic remote areas: authorities, business and service operators, residents, visitors and others (like experts and NGOs). Among the five-authorities and business representatives-should be to a higher degree engaged. However, the main conclusion is that engagement local government units, when developing their own, long-term strategies for social participation, should adapt the selection of participation methods and techniques to a specific target group and the desired level of their involvement so as to include stakeholders in the co-decision processes as effectively as possible and achieve effective regional co-management."
https://openalex.org/W3174467864,"Gaining insights into local people’s views, values and preferences for different conservation management options are increasingly gaining importance among conservationists and decision-makers. This can be achieved through the assessment and understanding of conservation attitudes and perceptions of rural communities including demographic characteristics predicting the attitudes to design and implement conservation policies in a more socially acceptable manner. In this study, we developed and validated user-friendly indices to measure attitudes towards the African elephant, a flagship species and its conservation in Trans Mara District. An iterative item reliability analysis was executed on household data from a random sample of 367 respondents using Cronbach’s Alpha in SPSS. Results yielded two indices; (i) Elephant Attitude Index (EAI); and (ii) Maasai Mara National Reserve Attitude Index (MAI). The EAI had a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.73 while the MAI had a Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient of 0.77. Data analysis revealed that (i) location of residence; (ii) age of respondent; (iii) number of income sources; (iv) gender of the respondent; and (v) benefit reception were the main determinants of EAI and MAI in TM. Our attitude indices can assist conservation practitioners and decision-makers to prioritise resources, on the assumption that high-scoring individuals are more likely to participate in conservation initiatives. We encourage making available different sources of income for residents and working towards improving the involvement of younger people and women in conservation activities in TM."

https://openalex.org/W3177197872,"Aim This study aimed to assess the fear of COVID-19 and its associates among older Rohingya (Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals or FDMNs) in Bangladesh. Method We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 416 older FDMNs aged 60 years and above living in camps of Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants’ socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions, and COVID-19 related information. Level of fear was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. A multiple linear regression examined the factors associated with fear. Results Among 416 participants aged 60 years or above, the mean fear score was 14.8 (range 8–28) and 88.9% of the participants had low fear score. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 ( β : 0.63, 95% CI: -0.26 to 1.53) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 ( β : 3.54, 95% CI: 2.54 to 4.55) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Other factors significantly associated with higher level of fear were lesser frequency of communication during COVID-19, difficulty in obtaining food during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and receiving COVID-19 related information from Radio/television and friends/family/neighbours. Conclusions Our study highlighted that currently there little fear of COVID-19 among the older Rohingya FDMNs. This is probably due to lack of awareness of the severity of the disease in. Dissemination of public health information relevant to COVID-19 and provision of mental health services should be intensified particularly focusing on the individual who were concerned, overwhelmed or fearful of COVID-19. However, further qualitative research is advised to find out the reasons behind this."
https://openalex.org/W3177224706,"The Aeolian wall lizard Podarcis raffonei is an island endemic that survives only on three tiny islets, and on the Capo Grosso peninsula of the Vulcano island, thus is among the European vertebrates with the smallest range and one of the most threatened by extinction. This species is declining due to competition and hybridization with the non-native lizard Podarcis siculus, but a regular monitoring program is lacking. Here we assessed the size and status of the Capo Grosso population of P. raffonei on Vulcano. In September 2015 we captured 30 individuals showing the typical brown phenotype of P. raffonei, while one single male showed a green phenotype, apparently intermediate between P. raffonei and the non-native Podarcis siculus. In May 2017, only 47% of 131 individuals showed the typical brown phenotype (P. raffonei-like) and 53% showed the green phenotype (P. siculus-like). Based on N-mixture models and removal sampling the estimated size of the Capo Grosso population was of 800-1300 individuals in 2017, being similar to 2015; available data suggest that the total range of the species could be as small as 2 ha. The frequency of individuals with the typical P. raffonei phenotype dramatically dropped between two samplings with a parallel increase of individuals displaying the green phenotype. Observation on outdoor captive-bred individuals demonstrates plasticity for colouration in P. raffonei individuals from Capo Grosso, with several individuals showing the typical brown pattern in September 2017 and a green pattern in March 2021. Non-exclusive hypotheses, including hybridization with P. siculus and plasticity in colour pattern of P. raffonei, are discussed to explain the phenotypic shifts of the P. raffonei population of Capo Grosso. While genomic evidence is required to reach conclusions and investigate eventual hybridization, it is urgent to undertake a programme for the monitoring and management of this lizard."

The data for the study was collected by the Government of the region of Aragon (Spain) through a survey of a non-randomly selected sample of firms located in the region. In addition to prospects and intended actions, firms were asked whether or not they had applied for ERTE aid (the Spanish job retention scheme to contain the pandemic crisis). We find that firms participating (voluntarily and anonymously) in the survey anticipated rather well the severity of the effects of the pandemic in the following months. The ERTE aid helped firms to maintain the jobs of their inactive employees, while firms that did not ask for aid responded by laying off employees. Further, the ERTE aid helped to maintain the jobs of furloughed employees, but the firms receiving ERTE aid expected to lay off the same proportion of employees as firms without that aid, controlling for the different anticipated effects of the pandemic in the two groups of firms."

Beetles were collected from the vicinity of five factories. The genotoxic effects of environmental exposures to industrial heavy metals were monitored using a broad range of assays, including energy-dispersive X ray microanalysis and X-ray diffraction (SEM and EDX)), qRT-PCR gene expression assay, micronuclei formation, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis for the soil and testicular tissues of beetles collected from the polluted site revealed a higher percentage of heavy metals than the beetles collected from the reference site (Sidi Kirier, Alexandria, Egypt). To analyze/monitor genotoxicity in P. latreillei sampled from the polluted site, the transcription levels of levels of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and accessory gland seminal fluid protein (AcPC01) in testicular tissues were recorded. The incidence of micronuclei (MN) formation in the testicular cells was also observed. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis was carried out to detect the changes in the gene expression of the aforementioned proteins. Genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90) were significantly overexpressed (> 2-fold) in specimens sampled from the polluted site; however, AcPC01 gene expression was under-expressed (<1.5-folds). The incidence of MN was significantly increased in specimens sampled from the polluted site. Ultrastructure anomalies (nuclear and cytoplasmic disruption) were also observed in the testicular cells of the beetles sampled from the polluted site compared to those sampled from the unpolluted site. Our results, therefore, advocate a need for adequate measures to reduce increasing environmental pollution in the urban-industrial areas."

To determine whether agency policies contribute to race-specific civilian fatalities, this exploratory study compared fatality rates among agencies with and without selected policies expected to reduce killings. A cross-section of 1085 fatalities in the 2015–2016 The Counted public-use database were matched to 481 agencies in the 2013 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) database. Negative binomial regression estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) adjusted for agency type, number of officers, percent female personnel, median income, percent with a bachelor’s degree, violent crime rate, and population size, with inference using robust standard errors. Agencies with greater proportions of full-time personnel (range 43–100%) had lower rates of all (IRR = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77–0.93) and non-White civilian killings (IRR = 0.85; CI = 0.73–0.99). Mission statements predicted lower rates of all (IRR = 0.70; CI = 0.58–0.84) and White killings (IRR = 0.60; CI = 0.40–0.90). Community evaluation and more types of personnel incentives predicted lower rates of White (IRR = 0.82; CI = 0.68–0.99) and non-White killings (IRR = 0.94; CI = 0.89–1.00), respectively. Increasing video use predicted higher rates of White killings (IRR = 1.13; CI = 1.01–1.28). No policies were significantly associated with Black civilian killings. Law enforcement policies that help reduce police killings may vary across racial groups with the least benefit for Black civilians. Impact evaluations and meta-analyses of initiatives aimed to mitigate fatalities should be explored, particularly policies to address anti-Black bias. A national registry tracking all police killings and agency policies is urgently needed to inform law enforcement policies aimed to mitigate civilian fatalities."

However, reliable data on factors that contribute to LBW have not been considered previously. Therefore, we aimed to examine the distribution of the causes for LBW. A retrospective review of cases involving 4,224 babies whose mothers underwent perinatal care at Keio University Hospital between 2013 and 2019 was conducted. The LBW incidence was 24% (1,028 babies). Of the 1,028 LBW babies, 231 babies were from multiple pregnancies. Of the 797 singleton LBW babies, 518 (65%) were born preterm. Obstetric complications in women with preterm LBW babies included premature rupture of membrane or labor onset (31%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP, 64%), fetal growth restriction (24%), non-reassuring fetal status (14%), and placental previa/vasa previa (8%). Of the 279 term LBW babies, 109 (39%) were small for gestational age. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed the following factors as LBW risk factors in term neonates: low pre-pregnancy maternal weight, inadequate gestational weight gain, birth at 37 gestational weeks, HDP, anemia during pregnancy, female sex, and neonatal congenital anomalies. HDP was an LBW risk factor not only in preterm births but also in term births. Our results suggest that both modifiable and non-modifiable factors are causes for LBW. It may be appropriate to consider a heterogeneous rather than a simple classification of LBW and to evaluate future health risks based on contributing factors."

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of SSI and identify the factors associated with SSI.A hospital-based analytic cross-sectional study was conducted based on the review of medical records of 1069 women who underwent CS in two public hospitals in Harar city. The post-CS SSI is defined when it occurred within 30 days after the CS procedure. Factors associated with SSI were identified using a multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. The analysis outputs are presented using an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical tests are defined as statistically significant at P-values<0.05.The prevalence of SSI was 12.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.4, 14.4). Emergency-CS was conducted for 75.9% (95% CI: 73.2, 78.3) of the women and 13.2% (95% CI: 11.3, 15.4) had at least one co-morbid condition. On presentation, 21.7% (95% CI: 19.3, 24.3) of women had rupture of membrane (ROM). Factors significantly and positively associated with post-CS SSI include general anesthesia (aOR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.10, 2.90), ROM (aOR = 2.27, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.52), hospital stay for over 7 days after operation (aOR = 3.57, 95%CI: 1.91, 5.21), and blood transfusion (aOR = 4.2, 95%CI: 2.35, 6.08).The prevalence of post-CS SSI was relatively high in the study settings.

https://openalex.org/W3174227344,"Animal culture and social bonds are relevant to wildlife conservation because they influence patterns of geography, behavior, and strategies of survival. Numerous examples of socially-driven habitat partitioning and ecological-niche specialization can be found among vertebrates, including toothed whales. But such social-ecological dynamics, described here as 'social niche partitioning', are not known among baleen whales, whose societies-particularly on foraging grounds-are largely perceived as unstructured and incidental to matters of habitat use and conservation. However, through 16 years of behavioral observations and photo-identifications of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding within a fjord system in the Canadian Pacific (primarily within Gitga'at First Nation waters), we have documented long-term pair bonds (up to 12 years) as well as a complex societal structure, which corresponds closely to persistent patterns in feeding strategy, long-term site fidelity (extended occupancy and annual rate of return up to 75%), specific geographic preferences within the fjord system, and other forms of habitat use. Randomization tests of network congruency and clustering algorithms were used to test for overlap in patterns of social structure and habitat use, which confirmed the occurrence of social niche partitioning on the feeding grounds of this baleen whale species. In addition, we document the extensive practice of group bubble net feeding in Pacific Canada. This coordinated feeding behavior was found to strongly mediate the social structure and habitat use within this humpback whale society. Additionally, during our 2004-2019 study, we observed a shift in social network structure in 2010-2012, which corresponded with environmental and demographic shifts including a sudden decline in the population's calving rate. Our findings indicate that the social lives of humpback whales, and perhaps baleen whales generally, are more complex than previously supposed and should be a primary consideration in the assessment of potential impacts to important habitat."

Adjusting for demographics, self-reported health, education and socio-economic status, we found that a higher BMI was associated with lower body satisfaction and self-esteem. However, higher scores on cultural efficacy were associated with higher levels of body satisfaction and self-esteem for respondents. Furthermore, the negative association between BMI and both body satisfaction and self-esteem was weaker for those with higher cultural efficacy. This held for BMI scores of 25, 30, and 35+. While our data suggest higher cultural efficacy may directly or interactively shield Māori from developing lowered self-esteem typically associated with higher BMI in Western populations, further research, using more comprehensive measures of body satisfaction should explore the extent to which Māori may find the Western ""thin ideal"" personally desirable for their own bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3174342456,"This study was performed to evaluate the measurement properties of Youth Quality of Life-Short Form (YQOL-SF) in assessing the quality of life (QOL) among general youths in Vietnam. An online cross-sectional study was conducted to validate the YQOL-SF. Factor analysis (including exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was utilized to determine the factorial structure of this tool. The psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of the new factorial model were assessed. The factor analysis revealed the two-factor model of YQOL-SF including factor 1 ""Belief in self and family"", and factor 2 ""Environment and relationships"". Cronbach's alpha value showed excellent internal consistency in both factors (0.911 and 0.910, respectively). Results also indicated good convergent, divergent, concurrent, and know-group validity of the two-factor model. Our study provided a promising model with different domains that were proved to be essential for the assessment of quality of life among Vietnamese youth aged 16-24. Our two-factor model affirmed that a balance between detail and length of the assessment is important to consider when selecting YQOL-SF for youths' QOL assessment. It helped reduce the risk of redundancy and encourages high survey completion rates among participants."
https://openalex.org/W3177262504,"In neuroscience, stereotactic brain surgery is a standard yet challenging technique for which laboratory and veterinary personnel must be sufficiently and properly trained. There is currently no animal-free training option for neurosurgeries; stereotactic techniques are learned and practiced on dead animals. Here we have used three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies to create rat and mouse skin-skull-brain models, specifically conceived for rodent stereotaxic surgery training. We used 3D models obtained from microCT pictures and printed them using materials that would provide the most accurate haptic feedback for each model-PC-ABS material for the rat and Durable resin for the mouse. We filled the skulls with Polyurethane expanding foam to mimic the brain. In order to simulate rodent skin, we added a rectangular 1mm thick clear silicone sheet on the skull. Ten qualified rodent neurosurgeons then performed a variety of stereotaxic surgeries on these rat and mouse 3D printed models. Participants evaluated models fidelity compared to cadaveric skulls and their appropriateness for educational use. The 3D printed rat and mouse skin-skull-brain models received an overwhelmingly positive response. They were perceived as very realistic, and considered an excellent alternative to cadaveric skulls for training purposes. They can be made rapidly and at low cost. Our real-size 3D printed replicas could enable cost- and time-efficient, animal-free neurosurgery training. They can be absolute replacements for stereotaxic surgery techniques practice including but not limited to craniotomies, screw placement, brain injections, implantations and cement applications. This project is a significant step forward in implementing the replacement, reduction, and refinement (3Rs) principles to animal experimentation. These 3D printed models could lead the way to the complete replacement of live animals for stereotaxic surgery training in laboratories and veterinary studies."
https://openalex.org/W3177060966,"Hepatitis C is considered a major public health problem caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Viral infections are known to induce production of IL1β through the signaling pathway of inflammasomes. Emerging evidences suggest that Inflammasome genes may influence the immune response against HCV as the host genetic background may contribute to the balance between acute and chronic inflammation. We investigated in 151 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 206 healthy blood donors' individuals (HD). Polymorphisms in the IL1B and IL18 genes were genotyped by PCR-RFLP, while NLRP3, CARD8, CTSB and AIM2 by RT- PCR. Serum assay of IL-1β cytokine was performed by ELISA. 84 patients presented mild fibrosis (<F2) and 67 advanced fibrosis (≥ F2). Among the HD individuals the NLRP3-rs10754558 C/C genotype correlated with higher IL-1β levels compared to the G/G genotype. Similar pattern was observed in patients with hepatitis C, mean circulating IL-1β levels were 21,96 ± 4.5 and 10,62 ± 3.3pg/mL among the C/C and G/G genotypes, respectively. This pattern holds even after stratification of the patients into mild fibrosis and advanced fibrosis, demonstrating that the NLRP3-rs10754558 or another polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with it possibly has an influence on the processing of pro-IL-1β. Notably, higher levels of IL-1β (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.0001) were observed among patients (mean ± SEM: 19,24 ±3.pg/mL) when compared with controls (mean ± SEM: 11,80 ±1.0pg/mL). Gene-gene interaction showed that individuals heterogyzotes for both CARD8-rs2009373 and IL1B-rs16944 are less prone to hepatitis C development (padj = 0.039). Similarly, herozygote carriers for CTSB-rs1692816 and AIM2-rs1103577 (padj = 0.008) or for IL18-rs187238 and NLRP3-rs10754558 (padj = 0.005), have less chances to the development of hepatitis C. However, between subgroups of <F2 and ≥F2, individuals homozygous for the T allele of CARD8-rs2009373 and heterozygous for IL18-rs187238 (padj = 0.028), have mild form of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3174472813,"Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of serious associated infections in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and is associated with significant morbidity. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in patients on mechanical ventilation may increase exposure to certain risk factors such as hyperoxemia and the need for multiple transfers. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between HBOT and VAP.This retrospective observational study was performed from March 2017 to March 2018 in a 10-bed ICU using HBOT. All patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours were eligible. VAP was defined using clinical and radiological criteria. Data collection was carried out via digital medical records. Risk factors for VAP were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.Forty-two (23%) of the 182 patients enrolled developed at least one episode of VAP. One hundred and twenty-four (68%) patients received HBOT. The incidence rate of VAP was 34 per 1000 ventilator days. The occurrence of VAP was significantly associated with immunosuppression (p<0.029), MV duration (5 [3-7] vs 8 [5-11.5] days, p<0.0001), length of stay (8 [5-13] vs 19.5 [13-32] days, p<0.0001), reintubation (p<0.0001), intra-hospital transport (p = 0.001), use of paralytic agents (p = 0.013), tracheotomy (p = 0.003) and prone position (p = 0.003). The use of HBOT was not associated with the occurrence of VAP. Multivariate analysis identified reintubation (OR: 8.3 [2.6-26.6]; p<0.0001), intra-hospital transport (OR: 3.5 [1.3-9.2]; p = 0.011) and the use of paralytic agents (OR: 3.3 [1.3-8.4]; p = 0.014) as independent risk factors for VAP.Known risk factors for VAP are to be found within our ICU population. HBOT, however, is not an extra risk factor for VAP within this group. Further experimental and clinical investigations are needed to understand the impact of HBOT on the occurrence of VAP and on physiological microbiome."
