https://openalex.org/W1989457482,"A crystalline germination stimulant (trivial name strigol) for the root parasite, witchweed (Striga lutea Lour.), has been isolated from cotton root exudates and characterized as a C19H22O6 compound. Although apparently different from known plant hormones, the stimulant is active at hormonal levels, causing germination at concentrations less than 10-5 part per million."
https://openalex.org/W1996278787,"Four magnetic profiles across the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge reveal magnetic anomalies that show trends parallel with the ridge axis and symmetry about the ridge axis. The distribution of bodies that could cause these anomalies supports the Vine and Matthews hypothesis for the generation of patterns of magnetic anomalies associated with the midocean ridge system. The geometry of the bodies accords with the known reversals of the geomagnetic field during the last 3.4 million years, indicating a spreading rate of the ocean floor of 4.5 centimeters per year. If one assumes that the spreading rate within 500 kilometers of the ridge axis has been constant, reversals of the geomagnetic field during the last 10.0 million years can be determined. This new, detailed history of field reversals accords with observed anomalies over Reykjanes Ridge in the North Atlantic if a spreading rate of 1 centimeter per year is assumed there."

If the phenylalanine molecule in the 7th position of this peptide is replaced by its dextrorotatory form, extinction is facilitated."

This procedure accelerates the escape of the ripening hormone ethylene from the tissue; by reducing the oxygen tension it also lowers the fruit's sensitivity to the hormone.

https://openalex.org/W1996643368,"Steroid inhibitors of cholesterogenesis containing nitrogen-substituted side chains induced electromyographic myotonia in rats. Cholesterol reduction or desmosterol accumulation, per se, did not cause myotonia, and cholestrol feeding prevented drug-induced myotonia. Desmosterol accumulation in combination with a specific drug effect may cause the observed myotonia."
https://openalex.org/W3207078256,"Many of the newly discovered seedoil acids have reactive or unusual functional groups or other facets of molecular structure that permit their ready differentiation from oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and the other most prevalent saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The recognition and availability of the new acids, coupled with methods that make detection and determination easy, will help studies of lipid biosynthesis in the plant and of lipid metabolism and utilization in animals, and will stimulate more studies in depth on the fine points of seedlipid structure. Correlations of structural patterns in seed lipids of particular groups of plants with classical taxonomic categories will permit clarifications, raise needed questions concerning classifications, and accelerate research in chemotaxonomy and phylogenetics. Seed lipids are particularly well suited for establishing relationships among plants because of their great variety in structure compared to the more limited structural types of amino acids, sugars, purines, and many other plant substances. The newly characterized seed oils are potentially important industrial raw materials whenever they come from agronomically promising plant species. The molecular structures of seed triglycerides have major influence on their physical properties and therefore advances in knowledge in that sphere have practical implications. For example, the unusual characteristics of cocoa butter that make it so valuable for food and confectionery use are attributed to the specific arrangement of fatty acids it its triglycerides. The glycerides are almost all 2-oleic-1,3-disaturated acid triglycerides. The physical characteristics of lard are advantageously changed by catalytically rearranging fatty acyl groups among the glycerides initially in the fat to achieve a more nearly random distribution, followed sometimes by further fractionation to remove more saturated glycerides. Through this change of glyceride structures a preferred, less grainy texture is achieved. Future studies to understand, unravel, and control seed-oil triglyceride structures will be significant in developing margarines of improved texture and ""feel,"" cocoa-butter substitutes, and many other products. I expect rapid, fruitful progress in seedlipid research and utilization to continue. Such progress will be aided by investigation of seed lipids from a large number and variety of different plants to find new types of fatty acids, to find new sources of familiar oils, and to obtain more data regarding their glyceride structures."
https://openalex.org/W1989124095,"Both dependent and independent random processes can be used to study and synthesize stratigraphic sections and bedding sequences. Synthetic stratigraphic sections can be modeled to fit any geologic problem with a good correspondence between the synthetic and actual stratigraphic sections. To synthesize a sedimentary sequence, one needs only a transition procedure to go from one lithology or bedding type to another, and frequency distributions of thickness for the various lithologies. A sedimentation process with a ""memory"" is termed Markovian; if the past has no influence on either present or future sedimentation, it is called an independent trials process."
https://openalex.org/W2030397237,"Cores recovered from horizon A are Late Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) in age and consist of alternating layers of calcareous turbidites and ""red clay."" The presence of red clay suggests that the water depth in this area during Cretaceous time was at least as great as at present—more than 5100 meters. A middle Cretaceous (Cenomanian) core consisting of interbedded sand and gravel and light-to-dark-gray lutite was taken in the same area from a layer stratigraphically below the horizon; the presence of hydrogen sulfide and iron sulfide may indicate anaerobic conditions that may be attributable to local ponding of sediment in Cenomanian time."
https://openalex.org/W2078218466,Treatment of rats with cycloheximide results in a defect in intestinal iron transport. A similar defect occurs after the parenteral administration of iron. Under both conditions there is impaired uptake of iron into the mucosal cells as well as defective transfer from the intestinal mucosa. It is suggested that the interference in iron transport may be due to a deficiency of an unidenti-fild carrier Substance.

This observation supports the view that the polar caps are predominantly solid CO(2). However, thin clouds of H(2)0 ice could substantially reduce the surface condensation rate."

https://openalex.org/W2079932662,An automated psychophysical method allows a human subject to track his own separation threshold for two flashes delivered in sequence without interfering with the simultaneous recording of the alpha rhythm of his electroencephalogram. A systematic rise in this threshold is observed when the alpha voltage declines from its normal alert level. This suggests that an increase in the minimum resolvable temporal sequence may contribute to the development of the negative time errors associated with drowsiness and sleep.
