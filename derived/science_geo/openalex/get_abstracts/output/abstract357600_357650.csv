We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium ( 40 K 87 Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 10 12 per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 × 10 –30 coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state."

Other crucial roles of CaCCs include action potential generation in Characean algae and prevention of polyspermia in frog egg membrane. None of the known molecular candidates share properties characteristic of most CaCCs in native cells. Using Axolotl oocytes as an expression system, we have identified TMEM16A as the Xenopus oocyte CaCC. The TMEM16 family of ""transmembrane proteins with unknown function"" is conserved among eukaryotes, with family members linked to tracheomalacia (mouse TMEM16A), gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (human TMEM16E), aberrant X segregation (a Drosophila TMEM16 family member), and increased sodium tolerance (yeast TMEM16). Moreover, mouse TMEM16A and TMEM16B yield CaCCs in Axolotl oocytes and mammalian HEK293 cells and recapitulate the broad CaCC expression. The identification of this new family of ion channels may help the development of CaCC modulators for treating diseases including hypertension and cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1997432717,"White adipose (fat) tissues regulate metabolism, reproduction, and life span. Adipocytes form throughout life, with the most marked expansion of the lineage occurring during the postnatal period. Adipocytes develop in coordination with the vasculature, but the identity and location of white adipocyte progenitor cells in vivo are unknown. We used genetically marked mice to isolate proliferating and renewing adipogenic progenitors. We found that most adipocytes descend from a pool of these proliferating progenitors that are already committed, either prenatally or early in postnatal life. These progenitors reside in the mural cell compartment of the adipose vasculature, but not in the vasculature of other tissues. Thus, the adipose vasculature appears to function as a progenitor niche and may provide signals for adipocyte development."

The enzyme(s) producing ssDNA at DSBs in eukaryotes remain unknown. We monitored 5′-strand resection at inducible DSB ends in yeast and identified proteins required for two stages of resection: initiation and long-range 5′-strand resection. We show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (MRX) initiates 5′ degradation, whereas Sgs1 and Dna2 degrade 5′ strands exposing long 3′ strands. Deletion of SGS1 or DNA2 reduces resection and DSB repair by single-strand annealing between distant repeats while the remaining long-range resection activity depends on the exonuclease Exo1. In exo1Δ sgs1Δ double mutants, the MRX complex together with Sae2 nuclease generate, in a stepwise manner, only few hundred nucleotides of ssDNA at the break, resulting in inefficient gene conversion and G2/M damage checkpoint arrest.

These results provide important insights into the early steps of DSB repair in eukaryotes. In mitotic cells DNA recombination repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) and gaps that occur spontaneously or are induced by chemicals or irradiation. DSBs occur also as intermediates of biological events such as meiotic recombination, V(D)J recombination, or mating-type switching in yeast. DSB-induced homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by formation of 3′-OH single-stranded tails (Sun et al., 1991Sun H. Treco D. Szostak J.W.

The strand exchange protein Rad51 assembles a nucleofilament at 3′ ssDNA tails that carries out a search for homologous sequences and promotes strand invasion (reviewed in San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J.

The same 3′ ssDNA tails at DSB ends constitute a signal for DNA-damage checkpoint induction (Vaze et al., 2002Vaze M. Pellicioli A. Lee S. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.

Mec1/Ddc2 in yeast and ATR/ATRIP in mammals bind RPA-coated ssDNA tails and initiate a kinase cascade that leads to cell-cycle arrest (reviewed in Harrison and Haber, 2006Harrison J.C. Haber J.E. Surviving the breakup: the DNA damage checkpoint.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Formation of 3′ ssDNA tails also determines the switch from the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) to the HR pathway because NHEJ preferentially utilizes the unresected ends for ligation (Ira et al., 2004Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D. Wan L. Hollingsworth N.M. et al.DNA end resection, homologous recombination and DNA damage checkpoint activation require CDK1.Nature. 2004; 431: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, RecBCD, a complex of helicases and a nuclease, is responsible for the formation of 3′ ssDNA tails at DSBs (reviewed in Spies and Kowalczykowski, 2005Spies M. Kowalczykowski S. Homologous recombination by RecBCD and RecF pathways.in: Higgins N.P. The Bacterial Chromosome. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.2005: 389-403Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, however, the major 5′ end resection activity remains unknown. Several proteins that are required for a normal rate of DSB end resection have been identified in budding yeast and mammals including the MRX/MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 in yeast and Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in human) (Ivanov et al., 1994Ivanov E.L.

Both MRX and Sae2 belong to one epistasis group with respect to DSB resection (Clerici et al., 2005Clerici M. Mantiero D. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sae2 protein promotes resection and bridging of double strand break ends.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38631-38638Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although deletion of any component of the MRX or Sae2 complex decreases the resection rate at DSBs, how MRX or Sae2 contributes to resection is unknown. Mre11 has multiple nuclease motifs but expression of mre11-H125N, which completely eliminates nuclease activity in vitro, was shown to retain a nearly normal resection rate, suggesting that the MRX complex may facilitate the access to DSB ends for other nucleases (Lee et al., 2002Lee S.E.

Also, the in vitro exonuclease activity of Mre11 has 3′ to 5′ polarity, which is opposite to the polarity of end degradation observed at DSBs in vivo (Furuse et al., 1998Furuse M. Nagase Y. Tsubouchi H. Murakami-Murofushi K. Shibata T. Ohta K.

Mre11 nuclease activity is directly responsible for processing Spo11-induced DSBs only in meiotic cells, most likely by removing covalently bound Spo11 from DSB ends (Furuse et al., 1998Furuse M.

Sae2 also exhibits nuclease activity (Lengsfeld et al., 2007Lengsfeld B.M. Rattray A.J. Bhaskara V. Ghirlando R. Paull T.T. Sae2 is an endonuclease that processes hairpin DNA cooperatively with the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 complex.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 638-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the role of this nuclease in DSB end resection is not yet defined. In mammals, loss of either the MRN complex or the recently identified Sae2 ortholog CtIP results in a dramatic defect in processing mitotic DSBs (Jazayeri et al., 2006Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. ATM- and cell cycle-dependent regulation of ATR in response to DNA double-strand breaks.Nat.

Human CtIP promotes DNA end resection.Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), with checkpoint and recombination proteins not properly loaded at the γ-irradiation-induced damage sites. Loss of Exo1, a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease, moderately reduces the rate of resection, but the more dramatic defect is observed only when both EXO1 and either the MRX complex or SAE2 are simultaneously deleted (Clerici et al., 2005Clerici M. Mantiero D. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sae2 protein promotes resection and bridging of double strand break ends.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38631-38638Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, Llorente and Symington, 2004Llorente B. Symington L.S.

Exo1 roles for repair of DNA double-strand breaks and meiotic crossing over in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Importantly, gene conversion is still accomplished in exo1Δ mre11Δ cells, suggesting that additional enzymes are able to generate ssDNA at DNA breaks. Since none of the factors listed above is likely to be the primary nuclease responsible for resection of DSBs in budding yeast, we searched for an enzyme that provides a robust resection activity analogous to the bacterial RecBCD. By monitoring the kinetics of 5′ resection at regions immediately adjacent to, and at different distances from the break site, we identified mutants that are defective in the initiation or progression of 5′ strand resection. We demonstrate that the MRX complex and Sae2 are important only in the initiation of resection. We also identified two new factors involved in 5′ strand resection: Bloom and Werner syndromes' helicase ortholog called Sgs1 and the Dna2 nuclease/helicase. In the absence of Sgs1 or Dna2, resection is slow and depends on yet another nuclease: Exo1. To define the roles of various factors in 5′ strand removal at DSBs in budding yeast, we first analyzed in detail how breaks are processed in wild-type cells. We used a strain that has a single HO endonuclease recognition site at the MAT locus on chromosome III. A DSB at MAT cannot be repaired by HR because the donor sequences HMR and HML are deleted. Following synchronous HO-induced cleavage, we monitored the rate of resection within 80 kb at each side of the break using a set of probes specific for sequences at different distances from the HO break (Figure 1A). As the 5′ strand is being degraded at DSB ends, the EcoRI enzyme is unable to cleave ssDNA, and the intensity of the bands corresponding to the DNA fragments by Southern blot hybridization becomes diminished (Figure 1B). We measured the band intensity corresponding to each probe over time and an average rate of resection was estimated from the time at which the signal intensity dropped to 50% of its original value measured 1 hr after break induction. An average rate of resection in wild-type cells for all of the investigated EcoRI fragments is 4.4 kb/hr (Figures 1C and 1D). A similar rate of resection was established previously in different assays (Fishman-Lobell and Haber, 1992Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Removal of nonhomologous DNA ends in double-strand break recombination: the role of the yeast ultraviolet repair gene RAD1.Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Vaze et al., 2002Vaze M. Pellicioli A. Lee S. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J. Recovery from checkpoint-mediated arrest after repair of a double-strand break requires srs2 helicase.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, resection at 30 kb proximal to the break is blocked. This is due to the presence of long inverted Ty1 transposon repeats that once resected immediately anneal to each other either within the same sister chromatid or between two different chromatids, forming a hairpin structure or a dicentric chromosome that blocks further processing. Deletion of Ty repeats restores resection beyond 30 kb (VanHulle et al., 2007VanHulle K. Lemoine F.J. Narayanan V. Downing B. Hull K. McCullough C. Bellinger M. Lobachev K. Petes T.D. Malkova A. Inverted DNA repeats channel repair of distant double-strand breaks into chromatid fusions and chromosomal rearrangements.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2601-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar; G.I. and J.E. Haber, unpublished data). To avoid any impact of inverted repeats on resection in this study, we used probes located prior to the inverted Ty repeats only. In E. coli, the nuclease component of the RecBCD complex degrades ssDNA unwound by helicases and initiates DSB-induced recombination. To test whether any yeast helicase is involved in 5′ strand resection we surveyed the role of Srs2, Sgs1, Rrm3, and Mph1 DNA helicases in end resection. In this initial screen only two probes were used, one located immediately next to the break (MAT) to monitor the rate of initiation of resection, and the other located 28 kb away from the break (FEN2) that allowed us to follow the rate of long-range resection. In all but one mutant, the rates of resection were identical to those in wild-type cells (data not shown). In an sgs1Δ mutant, initiation of resection at MAT was the same as in wild-type cells. However, resection at FEN2 was very slow. We used additional probes to detect resection beyond 3 kb, 10 kb, and 27–28 kb on both sides of the break. For all probes the average rate of resection was markedly reduced by about four-fold to about 1 kb/hr (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover the efficiency of resection was also dramatically reduced as only about 40% of cells processed the 5′ strand beyond 28 kb. Sgs1 forms a complex with Top3 and Rmi1 (hereafter called the STR complex) and acts together in several distinct DNA transactions (Chang et al., 2005Chang M. Bellaoui M. Zhang C. Desai R. Morozov P.

A similar complex was described between human orthologs called BLM/TopoIIIα/BLAP75 or BTB complex (Raynard et al., 2006Raynard S. Bussen W. Sung P.

We therefore tested whether TOP3- and RMI1-deficient cells show defects in 5′ strand resection comparable to that in the sgs1Δ mutant. Both top3Δ and sgs1Δ top3Δ can initiate resection but are equally defective in long-range resection at 5′ strands (Figure S1 available online). Also the rmi1Δ mutant is defective in resection (data not shown). We conclude that the STR complex is required for a wild-type rate (4.4 kb/hr) but not for the initiation of resection. To rule out the possibility that the observed resection defect in sgs1Δ is specific for a particular locus or assay that we employed, we tested whether sgs1Δ cells are proficient in single-strand annealing (SSA) between partial leu2 gene repeats located 25 kb apart from each other on the left arm of the chromosome III. In this assay, the HO recognition site is located next to the leu2 gene and the second leu2 sequence is inserted 25 kb downstream at the HIS4 locus. Therefore 25 kb of resection is required for SSA to occur (Figure 3A; Vaze et al., 2002Vaze M. Pellicioli A. Lee S. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J. Recovery from checkpoint-mediated arrest after repair of a double-strand break requires srs2 helicase.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To exclude the contribution of break-induced replication (BIR) to DSB repair by which one repeat invades the other repeat and copies the distal part of the chromosome, we measured the repair frequency in the absence of RAD51. Rad51 is essential for BIR but dispensable for SSA (Davis and Symington, 2004Davis A.P. Symington L.S. RAD51-dependent break-induced replication in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, VanHulle et al., 2007VanHulle K. Lemoine F.J. Narayanan V. Downing B. Hull K. McCullough C. Bellinger M. Lobachev K. Petes T.D. Malkova A. Inverted DNA repeats channel repair of distant double-strand breaks into chromatid fusions and chromosomal rearrangements.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2601-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if Sgs1 is involved in resection, especially for regions further from the break, SSA between repeats separated by 25 kb should depend strongly on Sgs1. Indeed in rad51Δ sgs1Δ mutant cells SSA is dramatically reduced and product formation is delayed substantially (Figures 3B–3D). The time required for product formation is congruent with earlier estimates of a 1 kb/hr rate of resection in an sgs1Δ mutant (Figures 2A and 2B). Together these results confirm that sgs1Δ cells are defective in 5′ strand resection but not in the initial processing of the breaks. To determine whether the helicase activity of Sgs1 is required for 5′ resection, we expressed the wild-type SGS1 gene or sgs1 mutant derivatives with a deletion or single amino acid substitution in the helicase domain (sgs1-ΔC795 or sgs1-hd) in sgs1Δ cells. As shown in Figure 2C, only wild-type SGS1 was able to restore the normal resection rate, demonstrating that Sgs1 helicase activity is required for efficient removal of the 5′ strand. Sgs1 is a DNA helicase that unwinds a 5′ strand and provides a substrate for a nuclease(s). Previously the MRX complex and Exo1 were shown to be involved in 5′ strand resection. Therefore we decided to test whether any of these factors is important for long-range processing of DSB ends along with Sgs1. We measured resection rates in a rad50Δ mutant. Consistent with previous reports (Ivanov et al., 1994Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. White C.I. Fabre F. Haber J.E. Mutations in XRS2 and RAD50 delay but do not prevent mating-type switching in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3414-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), resection at the MAT locus is slower in a rad50Δ mutant (Figure 4A). If the MRX complex is required for 5′ strand processing further away from the break, we anticipated very slow 5′ strand degradation at a distance of 28 kb from the break. However, we did not observe a significant difference between rad50Δ and wild-type cells in resection at 28 kb, except that a fraction of rad50Δ cells (about 20%) never initiated resection and therefore failed to process the 5′ strand away from the break (Figure 4A). The same results were observed in mre11Δ cells (Figure S2). We conclude that cells deficient in the MRX complex are impaired in the initiation of 5′ resection, but those that successfully initiate resection still process the 5′ strand at the wild-type rate. Therefore, MRX is not the nuclease that processes 5′ strands unwound by Sgs1. To determine whether Exo1 is the enzyme that processes the 5′ strands unwound by Sgs1, we measured the resection rate in an exo1Δ mutant. Initiation of resection in exo1Δ cells is comparable to that in wild-type cells. The kinetics and efficiency of SSA between repeats that are separated by 25 kb were identical in rad51Δ and exo1Δ rad51Δ cells (Figures 3C and 3D). In addition resection measured at 28 kb from the DSB in exo1Δ cells was reduced, however less dramatically than in sgs1Δ cells (Figure 4B). These results indicate that Exo1 is not the major nuclease that processes 5′ strands or that there is another equally efficient nuclease. We further constructed the sgs1Δ exo1Δ strain and measured the 5′ strand resection rate. As shown in Figure 4C, the processing of DSB ends in sgs1Δ exo1Δ is substantially slower and much less efficient than that in each single mutant. Only about 5%–10% of cells resect the 5′ strand beyond the EcoRI site located 3 kb away from the break (BUD5 probe). The results demonstrate that deletion of SGS1 and EXO1 almost completely eliminates 5′ strand degradation. However, these factors are dispensable for the initial resection of the break. Furthermore, sgs1Δ exo1Δ rad51Δ cells almost never complete SSA between repeats that are 25 kb or even 5 kb apart (Figures 3C and 3E). Along with the synergistic effect of sgs1Δ exo1Δ on phleomycin-induced damage tolerance (Figure 4D), we conclude that Sgs1 and Exo1 play a redundant role in DSB repair: 5′ end resection. We also conclude that besides Exo1, another nuclease exists to process the 5′ strand together with the Sgs1 helicase. The sgs1Δ exo1Δ mutant still sustains slow and limited 5′ resection at the vicinity of the break, as the HO-cut fragments disappeared into diffused bands (Figure 4C). To analyze these diffuse bands in more detail, we separated EcoRI fragments for a longer time (Figure 5A). Interestingly we observed that several bands accumulated over time below the initial HO cut bands that migrate in increments of about 100 bp. The additional bands are observed on both sides of the break. These smaller DNA fragments observed in the sgs1Δ exo1Δ double mutant could result when either 3′ end degradation or 5′ strand resection pauses at discrete sites. To distinguish between these two possibilities we used a 100 bp probe specific to the first 100 bp immediately adjacent to the break (probe B) (Figure 5A). The pattern and relative intensity of DNA fragments detected by this probe are identical to DNA fragments detected with a probe specific to 400 bp at the other end of the HO-cut fragment (probe A). We conclude that 3′ ends are stable and that enzymatic processing of DSB ends in the absence of both SGS1 and EXO1 pauses at discrete sites. We further measured how much ssDNA is created over time on one side of a DSB in the sgs1Δ exo1Δ mutant. The first 100 nucleotides are removed quickly, but 4–6 hr after HO induction only 30% or 10% of cells processed DSB ends beyond 100 or 200 nucleotides, respectively (Figure 5B). Such limited resection with the unique 100 bp pausing is also detected in rmi1Δ exo1Δ and top3Δ exo1Δ strains (Figure S3). We discovered that STR- and Exo1-independent 5′ resection depends almost entirely on the MRX complex and Sae2. In sgs1Δ rad50Δ, exo1Δ rad50Δ, exo1Δ sgs1Δ rad50Δ, and exo1Δ sgs1Δ sae2Δ mutants the bands corresponding to smaller HO cleavage products are never formed and in very slow growing triple mutants resection of the HO break is almost undetectable (Figures 5A and S4). The results indicate that the MRX complex and Sae2 are primarily responsible for resecting close to the break (Figure 4A). Furthermore, resection close to the break in rad50Δ sgs1Δ and rad50Δ exo1Δ double mutant cells is even more delayed than in a rad50Δ single mutant, suggesting that in the absence of the MRX complex both Sgs1 and Exo1 can still initiate limited DSB end processing. To test whether resection limited to the vicinity of DSB ends in sgs1Δ exo1Δ is sufficient for gene conversion, we used an ectopic recombination assay between a MATa sequence located on chromosome V and a MATa-inc sequence located on chromosome III (Ira et al., 2003Ira G. Malkova A. Liberi G. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Srs2 and Sgs1-Top3 suppress crossovers during double-strand break repair in yeast.Cell. 2003; 115: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Gene conversion in the sgs1Δ exo1Δ double mutant was reduced by about one-third when compared to each single mutant, demonstrating that limited resection in sgs1Δ exo1Δ partially impairs DSB repair via gene conversion (Figure S4). A relatively high level of repair in sgs1Δ exo1Δ cells is not surprising given that 100–200 bp of homology is sufficient for HR (Ira and Haber, 2002Ira G. Haber J.E.

Utilizing quantitative lipidomic analyses and mice deficient in adipose tissue lipid chaperones aP2 and mal1, we explored how metabolic alterations in adipose tissue are linked to whole-body metabolism through lipid signals. A robust increase in de novo lipogenesis rendered the adipose tissue of these mice resistant to the deleterious effects of dietary lipid exposure. Systemic lipid profiling also led to identification of C16:1n7-palmitoleate as an adipose tissue-derived lipid hormone that strongly stimulates muscle insulin action and suppresses hepatosteatosis. Our data reveal a lipid-mediated endocrine network and demonstrate that adipose tissue uses lipokines such as C16:1n7-palmitoleate to communicate with distant organs and regulate systemic metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2048685634,"The neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease has been associated with synaptic dismantling and progressive decrease in neuronal activity. We tested this hypothesis in vivo by using two-photon Ca 2+ imaging in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Although a decrease in neuronal activity was seen in 29% of layer 2/3 cortical neurons, 21% of neurons displayed an unexpected increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca 2+ transients. These “hyperactive” neurons were found exclusively near the plaques of amyloid β–depositing mice. The hyperactivity appeared to be due to a relative decrease in synaptic inhibition. Thus, we suggest that a redistribution of synaptic drive between silent and hyperactive neurons, rather than an overall decrease in synaptic activity, provides a mechanism for the disturbed cortical function in Alzheimer's disease."

We report a catalytic approach for the conversion of carbohydrates to specific classes of hydrocarbons for use as liquid transportation fuels, based on the integration of several flow reactors operated in a cascade mode, where the effluent from the one reactor is simply fed to the next reactor. This approach can be tuned for production of branched hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in gasoline, or longer-chain, less highly branched hydrocarbons in diesel and jet fuels. The liquid organic effluent from the first flow reactor contains monofunctional compounds, such as alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids, and heterocycles, that can also be used to provide reactive intermediates for fine chemicals and polymers markets."

Although poor fisheries governance is often implicated, evaluation of solutions remains rare. Bioeconomic theory and case studies suggest that rights-based catch shares can provide individual incentives for sustainable harvest that is less prone to collapse. To test whether catch-share fishery reforms achieve these hypothetical benefits, we have compiled a global database of fisheries institutions and catch statistics in 11,135 fisheries from 1950 to 2003. Implementation of catch shares halts, and even reverses, the global trend toward widespread collapse. Institutional change has the potential for greatly altering the future of global fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2140219059,"Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) comprise the largest ubiquitin E3 subclass, in which a central cullin subunit links a substrate-binding adaptor with an E2-binding RING. Covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to a conserved C-terminal domain (ctd) lysine stimulates CRL ubiquitination activity and prevents binding of the inhibitor CAND1. Here we report striking conformational rearrangements in the crystal structure of NEDD8~Cul5(ctd)-Rbx1 and SAXS analysis of NEDD8~Cul1(ctd)-Rbx1 relative to their unmodified counterparts. In NEDD8ylated CRL structures, the cullin WHB and Rbx1 RING subdomains are dramatically reoriented, eliminating a CAND1-binding site and imparting multiple potential catalytic geometries to an associated E2. Biochemical analyses indicate that the structural malleability is important for both CRL NEDD8ylation and subsequent ubiquitination activities. Thus, our results point to a conformational control of CRL activity, with ligation of NEDD8 shifting equilibria to disfavor inactive CAND1-bound closed architectures, and favor dynamic, open forms that promote polyubiquitination."

Analysis of the population dynamics of H. armigera from 1992 to 2007 in China indicated that a marked decrease in regional outbreaks of this pest in multiple crops was associated with the planting of Bt cotton. The study area included six provinces in northern China with an annual total of 3 million hectares of cotton and 22 million hectares of other crops (corn, peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables) grown by more than 10 million resource-poor farmers.

https://openalex.org/W2062535336,"Strong evidence indicates that regulated mRNA translation in neuronal dendrites underlies synaptic plasticity and brain development. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is involved in this process; here, we show that it acts by inhibiting translation initiation. A binding partner of FMRP, CYFIP1/Sra1, directly binds the translation initiation factor eIF4E through a domain that is structurally related to those present in 4E-BP translational inhibitors. Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BC1), another FMRP binding partner, increases the affinity of FMRP for the CYFIP1-eIF4E complex in the brain. Levels of proteins encoded by known FMRP target mRNAs are increased upon reduction of CYFIP1 in neurons. Translational repression is regulated in an activity-dependent manner because BDNF or DHPG stimulation of neurons causes CYFIP1 to dissociate from eIF4E at synapses, thereby resulting in protein synthesis. Thus, the translational repression activity of FMRP in the brain is mediated, at least in part, by CYFIP1.

The construction of neuronal circuits in the developing brain requires the correct assembly of trillions of synaptic connections. Finely regulated protein synthesis may be required to obtain the correct set of proteins at synapses and to modulate their activity in response to different developmental cues or synaptic stimulations. Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that local (synaptodendritic) protein synthesis modulates synaptic plasticity (Martin et al., 2000Martin K.C. Barad M. Kandel E.R.

Although the general translational machinery has been found at or near synapses, components that might control specific mRNA translation in that compartment are largely unknown. One protein implicated in neuronal mRNA translation is the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the absence of which causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS) that is characterized at the cellular level by a deficit in synapse maturation. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein with roles in mRNA localization, translation (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C. Greenough W.T.

It recognizes mRNAs by directly interacting with them through G quartets and/or U-rich sequences or through small, noncoding RNA adaptors such as the brain cytoplasmic RNA BC1 and possibly microRNAs (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C.

Strong evidence indicates that FMRP represses translation, although how it does so is enigmatic. Two well-characterized pathways that affect local protein synthesis in neurons involve activation of the TrkB receptors (Steward and Schuman, 2003Steward O. Schuman E.M.

USA. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for regulating translation is by modulation of the interactions between factors required for translational initiation. Cap-dependent translation, which requires the association of the eIF4A-eIF4G-eIF4E (eIF4F) complex with the 5′ terminal m7G cap, is known to be particularly important in neurons (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). eIF4F assembly is often regulated by the 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs), which interfere with the eIF4E-eIFG interaction (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, Richter and Klann, 2007Richter J.D. Klann E.

Although 4E-BP1, BP2, BP3, and 4E-T, which all block the eIF4G-eIF4E interaction, probably act as general regulators, other proteins such as Xenopus Maskin and Drosophila Cup act as mRNA-specific 4E-BPs (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Thus far, only Neuroguidin has been identified as a 4E-BP in the nervous system (Jung et al., 2006Jung M.Y. Lorenz L. Richter J.D.

Here, we demonstrate that FMRP-mediated repression of translation requires an interaction with Cytoplasmic FMRP Interacting Protein CYFIP1 (Schenck et al., 2001Schenck A. Bardoni B. Moro A. Bagni C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which also binds the cap-binding factor eIF4E. The eIF4E-interacting domain of CYFIP1 forms the characteristic “reverse L shaped” structure that is also assumed by the canonical eIF4E-binding motif (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J.

In the brain, however, CYFIP1 forms a complex with specific FMRP-target mRNAs; reduced levels of CYFIP1 cause an increase in the synthesis of MAP1B, αCaMKII, and APP, whose mRNAs are known to be regulated by FMRP (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C.

Our data indicate that an eIF4E-CYFIP1-FMRP complex is present at synapses and that synaptic activity releases CYFIP1 from eIF4E, as well as from bound RNAs, resulting in the alleviation of translation repression. To investigate the mechanism by which FMRP represses translation in neurons, we examined the distribution of FMRP in sucrose gradients. As shown in Figure 1A, FMRP cofractionated with mRNPs with sedimentation values ranging from 40S to 80S. This profile is similar to the one observed for translational regulators such as mammalian p27/eIF6 and eIF4E (Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online). Interestingly, CYFIP1, which interacts with FMRP in the cytoplasm (Schenck et al., 2001Schenck A. Bardoni B. Moro A. Bagni C. Mandel J.L. A highly conserved protein family interacting with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and displaying selective interactions with FMRP-related proteins FXR1P and FXR2P.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 8844-8849Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), partially cofractionated with FMRP and eIF4E (Figure 1A, lanes 6–9, and Figure S1). Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which associates with translationally active and inactive mRNAs, cosedimented with mRNPs (Figure 1A), as well as with heavy polysomes (Figure S1). These sedimentation experiments suggest that FMRP, CYFIP, and eIF4E might reside in a common complex, perhaps with mRNA. We next investigated whether the FMRP-CYFIP1 complex could be retained with eIF4E on m7GTP-Sepharose. When the beads were incubated with total brain cytoplasmic extracts, both FMRP and CYFIP1 were recovered from them but only after specific elution with m7GTP (Figure 1B, lane 3). Whereas the recovery of FMRP varied according to salt concentration (data not shown), CYFIP1 recovery was not particularly salt sensitive. PABP was also present in the m7GTP eluate, whereas two other proteins not involved in mRNA translation, β-tubulin and reticulon 1C, were not specifically eluted. Interestingly, WAVE, a cytoplasmic protein interacting with CYFIP1 (Bogdan et al., 2004Bogdan S. Grewe O. Strunk M. Mertens A. Klambt C. Sra-1 interacts with Kette and Wasp and is required for neuronal and bristle development in Drosophila.Development. 2004; 131: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was also mostly not retained on the beads (Figure 1B, lane 3), suggesting a specific function of the FMRP-CYFIP1-eIF4E complex. Furthermore, neither CYFIP1 nor FMRP (Figure 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6) was present in the last wash; GTP greatly reduced the yield of the eluted complex (Figure 1B, lane 7), demonstrating the efficiency and specificity of the m7GTP elution. The FMRP-CYFIP1-eIF4E complex was also coprecipitated from brain extracts with specific FMRP antibody (Ferrari et al., 2007Ferrari F. Mercaldo V. Piccoli G. Sala C. Cannata S. Achsel T. Bagni C. The fragile X mental retardation protein-RNP granules show an mGluR-dependent localization in the post-synaptic spines.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A specific interaction among FMRP, eIF4E, and CYFIP1 was detected in wild-type (Figure 1C, lane 4) but not in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice (Figure 1C, lane 3) (Bakker et al., 1994Bakker C.E. Verheij C. Willemsen R. Vanderhelm R. Oerlemans F. Vermey M. Bygrave A. Hoogeveen A.T. Oostra B.A. Reyniers E. Fmr1 knockout mice: A model to study fragile X mental retardation.Cell. 1994; 78: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). RNase A treatment did not destroy the CYFIP1-FMRP-eIF4E interaction as assessed by CYFIP1 antibody coprecipitation (Figure 1D, compare lanes 2 and 6, and Figure S2), although a decrease in the FMRP-CYFIP1 association did occur (see below). These data indicate that the FMRP-CYFIP1-eIF4E complex is maintained primarily by protein-protein interactions. To investigate whether the binding of the CYFIP1-FMRP complex to m7GTP was mediated by FMRP, we performed m7GTP chromatography with FMR1 KO brain extracts (Figure 1E). The eIF4E-CYFIP1 association did not require FMRP (Figure 1E, lane 3). Furthermore, addition of exogenous human 4E-BP1 (Haghighat et al., 1995Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Repression of cap-dependent translation by 4E-binding protein 1: Competition with p220 for binding to eukaryotic initiation factor-4E.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) to brain extracts decreased the amount of FMRP-CYFIP1 bound to eIF4E (Figure 1F, lanes 2–4), suggesting that they competed for the same site on eIF4E. This was confirmed with a 4E-BP mutated in the eIF4E-binding site (Figure S3). We conclude from these data that the FMRP-CYFIP1 complex binds eIF4E. Translational repression occurs when 4E-BPs bind eIF4E to the exclusion of eIF4G (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K.

Consequently, we investigated whether the absence of a functional eIF4GI impaired the binding of CYFIP1-FMRP complex to eIF4E. After inactivation of eIF4GI by cleavage (Gradi et al., 1998Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proteolysis of human eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4GII, but not eIF4GI, coincides with the shutoff of host protein synthesis after poliovirus infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (Figure 1G, lane 1, asterisk), CYFIP1 and FMRP still bound eIF4E (Figure 1G, lane 2), indicating that binding of CYFIP1 to eIF4E does not require functional eIF4G. PABP at the 3′ terminus of mRNA interacts with the 5′ cap-binding complex and circularizes mRNAs (Mazumder et al., 2003Mazumder B. Seshadri V. Fox P.L.

Shared protein components of SINE RNPs.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To test whether the FMRP-CYFIP1 complex simultaneously interacts with PABP, we used poly(A)-Sepharose beads to isolate PABP and associated factors from brain extracts. The FMRP-CYFIP1 complex was recovered together with PABP (Figure S4A). The binding of CYFIP1 to PABP was independent of FMRP and BC1 RNA, as shown by the use of FMR1 and BC1 KO (Skryabin et al., 2003Skryabin B.V. Sukonina V. Jordan U. Lewejohann L. Sachser N. Muslimov I. Tiedge H. Brosius J. Neuronal untranslated BC1 RNA: targeted gene elimination in mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) brain extracts (Figure S4A). Moreover, the recovery of the FMRP-CYFIP1 complex was not due to nonspecific binding of CYFIP1 or FMRP to the polyribonucleotides affixed to the beads (Figure S4B). PABP and FMRP were also coimmunoprecipitated (Figure 1C, lane 4), indicating that FMRP and CYFIP1 are present in a complex containing both eIF4E and PABP. Because CYFIP1 bound m7GTP (Figure 1B) independently of FMRP (Figure 1E), we hypothesized that CYFIP1 might be a novel eIF4E-binding protein. eIF4G and several characterized 4E-BPs share a short consensus motif that is responsible for binding to eIF4E (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used multisequence alignments to search for a similar peptide that is conserved in the CYFIP protein family. A candidate peptide (residues 733 to 751, human CYFIP1, Swissprot annotation Q14467) was identified in the central region of CYFIP1. Here, several amino acids are conserved among CYFIP and human 4E-BPs, 4G-I, and 4G-III (Figure 2A). To validate the functional significance of this similarity, we compared a structural arrangement of the CYFIP1 peptide spanning residues 733 to 751 with the known structure of eIF4E when complexed with the 4E-BP1 peptide (Tomoo et al., 2005Tomoo K. Matsushita Y. Fujisaki H. Abiko F. Shen X. Taniguchi T. Miyagawa H. Kitamura K. Miura K. Ishida T. Structural basis for mRNA Cap-Binding regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E by 4E-binding protein, studied by spectroscopic, X-ray crystal structural, and molecular dynamics simulation methods.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, the CYFIP1 peptide (blue ribbon in Figure 2B) could potentially adopt the peculiar “reverse L shaped” structure with two α-helical turns located at its center that are stabilized by two internal salt bridges between residues Asp742-Arg744 and Glu748-Lys750. Moreover, the CYFIP1 peptide docks onto the molecular binding surface of eIF4E (red ribbon; Figures 2B and 2C), where 12 out of the 16 interactions formed between eIF4E and 4E-BP1 (Marcotrigiano et al., 1999Marcotrigiano J.

Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) are conserved. In particular, the internal salt bridge Asp742-Arg744 (Figure 2B and Figure S6A) restricts the available conformations of the basic residue Lys743 and is thus locked in a favorable position for the formation of a salt bridge with Glu132 of eIF4E (Figure 2B). The 4E-BP1 peptide (purple ribbon, Figure 2C) and the CYFIP1 binding peptide (blue ribbon, Figure 2C) overlap in their “reverse L shaped” predicted structure and fit into the eIF4E pocket. The m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography (Figure 1) and the in silico analysis (Figure 2) predict that residues 733 to 751 of CYFIP1 may fold into an eIF4E-binding domain even though the amino acid sequence does not conform to the previously established consensus YxxxxLL (Mader et al., 1995Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. The translation initiation factor eIF-4E binds to a common motif shared by the translation factor eIF-4 gamma and the translational repressors 4E-binding proteins.Mol.

A novel inhibitor of cap-dependent translation initiation in yeast: p20 competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The charged residues implicated in the interaction are important for establishing the recognition between CYFIP1 and eIF4E. Interestingly, this pattern is common among three different protein families (CYFIP, 4G, 4E-BPs) that interact with eIF4E (Figure 2A). To determine whether CYFIP1 is a 4E-BP, we performed GST-Sepharose pull-down assays using in vitro-synthesized 35S-methionin-labeled proteins. Like 4E-T (Ferraiuolo et al., 2005Ferraiuolo M.A. Basak S. Dostie J. Murray E.L. Schoenberg D.R. Sonenberg N. A role for the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T in P-body formation and mRNA decay.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A, lane 7), CYFIP1 was precipitated specifically by GST-eIF4E (Figure 3A, compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3), indicating that eIF4E directly interacts with CYFIP1. The binding of CYFIP1 to the GST-eIF4E W73A mutant was reduced by 70%, similar to the effect on 4E-T (Figure 3B). eIF4E simultaneously interacts with CYFIP1 and m7GTP, because both proteins were retained on m7GTP-Sepharose beads. The retention of CYFIP1 was insensitive to RNase and DNase (Figure S5). To verify the importance of the putative eIF4E-binding region for the eIF4E-CYFIP1 interaction, we introduced several mutations in the CYFIP1 sequence (Figure 3C), followed by chromatography on m7GTP-Sepharose (Figure 3D). First, the Asp742 and Arg744 residues were both mutated to alanine, thus removing the salt bridge at the beginning of the α helix and presumably allowing more flexibility of the critical Lys743. This mutant (A-A) bound 20% less efficiently than did the wild-type. We introduced other mutations that affect both internal salt bridges (Asp742Lys; Arg744Glu; Glu748Lys) and invert the electric charge of the critical lysine that is predicted to interact with eIF4E (Lys743Glu). Binding of this quadruple mutant (KEE-K) was reduced even further (by 60%), indicating that this region of CYFIP1 is involved in eIF4E binding. Finally, we studied the importance of the lysine that presumably interacts with eIF4E, mutating it to glutamate (-E-). This single substitution had an effect similar to that of the quadruple mutation; a reduction of 70% (compare the last two bars in Figure 3D, right panel). Because the substitution of Lys743 with a residue of opposite charge did not induce destabilization of the “reverse L shaped” structure of the CYFIP1 peptide, the strong inhibition of eIF4E binding indicates that Lys743 is involved in the interaction of CYFIP1 with eIF4E, as predicted by sequence and structural analysis (Figure S6). On the contrary, the two salt bridges, Asp742-Arg744 and Glu748-Lys750 (Figure 2A), stabilize the CYFIP1 peptide in a conformation that is able to interact with the eIF4E protein surface through Lys743. Mutagenesis of CYFIP1 where a 4E-BP motif similar to the YxxxxLL consensus was found (WFREFFL) (Figure S7) did not significantly change the binding to eIF4E. To assess whether the isolated CYFIP1 peptide, which includes the eIF4E-binding domain, binds purified eIF4E, we synthesized wild-type (WT) and two mutant peptides (K-EE-K and -E-, Figure 3C) affixed to biotin. The western blot in Figure 3E shows that under stringent conditions (300 mM NaCl), no eIF4E bound to either the control (lane 2) or the CYFIP1 mutant peptides (lanes 4 and 5), whereas the streptavidin beads containing the WT peptide efficiently bound purified human eIF4E (lane 3). In less stringent conditions (150 mM NaCl, lower panel) the mutant peptides also bound some eIF4E but with lower efficiency than did the WT peptide. Therefore, the region of CYFIP1 with structural homology to the 4E-BPs does indeed bind eIF4E. CYFIP1 specifically and directly interacts with eIF4E through the noncanonical motif DKRLRSECK, where the lysine at the second position is c"

Here, we describe a cell-free system based on Xenopus egg extracts that supports ICL repair. During DNA replication of a plasmid containing a site-specific ICL, two replication forks converge on the crosslink. Subsequent lesion bypass involves advance of a nascent leading strand to within one nucleotide of the ICL, followed by incisions, translesion DNA synthesis, and extension of the nascent strand beyond the lesion. Immunodepletion experiments suggest that extension requires DNA polymerase zeta. Ultimately, a significant portion of the input DNA is fully repaired, but not if DNA replication is blocked. Our experiments establish a mechanism for ICL repair that reveals how this process is coupled to DNA replication."

Thus, the degree to which individuals are physiologically responsive to threat appears to indicate the degree to which they advocate policies that protect the existing social structure from both external (outgroup) and internal (norm-violator) threats."

Whereas Nanog null ES cells display a reversible and moderate up-regulation of Xist in the absence of any apparent modification of Oct3/4 and Sox2 binding, the drastic release of all three factors from Xist intron 1 triggers rapid ectopic accumulation of Xist RNA. We conclude that the three main genetic factors underlying pluripotency cooperate to repress Xist and thus couple X inactivation reprogramming to the control of pluripotency during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009495925,"The different cell types in the central nervous system develop from a common pool of progenitor cells. The nuclei of progenitors move between the apical and basal surfaces of the neuroepithelium in phase with their cell cycle, a process termed interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In the retina of zebrafish mikre oko (mok) mutants, in which the motor protein Dynactin-1 is disrupted, interkinetic nuclei migrate more rapidly and deeply to the basal side and more slowly to the apical side. We found that Notch signaling is predominantly activated on the apical side in both mutants and wild-type. Mutant progenitors are, thus, less exposed to Notch and exit the cell cycle prematurely. This leads to an overproduction of early-born retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at the expense of later-born interneurons and glia. Our data indicate that the function of INM is to balance the exposure of progenitor nuclei to neurogenic versus proliferative signals."

Increased synaptic strength was not observed after stable behavioral responding. Thus, enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons may act to facilitate the transformation of neutral environmental stimuli to salient reward-predictive cues."

Here, we have tested whether such coordination is mediated by intramolecular tension generated by the ""neck linkers,"" mechanical elements that span between the motor domains. When tension is reduced by extending the neck linkers with artificial peptides, the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and forward stepping is impaired and motor's velocity decreases as a consequence. However, speed recovers to nearly normal levels when external tension is applied by an optical trap. Remarkably, external load also induces bidirectional stepping of an immotile kinesin that lacks its mechanical element (neck linker) and fuel (ATP). Our results indicate that the kinesin motor domain senses and responds to strain in a manner that facilitates its plus-end-directed stepping and communication between its two motor domains."
https://openalex.org/W1991862301,"Bacterial replication origins move towards opposite ends of the cell during DNA segregation. We have identified a proline-rich polar protein, PopZ, required to anchor the separated Caulobacter crescentus chromosome origins at the cell poles, a function that is essential for maintaining chromosome organization and normal cell division. PopZ interacts directly with the ParB protein bound to specific DNA sequences near the replication origin. As the origin/ParB complex is being replicated and moved across the cell, PopZ accumulates at the cell pole and tethers the origin in place upon arrival. The polar accumulation of PopZ occurs by a diffusion/capture mechanism that requires the MreB cytoskeleton. High molecular weight oligomers of PopZ assemble in vitro into a filamentous network with trimer junctions, suggesting that the PopZ network and ParB-bound DNA interact in an adhesive complex, fixing the chromosome origin at the cell pole."

Moreover, depending on the type of physiological responses studied, Atnos1 is not always deficient in NO induction and/or detection, as previously reported.

NO is involved in plant development; it represses flowering (1He Y. Tang R.H. Hao Y. Stevens R.D. Cook C.W. Ahn S.M. Jing L. Yang Z. Chen L. Guo F. Fiorani F. Jackson R.B. Crawford N.M. Pei Z.M.

NO production has also been detected following different environmental stresses. For example, NO regulates stomata closure in response to abiotic stress (4Neill S.J. Desikan R. Clarke A. Hancock J.T. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and in response to biotic stress, NO participates in induction of plant defenses (5Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D.F.

Although NO plays a role as significant in plants as it does in animals, NO synthesis in planta is still a matter of debate (8Wilson I.D. Neill S.J. Hancock J.T. Plant Cell Environ. 2008; 31: 622-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Two major routes have been proposed for NO formation in plants. The first one relies on the reduction of nitrite to NO. Several studies demonstrate that nitrate reductase, whose primary function is to catalyze the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, can convert nitrite to NO with low efficiency (9Yamasaki H. Sakihama Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Rockel P. Strube F. Rockel A. Wildt J. Kaiser W.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 103-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrite can also be reduced to NO by a plasma membrane-bound nitrite:NOreductase (11Stohr C. Stremlau S. J. Exp.

The second probable NO biosynthetic pathway uses arginine as a substrate, following a reaction similar to that observed for the well characterized animal NOSs. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest the existence of a mammalian NOS-like enzyme in plants. Application of arginine analogs, inhibitors of animal NOSs, results in a reduction of NO detected in plants (5Durner J. Wendehenne D. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Data demonstrating NOS activity of a variant form of the P protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex (18Chandok M.R. Ytterberg A.J. van Wijk K.J. Klessig D.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were found to be nonreproducible and unreliable and thus were retracted (19Travis J. Science. 2004; 306: 960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crawford and co-workers (20Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) identified the second potential NOS in A. thaliana, AtNOS1, based on homology to a hypothetical snail NOS or NOS partner that cross-reacted with mammalian NOS antibody (23% identity, 39.5% similarity, 30.1% gap between AtNOS1 and the snail protein using a local alignment) (20Guo F.Q.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2516-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AtNOS1 T-DNA knock-out plants (Atnos1) have a growth phenotype that can be rescued by the application of NO donor compounds. Moreover, chemical probes sensitive to NO indicated reduced NO levels in Atnos1 compared with wild type plants (20Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M.

However, several groups, including our laboratory and Crawford's, cannot reproduce the originally reported NOS activity with recombinant AtNOS1, calling into question the true function of this protein (25Crawford N.M.

AtNOS1 is a 561-amino acid protein that has no sequence homology to the animal NOSs. It belongs to the circularly permuted GTPase (cGTPase) family (28Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The central domain of AtNOS1-(176-350) contains guanine-binding motifs (G motifs) characteristic of small GTPases like Ras, Rho, and Cdc42 (29Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar), but in an unusual arrangement; G4-G5 are N-terminal of G1-G2-G3. Among the four subfamilies of cGTPase represented by YlqF (in Bacillus subtilis), YjeQ (in Escherichia coli), and YawG (in Saccharomyces pombe), YqeH (in B. subtilis) is the closest homolog of AtNOS1 (30% identity, 43.6% similarity, 15.5% gap) (Fig. 2A). Both proteins contain four conserved cysteines in the N-terminal region (zinc-binding domain (ZBD)) that can form a zinc finger motif CXGCXnCXRC of the treble clef family (30Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 31Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). They also possess a very similar C-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function (40.8% similarity, 22.3% gap). AtNOS1 contains an additional 101 residues at the N terminus comprising a predicted mitochondria targeting sequence and a short stretch of basic lysine residues (KKKKK). Little is known concerning the function of cGTPases in eukaryotes that could shed light on the possible role of AtNOS1 in plants, particularly in regard to NO accumulation. Bacterial cGTPases are essential for cell growth (32Arigoni F. Talabot F. Peitsch M. Edgerton M.D. Meldrum E. Allet E. Fish R. Jamotte T. Curchod M.L. Loferer H. Nat.

In bacteria and in some eukaryotes, this family of GTP-binding proteins is associated with RNA/ribosome binding function (28Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. J. Biol.

For example, YqeH has been shown to be essential for the viability of B. subtilis (33Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3539-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and to participate in ribosome biogenesis and assembly (38Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Koenigsknecht M. Britton R.A. J.

Syst. 2007; 82: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic homologs are found in other plants, such as tomato (64.7% identity) and rice (Q6YPG5, 60.5% identity) as well as in mice (NP_062810) and humans (NP_115689). Mammalian homologs have less homology to AtNOS1 (22.4 and 23.2% identity and 35 and 34.5% similarity for the mouse and the human homologs, respectively) and contain longer amino acid insertions (34.6 and 31.4% gap for the mouse and human homologs, respectively). These proteins also contain a mitochondrial targeting peptide at their N termini and, like AtNOS1, they seem to localize in this organelle (22Guo F.Q. Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3436-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 40Zemojtel T. Kolanczyk M. Kossler N. Stricker S. Lurz R. Mikula I. Duchniewicz M. Schuelke M. Ghafourifar P. Martasek P. Vingron M. Mundlos S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The function of AtNOS1 as an authentic NOS has been recently questioned. This led to the renaming of AtNOS1 as NO-associated protein 1 (AtNOA1) (25Crawford N.M. Galli M. Tischner R. Heimer Y.M. Okamoto M. Mack A. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 526-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, publications still refer to AtNOS/A1 as a potential NOS (41Shi F.M. Li Y.Z. BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 79-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tun N.N. Livaja M. Kieber J.J. Scherer G.F. New Phytol. 2008; 178: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the ability of AtNOS1 protein to bind and oxidize arginine into NO, using several independent assays. We demonstrate that AtNOS1 is not a NOS but a functional GTPase. We show that its GTPase activity is necessary but not sufficient for its function in planta. This new activity is discussed in the context of the defective NO accumulation phenotype of Atnos1. GTP and NADPH were purchased from Roche Applied Science, and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (BH4) came from Shircks Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). All other chemicals were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Proteins Expression and Purification—Plasmids used for neuronal NOS (nNOS) expression, pCWori+ containing the rat nNOS cDNA and pGroESL for chaperone protein expression, were kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Sari (CNRS UMR 8601, Université René Descartes, Paris, France). The expression and purification of nNOS protein was conducted in the presence of arginine and BH4, as previously reported (43Moreau M. Takahashi H. Sari M.A. Boucher J.L. Sagami I. Shimizu T. Mansuy D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The protein was buffer-exchanged using a Sephadex G25 column prior to use. The AtNOA1 cDNA clone was obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The cDNA encoding AtNOA1 full-length, the N-terminal deletion of 101 amino acids (Δ101) and the T327A mutant, the N-terminal truncation containing only the circularly permuted G-motif domains (CPG domains) and the CTD (residue 351-561) and the C-terminal truncated proteins (residues 102-350) were all generated by PCR and cloned into pET28 expression vector (Novagen) as N-terminal His6 tag fusions. Plasmids were transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. These cells were grown in LB media at 37 °C until A600 nm ∼ 0.6, and expression was induced by 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 20 h at 18 °C, cells were collected and lysed in buffer A supplemented with 5 mm imidazole (buffer A: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Soluble protein supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen), washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 was performed to further purify the proteins (buffer B: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Fractions of interest were pooled and concentrated before storage at −80 °C until further use. Protein concentrations were evaluated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. NO Formation—Rates of NO synthesis were determined at room temperature on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer using the oxyhemoglobin assay for NO (44Murphy M.E. Noack E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). A 150-μl reaction containing 20 μm oxyhemoglobin, 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase and catalase, 10 μm BH4, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin (CaM), 1 mm NADPH, and 100 μm arginine in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) and 5 mm dithiothreitol was prepared. The addition of protein (nNOS or AtNOA1) initiated the reaction. The NO-dependent conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored by scanning every 0.5 min between 380 and 450 nm. An extinction coefficient of 77 mm-1 cm-1 between the peak at 401 nm and the valley at 420 nm was used to quantify NO. All other NOS assays were conducted as previously described (45Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Arginine Binding—Arginine-binding experiments were carried out with 100 nm [2,3,4-3H]arginine (41 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without unlabeled arginine (100,000-fold molar excess) in 120 μl of buffer B for 15 min on ice. Unbound ligand was removed with a 1-ml G-25 Superfine (Amersham Biosciences) column by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,000 × g. Bound [2,3,4-3H]arginine was quantified by scintillation counting of 90 μl of filtrate. Homology Modeling—Alignment of AtNOA1-(175-534) (containing CPG and CTD) and YqeH-(59-369) was performed using the alignment program Tcoffee (46Poirot O. O'Toole E. Notredame C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3503-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model for AtNOA1-(175-534) was generated by comparative protein modeling through satisfaction of spatial restraints with the program MODELLER (47Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) using the x-ray structure for gsYqeH-(59-369) as a template (48Sudhamsu J. Lee G.I. Klessig D.F. Crane B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32968-32976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Complementation—Atnoa1 seeds were obtained from Dr. Nigel Crawford (University of California at San Diego). For constitutive expression of AtNOA1 or AtNOA1D226N in plants, the open reading frame of the corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into plant transformation vector pF3PZPY122 (49Feng S.H. Ma L.G. Wang X.P. Xie D.X. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Wei N. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that encodes for the corresponding protein tagged by three tandem FLAG epitopes at the C terminus. For the expression of the CTD-truncated AtNOA1 in plants, AtNOA1-(1-386) cDNA was amplified and cloned into the plant transformation vector pBIN61HA that encodes AtNOA1-(1-386) protein tagged with an HA epitope at the C terminus (50Bendahmane A. Farnham G. Moffett P. Baulcombe D.C. Plant J. 2002; 32: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The different constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium medium strain GV3101, and recombinants were screened on LB medium containing chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml for pF3PZPY122) or kanamycin (30 μg/ml for pBIN61HA). Atnoa1 plants were transformed by the floral dip method (51Zhang X. Henriques R. Lin S.S. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Nat. Prot. 2006; 1: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The transgenic plants were selected for gentamicin (50 μg/ml in Murashige-Skoog medium for pF3ZPY122) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml for pBIN61HA) resistance and allowed to set seeds. Although the Atnoa1 mutants were originally generated by an insertion of T-DNA conferring kanamycin resistance, they developed antibiotic sensitivity after inbreeding for several generations (data not shown) (20Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 52Kilby N.J. Leyser H.M.O. Furner I.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Seeds of a T2 family were planted on Murashige-Skoog medium containing the corresponding antibiotics, incubated at 4 °C for 3 days in darkness, and transferred at 22 °C for 2 weeks under the long day condition (18-h light/6-h darkness). For AtNOA1-(1-386), seedlings displaying vigorous root growth were transferred to soil for further growth under the same long day condition. As controls, wild-type and Atnoa1 seeds were treated similarly except for the germination on Murashige-Skoog medium without the antibiotics. The genotypes of T1 and T2 plants were confirmed by genomic DNA PCR for knock-out of wild type AtNOA. Constitutive expression of AtNOA1 and AtNOA1D226N was examined by Western blotting analysis with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used to probe for AtNOA1-(1-386) expression. GTP Binding—N-Methylanthraniloyl-labeled GDP (MantGDP) was provided by Dr. Richard Cerione (Cornell University). Fluorescence of MantGDP was measured on a Varian Eclipse spectrofluorimeter in Dr. Cerione's laboratory. Kd for MantGDP binding to AtNOA1 was determined with 1 μm protein at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with 200 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 when indicated. Increasing amounts of MantGDP (up to 2 μm final concentration) were added, and the fluorescence was measured (excitation, 356 nm; emission, 450 nm) and corrected with the corresponding signal in the absence of protein. The resulting relative fluorescence of MantGDP-Δ101 complex was plotted as a function of MantGDP concentration, and the curve was fitted to a one-site-binding hyperbolic function with Origin Pro 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). For competition assays, proteins were mixed with 200 nm MantGDP until saturation of the fluorescence signal (∼1.5 μm Δ101). Increasing amounts of GTP, GDP, ATP, or CTP were added, and the fluorescence signal was recorded at equilibrium. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the following equation: relative fluorescence (%) = ((MantGDP fluorescence in the presence of competitor - basal MantGDP fluorescence)/(MantGDP fluorescence in the absence of competitor - basal MantGDP fluorescence)) × 100. The percentage of bound competitor was derived from the relative fluorescence and plotted as a function of the competitor concentration. IC50 values, corresponding to the amount of competitor necessary to observe a 50% decrease in fluorescence, were calculated. GTPase Activity—To demonstrate that Δ101 was indeed a functional GTPase, 20 or 40 μm protein was incubated with 500 μm GTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl in buffer B at 37 °C overnight. Samples were boiled for 5 min to stop the reaction and precipitate the proteins and then were centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Waters Sunfire C18 5 μm (4.5 × 250-mm) column. Nucleotides were separated with an isocratic condition at 1 ml/min of 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 0.2 mm NaN3, and 7.5% acetonitrile. Control reactions in the absence of protein were analyzed following the same procedure. Rates of GTP hydrolysis were quantified by measuring [32P]phosphate release (53Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reactions containing 1 nm [γ-32P]GTP (2 μCi) and varying amounts of cold GTP were prepared in 300 μl of buffer B supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and 200 mm KCl. The reaction was started by the addition of the protein. At various times, as indicated in the figures, 50-μl aliquots were mixed with 1 ml of activated charcoal (5% in 50 mm NaH2PO4). After a 1-min centrifugation, [γ-32P]phosphates in the supernatant were counted on a liquid scintillation counter. Counts/min were plotted as a function of time for the different GTP concentrations. Reactions in the absence of protein were conducted to control for spontaneous hydrolysis. Km and Vmax values were determined by plotting the initial velocity of GTP hydrolysis (v0) as a function of the substrate concentration. Curves were fitted to the equation, v0 = (Vmax × [GTP])/(Km + [GTP]) using Origin Pro 7.5 software. AtNOS1 Is Not a Nitric-oxide Synthase—The AtNOS1 full-length (fl) and a deletion variant with the first 101 amino acids removed (Δ101) were expressed in E. coli and tested for their ability to generate NO from arginine. The N-terminal deletion increases the solubility and stability of the protein by removing a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as additional residues not found in the bacterial homolog YqeH (see Fig. 2A). Five different assays were used to assess the NO synthesis ability of AtNOS1, with the rat nNOS included in all assays as a positive control. First, the hemoglobin assay was used to follow the rapid conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin by enzymatically generated NO. The reactions were performed with AtNOS1 fl and Δ101 in the presence of arginine and NADPH and with or without mammalian NOS cofactors, such as CaM, calcium, or BH4. Methemoglobin formation was not observed with AtNOS1 in any of the conditions tested (Fig. 1A). Second, a colorimetric Griess assay was used to detect the NO oxidation product nitrite in reactions including AtNOS1 fl or Δ101 and a combination of possible cofactors. Again, the recombinant proteins were unable to generate nitrite via NO from arginine (data not shown). Mammalian NOSs generate citrulline from arginine as a NO co-product; AtNOS1 failed to produce radiolabeled citrulline from [3H]arginine in this third assay (data not shown). All three NOS assays require electron transfer from NADPH for product formation. We were unable to detect NADPH oxidation or cytochrome c reduction by AtNOS1 (data not shown). To test the possibilities that AtNOS1 converts arginine to NO via a mechanism different from that of mammalian NOSs or that the lack of a suitable reductase component in our reconstituted system was preventing the detection of AtNOS1 activity, we assessed whether AtNOS1 is at least competent in binding its hypothetical substrate arginine. Neither Δ101 nor fl bound [3H]arginine in an exclusion chromatography assay (Fig. 1B). The addition of potential cofactors, such as NADPH, CaM, and Ca2+, as suggested by the original report (20Guo F.Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) did not promote arginine binding to Δ101 (Fig. 1B). In this and all other assays, the mammalian nNOS control gave positive results, indicating that these assays were working. Together, these results demonstrate that AtNOS1 neither binds nor oxidizes arginine to NO via a mechanism analogous to that of the mammalian NOSs (Table 1). Therefore, from this point onward, we will follow the suggestion to use AtNOA1 (A. thaliana NO-associated protein 1) to refer to this protein (25Crawford N.M. Galli M. Tischner R. Heimer Y.M. Okamoto M. Mack A.

https://openalex.org/W2099611734,"Cell polarization is an integral part of many unrelated bacterial processes. How intrinsic cell polarization is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that Caulobacter crescentus uses a multimeric pole-organizing factor (PopZ) that serves as a hub to concurrently achieve several polarizing functions. During chromosome segregation, polar PopZ captures the ParB•ori complex and thereby anchors sister chromosomes at opposite poles. This step is essential for stabilizing bipolar gradients of a cell division inhibitor and setting up division near midcell. PopZ also affects polar stalk morphogenesis and mediates the polar localization of the morphogenetic and cell cycle signaling proteins CckA and DivJ. Polar accumulation of PopZ, which is central to its polarizing activity, can be achieved independently of division and does not appear to be dictated by the pole curvature. Instead, evidence suggests that localization of PopZ largely relies on PopZ multimerization in chromosome-free regions, consistent with a self-organizing mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2066147981,"Understanding cell morphogenesis during metazoan development requires knowledge of how cells and the extracellular matrix produce and respond to forces. We investigated how apoptosis, which remodels tissue by eliminating supernumerary cells, also contributes forces to a tissue (the amnioserosa) that promotes cell-sheet fusion (dorsal closure) in the Drosophila embryo. We showed that expression in the amnioserosa of proteins that suppress or enhance apoptosis slows or speeds dorsal closure, respectively. These changes correlate with the forces produced by the amnioserosa and the rate of seam formation between the cell sheets (zipping), key processes that contribute to closure. This apoptotic force is used by the embryo to drive cell-sheet movements during development, a role not classically attributed to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1989486497,"In microorganisms, menaquinone is an obligatory component of the electron-transfer pathway. It is derived from chorismate by seven enzymes in Escherichia coli. However, a bioinformatic analysis of whole genome sequences has suggested that some microorganisms, including pathogenic species such as Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, do not have orthologs of the men genes, even though they synthesize menaquinone. We deduced the outline of this alternative pathway in a nonpathogenic strain of Streptomyces by bioinformatic screening, gene knockouts, shotgun cloning with isolated mutants, and in vitro studies with recombinant enzymes. As humans and commensal intestinal bacteria, including lactobacilli, lack this pathway, it represents an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2040531575,"The microscopic insight into how and why catalytically active nanoparticles change their shape during oxidation and reduction reactions is a pivotal challenge in the fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. We report an oxygen-induced shape transformation of rhodium nanoparticles on magnesium oxide (001) substrates that is lifted upon carbon monoxide exposure at 600 kelvin. A Wulff analysis of high-resolution in situ x-ray diffraction, combined with transmission electron microscopy, shows that this phenomenon is driven by the formation of a oxygen–rhodium–oxygen surface oxide at the rhodium nanofacets. This experimental access into the behavior of such nanoparticles during a catalytic cycle is useful for the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2104016860,"The Stardust spacecraft returned cometary samples that contain crystalline material, but the origin of the material is not yet well understood. We found four crystalline particles from comet 81P/Wild 2 that were apparently formed by flash-melting at a high temperature and are texturally, mineralogically, and compositionally similar to chondrules. Chondrules are submillimeter particles that dominate chondrites and are believed to have formed in the inner solar nebula. The comet particles show oxygen isotope compositions similar to chondrules in carbonaceous chondrites that compose the middle-to-outer asteroid belt. The presence of the chondrulelike objects in the comet suggests that chondrules have been transported out to the cold outer solar nebula and spread widely over the early solar system."

We show that a neural circuit involving npr-1 , which encodes a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) related to mammalian neuropeptide Y receptors, functions to suppress innate immune responses. The immune inhibitory function requires a guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate–gated ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4 as well as the soluble guanylate cyclase GCY-35. Furthermore, we show that npr-1 – and gcy-35 –expressing sensory neurons actively suppress immune responses of nonneuronal tissues. A full-genome microarray analysis on animals with altered neural function due to mutation in npr-1 shows an enrichment in genes that are markers of innate immune responses, including those regulated by a conserved PMK-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These results present evidence that neurons directly control innate immunity in C. elegans , suggesting that GPCRs may participate in neural circuits that receive inputs from either pathogens or infected sites and integrate them to coordinate appropriate immune responses."

Using a synthetic approach, a versatile library of 486 systematic histone H3 and H4 substitution and deletion mutants that probes the contribution of each residue to nucleosome function was generated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We probed fitness contributions of each residue to perturbations of chromosome integrity and transcription, mapping global patterns of chemical sensitivities and requirements for transcriptional silencing onto the nucleosome surface. Each histone mutant was tagged with unique molecular barcodes, facilitating identification of histone mutant pools through barcode amplification, labeling, and TAG microarray hybridization. Barcodes were used to score complex phenotypes such as competitive fitness in a chemostat, DNA repair proficiency, and synthetic genetic interactions, revealing new functions for distinct histone residues and new interdependencies among nucleosome components and their modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W1993333696,"Stem cells self-renew or differentiate under the governance of a stem-cell-specific transcriptional program, with each transcription factor orchestrating the activities of a particular set of genes. Here we demonstrate that a single transcription factor is able to regulate distinct core circuitries in two different blastocyst-derived stem cell lines, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells. The transcription factor Sall4 is required for early embryonic development and for ESC pluripotency. Sall4 is also expressed in XEN cells, and depletion of Sall4 disrupts self-renewal and induces differentiation. Genome-wide analysis reveals that Sall4 is regulating different gene sets in ESCs and XEN cells, and depletion of Sall4 targets in the respective cell types induces differentiation. With Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, Sall4 forms a crucial interconnected autoregulatory network in ESCs. In XEN cells, Sall4 regulates the key XEN lineage-associated genes Gata4, Gata6, Sox7, and Sox17. Our findings demonstrate how Sall4 functions as an essential stemness factor for two different stem cell lines."

However, the accuracy of these models is difficult to evaluate because little is known of the history of permafrost and its response to past warm intervals of climate.

Expression of these genes is conversely regulated in the liver in response to fasting and feeding. We explored the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of these genes by nutritional condition and found that reciprocal function of HNF-4 and Foxo1 plays an important role in this process. In the GK gene regulation, Foxo1 represses HNF-4-potentiated transcription of the gene, whereas it synergizes with HNF-4 in activating the G6Pase gene transcription. These opposite actions of Foxo1 concomitantly take place in the cells under no insulin stimulus, and such gene-specific action was promoter context-dependent. Interestingly, HNF-4-binding elements (HBEs) in the GK and G6Pase promoters were required both for the insulin-stimulated GK gene activation and insulin-mediated G6Pase gene repression. Indeed, mouse in vivo imaging showed that mutating the HBEs in the GK and G6Pase promoters significantly impaired their reactivity to the nutritional states, even in the presence of intact Foxo1-binding sites (insulin response sequences). Thus, in the physiological response of the GK and G6Pase genes to fasting/feeding conditions, Foxo1 distinctly decodes the promoter context of these genes and differently modulates the function of HBE, which then leads to opposite outcomes of gene transcription.

The liver plays an important role in maintaining plasma glucose homeostasis by adjusting a delicate balance between hepatic glucose utilization and production via the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. These physiologically opposed cascades are regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level of the glucokinase (GK) 2The abbreviations used are: GK, glucokinase; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; IRS, insulin response sequence; HBE, HNF-4-binding element; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; CBP, CREB-binding protein; L-PK, liver-type pyruvate kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; hG6Pase, human G6Pase; rGK, rat GK; CMV, cytomegalovirus. and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) genes, which catalyze the first and last rate-limiting steps in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. A number of studies have shown that fasting/feeding (or hormone) controls transcription of these two enzymes in the opposite direction. Fasting is associated with inhibition of GK transcription, whereas feeding or insulin treatment activates its transcription (1Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.R. J. Biol.

On the other hand, unphosphorylated form of Foxo1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with insulin response sequences (IRSs) present within the promoter regions of multiple target genes, including the G6Pase gene, and activates their transcription. Recent reports have demonstrated that Foxo1, in some cases, can also be recruited to a promoter through a DNA-binding transcription factor and act as a transcriptional repressor (11Hirota K.

However, little is known about how these two modes switch and what determines its state as activator or repressor in vivo. The HNF-4, expressed mainly in the liver, kidney, and intestine, binds to a specific DNA element (HNF-4-binding element (HBE)) as a homodimer and activates transcription of many genes that are involved in glucose, fatty acid, and cholesterol metabolism (16Sladek F.M.

Of particular interest, HNF-4 activates the transcription of both GK and G6Pase genes, which, as mentioned above, are oppositely regulated by nutritional manipulation (21Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Rajas F. Gautier A. Bady I. Montano S. Mithieux G. J. Biol.

However, it has not yet been determined how HNF-4 is involved in the nutritional regulation of these genes. If involved, because HNF-4 itself acts exclusively as an activator, it is reasonable to hypothesize that another nutritional status-regulated factor may modulate the function of the HNF-4 in an opposite way in regulating GK and G6Pase gene transcription. Previously, we have reported that HNF-4 directly interacts with Foxo1 (11Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is regulated in its localization in response to nutritional transition. Therefore, we hypothesized that Foxo1 is involved in the HNF-4-dependent regulation of these genes in response to metabolic status. Here, we show in cell transfection assays that Foxo1 represses the HNF-4-potentiated expression of the GK gene and simultaneously exerts synergistic activation on the HNF-4-dependent transcription of the G6Pase gene. Both of these HNF-4-dependent effects are abrogated by treating cells with insulin, which translocates Foxo1 to the cytosol. Importantly, the gene-specific effects of Foxo1 on HNF-4 functions were promoter context-dependent (i.e. different combination of HBEs and IRSs on the promoters). To gain insight into this regulation in a more physiological situation, we employed in vivo imaging technology and demonstrated that HBEs are in fact required for the regulation of these two genes in response to fasting and feeding. These data strongly imply that opposite effects of Foxo1 on GK and G6Pase gene expression require HNF-4 activity and that reciprocal action of Foxo1 and HNF-4 is an important determinant of the metabolic shift toward the glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Western Blotting—HepG2, HeLa, and CV1 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the livers of 8-week-old male C57BL6 mice or HepG2 cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). After electrophoresis, RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subsequently hybridized with specific 32P-labeled cDNA probes.

Primers for β-actin were purchased from TaKaRa. siRNA—For transfection of siRNAs, HepG2 cells at 30–50% confluence were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAi max (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty-six h after siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with DNA using GeneJuice® Transfection Regent (Merck). Green fluorescent protein siRNAs were purchased from B-Bridge International, Inc. The siRNA duplexes were used as follows; CBP (sense, 5′-aauccacaguaccgagaaatt-3′; antisense, 5′-uuucucgguacuguggauutt-3′), HNF-4, and PGC1α (Dharmacon). Protein and RNA were extracted at 72 h after transfection of siRNA. Expression levels of HNF-4 were analyzed by immunoblot, and G6Pase expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—HepG2 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CV1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.25% glucose. Transfections were performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) or GeneJuice® Transfection Regent (Merck). Thirty-three ng of pCMV-βgal or pRSV-βgal plasmid was included in each experiment to control for transfection efficiency. To ensure equal DNA amounts, empty plasmids were added to each transfection. Luciferase activity was measured with an ARVO™SX 1420 Multilabel Counter (Wallac Berthold) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity in the same sample. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate. ChIP Assay—The liver from a C57BL/6 mouse was excised, rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The livers were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through a cell strainer, and the sample was centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was used as hepatic nuclei. ChIP assays were performed as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) with some modifications. Cross-linking between transcription factors and chromatin was achieved by adding formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) to hepatic nuclei for 15 min for 37 °C.

Eight- to 10-week-old male ICR mice were given a rapid (5–6-s) tail vein injection of FLuc plasmids 2 μg (rGK-WT, rGK-ΔHBE, hG6Pase-WT, hG6Pase-mutHBE, or hG6Pase ΔIRS-LUC plasmid) combined with RLuc plasmid 1 μg (pRLSV40) and pCMV-βgal 22 μg in Ringer's solution in a volume of 2.5 ml. The pRLSV40 plasmid (Renilla luciferase reporter; Toyo-ink) was used as an internal control to normalize for infusion efficiency. To measure RLuc bioluminescence signals, mice were anesthetized by isofluran and given a tail vein injection of native coelenterazine (0.2 mg/ml in 100 μl). One min after coelenterazine administration, mice were imaged for 1 min with a Xenogen imaging system. Timed images were quantitatively analyzed by Living image version 2.5 software. To measure FLuc bioluminesecence signals, mice were anesthetized by isofluran. Anesthetized mice were intraperitoneal injected with firefly d-luciferin (30 mg/ml luciferin in 150 μl of sterile saline (Promega)). Five and 10 min after d-luciferin administration, mice were imaged for 1 min with a Xenogen imaging system. Timed images were quantitatively analyzed by Living image version 2.5 software. For GK, the first group of mice was allowed free access to food ad libitum, and the second group of mice was subjected to a fast for 8 h. Mice were then given an intraperitoneal injection of firefly d-luciferin, and glucose and insulin levels were measured from tail vein blood. After imaging with a Xenogen imaging system, mice were allowed free access to food ad libitum, given a tail vein injection of native coelenterazine, and imaged. For G6Pase, the first group of mice was allowed free access to food ad libitum, and the second group of mice was subjected to a fast for 5 h. Mice were given a tail vein injection of native coelenterazine. After imaging with a Xenogen imaging system, mice were either allowed free access to food ad libitum or subjected to a fast for 19 h again. Then mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of firefly d-luciferin and imaged, and glucose levels in tail vein blood and insulin levels in blood from the inferior vena cava were measured.

The critical residues in the DNA binding domains of HNF-4α2 and Foxo1 were mutated by PCR mutagenesis. The mPGC1α cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 tagged with the HA epitope (pcDNA3HA). Genomic fragments encompassing the human and rat glucokinase promoters extending from –1492 to +31 bp and from –1431 to +23 bp relative to the transcription initiation sites, respectively, were cloned into pGV-Basic vector II (firefly luciferase reporter; Toyo-ink) to generate hGK- and rGK-Luc constructs. To construct hG6Pase-WT LUC plasmid, an 800-bp (from –826 to +7 bp) DNA fragment containing the hG6Pase gene promoter was cloned into pGV-Basic vector II (firefly luciferase reporter; Toyo-ink). The hG6Pase-ΔIRS123 and hG6Pase-mutHBE plasmids were generated within the context of hG6Pase-WT Luc.

On the other hand, GK mRNA level was lower in the fasting state and higher in the feeding state (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrate that activity of these two enzymes is conversely controlled by nutritional status, at least in part at the gene expression level. Expression levels of HNF-4 and Foxo1 were largely not affected (Fig. S1, A and B). Since it is established that HNF-4 binds and activates the rat GK promoter (29Roth U. Curth K. Unterman T.G. Kietzmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2623-2631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we identified an HBE in the human GK promoter at the corresponding region of the rat gene (Fig. S2, A–C). We next examined an effect of HNF-4 on the transcriptional activity of GK and G6Pase genes. Although HNF-4 strongly potentiated the promoter activity of these two genes (Fig. 1B) (21Roth U. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Hirota K. Aoyama H. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol.

We therefore explored whether HNF-4 plays any role in these processes. HNF-4-potentiated GK Promoter Activity Is Modulated by Foxo1 in Response to Insulin—A previous study showed that hepatic expression of constitutively active Foxo1 in transgenic mice was related to reduced GK gene expression (30Zhang W. Patil S. Chauhan B. Guo S. Powell D.R. Le J. Klotsas A. Matika R. Xiao X. Franks R. Heidenreich K.A. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Stolz D.B. Tso P. Koo S.H. Montminy M. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10105-10117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A genetic study with liver-specific disruption of Foxo1 in mice also suggests that Foxo1 suppresses GK expression in the liver when insulin signaling is disrupted (31Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how Foxo1 is involved in a repression of the GK gene expression. On the other hand, we have previously shown, by using an artificial model promoter composed of eight tandem HBEs plus the TK promoter, that Foxo1 repressed HNF-4-potentiated transcriptional activity, and this repression was abrogated by treating the cells with insulin (11Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether Foxo1 repression of the HNF-4-mediated transcriptional activity also took place in the GK promoter context. In the cell transfection assay into HepG2 cells, HNF-4 strongly activated the GK promoter, regardless of insulin addition. When Foxo1 WT was cotransfected with HNF-4 in the absence of insulin, GK promoter activity was remarkably repressed, although no repression was observed in the absence of transfected HNF-4 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, insulin stimulation significantly canceled the repression of HNF-4-dependent GK promoter activity in the presence of Foxo1 WT but not of the 3A mutant, in which three putative Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr-24, Ser-253, and Ser-316) were replaced by nonphosphorylatable alanine residues (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3, B and C). We revealed that the Foxo1 WT was much more abundantly expressed than Foxo1 3A mutant (Fig. 1D); however, the 3A mutant repressed the HNF-4-dependent GK-LUC activity to the same extent as the WT did. Considering that Foxo1 3A mutant dominantly localized in the nucleus, we speculate that the Foxo1 WT and 3A variants are equally expressed in the nucleus. Next, to investigate the recruitment of Foxo1 to the GK promoter in vivo, we performed ChIP analysis using primers that amplify the HBE of the GK promoter on hepatic nuclei from fasted and refed mice (Fig. 1E). The results obtained by qRT-PCR indicated that HNF-4 binds to the HBE either in the fasted or refed state. On the other hand, Foxo1 is preferentially recruited to the HBE on GK promoter in the liver of fasted mice but not in one of refed mice. Together, these results suggest that Foxo1 is recruited to the HBE of the GK promoter through the binding to HNF-4 and represses its transcriptional activity, whereas feeding or insulin signal results in the dissociation of Foxo1 from the HBE through the phosphorylation of Foxo1, leading to enhancement of the HNF-4-dependent transcriptional activity. These results support our idea that interplay between HNF-4 and Foxo1 plays a role in the insulin response of GK gene expression. Foxo1 Synergizes with HNF-4 on the G6Pase Promoter—Next, we explored the effect of functional interplay between Foxo1 and HNF-4 on the G6Pase gene transcription. Previous tra"

A common feature in these conditions is the frequent detection of antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). TREX1 participates in a cell death process implicating this major 3′ → 5′ exonuclease in genomic DNA degradation to minimize potential immune activation by persistent self DNA. The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations were identified in AGS and FCL, respectively. TREX1 enzymes containing the D200N and D18N mutations were compared using nicked dsDNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) degradation assays. The TREX1WT/D200N and TREX1WT/D18N heterodimers are completely deficient at degrading dsDNA and degrade ssDNA at an expected ∼2-fold lower rate than TREX1WT enzyme. Further, the D200N- and D18N-containing TREX1 homo- and heterodimers inhibit the dsDNA degradation activity of TREX1WT enzyme, providing a likely explanation for the dominant phenotype of these TREX1 mutant alleles in AGS and FCL. By comparison, the TREX1 R114H homozygous mutation causes AGS and is found as a heterozygous mutation in systemic lupus erythematosus. The TREX1R114H/R114H homodimer has dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA degradation activities and does not detectibly inhibit the TREX1WT enzyme, whereas the TREX1WT/R114H heterodimer has a functional dsDNA degradation activity, supporting the recessive genetics of TREX1 R114H in AGS.

The structure of TREX1 catalytic domain with bound DNA reveals the protein-polynucleotide interactions that explain the preference for multiple unpaired 3′ termini in TREX1 exonuclease action and highlights the extensive interface contacts in the stable dimeric enzyme (9deSilva U.

A short ssDNA of approximately four nucleotides is accommodated in the TREX1 active site, and the Arg-128 interacting with the polynucleotide bases is proposed to destabilize dsDNA to provide ssDNA to the enzyme active site. A stable TREX1 dimer is generated through extensive interactions between the β3 strands and the α4 helices of each protomer at the interface (see Fig. 1). The hydrogen bonding network between protomers includes backbone contacts of the β3 strands and three pairs of side chain contacts from each protomer. The antiparallel α4 helices contribute hydrophobic packing interactions between the protomers. Symmetry in the TREX1 dimer positions the active sites of each protomer at opposite outer edges, providing open access for binding of two ssDNA polynucleotides. The dimeric structure of TREX1 and the closely related TREX2 (10Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol.

Defective TREX1 in humans might result in the failure to degrade ssDNA or dsDNA leading to immune activation and development of autoantibodies to these macromolecules. The source of this DNA could be genomic from the billions of cells that die daily in humans or from DNA replication and repair intermediates generated in the “normal” maintenance of genome integrity. The TREX1 dimer structure, its stability, and the noncatalytic C-terminal region have implications for enzyme dysfunction dependent upon the allele-specific mutation.

We have proposed that TREX1 degrades DNA by acting at nicked dsDNA generated by the NM23-H1 endonuclease during cell death (6Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P.C. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and others have proposed that TREX1 degrades ssDNA generated from processing of aberrant replication intermediates (8Yang Y.G. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Cell. 2007; 131: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) or derived from endogenous retroelements (24Stetson D.B. Ko J.S. Heidmann T. Medzhitov R. Cell. 2008; 134: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). To establish a link between TREX1 3′ exonuclease dysfunction and human autoimmune disease phenotype, we designed a dsDNA degradation assay to measure the activity of TREX1 variants using a nicked dsDNA substrate. Using this assay, we show that TREX1 enzymes containing the dominant D200N and D18N mutations are defective in dsDNA degradation activity. Moreover, these TREX1 mutants are likely trapped in nonproductive enzyme-DNA complexes at the sites of nicked DNA, thus inhibiting the dsDNA degradation activity of the TREX1WT enzyme, supporting the dominant phenotypes of the TREX1 D200N and D18N mutations. Further, we show that the TREX1R114H/R114H homodimer degrades dsDNA ∼300-fold less efficiently than TREX1WT, and this dsDNA degradation dysfunction is not detected in the TREX1WT/R114H heterodimer. These TREX1 enzymatic data parallel the genetic findings of TREX1 homozygous R114H in AGS and heterozygous R114H in SLE. These results support a role for TREX1 in dsDNA degradation to prevent immune activation leading to autoimmune disease. Materials—The synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide 5′-ATACGACGGTGACAGTGTTGTCAGACAGGT-3′ with 5′ fluorescein was from Operon. Plasmids 1 (9.4 kb) and 2 (10.8 kb) are derivatives of the pMYB5 plasmid (New England Biolabs). Plasmid 1 contains one Nt.BbvCI restriction enzyme site, and plasmid 2 contains two Nt.BbvCI sites ∼800 nucleotides apart in opposite orientation. Plasmid 2 contains unique EcoRI and SacI restriction enzyme sites. The plasmids were purified from bacterial cultures and from restriction enzyme digests using Qiagen kits. Enzyme Preparation—The human TREX1 enzymes contain the catalytic core amino acids 1–242. The TREX1 homodimers were first expressed in bacteria as N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions with a PreScission Protease recognition sequence between the MBP and TREX1. The pLM303 plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) for overexpression. The cells were grown to an A600 = 0.5 at 37 °C and quickly cooled on ice to 17 °C. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were allowed to grow for 15 h at 17 °C. The MBP-TREX1 fusion protein was bound to an amylose resin (New England Biolabs), washed, and the column resin was incubated at 4 °C overnight with PreScission Protease (GE Biosciences) to separate TREX1 from MBP. The TREX1 was collected from the column flow-through, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and purified to homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography (9deSilva U.

To generate TREX1 heterodimers, the mutant TREX1 was cloned into pLM303X (14Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D. Harvey S. Gong M. Senenko L. Engel K. Pfeiffer C. Hollis T. Gahr M. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Hubner N. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and WT TREX1 was cloned into the pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen). Mutant TREX1 plasmids were produced using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy (21Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression from pLM303X generates MBP-TREX1MUT and expression from pCDFDuet-1 generates HisNusAHis-TREX1WT, with both fusion proteins containing a PreScission Protease sequence between the affinity tag and TREX1. Coexpression of pLM303X and pCDFDuet-1 plasmids in the same bacterial cell as described above generates a mixture of TREX1WT/WT homodimers, TREX1WT/MUT heterodimers, and TREX1MUT/MUT homodimers. Only the TREX1WT/MUT heterodimer contains both affinity tags. The TREX1WT/WT and TREX1WT/MUT were first recovered by chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The TREX1WT/MUT heterodimer was then bound to an amylose resin and washed, and the column resin was incubated at 4 °C overnight with PreScission Protease to separate TREX1WT/MUT heterodimer from the MBP and NusA. The TREX1WT/MUT was collected and purified to homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by A280 using the molar extinction coefficient for human TREX1 protomer ϵ = 23,950 m-1 cm-1. Exonuclease Assays—The exonuclease reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 nm fluorescein-labeled 30-mer oligonucleotide (ssDNA assays) or 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA (dsDNA assays), and TREX1 protein as indicated in the figure legends. For all assays, the TREX1 enzyme and variant mixtures were prepared on ice at 10 times the final concentrations and added to reactions to yield the indicated final concentrations. Incubations were for the indicated times at 25 °C. After incubation, the samples were removed, quenched by the addition of three volumes of cold ethanol, and dried in vacuo. For ssDNA assays, the reaction products were processed and quantified as described (9deSilva U. Choudhury S. Bailey S.L. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol.

For dsDNA assays, the reaction products were resuspended in 20 μl of TAE-agarose gel running solution and electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. DNA was visualized using a FluorChem 8900 imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Activity was determined by calculating the time for TREX1WT (7.6 nm) to completely degrade the nicked polynucleotide of the dsDNA (30 μm as nucleotide) to dNMP as indicated by the loss of ethidium bromide staining material and the accumulation of the un-nicked ssDNA visible in the agarose gels. The TREX1 exonuclease degrades DNA polynucleotides to nucleoside monophosphates from available 3′ termini. We showed previously that TREX1 removes nucleotides from ssDNA and dsDNA oligonucleotide constructs (1Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol.

The TREX1 structure indicates that four nucleotides of ssDNA, not dsDNA, bind into the active sites of each protomer of the dimer (9deSilva U. Choudhury S. Bailey S.L. Harvey S. Perrino F.W.

The Asp-200 and Asp-18 residues are two of the divalent metal ion Mg2+-coordinating aspartates in the TREX1 active site required for catalysis (Fig. 1). TREX1 is a homodimer, so TREX1 dimers in cells of the AGS heterozygous individual could be TREX1D200N/D200N and TREX1WT homodimers and TREX1WT/D200N heterodimers. Similarly, TREX1 dimers in cells of the FCL heterozygous individuals could be TREX1D18N/D18N and TREX1WT homodimers and TREX1WT/D18N heterodimers. These recombinant TREX1 variant dimers were prepared, and the ssDNA exonuclease activities were measured (Fig. 2 and Table 1) (14Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D. Harvey S. Gong M. Senenko L. Engel K. Pfeiffer C. Hollis T. Gahr M. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Hubner N. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The exonuclease activities of the TREX1D200N/D200N and TREX1D18N/D18N homodimers are reduced by more than 104-fold compared with TREX1WT, exhibiting almost no catalytic activity using our standard ssDNA 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity assay. On the other hand, the activities of the TREX1WT/D200N and TREX1WT/D18N heterodimers are reduced by only 1.5- and 2.6-fold compared with TREX1WT (Fig. 2 and Table 1) (14Lee-Kirsch M.A. Chowdhury D.

The ∼2-fold loss in activity of the TREX1WT/D200N and TREX1WT/D18N heterodimers suggests that the WT TREX1 protomer within the dimer containing a D200N or D18N protomer is apparently fully functional and unaffected when degrading small ssDNA polynucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W2105439272,"Drosophila Dscam encodes a vast family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing proteins that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding. This diversity is essential for cell recognition events required for wiring the brain. Each isoform binds to itself but rarely to other isoforms. Specificity is determined by ""matching"" of three variable Ig domains within an approximately 220 kD ectodomain. Here, we present the structure of the homophilic binding region of Dscam, comprising the eight N-terminal Ig domains (Dscam(1-8)). Dscam(1-8) forms a symmetric homodimer of S-shaped molecules. This conformation, comprising two reverse turns, allows each pair of the three variable domains to ""match"" in an antiparallel fashion. Structural, genetic, and biochemical studies demonstrate that, in addition to variable domain ""matching,"" intramolecular interactions between constant domains promote homophilic binding. These studies provide insight into how ""matching"" at all three pairs of variable domains in Dscam mediates isoform-specific recognition."

For many glycosylases, the AP-DNA remains tightly bound, impeding enzymatic turnover. A prominent example is thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which removes T from G·T mispairs and recognizes other lesions, with specificity for damage at CpG dinucleotides. TDG turnover is very slow; its activity appears to reach a plateau as the [product]/[enzyme] ratio approaches unity. The follow-on base excision repair enzyme, AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), stimulates the turnover of TDG and other glycosylases, involving a mechanism that remains largely unknown. We examined the catalytic activity of human TDG (hTDG), alone and with human APE1 (hAPE1), using pre-steady-state kinetics and a coupled-enzyme (hTDG-hAPE1) fluorescence assay. hTDG turnover is exceedingly slow for G·T (kcat = 0.00034 min-1) and G·U (kcat = 0.005 min-1) substrates, much slower than kmax from single turnover experiments, confirming that AP-DNA release is rate-limiting. We find unexpectedly large differences in kcat for G·T, G·U, and G·FU substrates, indicating the excised base remains trapped in the product complex by AP-DNA. hAPE1 increases hTDG turnover by 42- and 26-fold for G·T and G·U substrates, the first quantitative measure of the effect of hAPE1. hAPE1 stimulates hTDG by disrupting the product complex rather than merely depleting (endonucleolytically) the AP-DNA. The enhancement is greater for hTDG catalytic core (residues 111–308 of 410), indicating the N- and C-terminal domains are dispensable for stimulatory interactions with hAPE1.

These remarkable enzymes use a nucleotide-flipping mechanism to find lesions and cleave the N-glycosidic bond, releasing the damaged base and producing an abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in the DNA (5Stivers J.T.

This may reflect a need to protect against the mutagenic and cytotoxic properties of AP sites, which impede some DNA polymerases, lack base coding information if replicated, and lead to single-strand breaks. Previous studies of BER in organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to humans have shown that AP endonucleases stimulate the activity (turnover) of many DNA glycosylases (6Parikh S.S. Mol C.D.

These important findings suggest some degree of coordination in the initial steps of BER, yet the mechanism remains largely unknown. We address this question here for human thymine DNA glycosylase (hTDG), which removes T from G·T mispairs and excises many additional lesions, with specificity for damaged bases that are paired with guanine and located in a CpG sequence context (11Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Cortazar D.

A crystal structure of the hTDG catalytic domain (hTDGcat, residues 111–308) bound to abasic DNA indicates the CpG specificity arises from interactions that select for guanine as the pairing partner of the target base and for guanine 3′ to the target base (i.e. 5′-CpG-3′/5′-XpG-3′, where X is the target base) (16Maiti A. Morgan M.T. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 8890-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The specificity of hTDG for damage in a CpG context suggests the predominant biological substrate is G·T mispairs arising from deamination of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) to thymine (17Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), because DNA methylation occurs at cytosine (C5) of CpG dinucleotides.

Nevertheless, CpG sites exhibit a disproportionately high frequency of mutations (C → T) in human cancers and genetic disease (22Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum.

Science. 2006; 314: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar), and it was suggested this may be attributable in part to the slow turnover of hTDG (12Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The importance of understanding hTDG-initiated BER is underscored by findings that it may participate in the active demethylation of m5CpG sites, hence transcriptional regulation, by processing G·T mispairs created by active deamination of m5C to T (25Metivier R. Gallais R. Tiffoche C. Le Peron C. Jurkowska R.Z. Carmouche R.P. Ibberson D. Barath P. Demay F. Reid G. Benes V. Jeltsch A. Gannon F. Salbert G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3245-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Such a role is consistent with a preliminary report that homozygous knock-out of the TDG gene is embryonic-lethal in mice (13Cortazar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schar P. DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We note that if demethylation of m5CpG sites involves active deamination, it would dramatically increase the burden of G·T mispairs, providing an alternative explanation for the high mutational frequency observed at CpG sites. Previous studies have shown that hTDG exhibits exceedingly slow turnover after converting a stoichiometric amount of G·T or G·U substrate to G·AP product (7Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J.

This is attributable to very slow product release; a dissociation constant of koff = ∼0.0016 min-1 (half-life of 7 h) was estimated for G·AP-DNA on the basis of electrophoretic mobility shift studies (7Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Accordingly, hTDG binds abasic DNA with high affinity (29Scharer O.D. Nash H.M. Jiricny J. Laval J. Verdine G.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, hTDG is not inhibited by the nucleobases that it removes from DNA, including thymine or 3,N4-ethenocytosine (ϵC), even at a concentrations of up to 5 mm (17Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating they do not bind hTDG with significant affinity. It has been shown that human AP endonuclease 1 (hAPE1, also known as Ref-1) stimulates the turnover of hTDG for G·T, G·U, and G·ϵC substrates (7Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 480–481: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the magnitude of the hAPE1 effect is unknown because the steady-state turnover (kcat) of hTDG in the presence and absence of hAPE1 has not been reported for any substrate. Moreover, the mechanism of hAPE1 stimulation has remained elusive, although two basic ideas have been proposed. It has been suggested that hAPE1 stimulates hTDG by depleting (endonucleolytically) the concentration of AP-DNA, involving no interaction between hAPE1 and the hTDG product complex (13Cortazar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schar P. DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Hardeland U. Bentele M. Lettieri T. Steinacher R. Jiricny J. Schar P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 235-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mechanism that we will refer to as “passive enhancement.” On the other hand, the “active displacement” mechanism requires that hAPE1 interacts with hTDG and/or AP-DNA to disrupt the product complex (6Parikh S.S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and may also involve hAPE1-mediated depletion of AP-DNA. Here, we explore the mechanism by which hAPE1 stimulates hTDG turnover using an experimental approach that has not previously been employed to address this question in BER. Using pre-steady-state multiple-turnover kinetics, we determined the maximal turnover rate (kcat) for hTDG acting upon G·T, G·U, and G·FU substrates. We developed a coupled-enzyme (hTDG-hAPE1) fluorescence assay to measure the steady-state kinetic parameters of hTDG in the presence of hAPE1. Together, these methods provide a quantitative measure of the hAPE1 effect. We also examined the stimulatory effect of hAPE1 on the turnover of hTDGcat, which lacks the N- and C-terminal domains of hTDG (110 and 102 residues, respectively). Our results rule out the passive enhancement mechanism and require that hAPE1 actively displaces AP-DNA from the hTDG product complex. The coupled-enzyme assay described here provides a new approach for studying the mechanism of hTDG using steady-state kinetics. Materials—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of Yale University, purified by HPLC or Glen-Pak purification cartridges (Glen Research), and quantified by absorbance (260 nm) as described (14Bennett M.T.

Purity was verified by analytical anion-exchange HPLC under denaturing (pH 12) conditions (14Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphoramidites for special nucleotides were obtained from Glen Research. The duplex DNA substrates (Fig. 1) were hybridized by rapid heating to 80 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. hTDG and the hTDG catalytic core (hTDGcat, residues 111–308 of 410) were expressed and purified as previously described (15Morgan M.T.

Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 =∼0.7, and hAPE1 expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. hAPE1 was purified (at 4 °C) using essentially the same protocol as previously described for hTDGcat (17Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), including nickel-affinity chromatography (Qiagen), thrombin cleavage (overnight, 4 °C) of the N-terminal polyhistidine tag (leaving six non-native N-terminal residues, GSHMAS), and anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography using SP-Sepharose and Superdex 75 columns (GE Healthcare). The molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry. hAPE1 was quantified by absorbance (ϵ280 = 52.9 mm-1cm-1), flash-frozen, and stored −80 °C. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Transient kinetics experiments for hTDG (and hTDGcat) were conducted at room temperature (∼22 °C) in HEMN.1 buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2) with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, quenched with 50% (v:v) 0.3 m NaOH, 0.03 m EDTA, and heated for 15 min at 85 °C to induce cleavage of the DNA backbone at abasic sites. Reactions were performed manually or by using a three-syringe rapid chemical quenched-flow instrument (RQF-3, Kintek Corp.). The extent of product formation was analyzed using an HPLC assay as described (14Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Single turnover experiments were collected for hTDG (and hTDGcat) under saturating enzyme conditions ([E] >> [S] >> KD) to obtain rate constants (for the maximal rate of AP product formation) that are not impacted by product release or the association of enzyme and substrate (14Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J. Biol.

Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1998Google Scholar), [Product]=A{1−exp(−kobst)} (Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude, kobs is the rate constant, and t is the reaction time (min). We use a concentration of enzyme, 5 μm, that is >100-fold higher than previously reported KD values for hTDG (17Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Scharer O.D. Kawate T. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4878-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and 0.5 μm substrate. These concentrations are sufficiently high to ensure saturating enzyme conditions, thereby providing the maximal rate constant for (enzyme-bound) product formation (i.e. kobs ≈ kmax), as shown in our previous studies (14Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To confirm saturating enzyme conditions, single turnover experiments were in some cases repeated with higher (10 μm) and lower (2.5 μm) enzyme concentrations, yielding the same result (within experimental error). The maximal rate constant for enzymatic turnover (kcat) was determined using pre-steady-state multiple-turnover kinetics conducted with a high enzyme concentration and excess substrate ([S] > [E] >> KD) such that kcat was not limited by the association of enzyme and substrate (35Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Progress curves exhibited “burst” kinetics, with a rapid exponential phase followed by a slow linear phase, indicating that the rate of product formation (enzyme-bound) greatly exceeds that of product release (35Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to Equation 2, [Product]=A{1−exp(−kobst)}+vt (Eq. 2) where A and kobs are the amplitude and rate constant of the exponential phase, v is the steady-state velocity, and t is the reaction time (min). The steady-state rate constant (kcat) was obtained by dividing the steady-state velocity (v) by the amplitude (A). In all cases, kobs/kcat ≥ 150, indicating the rate-limiting step occurs after chemistry. We used a high enzyme concentration (500 nm) and excess substrate (≥1 μm) to obtain maximal kcat values (35Johnson K.A. The Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar), as confirmed by repeating experiments at lower enzyme concentrations. Coupled-enzyme Fluorescence Assay—We developed a coupled-enzyme (hTDG-hAPE1) fluorescence assay to accurately determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of hTDG (kcat and Km) in the presence of hAPE1 (Fig. 2A). As is typical for a coupled-enzyme assay (36Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics, 3rd Ed. Portland Press Ltd., London2004Google Scholar), the product of the primary enzyme (hTDG) is a substrate for the coupling enzyme (hAPE1), and the steady-state velocity of hTDG is monitored by the formation of hAPE1 product. As shown below and as expected for a coupled-enzyme assay (36Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics, 3rd Ed. Portland Press Ltd., London2004Google Scholar), the initial velocity (v0) directly reflects the steady-state turnover of hTDG because we used a sufficiently high concentration of hAPE1 to ensure that hTDG turnover was rate-limiting. It is important to note that the steady-state turnover of hAPE1 (alone) is at least 10,000-fold faster than that observed here for hTDG (alone) (37Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Using the coupled-enzyme assay, the steady-state kinetic parameters for hTDG (kcat and Km) were obtained by determining the initial velocity (v0) as a function of substrate concentration and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3) using non-linear regression with Grafit 5 (33Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1998Google Scholar), kobs=kcat{[S]/(Km+[S])} (Eq. 3) where kobs = v0/[E]tot, and [E]tot is the total concentration of hTDG (or hTDGcat). The kinetic parameters kcat and Km directly reflect the steady-state activity of hTDG because the experiments (v0 determinations) were collected in the presence of sufficient hAPE1 such that the hTDG reaction was rate-limiting and v0 was independent of [hAPE1], as shown below. The DNA substrates (Fig. 1) contain a fluorescence quencher (dabcyl) at the 5′ end of the substrate (i.e. dU-containing) strand and a fluorophore (FAM) at the 3′ end of the complementary strand, such that FAM fluorescence is initially quenched (Fig. 2A). The substrates are similar to those used for previous “molecular beacon” assays for hAPE1 (38Madhusudan S. Smart F. Shrimpton P. Parsons J.L. Gardiner L. Houlbrook S. Talbot D.C. Hammonds T. Freemont P.A. Sternberg M.J. Dianov G.L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4711-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 39Maksimenko A. Ishchenko A.A. Sanz G. Laval J. Elder R.H. Saparbaev M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) but differ in one important respect as described below. The sequential activity of hTDG (creates an AP site) and hAPE1 (nicks the DNA backbone 5′ to the AP site) releases a short dabcyl-containing oligonucleotide, giving a large fluorescence increase (Fig. 2B). Experiments were collected in 3-mm fluorescence cells (Starna Cells) maintained at 22 °C using a QM-4 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 491 and 516 nm. The individual reactions (i.e. v0 determinations) were initiated by adding hTDG to HEMN.1 buffer containing the DNA substrate and hAPE1 and were monitored by the change in fluorescence intensity. A typical progress curve obtained from the coupled-enzyme assay is shown in Fig. 2C. As expected, hAPE1 alone does not generate a fluorescence change for the hTDG substrates, which do not contain an AP site (Fig. 2C, red data). The initial velocities (v0) were obtained by linear regression of fluorescence intensity (cps) versus time (s) for ∼50 s at the beginning of the progress curve, which is highly linear (Fig. 2C, inset). The v0 values were converted from units of fluorescence (cps·s-1) to product concentration (nm·s-1) using a conversion factor obtained from a plot of total fluorescence change (ΔFtot) versus substrate concentration. These standard curves (ΔFtot versus [S]) were determined for [S] ≤ 500 nm and were quite linear (r > 0.99). Values for ΔFtot were determined by bringing the coupled reaction to full completion. For the G·U20 and G·FU20 substrates, reactions were rapidly brought to completion by adding 25 nm human uracil DNA glycosylase (hUNG) after measuring v0 for hTDG. The fluorescence cells were carefully cleaned after each experiment to thoroughly remove hUNG. This was verified by ensuring the fluorescence of substrate with hAPE1 did not change over time (∼5 min) before adding hTDG. The presence of residual hUNG would be clearly indicated by a fluorescence increase due to the sequential activity of hUNG and hAPE1. Control experiments were routinely preformed to confirm that the hAPE1 concentration was sufficiently high such that v0 is independent of [hAPE1] and reflects the steady-state turnover of hTDG, i.e. that hTDG turnover is rate-limiting. For example, a series of v0 determinations collected with 50 nm hTDGcat, 1500 nm G·U20 substrate, and varying hAPE1 concentrations (Fig. 2D) shows that v0 is independent of hAPE1 concentration for [hAPE1] ≥ 50 nm. As expected, v0 increases linearly with hTDGcat concentration (for 12–150 nm hTDGcat) in the presence of a fixed (50 nm) concentration of hAPE1 (and 1500 nm substrate). A similar approach was used for G·T and G·FU substrates to ensure the v0 values are independent of [hAPE1] and reflect the steady-state turnover of hTDG. hAPE1 Removes FAM and Dabcyl Linked to the 5′- or 3′ Terminal Oxygen of DNA—Our coupled enzyme assay differs from previous molecular beacon assays involving hAPE1 (38Madhusudan S. Smart F. Shrimpton P. Parsons J.L. Gardiner L. Houlbrook S. Talbot D.C. Hammonds T. Freemont P.A. Sternberg M.J. Dianov G.L. Hickson I.D.

Commun. 2004; 319: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), for which the fluorophore (FAM) and quencher (dabcyl) were linked by phosphodiester bond to the 5′- or 3′-terminal oxygen of the DNA (Fig. 3). We prepared a G·U substrate using this approach and found that hAPE1 alone generates a rapid fluorescence increase even though the DNA contained no AP site. In contrast, hAPE1 did not change the fluorescence of a G·U duplex with FAM and dabcyl linked to the thymine base of a terminal dT nucleotide, which involves no phosphodiester bond (Fig. 3). Control experiments with four (non-AP) duplexes in which one group (either FAM or dabcyl) was linked (phosphodiester bond) to the 3′- or 5′-terminal oxygen and the other group was dT-linked revealed a fluorescence increase for hAPE1 alone in all cases (i.e. for 3′- or 5′-linked FAM and for 3′- or 5′-linked dabcyl). We conclude that hAPE1 removes FAM or dabcyl linked to either the 3′- or 5′-terminal oxygen of DNA, presumably by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bond. This activity is significant, up to 13% of the AP endonuclease activity"

https://openalex.org/W2142395647,"Background Cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) is a crucial prerequisite for effective priming of cytotoxic T-cell responses against bacterial, viral and tumor antigens; however, this antigen presentation pathway remains poorly defined. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of this process, we tested the hypothesis that the internalization of MHC class I molecules (MHC-I) from the cell surface is directly involved in cross-presentation pathway and the loading of antigenic peptides. Here we provide the first examination of the internalization of MHC-I in DCs and we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of MHC-I appears to act as an addressin domain to route MHC-I to both endosomal and lysosomal compartments of DCs, where it is demonstrated that loading of peptides derived from exogenously-derived proteins occurs. Furthermore, by chasing MHC-I from the cell surface of normal and transgenic DCs expressing mutant forms of MHC-I, we observe that a tyrosine-based endocytic trafficking motif is required for the constitutive internalization of MHC-I molecules from the cell surface into early endosomes and subsequently deep into lysosomal peptide-loading compartments. Finally, our data support the concept that multiple pathways of peptide loading of cross-presented antigens may exist depending on the chemical nature and size of the antigen requiring processing. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that DCs have ‘hijacked’ and adapted a common vacuolar/endocytic intracellular trafficking pathway to facilitate MHC I access to the endosomal and lysosomal compartments where antigen processing and loading and antigen cross-presentation takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1976321369,"Finding a mating partner is a critical task for many organisms. It is in the interest of males to employ multiple sensory modalities to search for females. In Drosophila melanogaster, vision is thought to be the most important courtship stimulating cue at long distance, while chemosensory cues are used at relatively short distance. In this report, we show that when visual cues are not available, sounds produced by the female allow the male to detect her presence in a large arena. When the target female was artificially immobilized, the male spent a prolonged time searching before starting courtship. This delay in courtship initiation was completely rescued by playing either white noise or recorded fly movement sounds to the male, indicating that the acoustic and/or seismic stimulus produced by movement stimulates courtship initiation, most likely by increasing the general arousal state of the male. Mutant males expressing tetanus toxin (TNT) under the control of Gr68a-GAL4 had a defect in finding active females and a delay in courtship initiation in a large arena, but not in a small arena. Gr68a-GAL4 was found to be expressed pleiotropically not only in putative gustatory pheromone receptor neurons but also in mechanosensory neurons, suggesting that Gr68a-positive mechanosensory neurons, not gustatory neurons, provide motion detection necessary for courtship initiation. TNT/Gr68a males were capable of discriminating the copulation status and age of target females in courtship conditioning, indicating that female discrimination and formation of olfactory courtship memory are independent of the Gr68a-expressing neurons that subserve gustation and mechanosensation. This study suggests for the first time that mechanical signals generated by a female fly have a prominent effect on males' courtship in the dark and leads the way to studying how multimodal sensory information and arousal are integrated in behavioral decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2088399252,"The confined electronic structure of nanoscale materials has increasingly been shown to induce behavior quite distinct from that of bulk analogs. Direct atomic-scale visualization of nanowires of zinc oxide was achieved through their unique pancake-type diffraction by using four-dimensional (4D) ultrafast electron crystallography. After electronic excitation of this wide-gap photonic material, the wires were found to exhibit colossal expansions, two orders of magnitude higher than that expected at thermal equilibrium; the expansion is highly anisotropic, a quasi–one-dimensional behavior, and is facilitated by the induced antibonding character. By reducing the density of nanowires, the expansions reach even larger values and occur at shorter times, suggesting a decrease of the structural constraint in transient atomic motions. This unanticipated ultrafast carrier-driven expansion highlights the optoelectronic consequences of nanoscale morphologies."

Normal fetal lung development and alveolar cell differentiation is regulated by a network of transcription factors.

During development, an embryo is exposed to varying levels of oxygen as a balance is created between vascularization and tissue growth.

One of the extracellular cues that is important for fetal vascular growth and lung morphogenesis is the physiologically low O2 environment of the fetus. The ability to cope with this developmental “hypoxia” is not only important for lung maturation but essential for the viability of the fetus (1Webster W.S. Abela D. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2007; 81: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Giaccia A.J. Simon M.C. Johnson R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to decreased oxygen availability are regulated by a family of proteins called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). The ability of HIFs to respond to hypoxia is controlled by oxygen-dependent post-translational hydroxylation. The prolyl hydroxylases, PHDs, modify HIFs on essential residues in an oxygen-, iron-, and α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner. Once hydroxylated, the HIF is quickly degraded in a proteosomal-dependent process that involves the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. HIF1α, the most ubiquitously expressed HIF, has been shown to play a critical role in normal development. HIF1α regulates the expression of genes important for cellular adaptation to hypoxia, including glycolytic enzymes and angiogenic factors (9Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies have established that HIF1α is indispensable during fetal development as HIF1α-/- mice die at midgestation, in association with defects in VEGF expression and vascularization (10Ryan H.E.

Finally, loss of HIF2α perturbs normal lung development through loss of VEGF expression and to subsequently decrease alveolar type II cell production of pulmonary surfactants (15Compernolle V.

To this aim, mice with a lung-specific deletion of HIF1α (termed HIF1αΔ/Δ) were generated. Lung specific embryonic deletion of HIF1α earlier than 3 days prior to parturition led to HIF1αΔ/Δ neonates exhibiting cyanosis and respiratory failure soon after birth. The expression of surfactant proteins was significantly lower in HIF1αΔ/Δ pups as compared with littermate control pups. Examination of the lungs from HIF1αΔ/Δ pups via light and transmission electron microscopy confirmed defects in both alveolar epithelial differentiation and septal development that resulted in the observed respiratory distress. Transgenic Mice and Genotyping—HIF1αflox/flox and SP-C-rtTA-/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg transgenic mice were generous gifts from Randall Johnson (University of California, San Diego) and Jeffrey Whitsett (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center), respectively (10Ryan H.E.

HIF1αflox/flox and SP-C-rtTA-/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg transgenic mice were mated to generate SP-C-rtTA-/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF1αflox/flox mice capable of respiratory epithelium-specific conditional recombination in the floxed HIF1α gene. In this model, depending on the day doxycycline is administered to the dam, various cell populations within the lung undergo recombination in HIF1αflox/flox alleles (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Genotyping of the mice progeny was performed by PCR for all the three loci using previously published primer sequences (supplemental Table S1). Genomic DNA extraction from tail clipping was performed using the Direct PCR extraction system (Viagen Biotech) per the manufacturer's instructions. PCR conditions were standardized for all the three alleles: denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; 38 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 60 s followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. Sizes of the amplified products obtained were ∼210 bp for HIF1α (wild type); 244 bp for HIF1αflox/flox; 370 bp for Cre transgene; and 350 bp for rtTA transgene (Fig. 1B). Doxycycline Treatment and Animal Husbandry—Dams bearing triple (SP-C-rtTA-/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF1αflox/flox) and double ((tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF1αflox/flox) transgenic embryos were maintained on doxycycline feed (625 mg of doxycycline/kg; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and drinking water (0.8 mg/ml; Sigma Chemicals Co.). The day of parturition was taken as the reference point to calculate the duration of doxycycline exposure. Control and HIF1aΔ/Δ pups exposed to doxycycline treatment for 0-14 days in utero were sacked within 1 h of parturition. All pups were sacrificed by decapitation. Mice used in this study were kept at the animal housing facility under the strict hygienic and pathogen-free conditions approved by the University Laboratory Animal Resource regulatory unit. Lung Harvesting and Processing—3-8 pups were analyzed from each genotype and doxycycline treatment. Pups were assessed for total body and lung weight. Lung tissues were isolated and the left lung lobe was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) or 4% glutaraldehyde for morphological analysis. The remaining lung tissue was divided; half was snap-frozen for Western blotting, half was stored in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen) for RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis. Western Blotting—Snap-frozen lung tissue (10 mg) was lysed and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm each of EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium vandate, sodium fluoride, 1 m dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin) using a bead beater system (45 s at 30 Hz frequency). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min.) and protein concentration was measured in supernatant using Bradford protein assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Protein samples (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel, Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were performed with rabbit or goat antibodies against surfactant-associated proteins (SP-A (sc 13977, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SP-B (AB 3780, Chemicon), SP-C (sc-13979, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and SP-D (SC 7709, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HIF1α (NB100-479, Novus Biologicals), tubulin (T5168, Sigma), and β-actin (SC-7210, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-goat (sc-2768, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL Western blot system (Pierce) or fluorescently using Alexa fluor 680 anti-rabbit IgG (A21109, Invitrogen) or IRdye800 antimouse IgG (610-132-121, Rockland). Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry—At least 4-6 pups of each genotype and doxycycline treatment were analyzed for histopathological changes. Formalin-fixed left lung lobe tissues were paraffin-embedded and 5-micron thick sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid Schiff (PAS), or immunostained with SP-B (1:500 dilution, AB3780, Chemicon, MA), SP-C (1:4000 dilution, antibody kindly provided by Jeffrey Whitsett), and CRE (1:100 dilution, AB24608; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 6% H2O2 for 30 min. Immunostaining was performed using Rabbit Vector Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Neonatal lung sections were fixed in 4% buffered glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C, and stored in the 10% NBF fixative until postfixation with 1% phosphate-buffered osmium tetroxide. Tissues were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Poly/Bed-Araldite resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). 1 μm-thick sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue for light microscopic identification of specific tissue sites for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultrathin tissue sections for TEM were cut at ∼75 nm and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Sectioning was performed with an LKB Ultratome III (LKB Instruments, Inc., Rockville, MD). Ultrastructural tissue examination and photography were performed with a JEOL JEM 100CXII electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis—10 mg of lung tissue stored in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent was homogenized in RLT buffer using a Retsch MM200 bead beater system (Retsch, Haan, Germany). Total RNA quantification was performed spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The expression level of selected genes involved in surfactant metabolism and lung development was analyzed by qRT-PCR using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (21Vengellur A. LaPres J.J. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 82: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Gene-specific primers are listed in supplemental Table S2. Copy number was determined by comparison with standard curves of the respective genes. This measurement was controlled for RNA quality, quantity, and RT efficiency by normalizing it to the expression level of the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) gene. Statistical significance was determined by use of normalized relative changes and analysis of variance. Quantitative Analysis—qRT-PCR analysis was performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test on GraphPad Prism. Results were considered significant at the 5% level. Conditional Inactivation of HIF1α in the Lung—The HIF1α gene was inactivated in the lung by mating HIF1α-conditional null mice (HIF1αflox/flox) (10Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) to an inducible bitransgenic mouse, SPC-rtTA, that expresses the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) under the control of the human surfactant protein C (SP-C) promoter and the Cre recombinase gene with a tetracycline operon (Fig. 1A) (18Perl A.K. Wert S.E. Nagy A. Lobe C.G. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). SPC-rtTA mice have been shown to express Cre recombinase specifically in the epithelial cells of the primordial lung buds as well as in the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium of postnatal mice in the presence of an inducer (i.e. doxycycline) (19Lobe C.G. Koop K.E. Kreppner W. Lomeli H. Gertsenstein M. Nagy A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In the present study, compound litters from reciprocal matings between SP-C-rtTA-/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF1αflox/flox and (tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF1αflox/flox mice were composed of pups with mixed genotypes with respect to SPC-rtTA transgene. Their genotypic ratios (data not shown) were in accordance with Mendelian inheritance as demonstrated by genotyping (Fig. 1B). Analysis of these ratios from litters studied (n = 30 litters and 190 pups) confirmed no in utero mortalities (data not shown). In the absence of doxycycline treatment, pups were phenotypically indistinguishable between litters. The functionality of the doxycycline treatment was demonstrated by the significant decrease in HIF1α mRNA as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C) and loss of HIF1α protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). Lung-specific Deletion of HIF1α Causes Lethal Phenotype—To determine if in utero loss of HIF1α influenced litter size or the Mendelian distribution of pups, dams carrying triple transgenic embryos were exposed to doxycycline through feed and water for various lengths of time prior to parturition (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 days). Our findings indicate pups exposed to doxycycline in utero for at least 8 days prior to parturition had a 100% mortality rate, while those receiving the drug for 4-6 days prior to parturition had approximately a 15% chance of survival (Fig. 2A). Following parturition, HIF1αΔ/Δ pups (doxycycline-induced) developed respiratory distress, severe cyanosis, and died within an hour of birth (range of 10-60 min) (Fig. 2B). No observable differences were noted in survival times following parturition from pups treated with doxycycline for only 1-6 days compared with those exposed for at least 8 days. More importantly, no mortality was observed in HIF1α+fl/+fl mice lacking either the rtTA or Cre recombinase transgene in the presence or absence of doxycycline (data not shown). These data suggest that the mortality is due to loss of HIF1α and not off-target effects of the other transgenes. At necropsy, the lungs from HIF1αΔ/Δ pups were dark red and atelectic, in contrast to pink, aerated lungs from control (in the absence of doxycycline treatment) pups. Excised lung lobes from HIF1αΔ/Δ pups weighed slightly more than the lungs from control mice and sank to the bottom of a saline-filled vial in contrast to the lungs from control littermates, which floated in saline (Fig. 2, C and D). At birth, the average total body weights of control littermate and HIF1αΔ/Δ were 1.318±0.018 (S.E.) and 1.288 ± 0.024 grams, respectively. Defective Lung Morphology—The lungs of HIF1αΔ/Δ pups had histologic and ultrastructural features that indicate an impairment of normal in utero differentiation of alveolar epithelium, with a related loss of lung surfactant proteins that are essential for preventing collapse of individual alveoli and ensuring proper gas exchange to maintain life. Lungs of HIF1αΔ/Δ pups at birth had abnormally thickened alveolar septa (Fig. 3C) lined by undifferentiated cuboidal epithelial cells (immature pneumocytes) containing large amounts of intracytoplasmic periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive material (Fig. 3D) that was ultrastructurally identified, via transmission electron microscopy, as glycogen (Fig. 4, C and D). There was a marked reduction of alveolar airspaces in the lungs of these mice due in part to the thickened septa and to focal areas of atelectasis.FIGURE 4Electron photomicrographs of alveolar epithelium of newborn pups. The lung from the control pup (A and B) has a well differentiated alveolar epithelium containing both type I and II cells (B). Stippled arrow indicates thin, squamoid, type I cells, and solid arrows indicate tubular myelin figures (secreted surfactant) within the alveolar airspace of control pup. Type II cells have numerous intracytoplasmic lamellar bodies (lb) and apical microvilli (mv).

Ultrastructurally, the luminal epithelium lining the alveolar airspace of control pups consisted of both alveolar type I and II cells (differentiated pneumocytes). Distinctive lamellar bodies were present in the apical cytoplasm of alveolar type II cells along with tubular myelin and secreted lamellar material (ultrastructural features of secreted surfactant) widely scattered along the alveolar luminal surface (Fig. 4, A and B). These distinctive cuboidal epithelial cells also had a round to ovoid nucleus, an apical luminal surface lined by short microvilli, and numerous cytoplasmic organelles consisting of mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. Type I cells were identified by their thin squamous morphology containing few organelles, and a fusiform nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, there were no microscopically detectable differences in the morphology of intrapulmonary conducting airways (preterminal and terminal bronchioles), lined principally by ciliated cells and nonciliated cuboidal (Clara) cells, between control and HIF1αΔ/Δ pups at birth. Altered Surfactant Metabolism—qRT-PCR analysis of the genes for surfactant proteins show a decreased expression of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C in the HIF1αΔ/Δ mice compared with control pups (Fig. 5A). SP-D mRNA expression was not significantly different between the two genotypes. Western blot analysis of protein extract from HIF1αΔ/Δ and control animals was also performed to determine if surfactant protein levels were similar to gene expression patterns. All four surfactants displayed a substantial reduction in protein levels in the HIF1αΔ/Δ mice as compared with control pups (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, SP-C displayed an overall decrease in protein levels but the pre-processed form (Fig. 5B, SPC upper band) was not as affected by deletion of HIF1α as was the fully processed form (Fig. 5B, SPC lower band). This suggests that SP-C transcription is being decreased by the loss of HIF1α and processing of any translated SP-C protein is being inhibited by the aberrant differentiation of the HIF1αΔ/Δ lung. In comparison, SP-B monomer and dimer forms were equally affected by loss of HIF1α. Immunohistochemical staining on lung sections confirmed the reduced levels of SP-B and SP-C in the HIF1αΔ/Δ compared with control pups (Fig. 5C). The reduced levels of surfactant mRNA and protein expression were consistent with the lack of alveolar epithelial differentiation and respiratory distress in the HIF1αΔ/Δ pups. Altered Gene Expression—To begin to understand how loss of HIF1α induced changes in lung morphology, qRT-PCR was performed on several critical genes known to be involved in lung development. These genes include β-catenin, Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), forkhead box A2 (Foxa2), forkhead box protein A1 (Foxa1, also known as HNF3α), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), GATA-binding protein 6 (Gata6), ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1 member 3 (ABCA3), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). There were no significant differences in the expression levels of Foxa2, ABCA3, CEBPα, TTF-1, Foxa1, or GATA, suggesting that HIF1α is not required for their normal expression and is most likely involved in later events in lung development (Fig. 6 and data not shown). However, lower levels of β-catenin, CCSP, HIMF, VEGF, and HIF2α mRNA in neonatal HIF1αΔ/Δ pups compared with control littermates suggest that HIF1α plays a role in controlling their expression during maturation of the lung (7Mucenski M.L.

Given the established role of these factors in regulating lung development, our data suggest that HIF1α is centrally located in the transcriptional network that is necessary for proper lung morphogenesis. The previously described role of HIF2α in lung development, the similarity in phenotype between the HIF2α knock-out survivors and HIF1α lung deletion strains, and the loss of HIF2α expression in the HIF1αΔ/Δ pups led us to determine the level of HIF2α expression at the protein level using immunohistochemistry (15Compernolle V. Brusselmans K. Acker T. Hoet P. Tjwa M. Beck H. Plaisance S. Dor Y. Keshet E. Lupu F. Nemery B. Dewerchin M. Van Veldhoven P. Plate K. Moons L. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 702-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of doxycycline there was a pronounced expression of Cre recombinase in all cell types of the lung (Fig. 7D). There was a corresponding loss in HIF1α expression in the alveolar tissue (Fig. 7E). Though HIF1α is not expressed ubiquitously throughout the lung, its cell-specific expression was abrogated upon doxycycline treatment in the triple transgenic animal (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, the increased Cre recombinase and subsequent loss of HIF1α expression also led to a drastic decline in HIF2α levels in the lung (Fig. 7, C and F). Mammalian lung development and successful transition to extrauterine respiration involves a wide battery of biochemical, cellular, and ultrastructural changes. This complex process begins at embryonic day E9.5 with most of the alveolar epithelial differentiation events starting at embryonic day E17.5. Several transcription factors control the temporal and positional epithelial differentiation process, as well as the function of these differentiated cells. When the function of these critical factors is disrupted during development, lung function is compromised, leading to respiratory distress at birth. Our results have added HIF1α to this list of transcription factors that are critical for lung development. We have also demonstrated that loss of HIF1α during development leads to changes in the expression of other critical factors, such as HIF2α, VEGF, and β-catenin (23Maeda Y. Dave V. Whitsett J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 219-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). HIFs are a class of transcription factors that play a critical role in oxygen-sensing and the metabolic adaptations to hypoxia. Previous studies have shown that HIF1α levels are predominant during lung development until day E13.5, at which time, HIF2α becomes the major HIF in this tissue (24Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N.

Targeted gene disruption of the HIF1α locus results in the embryonic lethality due to cardiovascular defects (12Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M.

Mice partially deficient for HIF1α alleles showed normal development but were physiologically compromised as they exhibited impaired pulmonary vascular remodeling under chronic hypoxic stress. In addition, the heterozygote was used to show that partial loss of HIF1α alleles results in impaired pulmonary arterial myocyte electrophysiological responses under hypoxic stress (13Yu A.Y.

The study presented here has shown that the lung-specific loss of HIF1α leads to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome due to impaired alveolar epithelial differentiation. Interestingly, the lungs of HIF1αΔ/Δ pups had normal morphogenesis of conducting airways, with phenotypic alterations restricted to the alveolar parenchyma. These results suggest that HIF1α is involved in the late events of lung morphogenesis and alveolar epithelial differentiation but not in the early lung biogenesis and airway branching morphogenesis. Respiratory distress syndrome and associated histopathology are phenotypic hallmarks of targeted deletion of several transcription factors, such as Foxa2, CEBPα, GATA-6, SMAD3, calcineurin β1, and thyroid transcription factor-1, suggesting an intricate network of transcriptional regulation governing the complex ultrastructural maturation of lungs (8Wan H.J.

Expression analysis demonstrated that the levels of Foxa2, Foxa1, CEBPα, and GATA-6 are comparable among pups with and without HIF1α (Fig. 6 and data not shown). This suggests that HIF1α acts either downstream or independent of these transcription factors. In contrast, the loss of HIF1α led to a decreased expression of other critical factors, including CCSP, β-catenin, HIMF, VEGF, and HIF2α (Fig. 6). Recently, the loss of HIF2α and subsequent decrease in VEGF has been linked to respiratory distress syndrome (15Compernolle V. Brusselmans K. Acker T. Hoet P. Tjwa M. Beck H. Plaisance S. Dor Y. Keshet E. Lupu F. Nemery B. Dewerchin M. Van Veldhoven P. Plate K. Moons L. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 702-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments involved a subset of HIF2α-/- mice that were viable up to parturition and displayed similar pathology to the HIF1αΔ/Δ mice described here. Delivery of VEGF, either intrauterine or postnatal intratracheal instillation, protected the HIF2α-/- mice from symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome. Given that HIF2α expression is abrogated in the HIF1aΔ/Δ pups suggests that HIF1α regulates HIF2α early in lung development and the subsequent loss of VEGF might explain the pathology of the HIF1αΔ/Δ pups. It remains to be seen if the decrease in VEGF expression is due to direct loss of HIF1α or indirectly through the loss of HIF2α expression. More importantly, the pathophysiology of the HIF1αΔ/Δ mouse resembles that of the HIF2α-/- mouse in relation to the lack of differentiation of type II pneumocytes and increased septal thickness. In addition, the HIF1αΔ/Δ pups display large glycogen stores with concurrent loss of surfactant protein expression. In conclusion, these studies provide evidence that HIF1α plays an important role in lung development. The respiratory failure induced by lung-specific deletion of HIF1α, suggests that hypoxia and HIF1α-regulated genes play an essential role in lung maturation, especially proper differentiation of type II alveolar cells. HIF1α potential upstream regulatory function of HIF2α and VEGF expression, directly or indirectly, offers a mechanism of action for the phenotypic observations. Finally, the results suggest that the hypoxia signaling cascade is important during the later stages of lung development but not essential in the initial patterning of the tissue. HIFs seem to play a later role in directing cell differentiation and regulating growth factors necessary for lung remodeling required for sustaining life extrauterine. Understanding the pathways necessary for proper HIF expression and function and the downstream pathways influenced by these factors will impact our ability to treat RDS and other diseases of the lung.

In plants, NO functions in many processes, including seed germination, hormone responses, respiration, root development, leaf expansion, fruit maturation, senescence, abiotic stress response, cell death, and disease resistance (2Crawford N.M.

Plant extracts generate NO and citrulline in an Arg-dependent manner, and this activity can be blocked by animal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors (9Cueto M. HernandezPerera O. Martin R.

Arg-dependent NO synthesis is important, because the well studied animal NOSs produce NO from this substrate in an active center that contains heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (15Alderton W.K.

Nature. 1998; 394: 585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). AtNOS1 was the second of two plant enzymes reported to catalyze the conversion of Arg to NO (1Guo F.-Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M.

AtNOS1 was identified from A. thaliana based on homology to a hypothetical snail NOS that appeared to synthesize NO (22Huang S. Kerschbaum H.H. Engel E. Hermann A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2516-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite virtually no sequence similarity with animal NOSs, mutation of the AtNOS1 gene generates a growth phenotype that can be rescued by NO donor compounds. In addition, chemical probes sensitive to NO show reduced activation in the knock-out mutant (1Guo F.-Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Genetic studies (23Zeidler D. Zahringer U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15811-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) further demonstrate that the Atnos1 mutant is more susceptible to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants. However, consistent with our own results, several groups have stated that they cannot reproduce NO synthase activity with host-derived or recombinant AtNOS1, calling into question the true function of this protein and resulting in its redefinition as AtNOA1 (for nitric oxide-associated protein) (8Crawford N.M. Galli M. Tischner R. Heimer Y.M. Okamoto M. Mack A. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 526-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Zemojtel T. Frohlich A. Palmieri M.C.

AtNOA1 is a 561-residue protein that contains four sequence motifs characteristic of GTP-binding proteins, such as p21-Ras, Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and Gα domains (24Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Reynaud E.G. Andrade M.A. Bonneau F. Thi B.N.L. Knop M. Scheffzek K. Pepperkok R. BMC Biol. 2005; 3: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Zemojtel T. Penzkofer T. Dandekar T. Schultz J. Trend. Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 224-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the order of motifs in the protein sequence indicates an unusual circular permutation of the polypeptide found only in a small subclass of GTPases of poorly understood function (24Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proteins containing circularly permutated G motif (CPG) domains are prevalent in bacteria (YlqF, YqeH, YjeQ, YawG, and MJ1464) but can also be found in yeast, plants, and even humans (e.g. LSG1) (25Reynaud E.G. Andrade M.A. Bonneau F. Thi B.N.L. Knop M. Scheffzek K. Pepperkok R. BMC Biol. 2005; 3: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CPG domains also belong to the HAS GTPase subfamily, which have a hydrophobic amino acid substitution in the place of a key hydrophilic residue that participates directly in GTP hydrolysis (often a Gln or His residue). Whereas AtNOA1 conserves the central HAS GTPase region, the protein also contains additional N- and C-terminal domains, neither of which have any relationship to other members of this family, except the shorter YqeH (∼360 amino acids). In fact, YqeH is likely to have a domain structure very similar to that of AtNOA1 (22.8% identity, 33.6% similarity, for the Geobacillus stearothermophilus YqeH-GsYqeH). Both proteins contain an N-terminal region that harbors four cysteines (CX2CX25-35CX2C) and secondary structure motifs consistent with the treble clef family of zinc-binding proteins (24Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conserved C-terminal regions of both AtNOA1 and YqeH have no detectable homology to any domain of known structure. All of these features are conserved in the rice (Oryza sativa) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) homologs of AtNOA1 (63.1 and 59.9% amino acid identity, respectively). The similarity between AtNOA1 and YqeH is even more striking if a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif (27Zemojtel T. Kolanczyk M. Kossler N. Stricker S. Lurz R. Mikula I. Duchniewicz M. Schuelke M. Ghafourifar P. Martasek P. Vingron M. Mundlos S. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is excluded from the comparison (29% identity, 43% similarity). The unusual arrangement of GTPase signature motifs and the unusual pendant domains make AtNOA1/YqeH interesting not only in the context of NO signaling in plants but also for understanding G-protein structure and function. The function of YqeH in bacteria is not well understood. Some members of the CPG family (i.e. YlqF) have been implicated in ribosome biogenesis (28Uicker W.C. Schaefer L. Britton R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Matsuo Y. Morimoto T. Kuwano M. Loh P.C. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8252-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but they contain C-terminal RNA-binding domains not found in YqeH/AtNOA1. Both YlqF and YqeH are essential for cell growth in Bacillus subtilis. They have been shown to bind [α-32P]GTP (31Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3539-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and GTPase activity was demonstrated for YqeH (32Loh P.C. Morimoto T. Matsuo Y. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. Genes Genet. Syst. 2007; 82: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis yqeH mutant is lethal, whereas reduced YqeH expression increases chromosomal replication (31Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N.

There is currently little data available about AtNOA1/YqeH mammalian homologs, aside from some localization studies that place them in the mitochondria (27Zemojtel T. Kolanczyk M. Kossler N.

Nevertheless, it is clear that these proteins form a unique family that is broadly represented in biology. Their role in NO metabolism may very well extend to additional organisms. Factors involved in bacterial ribosome assembly are potential targets for new antibacterial drugs (36Comartin D.J. Brown E.D. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2006; 6: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Campbell T.L. Daigle D.M. Brown E.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Wang J.

The fact that YqeH is found in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, coupled with the lethality caused by its deletion in B. subtilis, makes it attractive as a target for design of inhibitors. Molecular structures of YqeH with bound substrates and inhibitors could aid such efforts. It has been previously indicated that AtNOA1 does not synthesize NO (8Crawford N.M. Galli M. Tischner R. Heimer Y.M. Okamoto M. Mack A. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 526-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Zemojtel T. Frohlich A. Palmieri M.C. Kolanczyk M. Mikula I.

Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 524-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but no experimental data were published along with these reports. Furthermore, the putative GTPase activity of the enzyme has not been characterized, nor have its other biochemical properties. In an effort to address the issues surrounding the function of ANOA1, we report the 2.36 Å resolution crystal structure of the YqeH homolog from G. stearothermophilus and further investigate its biochemistry. We also show that these data are highly relevant to AtNOA1, because bacterial YqeH rescues growth and morphological defects of Atnoa1 mutant plants. The combined results indicate that YqeH/AtNOA1 is very unlikely to have NO synthase activity and rather appears to be a unique regulator capable of coupling GTP hydrolysis to nucleic acid and/or protein recognition. Materials—Sodium citrate and sodium chloride were obtained from Mallinckrodt, polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether was from Fluka, Tris was from Fisher, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Cloning and Expression of GsYqeH—The YqeH gene of G. stearothermophilus (ATCC strain number 12980) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR (with Phusion polymerase from New England Biolabs) and cloned into the pET28 (Novagen) expression vector between NdeI and XhoI. GsYqeH was then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells with an N-terminal His6 tag. Proteins were purified using nickel-chelate chromatography and then size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75) after removal of the His6 tag with thrombin. GsYqeH was concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl as estimated by the Bradford assay. Selenomethionyl protein was overexpressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells, which are auxotrophic for methionine (40Doublie S. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). An overnight culture in LB was spun down, washed twice with autoclaved water, and then added to the l-selenomethionine growth medium (M9 minimal media supplemented with 19 standard amino acids and l-selenomethionine at 50 mg/liter), which was then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside before harvesting cells. The protein was purified as above. Dithiothreitol (10 mm) was present in all buffers. The Thr-Ala and Cys-Ser substitutions in GsYqeH were produced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. GTPase Assays—The GTPase reactions were performed with 10 μm protein in a buffer that contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP at 37 °C. After 2 h of incubation, samples were boiled for 5 min and then centrifuged to separate precipitated protein. The supernatants were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (absorbance at 260 nm) on a Waters Sunfire™ C18 5 μm, 4.5 × 250-mm column. The running buffer contained 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, 0.2 mm NaN3, 7.5% acetonitrile. Product elution times were compared with standards for GTP, GDP, and GMP. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Model Building—Single crystals of diffraction quality were grown by vapor diffusion from 5-12 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The reservoir was mixed 1:1 with protein solution and contained 100 mm sodium citrate pH 4.8-5.4 and 0-5% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether. Native and l-selenomethionine GsYqeH crystals belonged to the P21 space group with cell dimensions 47.6 × 81.1 × 108.2 Å and β = 91.5°. Diffraction data for the native GsYqeH crystals (2.36 Å) were collected at CHESS beamlines F1 and F2 on a Q4 quantum CCD detector. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data (2.5 Å) for l-selenomethionine crystals were collected at the APS beamline NE-CAT 24-BM on a Q315 Quantum CCD detector. The data sets were reduced and scaled using HKL2000 (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The GsYqeH model (residues 97-369) was built manually using XFIT (42McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and COOT (43Emsley P. Cowtan K.

J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A more complete model (GsYqeH residues 57-369) was then placed in the unit cell, and refined against the native data set (2.36 Å resolution) with AMoRe (45Navaza J. Saludjian P. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and CNS (46Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The structure was adjusted with XFIT and COOT to Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc maps. The addition of GDP and water molecules amid cycles of refinement produced the final model (R = 25.3%; Rfree = 27.1%) (supplemental Table 1). Structure Analysis Programs and Computer Graphics—Structural alignments of proteins/peptides were made with URMS (47Yona G. Kedem K. J. Comput. Biol. 2005; 12: 12-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Structural homology searches were carried out with DALI (48Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The Function Site Prediction Server was used to identify functionally important residues, which were considered significant if the generalized linear model score was >6.0 (49Cheng G. Qian B. Samudrala R. Baker D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5861-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Molscript (50Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) generated the molecular representations. Complementation of Atnoa1 by yqeH—For constitutive expression of AtNOA1 in plants, the AtNOA1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a cDNA template with primers that generated XbaI and SmaI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The PCR product was cloned into plant transformation vector pF3PZPY122 (51Feng S.H. Ma L.G. Wang X.P. Xie D.X. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Wei N. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This resulted in pF3PZPY122:AtNOA1, which encodes recombinant AtNOA1 tagged with three tandem FLAG epitopes at the C terminus. A DNA fragment encoding the first 101 amino acids of AtNOA1 was amplified by PCR with primers conferring NheI and XbaI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends and cloned into the XbaI site of pF3PZPY122 to make pF3PZPY122:101AtNOA1. Then the yqeH open reading frame was amplified by PCR, digested with XbaI, and ligated with pF3PZPY122:101AtNOA1 linearized by XbaI and SmaI to generate the chimeric yqeH construct for the complementation experiment. Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 was transformed with chimeric yqeH constructs and pF3PZPY122:AtNOA1, and the recombinants were screened in LB medium containing chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml). Atnoa1 mutant plants were transformed by the floral dip method (52Zhang X.R. Henriques R. Lin S.S. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Nat. Prot. 2006; 1: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The transgenic plants were selected for gentamicin resistance (50 μg/ml Murashige-Skoog media) and allowed to set seeds. The genotypes of T2 plants were confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA for the knock-out of wild-type AtNOA1 and chimeric yqeH and for constitutive expression of AtNOA1 cDNA. Based on the sequence relationships to CPG domains and previous reports that B. subtilis YqeH could interact with and hydrolyze guanine nucleotides (31Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 3539-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Loh P.C. Morimoto T. Matsuo Y. Oshima T. Ogasawara N. Genes Genet. Syst. 2007; 82: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of GsYqeH to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Initially, GsYqeH showed little evidence of nucleotide hydrolysis by HPLC analysis of products, but upon the addition of a known facilitator of nucleotide exchange (200 mm ammonium sulfate) (53John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), GsYqeH converts GTP to GDP over a period of hours in a Mg2+-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1). Similar findings were also made for AtNOA1 in a companion study that provides additional data for the GTP hydrolysis properties of this enzyme family (85Moreau M. Lee G.I. Wang Y. Crane B.R. Klessig D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32957-32967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction of YqeH homologs revealed an N-terminal motif found in the treble clef family of zinc finger domains (24Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The treble clef motif is contained within diverse proteins whose functions range from the binding of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules to the catalysis of phosphodiester bond hydrolysis (54Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Inductively coupled plasma analysis on GsYqeH, purified without the addition of zinc, identified zinc as the most prevalent metal ion in the sample (data not shown). Zinc was present at nearly stoichiometric levels compared with protein. Zinc also affects the hydrodynamic properties of GsYqeH. Gel filtration chromatography (Superdex G75) of a GsYqeH sample prepared separately from the one analyzed above produced an elution profile with two closely separated peaks at a volume consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the protein (supplemental Fig. 2). However, upon the addition of 300 μm zinc chloride (to 250 μm protein), the elution peak corresponding to the larger hydrodynamic radius disappeared, and all of the protein appeared with the smaller hydrodynamic radius (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, a population of recombinant GsYqeH is deficient in zinc, and zinc binding converts the protein to a more compact form. To identify the residues responsible for zinc binding, we sequentially mutated the conserved cysteine residues to serine in the treble clef domain. Single GsYqeH point mutants at C7S, C10S, or C39S, a double mutant C7S/C10S, and a triple mutant C7S/C10S/C39S were readily expressed and purified from E. coli. Proteins with the single and double substitutions eluted at the same position as zinc-bound native protein when expressed in rich media. However, the triple substitution C7S/C10S/C39S eluted as the zinc-free native protein and did not undergo any change in hydrodynamic radius when incubated with zinc (supplemental Fig. 2). Note that the single and double Ser substitutions may also disrupt zinc binding, but a compact structure could result from disulfide bonding. Thus, the small N-terminal domain of YqeH is indeed a zinc-binding domain and is very unlikely to also contain the cofactors necessary to catalyze the conversion of Arg to NO. Following previous reports on AtNOA1 (1Guo F.-Q. Okamoto M. Crawford N.M. Science. 2003; 302: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), the Griess assay was employed in attempts to detect Arg conversion to NO and further oxidized species by YqeH. No NO production from GsYqeH was observed under any conditions (data not shown). These included the presence and absence of the animal NOS cofactors tetrahydrobiopterin and calmodulin and reductants supplied as peroxide or NADPH. Given that the structure of YqeH (see below) bears no resemblance to NOS and contains none of the NOS-essential cofactors or binding sites for them, it is consistent that the protein does not have NO synthase activity. Notably, in a companion study (85Moreau M. Lee G.I. Wang Y. Crane B.R. Klessig D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32957-32967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) extensive tests for NO synthesis activity and arginine binding by AtNOA1 were also all negative. Overall Structure—Recombinant GsYqeH formed crystals that diffracted to 2.36 Å resolution. The structure (Fig. 1) was determined by a single wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment on l-selenomethionine-derivatized material (supplemental Table 1). N-terminal Zinc-binding Domain—The N-terminal zinc-binding domain (residues 1-58) is absent in the electron density maps, despite the addition of excess ZnCl2 during handling and no evidence for proteolysis in the crystals (as verified by SDS-PAGE). GDP that co-purified with the protein is found bound in the CPG domain. CPG Domain—The CPG domain has a typical G-protein fold with a central seven-stranded β-sheet (six parallel strands, one antiparallel strand) surrounded by six α-helices (Figs. 1 and 2A). In G-proteins, five sequence regions termed G1-G5 in the order they appear along the protein sequence, play important roles in nucleotide exchange, GTP hydrolysis, and conformational change (55Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 56Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). G1-G5 are spatially close and are all associated with loop regions. G1-G4 are defined by conserved residues: G1 (GXXXXGK(S/T)), G2 (T), G3 (DXXG), G4 ((N/T)KXD) (24Anand B. Verma S.K. Prakash B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2196-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 56Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in YqeH, the G-regions of the CPG domain are rearranged as G4-G5-G1-G2-G3 in the linear sequence (Fig. 2B). However, this permutation allows for the same three-dimensional fold observed in canonical GTPases, such as the sma"

S1P modulates diverse cellular functions such as apoptosis, cell differentiation, and migration either through the activation of a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors (S1P1–5) or by acting as an intracellular second messenger (1Saba J.D. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system S1P has been shown to be released by cerebellar granule cells and astrocytes (4Anelli V. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. Viani P. Riboni L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1204-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal.

Regarding its function in the central nervous system it is well known that S1P promotes survival of neurons and astrocytes, induces proliferation of neural progenitor cells and astrocytes, and mediates nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated neurite outgrowth (2Anliker B. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20555-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

However, very little is known about the role of S1P in the regulation of neuronal excitability and the mechanisms that mediate these S1P functions. Recently whole cell patch clamp recordings revealed that loss of S1P2 leads to a large increase in the excitability of neocortical pyramidal neurons (8MacLennan A.J. Carney P.R. Zhu W.J. Chaves A.H. Garcia J. Grimes J.R. Anderson K.J. Roper S.N. Lee N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an inhibitory effect of S1P2 on neuronal excitability. On the other hand, several in vitro studies show that S1P can also increase neuronal functions. For example, S1P receptor activation augments glutamate secretion in hippocampal neurons (9Kajimoto T. Okada T. Yu H. Goparaju S.K. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3429-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and elevated intracellular S1P concentrations enhance the spontaneous neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions (10Brailoiu E. Cooper R.L. Dun N.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intra- as well as extracellularly applied S1P facilitated the NGF-induced increases in the excitability of sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (11Zhang Y.H. Fehrenbacher J.C. Vasko M.R. Nicol G.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y.H. Vasko M.R. Nicol G.D. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).However, to date little is known about physiological processes in which regulation of neuronal functions by S1P may play a role. Recently we showed that intrathecal administration of the S1P receptor agonist FTY720 reduces the nociceptive behavior in the formalin assay, demonstrating an antinociceptive effect of S1P receptor activation in the spinal cord (13Coste O. Pierre S. Marian C. Brenneis C. Angioni C. Schmidt H. Popp L. Geisslinger G. Scholich K. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2007; 12: 995-1004Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Here, we investigated in vivo the role of S1P in the spinal cord on pain perception (nociception). We show that peripheral nociceptive stimulation decreases S1P concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and that inhibition of spinal S1P synthesis lowers pain thresholds. Moreover, elevated spinal S1P concentrations reduced the nociceptive behavior in the formalin test. Toward the mechanism of the antinociceptive actions of S1P, we found that S1P decreases the cAMP synthesis in excitatory spinal cord neurons and prevents the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of NMDA receptors in the outer laminae of the dorsal horn. These data present for the first time in vivo evidence that S1P is involved in nociceptive processing and modulated neuronal cAMP synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—S1P was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). N,N-Dimethylsphingosine (NNDS), dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS), and sphinganine 1-phosphate from Sigma.Antibodies—Antibodies used were directed against SPHK-1 (Orbigen, San Diego, CA), SPHK-2 (Abgent, San Diego, CA), nuclear neuronal protein (NeuN), CD146, glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (all Chemicon, Temecula, CA), VGLUT-1 and-2 (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM), 7-Amino Actinomycin D (7AAD) (both BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), IBA-1 (Wako, Richmond, VA), phospho897-NR1, and ATP synthase (Upstate-Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), phospho-T286 CamKII (Promega, Madison, WI) FITC-conjugated Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (IB4), FITC-conjugated phalloidin (both Sigma).

In all experiments the ethics guidelines for investigations in conscious animals were obeyed and the procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee. SPHK-1 and SPHK-2 knock-out mice were kindly supplied by Novartis, Switzerland (14Zemann B. Kinzel B. Muller M. Reuschel R. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Bornancin F. Baumruker T. Billich A.

HPLC analysis was done under gradient conditions using a Luna C18-column (150 cm long × 2 mm ID, Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). MS/MS analyses were performed on a 4000 Q TRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a Turbo V source (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) as described previously (17Schmidt H. Schmidt R. Geisslinger G. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 81: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the calibration standards, quality controls, and samples were evaluated by Analyst software 1.4 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). The coefficient of correlation for all measured sequences was at least 0.99. Variations in accuracy and intra-day and inter-day precision (n = 6 for each concentration, respectively) were <15% over the range of calibration.Behavioral Tests—Implantation of lumbar catheters was performed as described previously (18Hofacker A. Coste O. Nguyen H.V. Marian C. Scholich K. Geisslinger G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9005-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the exception that polyethylene catheters (0.28-mm inner diameter, 0.61 mm outer diameter, Neolab, Heidelberg, Germany) were used. The formalin assay (18Hofacker A. Coste O. Nguyen H.V. Marian C. Scholich K. Geisslinger G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9005-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the hot plate test (19Tegeder I. Del Turco D. Schmidtko A. Sausbier M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Deller T. Ruth P. Geisslinger G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3253-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The observer was unaware of the treatments in all tests.Primary Cell Cultures—Whole spinal cords or brains were collected from embryos 16 to 18 days postcoitus and directly transferred into ice-cold HBSS containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 as described previously (20Brenneis C. Maier T.J. Schmidt R. Hofacker A. Zulauf L. Jakobsson P.J. Scholich K. Geisslinger G. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the spinal cords were treated with trypsin-EDTA and collagenase (500 units/ml, Biochrom AG, Germany) followed by mechanical separation. To obtain neuronal cultures, the cell suspension was plated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and incubated for 2 h in neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After the cells became adherent, the medium was replaced and 0.01 μg/ml murine nerve growth factor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by serum-free medium and incubated for another 6 days until the cAMP assays were performed. To generate glia cultures the cell suspension was cultivated in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown for at least 7 days and split at least twice.cAMP Accumulation—cAMP amounts in primary spinal cord cells were determined as described previously (21Pierre S.C. Hausler J. Birod K. Geisslinger G. Scholich K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3031-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For cAMP accumulation assays with freshly dissociated adult spinal cords, the dorsal half of the spinal cord from an adult rat was treated with 5 ml of 0.1% collagenase in neurobasal medium containing B27 for 45 min at 37 °C and then mechanically dissociated. Remaining tissue was allowed to sediment for 1 min before the supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at 90 × g. The cells were washed twice with medium and then used for cAMP determinations.FRET Imaging—Primary spinal cord cell cultures were plated on poly-l-lysine coated, photoetched coverslips (Dunn Labortechnik, Asbach, Germany) and transfected with pcDNA-CAT-CFP and pcDNA-RII-L20-YFP constructs (22Lissandron V. Terrin A. Collini M. D'Alfonso L. Chirico G. Pantano S. Zaccolo M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Monheim, Germany) 24–72 h after plating. FRET imaging experiments were performed 48–96 h after transfection. Cells were maintained in Hepes-buffered Ringer-modified saline containing 136 mm NaCl, 5,4 mm KCl, 0,33 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl4, 10 mm glucose, 1,8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, at room temperature (20–22 °C) and imaged on an Axioscope 2 upright microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a ×63 Achroplan water immersion objective (Zeiss). The microscope was equipped with an Imago CCD camera, a Polychrome IV monochromator (all TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany), and a beam-splitter optical device (Multispec Microimager, Optical Insights). Images were acquired and processed using Tillvision software. FRET changes were measured as changes in the background-subtracted 480/545 nm fluorescence emission intensities on excitation at 430 nm and expressed as R/R0, where R is the ratio at time t and R0 is the ratio at time, 0 s. FRET signals were averaged over 20 s, and the calculation of statistical descriptions and best-fit were achieved using Sigma Plot 8.0. Cells were incubated with 50 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 25 μm forskolin and where indicated with 3 μm S1P. Phase contrast images of cells of interest and the square identification numbers of the photoetched coverslips were recorded to permit later identification of the cells in the MELC system.Calcium Imaging—Calcium imaging experiments were performed with primary spinal cord neuronal cells (described under primary cell culture) plated on poly-l-lysine-coated, photoetched coverslips for 3–6 days in culture. Prior to the determination of intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i), cells were incubated with 10 μm of the ratiomeric calcium indicator Fura-2 AM (Biotium, Hayward) in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Fura-2 loaded cells were washed twice with Neurobasal medium and transferred to the perfusion chamber (same setup as described under FRET imaging) and imaged with a ×40 Achroplan water immersion objective (Zeiss) at room temperature. [Ca2+]i was expressed as the ratio of the background-subtracted fluorescence emission at 510 nm (filter type LP 440) due to excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm using the Polychrom IV Monochromator (Till Photonics). Cells were first stimulated with 40 mm KCL-Ringer for 1 s by puff application prior to S1P application.MELC—MELC robot technology involved validated distinct hardware and software components, as described earlier (23Friedenberger M.

After FRET imaging, cells of interest were localized using the square identification number of the coverslips, the YFP fluorescence and the phase contrast images. The primary spinal cord cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, incubated for 10 min with 6 m guanidinium-HCl to remove YFP fluorescence, and fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. Then the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with normal goat serum (10%) for 60 min. The coverslip was placed onto a customized sample holder (2-mm thickness, inner diameter of 16 mm) and fixed with an adapted silicon ring (outer diameter 2 cm, inner diameter 1 cm) that also served as antibody incubation chamber. The sample was positioned onto the inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRE2; ×63 oil objective lens). By a robotic pipetting process, the specimen was incubated with fluorophore-labeled antibodies and wash solutions under temperature control. Phase contrast and fluorescence signals were recorded, followed by a bleaching step (488 nm for FITC and 546 nm for phycoerythrin). A postbleaching image was taken and subtracted from the image taken from the following epitope. Antibody labeling with FITC was performed as described previously (23Friedenberger M. Bode M. Krusche A. Schubert W. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2285-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Schubert W. Bonnekoh B. Pommer A.J. Philipsen L. Bockelmann R. Malykh Y. Gollnick H.

Recording and processing of all image data and the coordination of all system components were fully automatically controlled by software developed by MelTec GmbH (Magdeburg, Germany).Conventional Immunohistochemistry—Cells as well as tissue slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were done in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h each. The samples were washed 3× with PBS prior mounting. For analysis a Nikon Eclipse C600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Duesseldorf, Germany) was used. Quantification of antibody signals on spinal cord slices was done using ImageJ 1.39 (NIH) software. For each image the mean integrated density for the outer lamina II of the dorsal horn was determined according to IB4 staining and background corrected. Values for each spinal cord were acquired using 3–4 different slices and averaged.Data Analysis—The statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.RESULTSSpinal S1P Concentrations Are Selectively Decreased after Peripheral Nociceptive Stimulation and Modulate Pain Thresholds—First, we determined the expression of SPHK-1 and −2 as well as the expression of the S1P receptors S1P1–5 in the adult spinal cord. Both, SPHK-1 and SPHK-2, were detected by Western blot analysis in spinal cord lysates (Fig. 1A). The mRNA of all five S1P receptors (S1P1–5) was detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) in the spinal cord of adult rats, and the expression of the respective proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C).S1P itself as well as sphingosine and five ceramides were detectable by LC-MS/MS in the cerebrospinal fluid of naive adult animals (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate the effect of nociceptive stimulation on spinal S1P concentrations we employed two commonly used pain models. In the formalin model for acute pain, formalin is injected into one hind paw and the nociceptive behavior is recorded during one hour. In the second model zymosan is injected into one hind paw and the development of hyperalgesia is monitored over 8 h. We found that S1P concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were significantly reduced in both pain models (Fig. 2A) while the concentrations of all other detectable sphingolipids were not significantly altered (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Spinal S1P concentrations after nociceptive stimulation and influence pain thresholds. A, S1P concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of untreated rats (control) and after formalin or zymosan injection. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 4–7 animals. Two-tailed Student's t test: *, p < 0.03; **, p < 0.005; ***, p < 0.0005 compared with control animals. B, same as A except that the concentrations of other sphingolipids than S1P are listed. Nondetectable sphingolipids were: sphinganine, dihydro-S1P, C2-, C4-, C6-, C8-, C10-, C12-, C14-, C18:1-ceramid (Cer.). C, adult rats were given intrathecally 10 μl of the SPHK inhibitors NNDS and DHS or saline containing 3 or 0.3% DMSO 90 min prior determining pain thresholds using the hot plate assay. Two-tailed Student's t test: *, p < 0.05. D, pain thresholds of SPHK-1 and −2 knock-out mice as well as wild-type mice were determined using the hot plate assay (D). Data are presented as change in the withdrawal latencies compared with baseline measurements. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of 5–9 animals. Two-tailed Student's t test: *, p < 0.05 as compared with wild-type animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because in both pain models the S1P concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid decreased after nociceptive stimulation, we investigated whether a reduction of S1P synthesis facilitates the transmission of nociceptive signals. To reduce spinal S1P synthesis we intrathecally administered the SPHK inhibitors NNDS and DHS. Because of the fact that peripheral nociceptive stimulation alone decreases spinal S1P concentrations, we chose to determine the influence of the SPHK inhibitors on basal pain thresholds. 90 min after intrathecal application of NNDS or DHS, the rats exhibited significantly lower pain thresholds in the hot plate test as compared with control animals that received the respective vehicle (Fig. 2C). Also, SPHK2 knock-out mice had significantly lower pain thresholds in the hot plate test than wild-type mice or mice with knock-out of the gene for SPHK1 (Fig. 2D). Thus, so far the data show that pain thresholds can be modulated by intrathecal administration of S1P, S1P reduction by sphingosine kinase inhibitors, or the absence of one of the sphingosine kinases that might produce endogenous S1P.Spinal S1P Concentrations Modulate Nociceptive Behavior in the Formalin Assay—To determine whether elevated spinal S1P concentrations reduce nociceptive processing, we administered S1P intrathecally and determined its effect in the formalin assay. Administration of 10 μl of 5 and 10 μm S1P-solutions decreased the nociceptive behavior dose-dependently (Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, this antinociceptive effect of S1P disappeared at higher S1P concentrations (40 μm; Fig. 3B), which may have two reasons: First, at higher doses S1P may reach the DRGs and increase the excitability of sensory neurons within the DRG (11Zhang Y.H. Fehrenbacher J.C. Vasko M.R. Nicol G.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 96: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y.H. Vasko M.R. Nicol G.D. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Second, because high extracellular S1P concentrations are described to cause its uptake in cells (25Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), the second messenger properties of S1P could facilitate neuronal excitability (12Zhang Y.H. Vasko M.R. Nicol G.D. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To distinguish between both possibilities, we intrathecally administered sphinganine 1-phosphate (dihydro-S1P), a S1P receptor agonist that has similar receptor affinities as S1P, but that does not mimic the intracellular second messenger properties of S1P (25Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. J.

In contrast to S1P, intrathecally administered dihydro-S1P exhibited a linear concentration dependence in the formalin assay even at high doses (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the loss of the antinociceptive actions of S1P at higher doses is based on the intracellular properties of S1P in spinal neurons rather than the activation of S1P receptors on DRGs.FIGURE 3Intrathecally administered S1P and dhS1P decreases nociceptive behavior in the formalin assay. A, adult rats were given intrathecally 10 μl of 10 μm S1P or saline 30 min prior to formalin injection. The number of flinches during 5-min intervals is shown. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of 6–7 animals. B, same as A, except that the number of flinches from 0–15 min (phase I), 16–35 min (phase IIa), and 36–60 min (phase IIb) is shown. Two-tailed Student's t test: *, p < 0.0001; **, p ≤ 0.038 as compared with saline-treated animals. C, same as B except that dihydro-S1P (dhS1P) was given instead of S1P. Two-tailed Student's t test: *, p ≤ 0.03; **, p < 0.0001 compared with saline-treated animals. D, calcium imaging of 1634 spinal cord cells (365 neurons).

Neurons were identified in these cultures by their response to high KCl concentrations, by morphology, and in part by immunocytochemistry. Physiological S1P concentrations (1 μm) increased intracellular calcium concentrations in a significant number of glia but not in neurons (Fig. 3D) while S1P concentrations of 0.1 μm or lower did not instigate a calcium response in either cell type. However, high S1P concentrations (10 μm) increased intracellular calcium concentrations in about 50% of the cells, neurons as well as glia (Fig. 3, D and E). Similar to the S1P, incubation with 1 μm dihydro-S1P increased intracellular calcium concentrations in a significant number of non-neuronal cells without triggering a response in a significant number of neurons (Fig. 3D).

https://openalex.org/W2029229339,"There is increasing evidence that tissue-specific modifications of basic cellular functions play an important role in development and disease. To identify the functions of COPI coatomer-mediated membrane trafficking in Drosophila development, we were aiming to create loss-of-function mutations in the gammaCOP gene, which encodes a subunit of the COPI coatomer complex.We found that gammaCOP is essential for the viability of the Drosophila embryo. In the absence of zygotic gammaCOP activity, embryos die late in embryogenesis and display pronounced defects in morphogenesis of the embryonic epidermis and of tracheal tubes. The coordinated cell rearrangements and cell shape changes during tracheal tube morphogenesis critically depend on apical secretion of certain proteins. Investigation of tracheal morphogenesis in gammaCOP loss-of-function mutants revealed that several key proteins required for tracheal morphogenesis are not properly secreted into the apical lumen. As a consequence, gammaCOP mutants show defects in cell rearrangements during branch elongation, in tube dilation, as well as in tube fusion. We present genetic evidence that a specific subset of the tracheal defects in gammaCOP mutants is due to the reduced secretion of the Zona Pellucida protein Piopio. Thus, we identified a critical target protein of COPI-dependent secretion in epithelial tube morphogenesis.These studies highlight the role of COPI coatomer-mediated vesicle trafficking in both general and tissue-specific secretion in a multicellular organism. Although COPI coatomer is generally required for protein secretion, we show that the phenotypic effect of gammaCOP mutations is surprisingly specific. Importantly, we attribute a distinct aspect of the gammaCOP phenotype to the effect on a specific key target protein."
https://openalex.org/W2037288722,"The hepatitis B virus precore protein is closely related to the nucleocapsid core protein but is processed distinctly in the cell and plays a different role in the viral cycle. Precore is addressed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a signal peptide, and the form present in the ER is the P22 protein. P22 is then cleaved in its C-terminal part to be secreted as HBe antigen. In addition, a cytosolic form of 22 kDa less characterized has been observed. Precore gene was shown to be implicated in viral persistence, but until now, the actual protein species involved has not been determined. Our work focuses on the cytosolic form of precore. Using human cells expressing precore and a convenient fractionation assay, we demonstrated that the cytosolic form is identical to the ER form and retrotransported in the cytoplasm through the ER-associated degradation pathway. This cellular machinery translocates misfolded proteins to the cytoplasm, where they are ubiquitinated on lysine residues and degraded by proteasome. We showed that precore escapes proteasome due to its low lysine content and accumulates in the cytosol. The role of this retrotransport was investigated. In the presence of precore, we found a specific redistribution of the Grp78/BiP chaperone protein to cytosol and demonstrated a specific interaction between precore and Grp78/BiP. Altogether, these data support the idea that the hepatitis B virus develops a strategy to take advantage of the ER-associated degradation pathway, allowing distinct subcellular localization and probably distinct roles for the viral precore protein.

Persistence of HBV in the liver leads to development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although mechanisms involved in the establishment of viral persistence have not been yet elucidated, several studies have suggested that the viral precore protein plays an important role in this process (1Beasley R.P.

Virol. 1979; 3: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).HBV precore/core open reading frame contains two ATG initiation codons in-frame, which generate two proteins, the core protein (P21) and the precore protein (P25), that share almost their entire primary sequence with an extended N-terminal region for P25. The core protein is synthesized in the cytosol and self-assembles into a 180- or 240-subunit nucleocapsid structure (4Uetrecht C. Versluis C. Watts N.R. Roos W.H. Wuite G.J. Wingfield P.T. Steven A.C. Heck A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 9216-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the precore protein uses another pathway as the P25 protein contains a 19-amino-acid signal peptide targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Ou J.H. Laub O. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1578-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). During translocation of the nascent polypeptide into the lumen of the ER, the signal peptide is cleaved, leading to a 22-kDa precore protein (P22) that differs from P21 by 10 residues at its N-terminal end. P22 is further processed in the trans-Golgi network and cleaved by furin protease leading to HBe antigen secretion (6Messageot F. Salhi S. Eon P. Rossignol J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 891-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a cytosolic form of precore has been observed in HBV transgenic mice and in HuH-7 cells expressing the precore gene (7Guidotti L.G. Matzke B. Pasquinelli C. Shoenberger J.M. Rogler C.E. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7056-7061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ou J.H. Yeh C.T. Yen T.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5238-5243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This form, with an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa, will be referred in this study as cytosolic P22 molecule. The cytosolic P22 molecules are assessed only in about 15% of P22 expressed proteins (8Ou J.H. Yeh C.T. Yen T.S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5238-5243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The biological function of precore in viral cycle could be played by HBe and/or P22 precore form, and until now, this role has not been clearly defined. Precore is an accessory protein, not required for viral replication or infection (9Chang C. Enders G. Sprengel R. Peters N. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. J.

It has been suggested that HBe could be involved in viral persistence by inducing immunologic tolerance (13Milich D.R. Chen M.K. Hughes J.L. Jones J.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2013-2021PubMed Google Scholar, 14Milich D.R. Jones J.E. Hughes J.L. Price J. Raney A.K. McLachlan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Moreover, in HBV transfected cells, mutations leading to an abolition of precore gene expression result in a significant increase of HBV replication, suggesting that precore can negatively regulate this process (15Lamberts C. Nassal M. Velhagen I. Zentgraf H. Schroder C.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Scaglioni P.P. Melegari M. Wands J.R. Virology. 1997; 233: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This negative effect of precore was suggested to be due to cytosolic P22 molecules, which could form heterodimers with the core proteins (17Scaglioni P.P. Melegari M. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 345-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These hybrid nucleocapsids have been shown to be unstable and devoid of viral genome. In these studies, the authors presume that the cytosolic P22 protein is identical to the P22 protein present in the secretory pathway (here referred as ER P22). However, recently, some hybrid nucleocapsids containing a P22 molecule distinct from the ER P22 have been isolated in the serum of HBV chronically infected patients (18Kimura T. Ohno N. Terada N. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Ohno S. Maki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this case, the precore protein has conserved its signal peptide and has been cleaved at its C-terminal end. Therefore, various observations report the presence of a cytosolic P22 protein in infected cells, but its molecular identity and the mechanism explaining its presence in the cytosol remain controversial.Newly synthesized proteins in the ER are subjected to a rigorous quality control system, and consequently, the misfolded proteins should be retrotransported back into the cytoplasm to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This multistep process, called ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD), has been characterized recently (for review, see Ref. 19Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). First, misfolded proteins are recognized by chaperone proteins, such as Grp78/BiP (20Elkabetz Y. Shapira I. Rabinovich E.

Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Altogether, these chaperones lead to deglycosylation and disassembling of substrates and drive them to the translocon channel. The composition of this channel remains contentious and probably distinct in yeast or mammal cells. Indeed, it has been first proposed that Sec61 transmembrane protein could be the main transporter, but conflicting data have been reported (24Schmitz A. Herrgen H. Winkeler A. Herzog V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Wahlman J. DeMartino G.N. Skach W.R. Bulleid N.J. Brodsky J.L. Johnson A.E.

More recently, the derlin-1 protein has been characterized to be part of the translocon channel (26Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H.

The emerging substrate is most likely ubiquitinated on lysyl residues at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and recognized by a complex, which contains the ATPase P97 and its cofactors Ufd1-Npl4 (29Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The ATPase pulls the substrate out of the membrane, and the polyubiquitinated substrate is then addressed to the proteasome for degradation.The aim of our study was to define and characterize the cytoplasmic form of the HBV precore protein and the mechanism allowing its accumulation in the cytoplasm. For this purpose, a cytosolic fractionation procedure was developed to distinguish the few cytoplasmic P22 molecules from the ER P22. Using this procedure, we isolated and characterized cytoplasmic P22 as a protein identical to the ER P22, and we demonstrated that i) P22 reaches the cytoplasm using the ERAD pathway and ii) P22 escapes to proteasome degradation due to its low lysine content. We observed a Grp78/BiP redistribution from ER to cytoplasm that occurs along with the P22 retrotransport. Moreover, we demonstrated a specific interaction between P22 and Grp78/BiP, which could explain this Grp78/BiP relocation. All these data show a new mechanism by which P22 could be a candidate to explain viral persistence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—pCEP4mp25 and pCEP4mp21 were previously described in Ref. 31Laine S.

The pHPCΔsp plasmid, which allows the expression of a precore protein deleted of its signal peptide (P22Δsp), was previously described in Ref. 31Laine S. Thouard A. Derancourt J. Kress M.

This avoids the expression of the core protein and allows the expression of a precore protein mutated in the 11th amino acid. Precore mutants encoding single or multiple arginine to lysine substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on pCEP4mp25 plasmid. Resulting plasmids were named as follows: pCEP4mp25-5K (R136K and R142K substitutions), pCEP4mp25-6K (R48K, R136K, and R142K), and pCEP4mp25-0K (K1R, K16R, and K91R), numbering of amino acids start at the first amino acid of P22. pCEP4mp25-His plasmid was constructed in two steps; i) a pCEP4m-His vector was created by the insertion of a His tag at HindIII and XhoI sites of pCEP4m, and ii) precore sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pCEP4m-His. The resulting recombinant protein is composed of precore protein fused in C terminus to the Pro-Ser-Leu-His6 peptide. pCEP4mSeap-HA construct was obtained by cloning secreted alkaline phosphatase protein (SEAP) sequence from pSEAP2-control vector (Clontech) at NheI and HindIII sites of pCEP4m-HA, which was generated by the insertion of an HA tag between HindIII and XhoI sites of pCEP4m.

Derlin1GFP expression was checked in HEK293T cells before performing ERAD experiments.Cell Lines, Transfections, and Drugs—HEK293T and HuH-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin. For cytosolic fractionation,100-mm cell dishes were coated with a 25 μg/ml polyethyleneimine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 03880 Fluka) for 10 min and dried before seeding cells. Calcium phosphate transfections were performed on HEK293T cells as described previously (31Laine S. Thouard A. Derancourt J. Kress M. Sitterlin D. Rossignol J.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12875-12880Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); 1.5 million of cells were transfected with either 10 μg of pCEP4mSeap-HA plasmid or 20 μg of other DNA constructs. Transfections involving dominant negative mutants of ERAD pathway (pcDNA3p97, pcDNA3p97QQ, and pcDNA3-Der1GFP) were carried out 24 h after pCEP4mp25 transfection due to the toxicity of the mutants. HuH-7 cells were seed at 1.6 million cells in 100-mm dishes and transfected with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-al, Sigma) was added at 25 μm for 7 h before extraction. As MG132 is diluted in DMSO, non-treated cells were also incubated in the presence of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). Tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 2.5 μg/ml for 5 h.Western Blot and Antibodies—Protein extracts were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Precore and core proteins of HBV were detected with a rabbit anti-HBc antibody (Dako, B0586). Mouse antibodies against BiP (BD Biosciences, G73320), PDI (StressGen Biotechnologies, SPA891), HA (HA-11, Covance Research Products, MMS101R), and penta-His (Qiagen, 34660) as well as rat antibody against α-tubulin (ABCYS biologie, CBL270) were used as primary antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit (W4011) and anti-mouse (W4021) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Promega, and goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-2006). Proteins were detected using the ECL SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce).Cytosolic Fractionation Procedure—Cytosolic fractionation was performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 3 min on ice with 3 ml of a digitonin buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 22.5 μg/ml digitonin (D1407), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, all products provided by Sigma). Digitonin buffer containing cytosolic proteins was withdrawn and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Proteins from the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of 6 volumes of methanol during 12 h at −80 °C and centrifuged at 9,800 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Pellet was dried and suspended in 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, 161-0737) to obtain the cytosolic fraction. After digitonin treatment, cells were suspended in 300 μl of Laemmli buffer to obtain the non-cytosolic fraction. Ten percent of the non-cytosolic and 40% of the cytosolic fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE.Co-immunoprecipitation—Two cell dishes (100 mm) were washed twice with PBS, and cells were lysed in 1 ml of PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, Sigma). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For each reaction, 2.5 μl of anti-BiP antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies, SPA827) were mixed overnight to 50 μl of protein A-coupled Sepharose (Sepharose CL-4B, GE Healthcare, 17-0780–01) at 4 °C in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Then, lysates were incubated with the anti-BiP antibody and the protein A-coupled Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed in PBS, Nonidet P-40 1% buffer five times and boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer. Half of the immunoprecipitates and 20% of the crude lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Qiagen kit according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then 1 μg of total RNA were treated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was realized using Taq polymerase from Invitrogen. For the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript (sense primer, 5′-ATGCCCCCATGTTTGTGATG-3′, anti-sense, primer 5′-ATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCAT-3′), cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, 20 cycles (95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). For unspliced and spliced Xbp-1 transcripts (sense primer, 5′-CCTTGTAGTTGAGAACCAGG-3′, anti-sense primer, 5′-GGGGCTTGGTATATATGTGG-3′): 95 °C for 3 min, 32 cycles (95 °C for 45 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). RT-PCR products were separated by a 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.RESULTSThe Cytosolic P22 Is Identical to the ER P22—Precore has been reported to be present in the cytoplasm; however, the mechanism allowing this localization remains unknown. To characterize this point, we developed a cytosolic fractionation protocol to isolate and specifically detect cytoplasmic precore proteins, discriminating them from ER forms. Since the cytoplasmic precore forms are not abundant (around 15% of all precore derivatives), classical methods to permeabilize cells, which often slightly damage ER membrane, were not convenient. For this reason, we devised plasma membrane permeabilization conditions using mild non-ionic detergent digitonin, which selectively perforates the plasma membrane without ER membrane damage. The soluble cytosolic protein components, released out of the cells, are further precipitated by methanol. The insoluble remnant “ghost” cells are lysed in Laemmli buffer, and this extract will be referred as the non-cytosolic fraction. We did such an experiment on HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding precore (p25). Cytosolic fractionation assay was performed, and the presence of proteins in both fractions was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against either precore protein or PDI, an endogenous luminal ER protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, distinct forms of the precore protein were detected in the non-cytosolic fraction. Additional experiments, described in the legend of supplemental Fig. S1, allowed us to characterize the P22 ER form (Fig. 1A, arrow) and the P21 protein, slightly expressed with this vector (lower band, triangle). The middle band, indicated by a star,is most likely due to an aberrant site of signal peptide cleavage. Cytosolic fraction analysis revealed the presence of precore protein in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, arrow). Indeed, the absence of PDI from the cytosolic fraction demonstrates that the fraction is not contaminated by luminal ER components. As the precore form detected in the cytosol displayed the same electrophoretic migration than the P22 ER form, we assumed that it is a form of 22 kDa that will be referred as the P22 cytosolic form. In an additional control, we overexpressed the HA-tagged secreted alkaline phosphatase protein (SEAP-HA), the subcellular localization of which is restricted to the secretory pathway. We performed the same experiment as in Fig. 1A, and we showed that SEAP-HA is not detected in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 1B). Altogether, these data rule out the possibility that the presence of P22 in the cytosol may be an artifact due to overexpression.Two hypotheses could explain the presence of P22 molecules in the cytoplasm. First, cytosolic P22 could be the result of a retrotransport from ER to cytoplasm and consequently would be devoid of signal peptide. On the other hand, cytosolic P22 could correspond to a form, which still contains the signal peptide but has been subjected to a proteolytic cleavage in its C-terminal end (18Kimura T. Ohno N. Terada N. Rokuhara A. Matsumoto A. Yagi S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Ohno S. Maki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21713-21719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In all cases, these two forms will display the same electrophoretic migration and will not be distinguishable. To resolve this problem, we designed a new precore construction, named precore-His (P25-His), allowing the expression of a precore protein fused to a histidine tag at its C-terminal end. As shown in the diagram of the Fig. 2A, the first hypothesis should lead to a P22-His cytosolic form identical to the size of the ER form and still containing the histidine tag (23K). According to the second hypothesis, the cytosolic form would be shorter than the ER form and devoid of histidine tag (22K). Thus, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either P25 or P25-His. A cytosolic fractionation assay was performed, and protein expression was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against precore, His tag, or PDI. PDI protein was detectable only in the non-cytosolic fractions, indicating that cytosolic fractions are not contaminated by luminal ER components (Fig. 2B). Precore and precore-His were equally expressed in the non-cytosolic and cytosolic fractions. More importantly, precore-His cytosolic form showed the same electrophoretic migration as ER P22-His and clearly an apparent molecular mass greater than the wild type P22 cytosolic form (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, the precore-His cytosolic form was recognized by the antibody directed against His tag. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a cytosolic form of precore exists in cells. This form is not modified in its C-terminal part and shows the same apparent molecular mass as the P22 ER form. Consequently, we concluded that the cytosolic precore derivative is the result of a retrotransport from ER to cytoplasm of the ER P22 protein.FIGURE 2The P22 protein present in the cytosol is identical to the ER P22 protein. A, diagram showing both hypotheses to explain the presence of precore in the cytosol. Hypotheses are represented for the His-tagged version of Precore. P25-His is indicated with signal peptide in gray and the His tag in black. The first hypothesis (hyp1) corresponds to a retrograde transport from the ER to the cytoplasm of the P22-His ER protein (23K). Hyp1 should lead to a P22-His (23K) cytosolic form identical to the ER form and still containing the His tag. The second hypothesis (hyp2) corresponds to a protein still containing the peptide signal but deleted in its C-terminal part following a proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage site is arbitrary, indicated by an arrow, to produce a protein identical in the size of the P22 ER protein. With the P25-His construction, this hypothesis should lead to a cytosolic form (cyto) shorter than the ER form and devoid of His tag (22K). B, the P22-His cytosolic form is identical to the P22-His ER form. HEK293T cells were transfected either with the empty pCEP4m vector or with vectors expressing P25 or P25-His. Then, experiments were performed as indicated in the legend for Fig. 1, and blots were probed with the antibodies indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)P22 Retrotransport Utilizes the ERAD Pathway—To better understand and validate the retrotransport mechanism, we investigated the pathway involved in the translocation of P22 from luminal ER to cytosol. We assume that P22 could be retrotransported through the ERAD pathway, which is the main characterized pathway involved in translocation from ER to cytoplasm. However, as ERAD substrates are targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the question that arises is how precore could remain intact into the cytosol. The extremely low lysine content of precore (3 lysine residues on 193 amino acids) may favor the escape to ubiquitin conjugation. As a consequence, P22 will accumulate in the cytoplasm because it is not a suitable substrate for proteasome degradation. To test this hypothesis, distinct arginyl residues in positions 136, 142, and 48 were successively mutated into lysyl residues. The resulting mutant proteins, designated as P22-5K and P22-6K, were expressed in HEK293T cells. To assess the proteasome involvement, 40 h after transfection, cells were treated or not with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor and then subjected to the fractionation assay. A Western blot analysis showed that wild type and mutant precore proteins were identically expressed in the non-cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). Interestingly, although precore wild type protein was easily detectable in cytosolic fractions, few P22-5K proteins and none of the P22-6K mutant proteins were observed (lanes 9–11). In cells treated with MG132, P22-5K and P22-6K expression levels increased in non-cytosolic fractions (lanes 6 and 7), and more importantly, became detectable in the cytosol (lanes 13 and 14). This experiment strongly supports our hypothesis that wild type P22 protein is detectable in the cytosol due to its capacity to escape the proteasome degradation because of its low lysine content. Moreover, a mutant devoid of lysine (P22-0K) was constructed and tested in the same experiment. As shown in Fig. 3B, precore wild type and mutant proteins were easily and equally detectable in the cytosol in the absence of MG132 (lanes 5 and 6) as well as in the presence of t"
https://openalex.org/W2087425383,"Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) belongs to the CCN family and mediates cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Our previous studies showed that Cyr61 protected against hyperoxia-induced lung cell death via Akt phosphorylation. Caveolin-1 (cav-1), a 22-kDa transmembrane scaffolding protein, is the principal structural component of caveolae. Emerging data show that cav-1 regulates signal transduction-associated proteins that reside in the caveolae. Numerous integrin-related pathways, including PI3K/Akt-induced cell survival are controlled by cav-1-mediated signaling. Our data showed that recombinant Cyr61 promoted cell proliferation and resistance to hyperoxia-induced cell death in vitro. Neutralizing antibodies reversed the above effects, indicating functional role of secreted Cyr61 in response to hyperoxic stress. While deletion of cav-1 protected cells from hyperoxia-induced cell death, Cyr61-neutralizing antibodies abolished this protective effect. Furthermore, Cyr61 and cav-1 colocalized and physically interacted via integrins in bronchial epithelial cells. Deletion of cav-1 increased extracellular and decreased cytosolic Cyr61, both in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment with Brefeldin A increased intracellular Cyr61 in cav-1(-/-) cells, while decreasing extracellular Cyr61. Taken together, Cav-1/Cyr61 interaction via integrins represents a novel pathway of Cyr61 signaling involving cav-1-dependent processes, which play a critical role in regulating hyperoxia-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1992080284,"Background Despite the dramatic decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) observed since the introduction of conjugate vaccination, it is feared that several factors may undermine the future effectiveness of the vaccines. In particular, pathogenic pneumococci may switch their capsular types and evade vaccine-conferred immunity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we first review the literature and summarize the available epidemiological data on capsular switch for S. pneumoniae. We estimate the weekly probability that a persistently carried strain may switch its capsule from four studies, totalling 516 children and 6 years of follow-up, at 1.5×10−3/week [4.6×10−5–4.8×10−3/week]. There is not enough power to assess an increase in this frequency in vaccinated individuals. Then, we use a mathematical model of pneumococcal transmission to quantify the impact of capsular switch on the incidence of IPD in a vaccinated population. In this model, we investigate a wide range of values for the frequency of vaccine-selected capsular switch. Predictions show that, with vaccine-independent switching only, IPD incidence in children should be down by 48% 5 years after the introduction of the vaccine with high coverage. Introducing vaccine-selected capsular switch at a frequency up to 0.01/week shows little effect on this decrease; yearly, at most 3 excess cases of IPD per 106 children might occur due to switched pneumococcal strains. Conclusions Based on all available data and model predictions, the existence of capsular switch by itself should not impact significantly the efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on IPD incidence. This optimistic result should be tempered by the fact that the selective pressure induced by the vaccine is currently increasing along with vaccine coverage worldwide; continued surveillance of pneumococcal populations remains of the utmost importance, in particular during clinical trials of the new conjugate vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2045905040,"Synaptic activity stimulates the influx of calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron and thereby sets in motion a cascade of signaling events that lead to changes in gene expression. These changes in gene expression affect many aspects of nervous system development including dendritic morphogenesis, neuronal survival, and synapse development as well as the adaptive responses that underlie learning and memory in the mature nervous system. Mutations in components of the signal-ing pathways that participate in the process of experience-dependent brain development have been found to give rise to a variety of disorders of cognitive function including autism spectrum disorders.The initial contact between the axon and the dendrite during synapse development is mediated by cell surface-associated proteins on the pre- and postsynaptic membranes. For example, the binding of presynaptic β-neurexin to its postsynaptic receptor, Neuroligin1, leads to the recruitment of PSD-95 at nascent excitatory synapses. Ephrin/Eph signaling leads to the recruitment of additional proteins and the potentiation of NMDA receptor signaling. Release of the excitatory neurotrans-mitter glutamate from the presynaptic membrane and its binding to NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane lead to the opening of these glutamate-gated ion channels. This is followed by membrane depolarization, opening of the L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channel (L-VSCC), and a rapid rise in calcium ions in the postsynaptic neuron as well as other local changes including protein recruitment and activation. Calcium entry through L-VSCCs leads to the recruitment of AKAP79/150, which then recruits PKA to the channel. PKA phosphorylates the calcium channel, thereby increasing its ability to allow calcium ions to flow into the cell. Calcium ion influx through L-VSCCs is sensed by calmodulin (CaM). Activated calmodulin initiates a cascade of events including stimulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRF, followed by activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade. Calcium-activated calmodulin also activates the CaM kinase signaling pathway. Once activated these pathways trigger the phosphorylation and activation of a wide range of transcription factors such as CREB and NeuroD2. The phosphorylation of these transcription factors occurs in the nucleus and can be triggered by a cascade of events that begins at the site of calcium entry at the mouth of the calcium channel (that is, the Ras, Raf, MEK, ERK, RSK/MSK signaling pathway). Alternatively, channel activation can trigger an elevation of calcium ions directly in the nucleus that leads to activation of nuclear CaMKII by calcium/calmodulin, which in turn phosphorylates CREB and NeuroD2. In addition, dephosphorylation-dependent signaling through calcium/calmodulin activation of calcineurin leads to the activation of the transcripton factors NFAT and MEF2.Once activated and localized to the nucleus, calcium-activated transcription factors and modulators of transcription bind to the regulatory regions of activity-regulated genes to orchestrate finely tuned levels of gene expression. The most extensively studied activity-regulated gene is"
https://openalex.org/W2011770591,"Background With increasing numbers of crystal structures of protein∶DNA and protein∶protein∶DNA complexes publically available, it is now possible to extract sufficient structural, physical-chemical and thermodynamic parameters to make general observations and predictions about their interactions. In particular, the properties of macromolecular assemblies of multiple proteins bound to DNA have not previously been investigated in detail. Methodology/Principal Findings We have performed computational structural analyses on macromolecular assemblies of multiple proteins bound to DNA using a variety of different computational tools: PISA; PROMOTIF; X3DNA; ReadOut; DDNA and DCOMPLEX. Additionally, we have developed and employed an algorithm for approximate collision detection and overlapping volume estimation of two macromolecules. An implementation of this algorithm is available at http://promoterplot.fmi.ch/Collision1/. The results obtained are compared with structural, physical-chemical and thermodynamic parameters from protein∶protein and single protein∶DNA complexes. Many of interface properties of multiple protein∶DNA complexes were found to be very similar to those observed in binary protein∶DNA and protein∶protein complexes. However, the conformational change of the DNA upon protein binding is significantly higher when multiple proteins bind to it than is observed when single proteins bind. The water mediated contacts are less important (found in less quantity) between the interfaces of components in ternary (protein∶protein∶DNA) complexes than in those of binary complexes (protein∶protein and protein∶DNA).The thermodynamic stability of ternary complexes is also higher than in the binary interactions. Greater specificity and affinity of multiple proteins binding to DNA in comparison with binary protein-DNA interactions were observed. However, protein-protein binding affinities are stronger in complexes without the presence of DNA. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the interface properties: interface area; number of interface residues/atoms and hydrogen bonds; and the distribution of interface residues, hydrogen bonds, van der Walls contacts and secondary structure motifs are independent of whether or not a protein is in a binary or ternary complex with DNA. However, changes in the shape of the DNA reduce the off-rate of the proteins which greatly enhances the stability and specificity of ternary complexes compared to binary ones."
https://openalex.org/W2165344941,"We present a simple model of genetic regulatory networks in which regulatory connections among genes are mediated by a limited number of signaling molecules. Each gene in our model produces (publishes) a single gene product, which regulates the expression of other genes by binding to regulatory regions that correspond (subscribe) to that product. We explore the consequences of this publish-subscribe model of regulation for the properties of single networks and for the evolution of populations of networks. Degree distributions of randomly constructed networks, particularly multimodal in-degree distributions, which depend on the length of the regulatory sequences and the number of possible gene products, differed from simpler Boolean NK models. In simulated evolution of populations of networks, single mutations in regulatory or coding regions resulted in multiple changes in regulatory connections among genes, or alternatively in neutral change that had no effect on phenotype. This resulted in remarkable evolvability in both number and length of attractors, leading to evolved networks far beyond the expectation of these measures based on random distributions. Surprisingly, this rapid evolution was not accompanied by changes in degree distribution; degree distribution in the evolved networks was not substantially different from that of randomly generated networks. The publish-subscribe model also allows exogenous gene products to create an environment, which may be noisy or stable, in which dynamic behavior occurs. In simulations, networks were able to evolve moderate levels of both mutational and environmental robustness."
