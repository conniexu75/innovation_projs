https://openalex.org/W2057771278,"The ability to properly model intravascular steps in metastasis is essential in identifying key physical, cellular, and molecular determinants that can be targeted therapeutically to prevent metastatic disease. Research on the vascular microenvironment has been hindered by challenges in studying this compartment in metastasis under conditions that reproduce in vivo physiology while allowing facile experimental manipulation.We present a microfluidic vasculature system to model interactions between circulating breast cancer cells with microvascular endothelium at potential sites of metastasis. The microfluidic vasculature produces spatially-restricted stimulation from the basal side of the endothelium that models both organ-specific localization and polarization of chemokines and many other signaling molecules under variable flow conditions. We used this microfluidic system to produce site-specific stimulation of microvascular endothelium with CXCL12, a chemokine strongly implicated in metastasis.When added from the basal side, CXCL12 acts through receptor CXCR4 on endothelium to promote adhesion of circulating breast cancer cells, independent of CXCL12 receptors CXCR4 or CXCR7 on tumor cells. These studies suggest that targeting CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in endothelium may limit metastases in breast and other cancers and highlight the unique capabilities of our microfluidic device to advance studies of the intravascular microenvironment in metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2114622275,"The oncogenic phenotype is complex, resulting from the accumulation of multiple somatic mutations that lead to the deregulation of growth regulatory and cell fate controlling activities and pathways. The ability to dissect this complexity, so as to reveal discrete aspects of the biology underlying the oncogenic phenotype, is critical to understanding the various mechanisms of disease as well as to reveal opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. Previous work has characterized the process of anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells in vitro as a key aspect of the tumor phenotype, particularly with respect to metastatic potential. Nevertheless, it remains a major challenge to translate these cell biology findings into the context of human tumors. We previously used DNA microarray assays to develop expression signatures, which have the capacity to identify subtle distinctions in biological states and can be used to connect in vitro and in vivo states. Here we describe the development of a signature of anchorage-independent growth, show that the signature exhibits characteristics of deregulated mitochondrial function and then demonstrate that the signature identifies human tumors with the potential for metastasis."

Although adipose tissue-derived estrogen contributes to obesity-associated risk for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, the estrogen-independent impact of adipose tissue on tumor invasion and progression needs to be elucidated. Here, we show that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) significantly stimulate migration and invasion of ER-negative breast cancer cells in vitro and tumor invasion in a co-transplant xenograft mouse model. Our study also identifies cofilin-1, a known regulator of actin dynamics, as a determinant of the tumor-promoting activity of ASCs. The cofilin-1-dependent pathway affects the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in ASCs. Depletion of IL-6 from the ASC-conditioned medium abrogated the stimulatory effect of ASCs on the migration and invasion of breast tumor cells. Thus, our study uncovers a link between a cytoskeleton-based pathway in ASCs and the stromal impact on breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2134406000,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration leading to loss of cognitive abilities and ultimately to death. Postmortem investigations revealed decreased expression of cerebral insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins in patients with AD. To elucidate the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in AD, we crossed mice expressing the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APPSW, Tg2576 mice) as a model for AD with mice deficient for either IRS-2, neuronal IGF-1R (nIGF-1R−/−), or neuronal insulin receptor (nIR−/−), and analyzed survival, glucose, and APP metabolism. In the present study, we show that IRS-2 deficiency in Tg2576 mice completely reverses premature mortality in Tg2576 females and delays β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation. Analysis of APP metabolism suggested that delayed Aβ accumulation resulted from decreased APP processing. To delineate the upstream signal responsible for IRS-2-mediated disease protection, we analyzed mice with nIGF-1R or nIR deficiency predominantly in the hippocampus. Interestingly, both male and female nIGF-1R−/−Tg2576 mice were protected from premature death in the presence of decreased Aβ accumulation specifically in the hippocampus formation. However, neuronal IR deletion had no influence on lethality of Tg2576 mice. Thus, impaired IGF-1/IRS-2 signaling prevents premature death and delays amyloid accumulation in a model of AD.—Freude, S., Hettich, M.

https://openalex.org/W2171955717,"In lead discovery, libraries of 106 molecules are screened for biological activity. Given the over 1060 drug-like molecules thought possible, such screens might never succeed. The fact that they do, even occasionally, implies a biased selection of library molecules. We have developed a method to quantify the bias in screening libraries toward biogenic molecules. With this approach, we consider what is missing from screening libraries and how they can be optimized."
https://openalex.org/W2131881226,"A Neolithic domestication of taurine cattle in the Fertile Crescent from local aurochsen (Bos primigenius) is generally accepted, but a genetic contribution from European aurochsen has been proposed. Here we performed a survey of a large number of taurine cattle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control regions from numerous European breeds confirming the overall clustering within haplogroups (T1, T2 and T3) of Near Eastern ancestry, but also identifying eight mtDNAs (1.3%) that did not fit in haplogroup T. Sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome showed that four mtDNAs formed a novel branch (haplogroup R) which, after the deep bifurcation that gave rise to the taurine and zebuine lineages, constitutes the earliest known split in the mtDNA phylogeny of B. primigenius. The remaining four mtDNAs were members of the recently discovered haplogroup Q. Phylogeographic data indicate that R mtDNAs were derived from female European aurochsen, possibly in the Italian Peninsula, and sporadically included in domestic herds. In contrast, the available data suggest that Q mtDNAs and T subclades were involved in the same Neolithic event of domestication in the Near East. Thus, the existence of novel (and rare) taurine haplogroups highlights a multifaceted genetic legacy from distinct B. primigenius populations. Taking into account that the maternally transmitted mtDNA tends to underestimate the extent of gene flow from European aurochsen, the detection of the R mtDNAs in autochthonous breeds, some of which are endangered, identifies an unexpected reservoir of genetic variation that should be carefully preserved."
https://openalex.org/W1971821779,"Adiponectin is widely known as an adipocytokine with therapeutic potential for its markedly protective function in the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders, metabolic syndrome, systemic insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease and more recently carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show that adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that adiponectin treatment increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity as evident by increased phosphorylation of downstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and inhibition of p70S6 kinase (S6K). Intriguingly, we discovered that adiponectin treatment increases the expression of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of LKB1 in breast cancer cells further increased adiponectin-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK. Using isogenic LKB1 knockdown cell line pair, we found that LKB1 is required for adiponectin-mediated modulation of AMPK-S6K axis and more importantly, inhibition of adhesion, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Taken together these data present a novel mechanism involving specific upregulation of tumor suppressor gene LKB1 by which adiponectin inhibits adhesion, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate the possibility of using adiponectin analogues to inhibit invasion and migration of breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028277827,"The NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway regulates phase 2 detoxification genes, including a variety of antioxidative enzymes. We tested neuroprotective effects of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-MA, a potent activator of the Nrf2/ARE signaling. CDDO-MA treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in Nrf2 upregulation and translocation from cytosol to nucleus and subsequent activation of ARE pathway genes. CDDO-MA blocked t-butylhydroperoxide-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of ARE genes only in wild type, but not Nrf2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Oral administration of CDDO-MA resulted in significant protection against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, pathological alpha-synuclein accumulation and oxidative damage in mice. Additionally, CDDO-MA treatment in rats produced significant rescue against striatal lesions caused by the neurotoxin 3-NP, and associated increases in the oxidative damage markers malondialdehyde, F(2)-Isoprostanes, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and impaired glutathione homeostasis. Our results indicate that the CDDO-MA renders its neuroprotective effects through its potent activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, and suggest that triterpenoids may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1990821445,"Serine proteinases in insect plasma have been implicated in two types of immune responses; that is, activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) and activation of cytokine-like proteins. We have identified more than 20 serine proteinases in hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, but functions are known for only a few of them. We report here functions of two additional M. sexta proteinases, hemolymph proteinases 6 and 8 (HP6 and HP8). HP6 and HP8 are each composed of an amino-terminal clip domain and a carboxyl-terminal proteinase domain. HP6 is an apparent ortholog of Drosophila Persephone, whereas HP8 is most similar to Drosophila and Tenebrio spätzle-activating enzymes, all of which activate the Toll pathway. proHP6 and proHP8 are expressed constitutively in fat body and hemocytes and secreted into plasma, where they are activated by proteolytic cleavage in response to infection. To investigate activation and biological activity of HP6 and HP8, we purified recombinant proHP8, proHP6, and mutants of proHP6 in which the catalytic serine was replaced with alanine, and/or the activation site was changed to permit activation by bovine factor Xa. HP6 was found to activate proPO-activating proteinase (proPAP1) in vitro and induce proPO activation in plasma. HP6 was also determined to activate proHP8. Active HP6 or HP8 injected into larvae induced expression of antimicrobial peptides and proteins, including attacin, cecropin, gloverin, moricin, and lysozyme. Our results suggest that proHP6 becomes activated in response to microbial infection and participates in two immune pathways; activation of PAP1, which leads to proPO activation and melanin synthesis, and activation of HP8, which stimulates a Toll-like pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2094627135,"Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) repairs oxidized methionine residues within proteins and may also function as a general antioxidant. Previous reports have suggested that modulation of MsrA in mice and mammalian cell culture can affect the accumulation of oxidized proteins and may regulate resistance to oxidative stress. Thus, under the oxidative stress theory of aging, these results would predict that MsrA regulates the aging process in mammals. We show here that MsrA(-/-) mice are more susceptible to oxidative stress induced by paraquat. Skin-derived fibroblasts do not express MsrA, but fibroblasts cultured from MsrA(-/-) mice were, nevertheless, also more susceptible to killing by various oxidative stresses. In contrast to previous reports, we find no evidence for neuromuscular dysfunction in MsrA(-/-) mice in either young adult or in older animals. Most important, we found no difference between MsrA(-/-) and control mice in either their median or maximum life span. Thus, our results show that MsrA regulates sensitivity to oxidative stress in mice but has no effect on aging, as determined by life span."
https://openalex.org/W1966103845,"RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic sensors that recognize different species of viral RNAs, leads to activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which collaborate to induce type I interferons. In this study, we identified REUL, a RING-finger protein, as a specific RIG-I-interacting protein. REUL was associated with RIG-I, but not MDA5, through its PRY and SPRY domains. Overexpression of REUL potently potentiated RIG-I-, but not MDA5-mediated downstream signalling and antiviral activity. In contrast, the RING domain deletion mutant of REUL suppressed Sendai virus (SV)-induced, but not cytoplasmic polyI:C-induced activation of IFN-β promoter. Knockdown of endogenous REUL by RNAi inhibited SV-triggered IFN-β expression, and also increased VSV replication. Full-length RIG-I, but not the CARD domain deletion mutant of RIG-I, underwent ubiquitination induced by REUL. The Lys 154, 164, and 172 residues of the RIG-I CARD domain were critical for efficient REUL-mediated ubiquitination, as well as the ability of RIG-I to induce activation of IFN-β promoter. These findings suggest that REUL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of RIG-I and specifically stimulates RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2127767299,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a potentially fatal syndrome associated with the consumption of shellfish that have accumulated saxitoxin (STX). STX is produced by microscopic marine dinoflagellate algae. Little is known about the origin and spread of saxitoxin genes in these under-studied eukaryotes. Fortuitously, some freshwater cyanobacteria also produce STX, providing an ideal model for studying its biosynthesis. Here we focus on saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria and their non-toxic sisters to elucidate the origin of genes involved in the putative STX biosynthetic pathway.We generated a draft genome assembly of the saxitoxin-producing (STX+) cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis ACBU02 and searched for 26 candidate saxitoxin-genes (named sxtA to sxtZ) that were recently identified in the toxic strain Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3. We also generated a draft assembly of the non-toxic (STX-) sister Anabaena circinalis ACFR02 to aid the identification of saxitoxin-specific genes. Comparative phylogenomic analyses revealed that nine putative STX genes were horizontally transferred from non-cyanobacterial sources, whereas one key gene (sxtA) originated in STX+ cyanobacteria via two independent horizontal transfers followed by fusion. In total, of the 26 candidate saxitoxin-genes, 13 are of cyanobacterial provenance and are monophyletic among the STX+ taxa, four are shared amongst STX+ and STX-cyanobacteria, and the remaining nine genes are specific to STX+ cyanobacteria.Our results provide evidence that the assembly of STX genes in ACBU02 involved multiple HGT events from different sources followed presumably by coordination of the expression of foreign and native genes in the common ancestor of STX+ cyanobacteria. The ability to produce saxitoxin was subsequently lost multiple independent times resulting in a nested relationship of STX+ and STX- strains among Anabaena circinalis strains."

Despite their importance, a robust strategy comparable with gene or protein array technology for comprehensively analyzing the eicosanoid metabolome has not been forthcoming. We have developed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology that quantitatively and comprehensively analyzes the eicosanoid metabolome and utilized this approach to characterize eicosanoid production during experimental Lyme arthritis in mice infected with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Eicosanoids were extracted throughout infection from the joints of Lyme arthritis-resistant and -susceptible mice and subjected to lipidomic profiling. We identified temporal and quantitative differences between these mouse strains in the production of eicosanoids, which correlated with differences in arthritis development. The eicosanoid biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been implicated in the regulation of Lyme arthritis pathology, and subsequent lipidomic profiling of B. burgdorferi-infected COX-2−/− mice identified reductions not only in COX-2 products but, surprisingly, also significant off-target reductions in 5-lipoxygenase metabolites.

Our results demonstrate the utility of a comprehensive lipidomic approach for identifying potential contributors to disease pathology and may facilitate the development of more precisely targeted treatment strategies. Systems biology has advanced exponentially during the past decade, producing a wealth of data relating to disease susceptibility and pathology. Because of its immense scope and complex chemical composition, metabolomics has lagged behind its genomics and proteomics counterparts, hampering the advancement of sequential systems biology as a cohesive approach to disease investigation and drug discovery (1Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2089-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The unique challenges faced by metabolomics researchers are evident in the emerging field of lipidomics, the analysis and characterization of the enormous and diverse set of lipid molecules. For this reason, the Lipid Metabolites and Pathway Strategy (LIPID MAPS) consortium was created to provide an intellectual infrastructure for the advancement of lipidomics (2Schmelzer K. Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To expedite the elevation of lipidomics to a level comparable with that of genomics and proteomics, efforts have included the establishment of a comprehensive lipid classification system (3Fahy E.

Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1015-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As a class, these molecules act as spatially localized hormone-like signaling molecules that have a wide range of effects, and under non-disease conditions contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in almost every organ system (5Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3049) Google Scholar). However, it is because of their participation in inflammatory diseases that eicosanoids have been the target of intense study. For example, cyclooxygenases can generate pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PG), which are responsible for many of the hallmark signs of inflammation such as heat, redness, swelling and pain, whereas cytochrome P450s create epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET), which may affect local inflammation by promoting vasodilatation, and the lipoxygenases, which generate molecules with diverse signaling effects such as pro-inflammatory leukotrienes (LT) or anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution lipoxins (LX), resolvins (Rv), and protectins (PD). Metabolic and non-enzymatic breakdown products of these lipids can have significantly altered bioactivity, further complicating our understanding of these intricate pathways. The currently accepted model of inflammation proposes that both the induction of inflammation and its eventual resolution and return to homeostasis are not passive events but instead are coordinated, orderly processes actively signaled by specific protein and lipid molecules (6Serhan C.N. Chiang N. Van Dyke T.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response is the first step in the immune response and is characterized by an influx of innate immune cells, the production of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators, and tissue destruction. Conversely, resolution sees an influx of anti-inflammatory macrophages, pro-resolution lipid production, and tissue remodeling and repair. Although the roles of some individual eicosanoids in inflammation have been well studied, the overall biological significance of how these signals act in vivo to properly initiate and resolve inflammation has yet to be fully elucidated. Studies specifically addressing pathway interactions have investigated the connections between PGE2 and LX signaling in several animal models of autoimmunity (8Bannenberg G.L. Chiang N. Ariel A.

Jinks S.L. Eiserich J.P. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13646-13651Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have identified in vivo changes in prostaglandin signaling following modulation of endogenous EETs. Although these studies have examined isolated sectors of the eicosanoid metabolome, no reported study has comprehensively examined the temporal production of these metabolites. Our understanding of eicosanoid involvement in regulating the response to infection is even more fragmented and has been focused primarily on a few select metabolites (11Blaho V.A. Mitchell W.J. Brown C.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Bafica A. Scanga C.A. Serhan C. Machado F. White S. Sher A. Aliberti J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, a complete metabolomics approach on a scale comparable with current gene microarray technology is essential to achieve a thorough understanding of the inflammatory and immune responses and to facilitate the design of more effective disease therapies. To date, lipidomics studies have been capable of measuring, at most, only ∼40 eicosanoids, fewer than half of the known eicosanoid species, with a per sample run time of over 50 min (13Masoodi M. Mir A.A. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. Nicolaou A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 22: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Kiss L. Röder Y. Bier J. Weissmann N. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2008; 390: 697-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, extraction methods have been limited to primarily soft tissue samples such as lung or brain, excluding the possibility of lipidomic analysis of more complex tissues such as arthritic joints. These constraints create significant impediments toward the general applicability of previous methodology and require considerable technical development when applying them to other biological systems. For this reason, we have developed a protocol for complete eicosanoid extraction from complex tissue combined with a comprehensive LC-MS/MS methodology with a run time of 25 min/sample to identify and quantify 104 unique lipid species, which encompasses about 90% of the known eicosanoid metabolome (4Buczynski M.W. Dumlao D.S. Dennis E.A. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 1015-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These advances allow this technique to be robustly applied to diverse biological samples at a systems biology level. To demonstrate the applicability of such an approach, we utilized this strategy to investigate the role of eicosanoids in regulating the development and resolution of arthritis pathology in mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere and presents diverse pathologies, the most common of which is arthritis (15Steere A.C. Glickstein L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Lyme arthritis manifests in about 60–80% of individuals not treated with antibiotics and is characterized by cellular infiltrate consisting of primarily neutrophils and macrophages, a pathology that is recapitulated in the murine model (16Barthold S.W. Beck D.S. Hansen G.M. Terwilliger G.A. Moody K.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The resolution of arthritis is thought to be dependent upon the clearance of B. burgdorferi from the joints by specific antibodies. Genomic profiling of mouse strains that are resistant (C57BL/6, DBA/2) or susceptible (C3H/He) to the development of Lyme arthritis has yielded intriguing data (17Crandall H. Dunn D.M. Ma Y. Wooten R.M. Zachary J.F. Weis J.H. Weiss R.B. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7930-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but has generated more questions than answers as to the determining factor(s) for arthritis development. Although previous studies indicate that eicosanoids may play a role in regulating Lyme arthritis pathology, it is unknown which eicosanoids are involved or what their specific roles might be in this pathology (11Blaho V.A. Mitchell W.J. Brown C.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we present the first comprehensive lipidomic analysis of an in vivo inflammatory response, from initiation to resolution. Analysis of joints from Lyme arthritis-resistant and -susceptible mouse strains revealed significant differences in basal and infection-induced eicosanoid production between the two strains. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach by performing lipidomic analysis on joints from COX-2-deficient (COX-2−/−) animals during infection with B. burgdorferi at the peak of the inflammatory response. Lipidomics of COX-2−/− joints exhibited the expected decrease in COX-2 products but also revealed surprising decreases in multiple products from the 5-LOX pathway. These data establish the robustness of this protocol, as well as its potential to uncover unexpected regulatory pathways. LC grade solvents were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Synergy C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column and Strata-X solid phase extraction columns were purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Eicosanoids were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) and Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). With the exception of dihomo-PGF2α, primary standards for dihomo (adrenic acid-derived)-prostaglandins were not commercially available; these metabolites were analyzed qualitatively using previously characterized extracts from RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells prepared as described (18Harkewicz R.

Female C3H/HeJ (C3H) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice, 4–6 weeks of age, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). COX-2 heterozygous mice (B6;129S7-Ptgs2tm1Jed) were purchased as breeders from The Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed onto the C3H genetic background for 10 generations. Heterozygous mice were then intercrossed to produce knock-out and wild-type littermates. Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and given sterile food and water ad libitum. All studies were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Missouri. A virulent, low passage, clonal isolate of the B. burgdorferi N40 strain was used for all infections. Frozen stocks were placed in 7.5 ml of Barbour, Stoenner, Kelly (BSK) II medium (Sigma-Aldrich) with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and grown to log phase by incubation for 5–6 days at 32 °C. Spirochetes were enumerated using dark field microscopy and a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA). Spirochete dilutions were made in sterile BSK II medium, and mice were inoculated in both hind footpads with 5 × 104 B. burgdorferi organisms in 50 μl of medium for a final inoculum of 1 × 105, a concentration that reliably produces arthritis in susceptible animals (19Brown C.R. Blaho V.A. Loiacono C.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sham-infected control animals were injected with 50 μl of BSK II medium/hind footpad. To determine arthritis severity scores, a histologic analysis of the left tibiotarsal joint from each mouse was performed following sacrifice. The tibiotarsal joint was excised, fixed in 10% buffered zinc-formalin, and embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were evaluated in a blind manner by two independent observers and were assessed for arthritis severity on a scale of 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicated normal tissue, 1, 2, and 3 indicated minimal, mild, and moderate inflammation, respectively, and 4 indicated severe arthritis. The pathology present in histologic sections was characterized by neutrophil and monocyte infiltration into the joints, tendons, and ligament sheaths; hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the synovium; and fibrin exudates. The extent of the observed inflammatory changes formed the basis for the arthritis severity scores. B. burgdorferi-specific IgM and IgG levels in the sera of infected animals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (11Blaho V.A. Mitchell W.J. Brown C.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and then stored at −80 °C until extraction. Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Multiplex quantitative PCR for determination of B. burgdorferi loads was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (19Brown C.R. Blaho V.A. Loiacono C.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Bacterial loads are expressed as copies of B. burgdorferi flagellin per 1000 copies of mouse nidogen. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until extraction. The extraction protocol is a modification of Chen et al. (20Chen M. Lam B.K. Kanaoka Y. Nigrovic P.A. Audoly L.P. Austen K.F. Lee D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For extraction, each frozen tibiotarsal joint was wrapped in foil and placed in liquid nitrogen. The joint was then pulverized and the resulting frozen powder placed immediately in 3 ml of ice-cold 50% ethanol and then weighed. This protocol resulted in a nominal loss of tissue; the weight was later used for the normalization of eicosanoid levels in each sample. 10 μl of antioxidant mixture (0.2 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene, 0.2 mg/ml EDTA, 2 mg/ml triphenylphosphine, 2 mg/ml indomethacin in a solution of 2:1:1 methanol:ethanol:H2O) was added to each sample, and all tubes were kept on ice until incubation at −20 °C for 72 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 3500 × g for 30 min, and the clear ethanolic supernatant was removed to a new tube and dried under nitrogen gas. Samples were reconstituted with 2 ml of 10% MeOH and supplemented with 50 μl of internal standard containing the following deuterated eicosanoids (50 pg/μl, 2.5 ng total): (d4) 6k PGF1α, (d4) TXB2, (d4) PGF2α, (d4) PGE2, (d4) PGD2, (d4) 15d PGJ2, (d11) 5-iso PGF2α VI, (d4) dhk PGF2α, (d4) dhk PGD2, (d4) LTB4, (d8) 5-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (HETE), (d8) 15-HETE, (d6) 20-HETE, (d4) 9-HODE, (d4) 13-HODE, (d7) 5-oxoETE, (d8) 8,9-EET, (d8) 11,12-EET, (d8) 14,15-EET, (d4) 9,10-diHOME, and (d4) 12,13-diHOME. Samples were sonicated for 30 s with a probe sonicator and purified by solid phase extraction as described previously (21Buczynski M.W. Stephens D.L. Bowers-Gentry R.C. Grkovich A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22834-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Deems R. Buczynski M.W. Bowers-Gentry R. Harkewicz R. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, samples were evaporated using a SpeedVac and reconstituted in 50 μl of LC solvent A (water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (70:30:0.02, v/v/v)). Eicosanoids were separated by reverse-phase LC on a Synergy C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 300 μl/min at 50 °C. The column was equilibrated in solvent A (water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (70:30:0.02; v/v/v)), and 40 μl of sample (80%) was injected using a 50-μl injection loop and eluted with 0% solvent B (acetonitrile-isopropyl alcohol (50:50, v/v)) between 0 and 1 min. Solvent B was increased in a linear gradient to 25% solvent B until 3 min, to 45% until 11 min, to 60% until 13 min, to 75% until 18 min, and to 90% until 18.5 min. Solvent B was held at 90% until 20 min, dropped to 0% by 21 min, and held until 25 min. Eicosanoids were analyzed using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (ABI 4000 Q-Trap®, Applied Biosystems) via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in negative ion mode. The electrospray voltage was −4.5 kV, and the turbo ion spray source temperature was 525 °C. Collisional activation of eicosanoid precursor ions used nitrogen as a collision gas. Eicosanoids were measured using precursor→product (MRM) pairs, and the MS analysis was divided into six periods (Fig. 1, supplemental Table 1). The duty cycle for each period ranged between 390 and 840 ms, with an average time of 565 ms. The declustering potential and collision energy for each eicosanoid was optimized for maximal signal using flow injection mass spectrometry. Eicosanoids were identified in samples by matching their MRM signal and LC retention time with those of a pure standard. Extraction and ionization efficiencies were determined for the internal standards by comparing the ion intensity of the samples with those of the extraction controls. The range of efficiency for a typical experiment was between 20 and 75%, with an average of around 50%. Quantitative eicosanoid determination was performed by the stable isotope dilution method (21Buczynski M.W. Stephens D.L. Bowers-Gentry R.C. Grkovich A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22834-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Deems R. Buczynski M.W. Bowers-Gentry R. Harkewicz R. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 432: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Deuterated internal standards (2.5 ng) were added to each sample to account for extraction efficiency and mass spectrometry ion suppression. To calculate the amount of eicosanoid in a sample, the ratio of the natural eicosanoid peak area to the deuterated eicosanoid peak area (termed “eicosanoid ratio”) was determined for each sample. The eicosanoid ratio, proportional to ng of eicosanoid, was converted using the standard curve, 2.5 ng of each internal (deuterated) eicosanoid standard mixed with the following amounts of natural eicosanoid (nondeuterated) primary standard: 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 ng. The hepoxilin standards that are commercially available from Biomol each contain a mixture of two diasteriomers, which are not distinguishable by this methodology and are identified only as hepoxilin (HX) A3 and HXB3, respectively. For PD1 and Δ15t-PD1, the isomer 10S,17S-diHDoHE was used as the quantitative primary standard; for 11Β PGE2, the isomer PGE2 was used. Performing linear regression using Y = mX, where (Y = eicosanoid ratio, X = ng of eicosanoid, m = slope), the eicosanoid ratio was multiplied by (1/m) to determine the ng eicosanoid in a sample. The deuterated internal standards contained a small but detectable level of natural, undeuterated eicosanoid; to account for this, extraction controls were performed in quadruplicate and the ng of eicosanoid subtracted from each sample. The final values were normalized to the original weight of the tissue and expressed as ng of eicosanoid/mg of tibiotarsal tissue. In addition to quantitative analysis, data were expressed as a heat map to identify relative increases and decreases in metabolites over time. Similar to the quantitative analysis, the extraction eicosanoid ratio was subtracted from the sample ratio and normalized to the original weight of the tissue; this value was then normalized to the corresponding value at day 0. The (1/m) value determined from the quantitative curve cancels out of relative fold calculations. One advantage to eliminating (1/m) is that, for eicosanoids with a limited availability, analysis can be performed in the absence of full quantitation. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by a multiple comparison procedure, or t test, and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Upon infection with B. burgdorferi, arthritis-susceptible C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice developed a severe inflammatory response as measured by arthritis severity scores, which peaked at 2 weeks post-infection and then spontaneously resolved. Resistant DBA/2J (DBA) mice developed only a very mild inflammation (Fig. 2A). Bacterial loads in the joint tended to mirror the course of pathology (Fig. 2B), peaking just before the arthritic response. However, inoculum size does not affect susceptibility or resistance to arthritis development in most mouse strains (23Ma Y. Seiler K.P. Eichwald E.J. Weis J.H. Teuscher C. Weis J.J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 161-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in histopathology was most evident at the peak of arthritis, the development of which is dependent upon neutrophil recruitment into the infected joint (Fig. 2C, day 10) (19Brown C.R. Blaho V.A. Loiacono C.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas macrophages predominated during the resolution phase (Fig. 2C, day 35) (16Barthold S.W. Beck D.S. Hansen G.M. Terwilliger G.A. Moody K.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Resolution of arthritis is attributed to B. burgdorferi-specific IgM- and IgG-mediated (Fig. 2D) clearance of bacteria from infected joints (24Barthold S.W. Feng S. Bockenstedt L.K. Fikrig E. Feen K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 25 (Suppl. 1): S9-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Overall, DBA mice demonstrated less cellular infiltration into the joints with almost no differences in the bacterial loads and antibody responses, demonstrating that Lyme arthritis susceptibility is genetically regulated and independent of the numbers of bacteria in the joints (25Brown C.R. Reiner S.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1446-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Tibiotarsal (ankle) joints from B. burgdorferi-infected C3H and DBA mice were collected at various time points post-infection and analyzed for eicosanoid levels during the progression of arthritis (Fig. 3). The majority of joint mass is bone, making it difficult to extract the low levels of eicosanoids from the surrounding tissue comprised of infiltrating cells, muscle, synovium, intrarticular fluid, and cellular exudate. Joints were kept frozen with liquid nitrogen and then pulverized. The resultant powder was placed in cold 50% ethanol containing an antioxidant mixture to prevent lipid degradation. After 72 h of incubation at −20 °C, samples were clarified by centrifugation and supernatants dried completely under nitrogen gas. Repeated analysis found dramatically decreased eicosanoid levels with −20 °C incubation times less than 72 h and little to no increase in lipid concentrations with incubation times greater than 72 h. Samples were reconstituted with 10% methanol containing 21 deuterated internal standards representative of products from all major eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways. Subsequently, the samples were purified by solid phase extraction and stored in methanol for analysis (21Buczynski M.W. Stephens D.L. Bowers-Gentry R.C. Grkovich A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2132111454,"STIM1 and STIM2 are dynamic transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensors, coupling directly to activate plasma membrane Orai Ca(2+) entry channels. Despite extensive sequence homology, the STIM proteins are functionally distinct. We reveal that the short variable N-terminal random coil sequences of STIM1 and STIM2 confer profoundly different activation properties. Using Orai1-expressing HEK293 cells, chimeric replacement of the 43-amino-acid STIM1 N terminus with that of STIM2 attenuates Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry and drastically slows store-induced Orai1 channel activation. Conversely, the 55-amino-acid STIM2 terminus substituted within STIM1 strikingly enhances both Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry and constitutive coupling to activate Orai1 channels. Hence, STIM N termini are powerful coupling modifiers, functioning in STIM2 to ""brake"" the otherwise constitutive activation of Orai1 channels afforded by its high sensitivity to luminal Ca(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2166257330,"Identification of factors that improve muscle function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) could lead to an improved quality of life. To establish a functional in vitro assay for muscle strength, mdx murine myoblasts, the genetic homologue of DMD, were tissue engineered in 96-microwell plates into 3-dimensional muscle constructs with parallel arrays of striated muscle fibers. When electrically stimulated, they generated tetanic forces measured with an automated motion tracking system. Thirty-one compounds of interest as potential treatments for patients with DMD were tested at 3 to 6 concentrations. Eleven of the compounds (insulin-like growth factor-1, creatine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, trichostatin A, lisinopril, and 6 from the glucocorticoid family) significantly increased tetanic force relative to placebo-treated controls. The glucocorticoids methylprednisolone, deflazacort, and prednisone increased tetanic forces at low doses (EC(50) of 6, 19, and 56 nM, respectively), indicating a direct muscle mechanism by which they may be benefitting DMD patients. The tetanic force assay also identified beneficial compound interactions (arginine plus deflazacort and prednisone plus creatine) as well as deleterious interactions (prednisone plus creatine inhibited by pentoxifylline) of combinatorial therapies taken by some DMD patients. Since mdx muscle in vivo and DMD patients respond in a similar manner to many of these compounds, the in vitro assay will be a useful tool for the rapid identification of new potential treatments for muscle weakness in DMD and other muscle disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2046439590,"APE1 is the major nuclease for excising abasic (AP) sites and particular 3'-obstructive termini from DNA, and is an integral participant in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER capacity plays a prominent role in dictating responsiveness to agents that generate oxidative or alkylation DNA damage, as well as certain chain-terminating nucleoside analogs and 5-fluorouracil. We describe within the development of a robust, 1536-well automated screening assay that employs a deoxyoligonucleotide substrate operating in the red-shifted fluorescence spectral region to identify APE1 endonuclease inhibitors. This AP site incision assay was used in a titration-based high-throughput screen of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC(1280)), a collection of well-characterized, drug-like molecules representing all major target classes. Prioritized hits were authenticated and characterized via two high-throughput screening assays -- a Thiazole Orange fluorophore-DNA displacement test and an E. coli endonuclease IV counterscreen -- and a conventional, gel-based radiotracer incision assay. The top, validated compounds, i.e. 6-hydroxy-DL-DOPA, Reactive Blue 2 and myricetin, were shown to inhibit AP site cleavage activity of whole cell protein extracts from HEK 293T and HeLa cell lines, and to enhance the cytotoxic and genotoxic potency of the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate. The studies herein report on the identification of novel, small molecule APE1-targeted bioactive inhibitor probes, which represent initial chemotypes towards the development of potential pharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2079702499,"Tissue exudates contain low levels of serum complement proteins, and their regulatory effects on prostate cancer progression are largely unknown. We examined specific serum complement components in coordinating the activation of tumor suppressors p53 and WWOX (also named FOR or WOX1) and kinases ERK, JNK1 and STAT3 in human prostate DU145 cells.DU145 cells were cultured overnight in 1% normal human serum, or in human serum depleted of an indicated complement protein. Under complement C1q- or C6-free conditions, WOX1 and ERK were mainly present in the cytoplasm without phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylated JNK1 was greatly accumulated in the nuclei. Exogenous C1q rapidly restored the WOX1 activation (with Tyr33 phosphorylation) in less than 2 hr. Without serum complement C9, p53 became activated, and hyaluronan (HA) reversed the effect. Under C6-free conditions, HA induced activation of STAT3, an enhancer of metastasis. Notably, exogenous C1q significantly induced apoptosis of WOX1-overexpressing DU145 cells, but not vehicle-expressing cells. A dominant negative and Y33R mutant of WOX1 blocked the apoptotic effect. C1q did not enhance p53-mediated apoptosis. By total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, it was determined that C1q destabilized adherence of WOX1-expressing DU145 cells by partial detaching and inducing formation of clustered microvilli for focal adhesion particularly in between cells. These cells then underwent shrinkage, membrane blebbing and death. Remarkably, as determined by immunostaining, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer were shown to have a significantly reduced expression of tissue C1q, compared to age-matched normal prostate tissues.We conclude that complement C1q may induce apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by activating WOX1 and destabilizing cell adhesion. Downregulation of C1q enhances prostate hyperplasia and cancerous formation due to failure of WOX1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2082075917,"Hypoxia changes the responses of cancer cells to many chemotherapy agents, resulting in chemoresistance. The underlying molecular mechanism of hypoxia-induced drug resistance remains unclear. Pim-1 is a survival kinase, which phosphorylates Bad at serine 112 to antagonize drug-induced apoptosis. Here we show that hypoxia increases Pim-1 in a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-independent manner. Inhibition of Pim-1 function by dominant-negative Pim-1 dramatically restores the drug sensitivity to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy under hypoxic conditions in both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Introduction of siRNAs for Pim-1 also resensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs under hypoxic conditions, whereas forced overexpression of Pim-1 endows solid tumor cells with resistance to cisplatin, even under normoxia. Dominant-negative Pim-1 prevents a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential in solid tumor cells, which is normally induced by cisplatin (CDDP), followed by the reduced activity of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, indicating that Pim-1 participates in hypoxia-induced drug resistance through the stabilization of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Our results demonstrate that Pim-1 is a pivotal regulator involved in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Targeting Pim-1 may improve the chemotherapeutic strategy for solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1995802055,"We have developed a unique microfluidic platform capable of capturing circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by understanding surface chemistries and adhesion profiles. The surface of a variable-shear-stress microfluidic device was conjugated with 6 different antibodies [anti-CD34, -CD31, -vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), -CD146, -CD45, and -von Willebrand factor (vWF)] designed to match the surface antigens on ovine peripheral blood-derived EPCs. Microfluidic analysis showed a shear-stress-dependent decrease in EPC adhesion on attached surface antigens. EPCs exhibited increased adhesion to antibodies against CD34, VEGFR-2, CD31, and CD146 compared to CD45, consistent with their endothelial cell-specific surface profile, when exposed to a minimum shear stress of 1.47 dyn/cm(2). Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and artery-derived endothelial and smooth muscle cells were used to demonstrate the specificity of the EPC microfluidic device. Coated hematopoietic specific-surface (CD45) and granular vWF antibodies, as well as uncoated bare glass and substrate (1% BSA), were utilized as controls. Microfluidic devices have been developed as an EPC capture platform using immobilized antibodies targeted as EPC surface antigens.

https://openalex.org/W1978304531,"A marker-assisted background selection (MABS)-based gene introgression approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was optimized, where 97% or more of a recurrent parent genome (RPG) can be recovered in just two backcross (BC) generations. A four-step MABS method was developed based on ‘Plabsim’ computer simulations and wheat genome structure information. During empirical optimization of this method, double recombinants around the target gene were selected in a step-wise fashion during the two BC cycles followed by selection for recurrent parent genotype on non-carrier chromosomes. The average spacing between carrier chromosome markers was <4 cM. For non-carrier chromosome markers that flanked each of the 48 wheat gene-rich regions, this distance was ∼12 cM. Employed to introgress seedling stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistance gene Yr15 into the spring wheat cultivar ‘Zak’, marker analysis of 2,187 backcross-derived progeny resulted in the recovery of a BC2F2∶3 plant with 97% of the recurrent parent genome. In contrast, only 82% of the recurrent parent genome was recovered in phenotypically selected BC4F7 plants developed without MABS. Field evaluation results from 17 locations indicated that the MABS-derived line was either equal or superior to the recurrent parent for the tested agronomic characteristics. Based on these results, MABS is recommended as a strategy for rapidly introgressing a targeted gene into a wheat genotype in just two backcross generations while recovering 97% or more of the recurrent parent genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2065650174,"The role of the canonical NF-κB pathway in mammary tumorigenesis was investigated using a transgenic (TG) mouse expressing a dominant-negative inhibitor of κB (IκBαSR (S32A/S36A)) in the mammary gland under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV). TG and control mice were subjected to a chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Hyperkeratinized squamous metaplasias (cytokeratin−6+/p63+) sometimes with a basaloid island component, were found in both TG and control mice whereas luminal (cytokeratin-19+/MUC1+) ErbB2+ papillary and adenomatous lesions developed almost exclusively in control mice. p65/RelA- and NF-κB DNA-binding activity were detected in mammary luminal lesions, but rarely in squamous metaplasias. Analysis of NF-κB family proteins and target genes using microarray data from a cohort of human mammary tumors revealed the expression of a canonical NF-κB pathway, but not non-canonical pathway proteins in HER2+ luminal cancers. HER2+ tumors also showed differential regulation of specific NF-κB target genes relative to basal and ER+ luminal cancers. Isolation of mammary cell populations enriched for stem and progenitor cell characteristics from an NF-κB-EGFP reporter mouse by fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated that luminal progenitors contain activated NF-κB whereas the mammary stem cell-enriched population, does not. Together these data suggest that the canonical NF-κB pathway is active in normal luminal progenitor cells before transformation and is required for the formation of mammary luminal-type epithelial neoplasias."
https://openalex.org/W2123004796,"Mucosal surfaces of the reproductive tract as well as their secretions have important roles in preventing sexual transmission of HIV-1. In the current study, the majority of the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity of human seminal plasma (SP) was determined to reside in the cationic polypeptide fraction. Antiviral assays utilizing luciferase reporter cells and lymphocytic cells revealed the ability of whole SP to prevent HIV-1 infection, even when SP was diluted 3200-fold. Subsequent fractionation by continuous flow acid-urea (AU)-PAGE and antiviral testing revealed that cationic polypeptides within SP were responsible for the majority of anti-HIV-1 activity. A proteomic approach was utilized to resolve and identify 52 individual cationic polypeptides that contribute to the aggregate anti-HIV-1 activity of SP. One peptide fragment of semenogelin I, termed SG-1, was purified from SP by a multistep chromatographic approach, protein sequenced, and determined to exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity against HIV-1. Anti-HIV-1 activity was transient, as whole SP incubated for prolonged time intervals exhibited a proportional decrease in anti-HIV-1 activity that was directly attributed to the degradation of semenogelin I peptides. Collectively, these results indicate that the cationic polypeptide fraction of SP is active against HIV-1, and that semenogelin-derived peptides contribute to the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity of SP.—Martellini, J.

https://openalex.org/W2002979500,"The balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids plays a crucial role in determining the membrane fluidity. In the diploid fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the gene for fatty acid Δ9 desaturase, OLE1, is essential for viability. Using a reverse genetic approach, termed the fitness test, we identified a group of structurally related synthetic compounds that induce specific hypersensitivity of the OLE1+/− strain. Genetic repression of OLE1 and chemical inhibition by two selected compounds, ECC145 and ECC188, resulted in a marked decrease in the total unsaturated fatty acids and impaired hyphal development. The resulting auxotroph of both was suppressed by the exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1Δ9 and 18:1Δ9). These correlations suggest that both compounds affect the level of unsaturated fatty acids, likely by impairing Ole1p directly or indirectly. However, the residual levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) resulted from chemical inhibition were significantly higher than OLE1 repression, indicating even partial inhibition of MUFAs is sufficient to stop cellular proliferation. Although the essentiality of OLE1 was suppressed by MUFAs in vitro, we demonstrated that it was required for virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis even when the animals were supplemented with a high fat diet. Thus, the fungal fatty acid desaturase is an attractive antifungal drug target. Taking advantage of the inhibitors and the relevant conditional shut-off strains, we validated several chemical genetic interactions observed in the fitness test profiles that reveal novel genetic interactions between OLE1/unsaturated fatty acids and other cellular processes.

In fact, C. albicans persists as the single most significant fungal pathogen leading to life-threatening infections in terms of the total number of cases and the mortality rate in the hospital setting (1.Pfaller M.A. Diekema D.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3040) Google Scholar). Our understandings of its pathobiology as well as our efforts to identify therapeutic agents have been greatly facilitated by studying another Hemiascomycete, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genomic studies indicate that Hemiascomycetes represent a phylogenetically homogenous group of eukaryotes (2.Sherman D. Durrens P. Beyne E. Nikolski M. Souciet J.L. Génolevures Consortium Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D315-D318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, they are highly diverse at the physiological and ecological levels. Unlike the model yeast, C. albicans is a diploid without a sexual life cycle based on meiosis and sporulation. The application of the conventional forward genetic approaches is restricted. Its unique pathobiology, however, urges that biological studies be performed directly in the pathogen. To this end, large-scale construction of mutants has been undertaken in this diploid organism (3.Noble S.M. Johnson A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).One of the genetic strategies took advantage of the diploidy of C. albicans to create a library of heterozygous mutants in which each strain contains an insertional disruption of the Tn7 transposon. A screen of that library yielded a set of genes that was defective in the yeast-to-hypha transition when one allele was disrupted (4.Uhl M.A. Biery M. Craig N. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2668-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Haploinsufficiency (reduction in growth by a loss-of-function mutation of one allele in a diploid organism; e.g. phenotypic defects associated with heterozygous deletion strains) and conditional haploinsufficiency, in particular, provide the genetic basis to identify genes whose dosages become susceptible to a defined condition and, thus, are functionally involved in the relevant biological processes. As the genome of C. albicans has been determined and annotated (5.Jones T. Federspiel N.A. Chibana H. Dungan J. Kalman S. Magee B.B. Newport G. Thorstenson Y.R. Agabian N. Magee P.T. Davis R.W.

Because each strain was double-bar-coded at the deleted locus, the relative variations in growth (hence, the term of fitness test) of all the strains in response to chemical perturbations could be determined en masse by DNA microarrays (9.Xu D.

Usually, they contain strains corresponding to the targets and other factors that are directly associated with or involved in the targets or aspects of the mechanisms of action (MOAs). For example, fluconazole, the therapeutic drug used to treat fungal infections, induces specific hypersensitivity of heterozygotes for ERG11, NCP1, and CDR1, corresponding to the target, the co-factor of Erg11p, and the efflux pump for the drug, respectively (9.Xu D.

In most cases the fitness test profiles are highly indicative of the biological activities of the compounds tested, as the hypersensitive and resistant strains reveal aspects of MOAs of antiproliferative compounds that are susceptible to a 50% loss of gene dosage.

In this report we present the identification of structurally related small-molecule inhibitors that elicited significant hypersensitivity of the OLE1+/− strain in the fitness test and demonstrate that the two selected compounds reduce the level of unsaturated fatty acids and block hyphal growth.The balance between saturated (SFA) and unsaturated (UFA) fatty acids is a critical determining factor of membrane fluidity important for the function and integrity of the membrane systems of the cell. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the fatty acid Δ9 desaturase (ScOle1p) is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface and converts coenzyme A-bound SFAs (palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs, palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acids) by introducing double-bonds at carbon 9 in the carbon chains (14.Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16537-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The C. albicans Ole1p was shown to play the same role (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, although 16:1 is the predominant UFA in S. cerevisiae, the pathogen produces, in addition, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids) through the sequential formation of extra double bonds in 18:1 via Δ12 and Δ15 desaturases (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17.Mishra P. Bolard J. Prasad R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).In yeast, the level of unsaturated fatty acids is elaborately controlled. For example, multiple transcription regulatory elements have been identified in the promoter of ScOLE1. Its transcription is repressed by UFAs (which also regulates the stability of ScOLE1 mRNA) but activated by hypoxia and low temperature via the ER-bound transcription factors ScSpt23p and ScMga2p (18.Martin C.E. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both factors are, in turn, activated by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent ER-associated degradation, a process that is also involved in regulating the stability of ScOle1p (19.Braun S. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Thoms S. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 521-615Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Moreover, the UFA/SFA balance is important for other cellular processes. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutant of ScOLE1, identified as mdm2, resulted in a 2.5-fold decrease of monounsaturated fatty acids at the nonpermissive temperatures and caused the fragmentation of reticular network of mitochondria and accumulation of defective mitochondria in the mother cell during division (20.Stewart L.C. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, low levels of unsaturated fatty acids affect the nuclear envelope structure and, to a less extent, vesicular traffic (21.Schneiter R. Kohlwein S.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, diminished levels of OLE1 block hyphal development and formation of chlamydospores under the normoxic conditions (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Our results show that the effects of chemical inhibition by two selected compounds correlate with genetic repression of OLE1 (in a conditional shut-off strain), suggesting that Ole1p be the target. However, it is possible that their affects on Ole1p is indirect, as neither compound was tested for direct inhibition of the Δ9 desaturase activity in vitro. Nonetheless, we provide evidence that partial depletion of monounsaturated fatty acids is sufficient to be antiproliferative and demonstrate the essentiality of OLE1 in a murine model of systemic candidiasis.DiscussionIn this study we applied chemical genetic profiling in C. albicans to identify a series of structurally related synthetic compounds that induced significant and specific hypersensitivity of the heterozygous deletion strain for OLE1, encoding the fungal fatty acid Δ9 desaturase (Fig. 1). The fitness test results suggest that these compounds affect unsaturated fatty acids, likely by impairing Ole1p. Two representative compounds were selected for characterization of mechanism of action. The conditional shut-off strains provided a genetic means to examine the level of cellular fatty acids (Table 2), and the effect on hyphal growth (Fig. 4) when OLE1 expression was repressed. The overall correlations between genetic repression and chemical inhibition (Table 2 and Fig. 4), and suppression of both by the exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) supported the MOA hypothesis. The significant reduction in total unsaturated fatty acids and the concomitant increase in total saturated fatty acids (Table 2) are clear indications that both ECC145 and ECC188 inhibit UFA biosynthesis. The shared chemical structures and the CaFT profiles (Fig. 1) suggest that other OLE1 compounds act in a similar manner. They provide another example that illustrates the predicative power of the fitness test in studying mechanisms of action of unknown compounds; thus, its application in antifungal drug discovery (9.Xu D.

However, the question remains of whether the effects of ECC145 and ECC188 are because of direct inhibition of Ole1p, as neither was tested for direct inhibition of the Δ9 desaturase activity in vitro.Fatty Acid Biosynthesis in C. albicansFatty acids are a fundamental constituent of the cellular membrane systems that are involved in diverse biological processes. Their biosynthesis is energy-consuming and, thus, subject to elaborate regulation in response to physiological conditions and environmental cues. In particular, any imbalance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids could have a deleterious consequence, as in the case of the pTET-FAS1 strain exposed to 18:0, 16:1, and 18:1 under the non-repressing conditions (Fig. 2). Most likely, the replacement of the native promoter by a heterologous promoter escapes transcriptional regulation of FAS1 expression in the presence of excess downstream products, resulting in imbalances between not only unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, but also 16:0 and 18:0; our results (Table 2) and others (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17.Mishra P. Bolard J. Prasad R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28.Oh C.S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7030-7039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicate that the level of 16:0 is significantly higher than that of 18:0. On the other hand, the effects of exogenous 18:0 and 16:1 on the pTET-FAS2 strain were less severe (Fig. 2), and only the pTET-FAS1 strain was partially impaired in growth under the non-repressing conditions (Fig. 2B, mock). In S. cerevisiae, expression of ScFAS2 depends on the cellular level of free ScFas1p, and a responsive cis-regulatory element is in the ORF of ScFAS2 (29.Wenz P. Schwank S. Hoja U. Schüller H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4625-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As this might be the case in C. albicans (9.Xu D. Jiang B. Ketela T. Lemieux S. Veillette K. Martel N. Davison J. Sillaots S. Trosok S. Bachewich C. Bussey H. Youngman P. Roemer T. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), our results provide further evidence for the conservation of such regulatory scheme.OLE1 repression was partially suppressed by 16:1 and further enhanced by 18:1, the latter of which did not suppress by itself but impaired severely the pTET-OLE1 strain under the non-repressing conditions (Fig. 2C). 18:0 had a similar but less severe deleterious effect on this strain (Fig. 2B). Our analyses indicated that the heterologous pTET drove a lower level of OLE1 expression than the native promoter.3 This was further confirmed by two additional lines of evidence. 1) The level of monounsaturated fatty acids in this strain (MUFA/SFA ratio = 0.75) was significantly lower than that in the control strain (MUFA/SFA = 1.40); a less significant difference was observed with polyunsaturated fatty acids (Table 2). 2) The pTET-OLE1 strain was intrinsically more susceptible to both ECC145 and ECC188 than the OLE1+/− counterpart (Table 1, Fig. 3). In S. cerevisiae, transcription of ScOLE1 is repressed by unsaturated fatty acids, which also destabilizes the mRNA via its 5′-untranslated region. Saturated fatty acids, on the other hand, activate transcription of ScOLE1 without affecting the RNA stability (18.Martin C.E. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the ∼250-base pair region immediately upstream of the OLE1 ORF is important for its regulation in response to both exogenous 18:0 and 18:1. The interplay between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was further demonstrated by partial suppression of cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, by low concentrations of ECC145 and ECC188 (Fig. 6), suggesting relative growth advantage of partially restored UFA/SFA balance even when the overall fatty acid syntheses are impaired.Mechanisms of Action of ECC145 and ECC188Consistent with the MOA hypothesis generated in the fitness test, our results corroborate the chemical inhibition of both compounds with the genetic repression of OLE1 (Table 2, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). However, neither compound was tested for in vitro inhibition of the Δ9 desaturase activity (although the microsomal ScOle1p activity was tested in S. cerevisiae (26.Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none has been reported for C. albicans). We cannot, therefore, rule out the possibility that Ole1p is not the direct molecular target of these compounds and that their effects on unsaturated fatty acids are indirect.In S. cerevisiae, expression of ScOLE1 is exquisitely regulated by two homologous transcription factors, ScSpt23p and ScMga2p (18.Martin C.E. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The only ortholog, SPT23/orf19.1751, in C. albicans has been shown to play the same role. Its repression leads to reduction in monounsaturated fatty acids, and the resulting lethality is rescued by exogenous UFAs (28.Oh C.S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7030-7039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The heterozygous deletion for SPT23 was not constructed for the CaFT; neither was the pTET strain. Nevertheless, the chemical inhibition of ECC145 and ECC188 is also in agreement with the terminal phenotypes of SPT23 repression as reported (28.Oh C.S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7030-7039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is, thus, possible that these compounds inhibit Spt23p, which in turn stalls the OLE1 expression. The chemical genetic interactions characterized here reflect the exclusive role the transcription factor in regulating OLE1.On the other hand, the partial suppression of ECC145 (and likely ECC1883) by exogenous MUFAs (Fig. 5) suggests that the antiproliferative activities are not restricted to inhibition of monounsaturated fatty acids. Although genetic repression of OLE1 predominantly reduced the level of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA/SFA = 0.06), both MUFAs and PUFAs were affected by the two compounds (MUFA/SFA ≈ PUFA/SFA ≈ 0.3, Table 2). The genes for the two polydesaturases, FAD2 (orf19.118) and FAD3 (orf19.4933), are not essential (30.Murayama S.Y. Negishi Y. Umeyama T. Kaneko A. Oura T. Niimi M. Ubukata K. Kajiwara S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).3 The two heterozygous deletion strains displayed no significant growth variations against any of the OLE1 compounds or ECC145 in the presence of MUFAs in the fitness test (supplemental Table S1). We cannot, however, exclude a possible synergistic effect of impairing both MUFAs and PUFAs by ECC145 or ECC188 (particularly at high concentrations).The structural variability of the putative OLE1 compounds (Fig. 1, A and B) suggests the possibility that they could be metabolized in C. albicans, which in turn generates a common product that causes the observed effects. If so, the fitness test did not ostensibly reveal this aspect of the mechanism of action. As only ∼45% of the genome was represented in the current version of the fitness test (9.Xu D. Jiang B. Ketela T. Lemieux S. Veillette K. Martel N. Davison J. Sillaots S. Trosok S. Bachewich C. Bussey H. Youngman P. Roemer T. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), another possibility exists that these compounds affect another cellular process(es) which becomes synthetically lethal when chemically perturbed, with a genetic impaired unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (as in the case of OLE1+/− strain). If so, the potential target of these compounds could be related to the so-called secondary profiles in the fitness test (Fig. 1C and see below). We noted that the fatty acid profile of the parental strain (CAI-4), used to construct all the pTET strains, is different (Table 2). In particular, the level of monounsaturated fatty acids is significantly higher than both HIS3 (the control) and OLE1 conditional shut-off strains. It remains to be determined if genetic manipulations in CAI-4 and/or the pTET strains are responsible for changes in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and if such changes affect the susceptibility to these compounds.OLE1 as an Antifungal TargetRegardless of the exact molecular target of these compounds, our results and others (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28.Oh C.S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7030-7039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggest that an incomplete depletion of monounsaturated fatty acids is sufficient to block cellular proliferation. Although the results in Table 2 were not replicated biologically and, thus, must be interpreted with cautions, the fatty acid profiles resulted from ECC145 and ECC188 inhibition are in general agreement with each other. We note that the residual level of monounsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher in cells treated with either compound (at ∼5× minimal inhibitory concentration for 15 h, with ∼5-fold reduction in the MUFA/SFA ratio from ∼1.5 to ∼0.3) than in those depleted of OLE1 expression (∼15-fold decrease from ∼0.75 to ∼0.06) (Table 2). Using a similar promoter replacement strategy but with the MET3 promoter, Krishnamurthy et al. (16.Krishnamurthy S. Plaine A. Albert J. Prasad T. Prasad R. Ernst J.F.

https://openalex.org/W1985744953,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion, for which there is no effective disease modifying therapy. In recent years, transcriptional dysregulation has emerged as a pathogenic process that appears early in disease progression. Administration of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) have consistently shown therapeutic potential in models of HD, at least partly through increasing the association of acetylated histones with down-regulated genes and by correcting mRNA abnormalities. The HDAC enzyme through which SAHA mediates its beneficial effects in the R6/2 mouse model of HD is not known. Therefore, we have embarked on a series of genetic studies to uncover the HDAC target that is relevant to therapeutic development for HD. HDAC7 is of interest in this context because SAHA has been shown to decrease HDAC7 expression in cell culture systems in addition to inhibiting enzyme activity. After confirming that expression levels of Hdac7 are decreased in the brains of wild type and R6/2 mice after SAHA administration, we performed a genetic cross to determine whether genetic reduction of Hdac7 would alleviate phenotypes in the R6/2 mice. We found no improvement in a number of physiological or behavioral phenotypes. Similarly, the dysregulated expression levels of a number of genes of interest were not improved suggesting that reduction in Hdac7 does not alleviate the R6/2 HD-related transcriptional dysregulation. Therefore, we conclude that the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors are not predominantly mediated through the inhibition of HDAC7."
https://openalex.org/W2039697049,"Human melanomas show oncogenic B-Raf mutations, which activate the B-Raf/MKK/ERK cascade. We screened microarrays to identify cellular targets of this pathway, and found that genes upregulated by B-Raf/MKK/ERK showed highest association with cell-cycle regulators, whereas genes downregulated were most highly associated with axon guidance genes, including plexin–semaphorin family members. Plexin B1 was strongly inhibited by mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in melanoma cells and melanocytes. In primary melanoma cells, plexin B1 blocked tumorigenesis as measured by growth of colonies in soft agar, spheroids in extracellular matrix and xenograft tumors. Tumor suppression depended on residues in the C-terminal domain of plexin B1, which mediate receptor GTPase activating protein activity, and also correlated with AKT inhibition. Interestingly, the inhibitory response to plexin B1 was reduced or absent in cells from a matched metastatic tumor, suggesting that changes occur in metastatic cells which bypass the tumor-suppressor mechanisms. Plexin B1 also inhibited cell migration, but this was seen in metastatic cells and not in matched primary cells. Thus, plexin B1 has tumor-suppressor function in early-stage cells, although suppressing migration in late-stage cells. Our findings suggest that B-Raf/MKK/ERK provides a permissive environment for melanoma genesis by modulating plexin B1."
https://openalex.org/W1967425351,"Cyclin A accumulates at the onset of S phase, remains high during G(2) and early mitosis and is degraded at prometaphase. Here, we report that the acetyltransferase P/CAF directly interacts with cyclin A that as a consequence becomes acetylated at lysines 54, 68, 95 and 112. Maximal acetylation occurs simultaneously to ubiquitylation at mitosis, indicating importance of acetylation on cyclin A stability. This was further confirmed by the observation that the pseudoacetylated cyclin A mutant can be ubiquitylated whereas the nonacetylatable mutant cannot. The nonacetylatable mutant is more stable than cyclin A WT (cycA WT) and arrests cell cycle at mitosis. Moreover, in cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors cyclin A acetylation increases and its stability decreases, thus supporting the function of acetylation on cyclin A degradation. Although the nonacetylatable mutant cannot be ubiquitylated, it interacts with the proteins needed for its degradation (cdks, Cks, Cdc20, Cdh1 and APC/C). In fact, its association with cdks is increased and its complexes with these kinases display higher activity than control cycA WT-cdk complexes. All these results indicate that cyclin A acetylation at specific lysines is crucial for cyclin A stability and also has a function in the regulation of cycA-cdk activity."
https://openalex.org/W2038624062,"The human neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene is no longer principally considered a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family, as its domain structure and functions in innate immunity also warrant inclusion in the Nod-Like Receptor (NLR) superfamily. NAIP is located in a region of copy number variation, with one full length and four partly deleted copies in the reference human genome. We demonstrate that several of the NAIP paralogues are expressed, and that novel transcripts arise from both internal and upstream transcription start sites. Remarkably, two internal start sites initiate within Alu short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, and a third novel transcription start site exists within the final intron of the GUSBP1 gene, upstream of only two NAIP copies. One Alu functions alone as a promoter in transient assays, while the other likely combines with upstream L1 sequences to form a composite promoter. The novel transcripts encode shortened open reading frames and we show that corresponding proteins are translated in a number of cell lines and primary tissues, in some cases above the level of full length NAIP. Interestingly, some NAIP isoforms lack their caspase-sequestering motifs, suggesting that they have novel functions. Moreover, given that human and mouse NAIP have previously been shown to employ endogenous retroviral long terminal repeats as promoters, exaptation of Alu repeats as additional promoters provides a fascinating illustration of regulatory innovations adopted by a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W2034297330,"N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play critical roles in complex brain functions as well as pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. There are many NMDA isoforms and subunit types that, together with subtype-specific assembly, give rise to significant functional heterogeneity of NMDA receptors. Conventional NMDA receptors are obligatory heterotetramers composed of two glycine-binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate-binding NR2 subunits. When individually expressed in heterogeneous cells, most of the NR1 splice variants and the NR2 subunits remain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and do not form homomeric channels. The mechanisms underlying NMDA receptor trafficking and functional expression remain uncertain. Using truncated and chimeric NMDA receptor subunits expressed in heterogeneous cells and hippocampal neurons, together with immunostaining, biochemical, and functional analyses, we found that the NR2A amino-terminal domain (ATD) contains an ER retention signal, which can be specifically masked by the NR1a ATD. Interestingly, no such signal was found in the ATD of the NR2B subunit. We further identified the A2 segment of the NR2A ATD to be the primary determinant of ER retention. These findings indicate that NR2A-containing NMDA receptors may undergo a different ER quality control process from NR2B-containing NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2049977188,"Background Recent research on the “embodiment of emotion” implies that experiencing an emotion may involve perceptual, somatovisceral, and motor feedback aspects. For example, manipulations of facial expression and posture appear to induce emotional states and influence how affective information is processed. The present study investigates whether performance monitoring, a cognitive process known to be under heavy control of the dopaminergic system, is modulated by induced facial expressions. In particular, we focused on the error-related negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of performance monitoring. Methods/Principal Findings During a choice reaction task, participants held a Chinese chop stick either horizontally between the teeth (“smile” condition) or, in different runs, vertically (“no smile”) with the upper lip. In a third control condition, no chop stick was used (“no stick”). It could be shown on a separate sample that the facial feedback procedure is feasible to induce mild changes in positive affect. In the ERP sample, the smile condition, hypothesized to lead to an increase in dopaminergic activity, was associated with a decrease of ERN amplitude relative to “no smile” and “no stick” conditions. Conclusion Embodying emotions by induced facial expressions leads to a changes in the neural correlates of error detection. We suggest that this is due to the joint influence of the dopaminergic system on positive affect and performance monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2004394976,"The Mpz (myelin protein zero) gene codes for the principal component of myelin in the peripheral nervous system, and mutations in this gene cause human peripheral myelinopathies. Expression of the Mpz gene is controlled by two major transactivators that coordinate Schwann cell development: Egr2/Krox20 and Sox10. Our in vivo ChIP-chip analysis in myelinating peripheral nerve identified major sites of Egr2 interaction within the first intron of the Mpz gene and approximately 5 kb upstream of the transcription start site. In addition, the sites of Egr2 binding display many of the hallmarks associated with enhancer elements. Interestingly, the upstream Egr2 binding sites lie proximal to the divergently transcribed succinate dehydrogenase C gene, but Sdhc expression was not affected by the massive induction of Mpz mediated by Egr2. Mpz induction was greatly enhanced in the presence of the Egr2 binding sites, and removal of them markedly diminished transgenic expression of a construct derived from the Mpz locus. Sox10 was also found to be associated with the upstream region, and its binding was required for Egr2-mediated activation in this distal regulatory region. Our findings highlight that peripheral nerve-specific expression of Mpz is primarily regulated by both upstream and intron-associated regulatory elements. Overall, these results provide a locus-wide analysis of the role and activity of Egr2 in regulation of the Mpz gene within its native chromosomal context."
https://openalex.org/W2165687899,"DNA-reactive B cells play a central role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); DNA antibodies precede clinical disease and in established disease correlate with renal inflammation and contribute to dendritic cell activation and high levels of type 1 interferon. A number of central and peripheral B cell tolerance mechanisms designed to control the survival, differentiation and activation of autoreactive B cells are thought to be disturbed in patients with SLE. The characterization of DNA-reactive B cells has, however, been limited by their low frequency in peripheral blood. Using a tetrameric configuration of a peptide mimetope of DNA bound by pathogenic anti-DNA antibodies, we can identify B cells producing potentially pathogenic DNA-reactive antibodies. We, therefore, characterized the maturation and differentiation states of peptide, (ds) double stranded DNA cross-reactive B cells in the peripheral blood of lupus patients and correlated these with clinical disease activity. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of tetramer-binding B cells in SLE patients compared to healthy controls. We demonstrated the existence of a novel tolerance checkpoint at the transition of antigen-naïve to antigen-experienced. We further demonstrate that patients with moderately active disease have more autoreactive B cells in both the antigen-naïve and antigen-experienced compartments consistent with greater impairment in B cell tolerance in both early and late checkpoints in these patients than in patients with quiescent disease. This methodology enables us to gain insight into the development and fate of DNA-reactive B cells in individual patients with SLE and paves the way ultimately to permit better and more customized therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2093766743,"Fibrosis is characterized by elevated transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling, resulting in extracellular matrix accumulation and increased PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) expression. PAI-1 induces the internalization of urokinase plasminogen activator/receptor and integrin alphavbeta3 from the cell surface. Since increased alphavbeta3 expression correlates with increased TGFbeta signaling, we hypothesized that aberrant PAI-1-mediated alphavbeta3 endocytosis could initiate an autocrine loop of TGFbeta activity. We found that in PAI-1 knock-out (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts), alphavbeta3 endocytosis was reduced by approximately 75%, leaving alphavbeta3 in enlarged focal adhesions, similar to wild type cells transfected with PAI-1 small interfering RNA. TGFbeta signaling was significantly enhanced in PAI-1 KO cells, as demonstrated by a 3-fold increase in SMAD2/3-containing nuclei and a 2.9-fold increase in TGFbeta activity that correlated with an increase in alphavbeta3 and TGFbeta receptor II expression. As expected, PAI-1 KO cells had unregulated plasmin activity, which was only partially responsible for TGFbeta activation, as evidenced by a mere 25% reduction in TGFbeta activity when plasmin was inhibited. Treatment of cells with an alphavbeta3-specific cyclic RGD peptide (GpenGRGD) led to a more profound (59%) TGFbeta inhibition; a nonspecific RGD peptide (GRGDNP) inhibited TGFbeta by only 23%. Human primary fibroblasts were used to confirm that PAI-1 inhibition and beta3 overexpression led to an increase in TGFbeta activity. Consistent with a fibrotic phenotype, PAI-1 KO cells were constitutively myofibroblasts that had a 1.6-fold increase in collagen deposition over wild type cells. These data suggest that PAI-1-mediated regulation of alphavbeta3 integrin is critical for the control of TGFbeta signaling and the prevention of fibrotic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1977475485,"Little has been known about Tlr13 (Toll-like receptor 13), a novel member of the Toll-like receptor family. To elucidate the molecular basis of murine Tlr13 gene expression, the activity of the Tlr13 gene promoter was characterized. Reporter gene analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Tlr13 gene transcription was regulated through three cis-acting elements that interacted with the Ets2, Sp1, and PU.1 transcription factors. Furthermore, our work suggests that these transcription factors may cooperate, culminating in maximal transcription of the Tlr13 gene. In contrast, NF-kappaB appeared to act as an inhibitor of Tlr13 transcription. Overexpression of Ets2 caused a strong increase in the transcriptional activity of the Tlr13 promoter; however, overexpression of NF-kappaB p65 dramatically inhibited it. Additionally, interferon-beta is capable of acting Tlr13 transcription, but the activated signaling of lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 and peptidoglycan/TLR2 strongly inhibited the Tlr13 gene promoter. Thus, these findings reveal the mechanism of Tlr13 gene regulation, thereby providing insight into the function of Tlr13 in the immune response to pathogen."

Very little is known about the cellular function of SNX33. In an effort to analyze its structure/function relationship, we attempted but failed to generate stable cell lines for short hairpin RNA or overexpression SNX33. Transient knockdown of SNX33 induces both HeLa and MCF7 cells to grow multiple long processes, delay the G(1)/M transition, and become more apoptotic, implying that SNX33 may control cell cycle process through influence the cytoskeleton. In vitro cell lineage analysis revealed that cells transfected with SNX33 failed to divide and became micronucleated, suggesting a specific defect in cytokinesis. Further analysis revealed that SNX33 induced the accumulation of actin at the perinuclear space, which might have disabled the cytokinetic machinery. However, SNX33 appears to mediate actin polymerization indirectly, as they do not interact with each other. SNX33 interacts with itself and SNX9. Interestingly, it also interacts with VCA domain of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp), a protein known to be involved in actin polymerization. Indeed, cells overexpressing WASp failed to divide and form stable colonies as SNX33, consistent with the notion that SNX33 may interfere with cytokinesis. On the other hand, knockdown of WASp alleviates the phenotype induced by SNX33. Taken together, our results suggest that SNX33 plays a role in maintaining cell shape and cell cycle progression through its interaction with WASp."
https://openalex.org/W2009074588,"Upregulation and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and/or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in a variety of cancers have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. High-molecular-weight kininogen can be hydrolysed by plasma kallikrein to bradykinin and cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen (HKa). HKa and its domain 5 (D5) both have been shown to have potent anti-angiogenic activity. We now show that HKa blocks human prostate cancer cell (DU145) migration by 76.0+/-2.4% at 300 nM and invasion by 78.0+/-12.9% at 11.1 nM. D5 inhibits tumor migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. Stimulation by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor results in clustering of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of DU145 cells. The co-localization of uPAR and EGFR is prevented by HKa. Immunoprecipitation suggests that uPAR, EGFR and alpha5beta1 integrin formed a ternary complex. Immunoblotting shows that HKa significantly decreases the bFGF-transactivated phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr 1173 between 30 min and 4 h. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT, which are downstream effectors of EGFR, is also inhibited by HKa. These novel data indicate that HKa and D5 inhibit migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through an EGFR/uPAR pathway, suggesting the therapeutic potential of HKa and D5 to decrease metastasis of human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2074589994,"The purpose of this study was to identify the role of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in Der f 2-induced interleukin (IL)-13 production. The major house dust mite allergen, Der f 2, increased PLD activity in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), and dominant negative PLD1 or PLD1 siRNA decreased Der f 2-induced IL-13 expression and production. Treatment of Der f 2 activated the phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma)/protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha)/p38 MAPK pathway. Der f 2-induced PLD activation was attenuated by PLCgamma inhibitors (U73122 and PAO), PKCalpha inhibitors (RO320432 and GO6976), and p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190). These results indicate that PLCgamma, PKCalpha, and p38 MAPK act as upstream activators of PLD in Der f 2-treated BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, expression and production of IL-13 increased by Der f 2 were also blocked by inhibition of PLCgamma, PKCalpha, or p38 MAPK, indicating that IL-13 expression and production are related to a PLCgamma/PKCalpha/p38 MAPK pathway. We found that activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) was activated by Der f 2 in BEAS-2B cells and activation of ATF-2 was controlled by PLD1. When ATF-2 activity was blocked with ATF-2 siRNA, Der f 2-induced IL-13 expression and production were decreased. Thus, ATF-2 might be one of the transcriptional factors for the expression of IL-13 in Der f 2-treated BEAS-2B cells. Taken together, PLD1 acts as an important regulator in Der f 2-induced expression and production of IL-13 through activation of ATF-2 in BEAS-2B cells."

To identify CDH23-interacting proteins, a membrane-based yeast two-hybrid screen of an outer hair cell (OHC) cDNA library was performed. EHD4, a member of the C-terminal EH domain containing a protein family involved in endocytic recycling, was identified as a potential interactor. To confirm the interaction, we first demonstrated the EHD4 mRNA expression in hair cells using in situ hybridization. Next, we showed that EHD4 co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with CDH23 in mammalian cells. Interestingly, the co-immunoprecipitation was found to be calcium-sensitive. To investigate the role of EHD4 in hearing, compound action potentials were measured in EHD4 knock-out (KO) mice. Although EHD4 KO mice have normal hearing sensitivity, analysis of mouse cochlear lysates revealed a 2-fold increase in EHD1, but no increase in EHD2 or EHD3, in EHD4 KO cochleae compared with wild type, suggesting that a compensatory increase in EHD1 levels may account for the absence of a hearing defect in EHD4 KO mice.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43103-43110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown this intracellular protein to be involved in the regulation of neurotrophin receptor TrkA endocytosis in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (27Shao Y. Akmentin W. Toledo-Aral J.J. Rosenbaum J. Valdez G. Cabot J.B. Hilbush B.S. Halegoua S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is also involved in interactions with the cell fate determinant, NUMB, and co-localizes with the small GTP-binding protein, Arf6 (28Smith C.A. Dho S.E. Donaldson J. Tepass U. McGlade C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3698-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, Sharma et al. (29Sharma M. Naslavsky N. Caplan S. Traffic. 2008; 9: 995-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that EHD4 regulates the exit of endocytic cargo from the early endosome toward both the recycling compartment and the late endocytic pathway. They also indicated that EHD4 and EHD1 interact transiently as most of the EHD4 resides on peripheral early endosomes, while EHD1 resides primarily on tubular recycling compartments. This partial overlap/association might be necessary for the transport of proteins through the early endosome to the ERC. Previously, George et al. (25George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A. Parikh P.T. Gao Q. Band V. Band H. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) had also demonstrated that EHD4 interacts with EHD1 and its paralogs, which suggests cooperation and partial overlap of function between EHD4 and EHD1. Unlike other CDH23-binding proteins, EHD4 does not contain a PDZ domain that could bind to the PBI located in the cytoplasmic tail of CDH23. In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of CDH23 lacks an Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif that could mediate an interaction with the EH domain of EHD4. Therefore, we proceeded to characterize the authenticity of interaction between EHD4 and CDH23 identified in yeast and mammalian cells, using both in vitro and in vivo methods. We verified the expression of EHD4 mRNA in mouse cochlea and investigated the physiological role of EHD4 protein in the cochlea using EHD4-KO mice. Constructs encoding Myc-tagged and GFP-tagged full-length EHD4 and EHD4ΔEH are described previously (25George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A. Parikh P.T. Gao Q. Band V. Band H. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Otocdh23 DF-pFLAG-CMV-1 (kindly provided by Dr. James R. Bartles) contains a FLAG tag, several extracellular cadherin repeats (domains 14–27), the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail. Constructs encoding GFP-tagged prestin and V5-tagged prestin were described previously (30Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were monoclonal anti-V5 antibody and monoclonal anti-Myc-HRP-conjugated antibody from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma, rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG and anti-Hsc70 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit polyclonal EHD1, EHD2, EHD3, and EHD4 antibodies were custom-made as described before (25George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A. Parikh P.T. Gao Q. Band V. Band H. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and goat polyclonal EHD4 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Secondary antibodies include goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor 546 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); protein A-HRP (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Otocdh23 DF (CDH23) was inserted into the bait expression vector pTMBV4 (DUALsystems Biotech, Switzerland) with CUB-LexA-VP16 downstream of and in-frame with CDH23. The bait vector carries the LEU2 gene for auxotrophic selection. The sequence of the CDH23-bait vector was confirmed through DNA sequencing. Expression of the CDH23-CUB-LexA-VP16 fusion protein was further verified by Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. Part of EHD4 (1408–1727 bp) was inserted into the prey-expressing vector pDL2-Nx (DUALsystems Biotech) with NubG upstream of and in-frame with EHD4. The prey vector carries the TRP1 gene for auxotrophic selection. pMBV-Alg5 is a negative control bait construct, which expresses the Cub-LexA-VP16 fusion protein in the correct orientation in the yeast membrane. The CDH23-bait construct and the negative control, pMBV-Alg5, were transformed into yeast strain NMY51 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1−901 leu2−3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4- HIS3 ura3::(lexAop)8-lacZ ade2::(lexAop)8-ADE2 GAL4) (DUALsystems Biotech, Switzerland) and grown on leucine selective plates (SD-L), respectively. EHD4 prey constructs were transformed into CDH23-bait-expressing yeast or pMBV-Alg5 expressing yeast and grown on leucine-tryptophan double selective plates (SD-LT). Positive interactions were identified by the ability of yeast to grow on leucine-tryptophan-histidine-alanine selective plates (SD-LTHA) in the presence of 2 mm 3-aminotriazole, and by β-galactosidase expression, indicated by the blue color observed in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). All surgical and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the policies of Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health. The detailed procedures for producing whole mount cochlear samples were described in Judice et al. (31Judice T.N. Nelson N.C. Beisel C.L. Delimont D.C. Fritzsch B. Beisel K.W. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 2002; 9: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult wild type and EHD4-KO mice were cardiac-perfused, first with heparinized saline and then with 4% formaldehyde, followed by at least 48-h postfixation. Cochleae were dissected and decalcified in 10% EDTA for at least 24 h. A 319-bp fragment corresponding to the EHD4 cDNA (nucleotides 1408–1727 bp) was cloned into pGEM-7Z. Antisense and sense mRNAs transcribed from the T7 and SP6 promoters, respectively, were labeled with Dig-UTP using the Dig RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). After purification of RNA probes with ChromaSpin-30 columns (Clontech), the Dig-labeled probe was used to hybridize cochlear tissue. Samples were mounted on glass slides and viewed with a standard microscope. Images were captured with a CCD camera. Plasmids encoding GFP-tagged EHD4 or GFP-tagged EHD4ΔEH were transiently co-transfected with that of CDH23 or prestin in opossum kidney (OK) cells according to the protocols described in Zheng et al. (30Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Approximately 46-h post-transfection, the transiently transfected cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in PBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% saponin for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:1000), anti-V5 (1:1600), or rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (1:200) antibodies in PBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% saponin for 2 h at room temperature. Following brief washing, secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 546 (1:400) and/or goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400) were incubated in PBS with 5% BSA, 0.1% saponin, and 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and observed using a Leica confocal system with a standard configuration DMRXE7 microscope. Details on the generation and characterization of Ehd4-deficient mice are described elsewhere. 3M. George, M. Naramura, M. A. Rainey, G. Ying, L. Doglio, M. H. Vitaterna, S. E. Crawford, V. Band, and H. Band, submitted for publication. In brief, a conditional gene knock-out targeting construct was generated using the “recombineering” method described by Liu et al. (32Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genome. Res. 2003; 13: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). C57BL/6-derived ES cells were used for gene targeting, and the loxP-flanked first exon of Ehd4 was deleted by crossing the mice with B6.FVB-Tg (EIIa-Cre) C5379Lmgd/J mice, which express Cre recombinase in a wide range of tissues including the germ cells. All mice used in this study have been maintained on the C57BL/6J background. Cochlea and lung from either wild type or EHD4-KO mice were collected in CelLytic mammalian tissue lysis/extraction reagent (Sigma) supplemented with a combination of inhibitors (1:100 mixture protease inhibitor (Sigma), 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 units/ml DNase). After homogenization, samples were centrifuged (800 × g for 10 min) to separate the nuclei, unlysed cells, and bone structures. The protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Human lung epithelial cell line HBE135 lysate was used as an additional control. For Western blots, lysates were mixed with 2× LDS Laemmli sample buffer combined with 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of 90 μg of protein lysate were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with 1:2000 dilutions of primary antibodies (anti EHD1, EHD2, EHD3, EHD4, or Hsc70), followed by 1:20,000 dilution of protein A-HRP. Signals were detected using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gross cochlear potentials were acquired at the round window membrane using a silver wire ball electrode in young mice (P33-P60) anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, IP). A traditional ventro-lateral approach was used, and the headholder was heated to prevent cooling of the cochlea. Compound action potential (CAP) thresholds were obtained for a 10 μV N1/P1 criterion voltage (33Cheatham M.A. Huynh K.H. Gao J. Zuo J. Dallos P. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the National Institutes of Health and by Northwestern's Institutional Review Board. For co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins, HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-CDH23 and either with Myc-EHD4 or Myc-EHD4ΔEH using ProFection Mammalian Transfection System-Calcium Phosphate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Approximately 42-h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitor (1:100) and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed either in cold lysis buffer plus 1 mm EDTA or in cold lysis buffer plus 1 mm CaCl2 to assess calcium sensitivity of the co-immunoprecipitation. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Co-IPs were carried out by rocking 1.5 mg of aliquots of protein lysate, 2 μg of anti-FLAG antibody, and protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. Cell lysate transfected with either Myc-EHD4 or Myc-EHD4ΔEH only was used as a negative control. Beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol. The proteins were resolved on a 10% NEXT gel (AMRESCO, Solon, OH) followed by immunoblotting. Myc-EHD4 was detected with polyclonal goat anti-EHD4 antibody at 1:2000 and Donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP at 1:5000, whereas Myc-EHD4ΔEH was detected by using a monoclonal anti-Myc-HRP-conjugated antibody at 1:2000. CDH23 protein was detected with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody at 1:1000 followed by a Goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP at 1:5000. Signals were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate (Pierce). A membrane-based yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify potential CDH23 partners from an OHC cDNA library (13Zheng J. Anderson C.T. Miller K.K. Cheatham M. Dallos P. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This screening method is a highly sensitive genetic approach, suitable for identifying low abundance protein partners whether they are present in the cytoplasm and/or on the cell membrane (34Stagljar I. Fields S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 559-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By using partial CDH23 as the bait, two independent clones encoding EHD4 were isolated (13Zheng J. Anderson C.T. Miller K.K. Cheatham M. Dallos P. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sequences of these clones mapped to the EH domain of EHD4. The interaction between CDH23-bait and EHD4-prey was further tested using SD-LTHA selective plates to select yeast expression of CDH23 and EHD4, as well as interaction between them. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the yeast co-expressing EHD4-prey and CDH23-bait grew on SD-LTHA-selective plates (Fig. 1B) and turned blue when tested for the activation of the lacZ gene (data not shown). However, yeast expressing control-bait and EHD4-prey showed no growth (Fig. 1A) indicating that EHD4 prey could interact with CDH23 bait but not with control bait. These data suggest that EHD4 is a potential interacting partner of CDH23 in yeast. CDH23 is expressed in hair cells and Reissner's membrane of the cochlea (35Wilson S.M. Householder D.B. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Fritzsch B. Lee E.C. Goss D. Carlson G.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 2001; 74: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Lagziel A. Ahmed Z.M. Schultz J.M. Morell R.J. Belyantseva I.A. Friedman T.B. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To examine cochlear EHD4 mRNA distribution in hair cells, in situ hybridization was performed to detect EHD4 mRNA at the cellular level. When WT mouse cochlear tissue was stained with either antisense or sense EHD4 RNA probes (see “Experimental Procedures”), only the antisense EHD4 RNA probe showed hybridization signals in OHCs and IHCs (brown color in Fig. 2B). The sense probe, which was used as a negative control, produced no signal (Fig. 2A). As expected, no hybridization signal was observed when EHD4-KO mouse cochlear tissue was stained with either the antisense EHD4 RNA probe (Fig. 2D) or the sense EHD4 RNA probe (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that EHD4 mRNA is present in both populations of sensory receptor cells in WT mouse cochleae, where CDH23 is known to be expressed. The co-existence of EHD4/CDH23 mRNA in hair cells is consistent with the possibility that CDH23 and EHD4 proteins could interact in vivo. We further investigated the localization of EHD4 protein in hair cells. However, anti-EHD4 antibodies, both custom-made (25George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A. Parikh P.T. Gao Q. Band V. Band H. BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and purchased (from Abcam), cross-react with other EHD (1Siemens J. Lillo C. Dumont R.A. Reynolds A. Williams D.S. Gillespie P.G.

Hear Res. 1984; 15: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) proteins apparently due to high homology among these proteins. Therefore, it was not feasible to selectively detect EHD4 protein expression in the cochlea. To investigate the co-localization between CDH23 and EHD4 proteins, plasmids containing GFP-EHD4 and GFP-EHD4ΔEH (EHD4 protein without EH domain) were co-transfected with a FLAG-CDH23 plasmid into opossum kidney (OK) cells. Distinct co-localization was observed between GFP-EHD4 and CDH23 (Fig. 3C) near the plasma membrane. CDH23 is a single domain transmembrane protein whereas EHD4 does not contain any transmembrane domain. However, EHD4 has been shown to associate with membranes either through a direct interaction with lipids or with lipid-embedded proteins (37Blume J.J. Halbach A. Behrendt D. Paulsson M. Plomann M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Naslavsky N. Rahajeng J. Chenavas S. Sorgen P.L. Caplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16612-16622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The co-localization of EHD4 with CDH23 in the plasma membrane could reflect a direct or indirect interaction between these proteins. It has been shown previously that EHD proteins localize to membranes of tubules and loss of the EH domain (EHDΔEH) results in their re-localization exclusively in punctuate structures (17Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25George M. Ying G. Rainey M.A. Solomon A.

Traffic. 2008; 9: 995-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we also observed that EHD4ΔEH no longer associated with tubules but localized to large punctate structures (Fig. 3D). We could not find any co-localization between EHD4ΔEH and CDH23 (Fig. 3F), which supports the conclusion that interaction with CDH23 requires the EHD4 EH domain or the EH domain-dependent membrane localization. When prestin, a transmembrane protein (30Zheng J. Long K.B. Shen W. Madison L.D. Dallos P. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (used as a ne"
https://openalex.org/W1996571604,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) join amino acids to their cognate tRNAs to initiate protein synthesis. Class II ARS possess a unique catalytic domain fold, possess active site signature sequences, and are dimers or tetramers. The dimeric class I enzymes, notably TyrRS, exhibit half-of-sites reactivity, but its mechanistic basis is unclear. In class II histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS), amino acid activation occurs at different rates in the two active sites when tRNA is absent, but half-of-sites reactivity has not been observed. To investigate the mechanistic basis of the asymmetry, and explore the relationship between adenylate formation and conformational events in HisRS, a fluorescently labeled version of the enzyme was developed by conjugating 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)coumarin (MDCC) to a cysteine introduced at residue 212, located in the insertion domain. The binding of the substrates histidine, ATP, and 5'-O-[N-(l-histidyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine to MDCC-HisRS produced fluorescence quenches on the order of 6-15%, allowing equilibrium dissociation constants to be measured. The rates of adenylate formation measured by rapid quench and domain closure as measured by stopped-flow fluorescence were similar and asymmetric with respect to the two active sites of the dimer, indicating that conformational change may be rate-limiting for product formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments employing differential labeling of the two monomers in the dimer suggested that rigid body rotation of the insertion domain accompanies adenylate formation. The results support an alternating site model for catalysis in HisRS that may prove to be common to other class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W2051207928,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play multiple roles in vertebrate endocrinology and development. TRs are expressed as a series of distinct receptor isoforms that mediate different biological functions. The TRbeta2 isoform is expressed primarily in the hypothalamus, pituitary, cochlea, and retina, and displays an enhanced response to hormone agonist relative to the other TR isoforms. We report here that the unusual transcriptional properties of TRbeta2 parallel the ability of this isoform to bind p160 coactivators cooperatively through multiple contact surfaces; the more broadly expressed TRbeta1 isoform, in contrast, utilizes a single contact mechanism. Intriguingly, the PAS-B domain in the p160 N terminus plays a previously unanticipated role in permitting TRbeta2 to recruit coactivator at limiting triiodothyronine concentrations. The PAS-B sequences also play an important role in coactivator binding by estrogen receptor-alpha. We propose that the PAS-B domain of the p160 coactivators is an important modulator of coactivator recruitment for a specific subset of nuclear receptors, permitting stronger transcriptional activation at lower hormone concentrations than would otherwise occur, and allowing isoform-specific mRNA splicing to customize the hormone response in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1965799011,"These investigations demonstrate that expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis family member, survivin, is dramatically increased during immortalization of nontransformed human fibroblasts that were transduced with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Expression of survivin in immortalized fibroblasts peaked during G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. However, the upregulation of survivin was dissociated from the rate of proliferation and proportion of G(2)/M cells. Depletion of survivin from immortal fibroblasts increased sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis and resulted in an accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content. Conversely, overexpression of survivin in mortal fibroblasts conferred resistance to apoptosis. In contrast, very low levels of survivin in proliferating parental fibroblasts had no bearing on sensitivity to apoptosis. The upregulation of survivin did not appear to be a direct consequence of hTERT transduction. However, repression of hTERT resulted in the rapid downregulation of survivin in telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts and tumor cell lines, but not in cells immortalized via an Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres mechanism. These results have important therapeutic implications, as telomerase and survivin are both broadly expressed in human cancers. Selection during the immortalization process for cells expressing high levels of survivin may account for the abundance of survivin in diverse tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2074222709,"Background Extracellular translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is known to play a role in human allergic responses. TCTP has been identified outside of macrophages, in activated mononuclear cells, and in biological fluids from allergic patients. Even TCTP devoid of signal sequences, is secreted to extracellular environment by an yet undefined mechanism. This study is aimed at understanding the mechanism of TCTP release and its regulation. A secondary goal is to see if inhibitors of TCTP release can serve as potential anti-allergic asthmatic drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings Using Western blotting assay in HEK293 and U937 cells, we found that TCTP secretion is reduced by omeprazole and pantoprazole, both of which are proton pump inhibitors. We then transfected HEK293 cells with proton pump expression vectors to search for the effects of exogeneously overexpressed H+/K+-ATPase on the TCTP secretion. Based on these in vitro data we checked the in vivo effects of pantoprazole in a murine model of ovalbumin-induced allergy. Omeprazole and pantoprazole reduced TCTP secretion from HEK293 and U937 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion and the secretion of TCTP from HEK293 cells increased when they over-expressed H+/K+-ATPase. In a murine model of ovalbumin-induced allergy, pretreatment with pantoprazole reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, increased goblet cells, and increased TCTP secretion induced by OVA challenge. Conclusion Since Omeprazole and pantoprazole decrease the secretion of TCTP which is associated with the development of allergic reaction, they may have the potential to serve as anti-allergic (asthmatic) drugs."

We now show that Cab45b is also expressed in pancreatic islet β-cells and interacts there with the Sec1-Munc18 protein Munc18b. We employed patch clamp cell capacitance measurements to show that antibodies against Cab45b inhibited depolarization-evoked membrane capacitance increments, suggesting an impact on β-cell granule exocytosis, both the readily releasable granule pool and refilling of this pool. Site-specific mutants in the Cab45b EF-hands were used to dissect the molecular interactions involved in Cab45b function. Mutants in EF-hands 2 and 3 had no detectable effects on interaction of Cab45b with Munc18b and did not affect the depolarization-evoked calcium currents, but remarkably, they facilitated the complex formation of Munc18b with syntaxin-2 and -3. As a result, these two EF-hand mutants inhibited β-cell membrane capacitance increments. This inhibition is mediated via Munc18b because Munc18b silencing with small interfering RNA abolished the effects of these two mutants.

The Munc18 proteins were initially proposed to function as negative regulators of membrane fusion by inhibiting the assembly of trans-SNARE complexes. However, recent studies suggest that the Munc18 proteins regulate the transition of syntaxin from closed to open conformation, thereby facilitating SNARE complex assembly (6Zilly F.E. Sørensen J.B.

Recently, we reported a novel SM-binding protein, a cytosolic splice variant of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein Cab45 (designated Cab45b) expressed in pancreatic acini. Cab45b binds to Munc18b in complex with syntaxin-2 (Syn-2) and -3 (Syn-3) and directly influences amylase release from acini (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S.

In this study, we demonstrate that Cab45b is expressed in the neuroendocrine pancreatic islet β-cells and is associated with Munc18b-Syn-2 and Munc18b-Syn-3 complexes. Using cell membrane capacitance measurement, a well established technique for monitoring exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells (18Rorsman P. Renström E.

The constructs pGEX1λT-Cab45b-WT, -mEF1 (mutant EF-hand 1, E25Q), -mEF2 (E70Q), and -mEF3 (E106Q) were generated as we reported previously (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–350 g and separated by density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (20Kwan E.P. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2734-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Animal procedures were performed in accordance with the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee ethical guidelines. To obtain single islet cells, the intact rat islets were dispersed in dispase II solution (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 5 min, and the single cells were placed on glass coverslips. The dispersed islet cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 24–72 h before experiments. Dispersed single islet cells were costained for Cab45b and either insulin or glucagon, and some islet cells were costained for insulin and Munc18b. Briefly, cells were placed on glass coverslips, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The cells were then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, washed, and then treated with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C. After the wash, the cells were incubated with two of the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Cab45b (1:100; prepared in the Olkkonen laboratory), guinea pig anti-insulin (1:200; Sigma), mouse anti-glucagon (1:200; Sigma), and rabbit anti-Munc18b (1:100; prepared in the Olkkonen laboratory) for 1 h at the indicated dilution, followed by the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antiserum (1 h at 25 °C). The specimens were mounted in glycerol and examined using an LSM510 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells were patch-clamped in conventional whole-cell configuration at 33–34 °C. Islet β-cells were identified by cell size (>4 pF) and by their Na+ current inactivation properties as described previously (21Göpel S. Kanno T. Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software from HEKA Electronik (Lambrecht, Germany) as we have described (22Kwan E.P. Xie L. Sheu L. Ohtsuka T. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes had typical resistances of 3–6 megaohms when fire-polished and filled with an intracellular solution containing 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm cAMP, and 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.3, with CsOH. The indicated antibodies or recombinant fusion proteins were added to the intracellular solution before experiments. After whole-cell configuration was established, the intracellular solution was dialyzed into the cell via patch pipette for 1 min, and then the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) or Ca2+ currents were measured. Extracellular solutions for capacitance measurements contained 118 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. In the recordings of depolarization-evoked Ca2+ currents, the following extracellular solution was used: 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 20 mm BaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 4 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Here, we employed Ba2+ to replace Ca2+ as the charge carrier to amplify Ca2+ current responses during the depolarization stimulus. Rat islets were lysed by sonication in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. For binding assay, the detergent extract (0.5 ml, 2.0 μg/μl protein) of rat islets was incubated with GST (as a negative control), GST-Cab45b-WT, -mEF1, -mEF2, or -mEF3 (bound to glutathione-agarose, 400 pmol of protein each) at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were then washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KoAc, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100), separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The precipitated and separated proteins were identified with specific antibodies, including mouse anti-Munc18a (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-Munc18b (1:500) (13Riento K.

Tamori, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan), mouse monoclonal anti-Syn-1A (1:1000; Sigma), rabbit anti-Syn-2 and -Syn-3 (affinity-purified) and anti-Syn-4 (1:1000; Synaptic System, Goettingen, Germany), or mouse soluble SNAP-25 (1:1000; Sternberger Monoclonals, Baltimore, MD). To examine whether Cab45b-mEF3 is able to bind directly to Munc18b but not Syn-3, HEK293 cells were infected with Ad-Munc18b, and BHK-21 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Syn-3. GST-Cab45b-mEF1 (as negative control) and -mEF3 (400 or 800 pmol of protein) were used to precipitate Munc18b and Syn-3 from Munc18b- and Syn-3-expressing cell lysate extracts (650 μg of protein), respectively. siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequences of siRNA against Munc18b are as follows: sense, 5′-GCC CUG AUU GCG GAC UUC CAG GGA A-3′; and antisense, 5′-UUC CCU GGA AGU CCG CAA UCA GGG C-3′. For the negative control, scrambled siRNA (sense, 5′-CGG UUU GGG UGU GCA GUA CAA ACA G-3′; and antisense, 5′-CUG UUU GUA CUG CAC ACC CAA ACC G-3′) was used. INS-1E cells (gift from C. Wollheim) were used for siRNA (25 nm) transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). A transfection efficiency of 85–90% was observed at 48 h, and then the cells were patch-clamped for capacitance measurements. All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test, and significance was assumed at p < 0.05 by using the software SigmaPlot (SigmaPlot 2001, SPSS Science). Patch clamp data were analyzed with IGOR Pro 3.12 software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The integrated Ca2+ currents during the depolarizations were determined by the software PULSEFIT (HEKA Electronik). Cab45 is a 42-kDa EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein that localizes to the Golgi lumen (23Koivu T. Laitinen S. Riento K. Olkkonen V.M. DNA Seq. 1997; 7: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Scherer P.E. Lederkremer G.Z. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The recently discovered short splice variant Cab45b (15 kDa) consists of 130 amino acid residues and three EF-hand motifs (Fig. 1) (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of rat islet cells using an affinity-purified anti-Cab45b antibody revealed strong staining of the β-cells identified by costaining for insulin (Fig. 2Ai). The Cab45b fluorescence showed in part an even, cytosolic-appearing distribution, but more intense fluorescence was observed in the peripheral region in proximity of the plasma membrane, where also most of the insulin-positive granules are localized (Fig. 2Aii). In this region, the Cab45b and insulin signals colocalized substantially. In the β-cells, Munc18b displayed a prominent insulin granule localization (Fig. 2B), consistent with the notion that it may recruit part of the Cab45b on granule membranes. Cab45b was also detected in the islet α-cells identified by staining for glucagon (Fig. 2C). In these cells, Cab45b was distributed between a cytosolic-appearing pattern and localization on the surface of glucagon granules.FIGURE 2Cab45b is present in rat pancreatic islet cells.

Experiments were conducted in the presence of nonimmune rabbit IgG (100 μg/ml) as a negative control or affinity-purified antibodies against Cab45b (100 μg/ml). We observed that the depolarization-evoked capacitance change (ΔCm) was severely reduced in cells treated with anti-Cab45b compared with the IgG control (Fig. 3A). The total membrane ΔCm in IgG-treated control cells was 91 ± 15 fF/pF (Fig. 3, B and C) in response to a train of 10 depolarizations (pulse1–10). Under the same conditions, cells treated with anti-Cab45b demonstrated markedly weaker capacitance responses (36 ± 9 fF/pF, p < 0.01 versus control) (Fig. 3, B and C, pulse1–10). These data suggest that Cab45b plays an important role in regulating β-cell exocytosis. The ΔCm elicited by the first two depolarizations is thought to approximate the capacity of the readily releasable granule pool (RRP), whereas ΔCm evoked by the subsequent depolarizations estimates the refilling of the RRP by mobilization of new granules from the reserve pool (18Rorsman P. Renström E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 19Gillis K.D. Mossner R. Neher E.

Physiol. 1999; 518: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the capacitance changes in this study revealed that the ΔCm elicited by the first two depolarizations (pulse1–2) in the cells treated with anti-Cab45b was 14 ± 4 fF/pF, markedly smaller than that in control cells (38 ± 10 fF/pF; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). A similar trend in the ΔCm elicited by the last eight depolarizations (pulse3–10) was observed (53 ± 10 fF/pF for control versus 22 ± 6 fF/pF for Cab45b; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Cab45b may regulate both the β-cell RRP size and the refilling process of the RRP. To identify structural determinants in Cab45b that might impact granule exocytosis in rat islet β-cells, we examined in patch clamp experiments the actions of full-length WT Cab45b and point mutations that inactivate each of the EF-hand domains, EF-hands 1 (E25Q, denoted mEF1), 2 (E70Q, denoted mEF2), and 3 (E106Q, denoted mEF3). We first examined the ability of each of these Cab45b proteins to associate with Munc18 and islet SNARE proteins. GST (as negative control) and GST-Cab45b-WT, -mEF1, -mEF2, and -mEF3 were used to pull down the proteins of interest in rat islet lysates, and the proteins associated with Cab45b were identified with specific antibodies. Cab45b-WT, -mEF1, -mEF2, and -mEF3 proteins were equally capable of pulling down Munc18b (Fig. 4Ai), indicating that the inactivating mutations within the EF domains did not block Cab45b binding to Munc18b. The Cab45b proteins did not pull down Munc18a or Munc18c (data not shown), supporting the view that Cab45b interacts specifically with the Munc18b isoform (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syn-4, which would have bound Munc18c (26Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was likewise not coprecipitated. We then examined the syntaxins coprecipitated with the Munc18b-Cab45b complex. Cab45b-WT, -mEF1, -mEF2, and -mEF3 proteins were equally capable of pulling down Syn-1A (Fig. 4Ai) in pancreatic β-cells, indicating that the inactivating mutations within the EF domains did not interfere with the interaction of Syn-1A with Munc18b. Munc18b had previously been shown also to bind Syn-1A (27Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, Munc18b in complex with GST-Cab45b-mEF2 or -mEF3, but not GST-Cab45b-WT or -mEF1, pulled down Syn-2 and Syn-3, but not Syn-4 (Fig. 4Ai). The results suggest that Cab45b regulates the association of Munc18b with Syn-2 and Syn-3, thus controlling the participation of these syntaxins in SNARE complex assembly required for exocytosis. Of note, Cab45b-mEF3 in association with Munc18b formed a particularly abundant complex with Syn-3 and, to a lesser extent, also with Syn-2. In accordance with our previous observations (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GST-Cab45b-mEF3 failed to pull down Syn-3 overexpressed in BHK-21 cells (Fig. 4B), a cell line that does not express Munc18b, but would pull down Munc18b overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Thus, there is no direct interaction between Cab45b and syntaxins. Therefore, these results suggest that Cab45b, particularly its EF3 domain, has a distinct function in regulating the interaction of Munc18b with Syn-2 and Syn-3. Distortion of the EF-hands 2 and 3 apparently facilitates the complex formation of the SM protein with Syn-2 and Syn-3 and could consequently influence SNARE complex assembly. Indeed, SNAP-25 was not pulled down by these GST-Cab45b complexes (data not shown), indicating that Syn-2 and Syn-3 bound to the Munc18b-Cab45b complexes are unable to form complexes with cognate SNARE partners such as SNAP-25. To examine whether these Cab45b structural requirements for binding Munc18b-syntaxin complexes are of functional significance, we performed capacitance measurements on rat islet β-cells dialyzed with each of the Cab45b-WT and -mEF proteins. Remarkably, the Cab45b-mEF2 and -mEF3 fusion proteins resulted in suppression of total ΔCm (pulse1–10) in β-cells (p < 0.01 versus GST control). Further analysis of the ΔCm induced by the first two (pulse1–2) or last eight (pulse3–10) depolarizations revealed that both mEF2 and mEF3 profoundly inhibited the size of RRP and the refilling process of RRP, respectively (Fig. 5). In contrast, neither mEF1 nor Cab45b-WT caused any change of ΔCm compared with the GST control (Fig. 5), indicating that a cellular excess of functionally normal Cab45b does not interfere with granule exocytosis. To confirm that Cab45b through its EF domains regulated exocytosis specifically by its actions on Munc18b, siRNA against Munc18b was employed on INS-1E cells to knock down the expression of endogenous Munc18b, and capacitance measurements were performed 48–72 h after transfection. The results showed that Munc18b siRNA greatly suppressed the endogenous level of Munc18b (Fig. 6A) and decreased the total ΔCm compared with a scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 6, B and C). Of note, in the cells transfected with Munc18b siRNA, no differences were observed in total ΔCm among groups treated with GST, Cab45b-WT, and Cab45b-mEF proteins (Fig. 6, B and C). These results indicate that genetic suppression of Munc18b abolishes the effects of Cab45b-mEF2 and -mEF3 on the capacitance changes, a surrogate marker for exocytosis. These results support our in vitro binding data and suggest that association with Munc18b is required for the interference of exocytosis by Cab45b-mEF2 and -mEF3. Because ΔCm is triggered by depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx, we determined whether the Cab45b-WT or -mEF proteins might influence Ca2+ currents during the depolarization stimulus. As shown in Fig. 7, there were no significant differences in the integrated Ca2+ currents among groups treated with GST, Cab45b-WT, or Cab45b-mEF, indicating that the effects of Cab45b-mEF2 and -mEF3 on membrane capacitance changes were not caused by a change of Ca2+ influx but by the exocytotic machinery per se. The present immunofluorescence analysis identified Cab45b in rat pancreatic islets, in both β- and α-cells. In β-cells, Cab45b, which is intrinsically cytosolic, was found concentrating in regions where the insulin granules are located. Furthermore, Munc18b was found prominently localized on the insulin granules. We have in this and a previous study (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shown by GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation that Cab45b and Munc18b are physically associated in same protein complexes. Moreover, our findings using the yeast two-hybrid system (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest a direct interaction of the two proteins. We therefore find it likely that Munc18b may interact with Cab45b on the surface of insulin granules. In this way, Cab45b is in a position to regulate the association of Munc18b with its cognate SNARE partners instrumental in membrane fusion in β-cells. The present data suggest that the actions of Cab45b profoundly influence the kinetics of insulin granule mobilization, priming, and release in pancreatic islet β-cells. Cab45b is capable of binding Munc18b but does not directly interact with syntaxins. Our results suggest that Cab45b regulates the association of Munc18b with Syn-2 and Syn-3, thus controlling the participation of these syntaxins in SNARE complex assembly required for exocytosis, which we measured using ΔCm as a surrogate marker. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Cab45b-mEF proteins inhibited capacitance increments but had no detectable effect on Ca2+ currents during depolarization stimulus. We were able to pull down Syn-2 and Syn-3 only with the Cab45b-mEF2 and -mEF3 proteins and not with Cab45b-WT, suggesting that Munc18b complexes with syntaxins are of low abundance or unstable under steady-state conditions in the rat pancreatic islet, and the EF2 and -3 mutants most likely have a dominant interfering activity, possibly by causing sequestration of syntaxins in abnormally stable complexes with Munc18b. However, Munc18b-Cab45b-syntaxin complexes were readily coimmunoprecipitated from pancreatic acini (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most likely reflecting a higher abundance or stability of such complexes in the acinar cells. In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, research on exocytosis has focused mainly on the actions of Munc18a and Syn-1A (3Gallwitz D. Jahn R. Trends Biochem.

Cab45b or similar Cab45 variants present in neuroendocrine cells could facilitate the conversion of closed conformation Syn-2 and Syn-3 complexed with Munc18b to the open conformation capable of SNARE complex assembly required to influence their exocytotic functions. The secretory actions of Munc18b and its syntaxin partners may thus be enabled by Cab45b in both non-neuronal secretory (pancreatic acini (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L.

The role of Ca2+ binding by Cab45b is thus far unclear. It is obvious from previous work that Ca2+ is not required for the Munc18b-Cab45b interaction (12Lam P.P. Hyvärinen K. Kauppi M. Cosen-Binker L. Laitinen S. Keränen S. Gaisano H.Y. Olkkonen V.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, even though the present study shows that mutating Cab45b EF-hands 2 and 3, which are important for calcium binding, does not inhibit the Munc18b-Cab45b interaction, it demonstrates the functional importance of the Ca2+-binding EF-hands 2 and 3. We find it likely that these structural motifs, the conformation of which is putatively affected by bound Ca2+ ions, play a distinct role in controlling the interaction of Munc18b with syntaxins. This hypothesis will be addressed in detail in future studies. We thank Pirjo Ranta for skilled technical assistance."

The C-terminal 16 amino residues of GL comprise a high affinity binding site for GP that regulates bound PP1 activity against GS. In this study, a truncated GL construct lacking the GP-binding site (GLtr) and a chimeric PTG molecule containing the C-terminal site (PTG-GL) were generated. As expected, GP binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GLtr was reduced, whereas GP binding to GST-PTG-GL was increased 2- to 3-fold versus GST-PTG. In contrast, PP1 binding to all proteins was equivalent. Primary mouse hepatocytes were infected with adenoviral constructs for each subunit, and their effects on glycogen metabolism were investigated. GLtr expression was more effective at promoting GP inactivation, GS activation, and glycogen accumulation than GL. Removal of the regulatory GP-binding site from GLtr completely blocked the inactivation of GS seen in GL-expressing cells following a drop in extracellular glucose. As a result, GLtr expression prevented glycogen mobilization under 5 mm glucose conditions. In contrast, equivalent overexpression of PTG or PTG-GL caused a similar increase in glycogen-targeted PP1 levels and GS dephosphorylation. Surprisingly, GP dephosphorylation was significantly reduced in PTG-GL-overexpressing cells. As a result, PTG-GL expression permitted glycogenolysis under 5 mm glucose conditions that was prevented in PTG-expressing cells. Thus, expression of constructs that contained the high affinity GP-binding site (GL and PTG-GL) displayed reduced glycogen accumulation and enhanced glycogenolysis compared with their respective controls, albeit via different mechanisms.

Hepatic glycogen metabolism plays a central role in the maintenance of circulating plasma glucose levels under various physiological conditions.

GS is phosphorylated on up to 9 residues by a variety of kinases, although site 2 appears to be the most important regulator of hepatic GS (1.Ros S. García-Rocha M. Domínguez J. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6370-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, GP is phosphorylated on a single N-terminal serine residue by phosphorylase kinase, which increases GP activity and its sensitivity to allosteric activators. Both GS and GP are in turn also regulated by protein phosphatases, most notably PP1. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, a family of five molecules has been reported that targets the enzyme to glycogen particles (2.Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differential properties of PTG and GL have not been completely defined. Both PTG and GL directly bind to specific PP1 substrates involved in glycogen metabolism, albeit for different physiological reasons. The extreme C-terminal 16 amino acids of GL comprises a unique, high affinity binding site for phosphorylated GP (GPa (17.Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)), which has been further delineated to two critical tyrosine residues (18.Kelsall I.R. Munro S. Hallyburton I. Treadway J.L.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In turn, GPa binding to the GL-PP1 complex potently inhibits phosphatase activity against GS in vitro (3.Doherty M.J.

PTG contains a single substrate-binding site that interacts with GS and GP (5.Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R.

In contrast to the regulatory role of the GPa binding to GL, interaction of substrates with PTG increases PP1 activity against these proteins (24.Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, disruption of the substrate-binding site by point mutagenesis abrogated the ability of mutant PTG expression to increase cellular glycogen levels (23.Fong N.M. Jensen T.C. Shah A.S.

Previous work has comprehensively compared the metabolic impact of PTG versus GL overexpression in hepatocytes and thus was not the goal of this study (9.Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J.

Instead, two novel PP1 targeting constructs were generated in which the high affinity GPa-binding site was removed from GL or added to the C terminus of PTG. The effects of expressing wild-type and mutant constructs on GS and GP activities and on the regulation of glycogen metabolism by extracellular glucose were investigated using primary mouse hepatocytes. The PP1 glycogen-targeting subunit GL was cloned from a rat liver cDNA library using the primers sense, ATGGCCGTGGACATA, and antisense, GTAATAGGGCCCCAG. The GL-truncated construct (lacking 16 amino acids from the C terminus) was cloned using the GL sense primer and antisense primer: AAACAGGCCGAAGGA. The PTG-GL chimera was cloned from a PTG DNA template using sense (first 15 bp of PTG), ATGGCCATGAGGATT, and antisense (last 48 bp of GL followed by last 15 bp of PTG), GTAATAGGGCCCCAGCTTTTCATACCCCAGATAACTAGGCCACTCTGGTCGATAGGAGGTCAA. Constructs were then cloned into pGEX-KG or Adeno-X (Clontech) as reported previously (24.Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Following sacrifice, the abdomen was excised longitudinally up to the ribcage. The inferior vena cava was cannulated with a 23-gauge needle and perfused with 30 ml of Buffer A (Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mm EGTA) at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Concomitantly, the portal vein was cut to allow for drainage of the perfusate. Next, the liver was perfused with 30 ml of Buffer B (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) plus 100 units/ml of type IV collagenase (Sigma)) using a 6 ml/min flow rate. The liver was removed and placed into cold DMEM containing 10% FBS (Biowest, Miami, FL) and brushed to loosen cells. The cellular suspension was filtered through 70 μm cell strainers (Falcon) and spun 2 times at 50 × g, 2 min, 4 °C. The hepatocytes were resuspended in fresh medium, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion staining. Hepatocytes were plated to near confluence onto multiwell dishes coated with rat tail collagen (Sigma), allowed to settle in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator, and after 2 h, the media was replaced with DMEM with 10% FBS. 2 h after isolation and plating, hepatocytes were incubated with ∼1–5 × 103 particles/cell of the indicated adenoviral constructs in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose plus 10% FBS and incubated overnight. In some experiments, media was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS containing either 5 or 25 mm glucose and incubated for 2–3 h. Cells were rinsed with 4 °C 5 or 25 rinse buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Ca2+ free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), 5 or 25 mm glucose) for assays involving parallel 5 and 25 mm glucose incubations, or otherwise 4 °C PBS, and collected in homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors). Samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants used for analysis. For cellular fractionation experiments, lysates were spun at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet glycogen. The cytosolic supernatant fractions were removed, and glycogen-enriched pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer using half the volume of the cytosol. Lysates were analyzed as described (16.Greenberg C.C. Danos A.M. Brady M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Quantitative immunoblot analysis was carried using ImageJ software. Absolute phospho-protein levels were divided by total protein levels, and results were normalized within a single immunoblot, for comparison with immunoblots from other independent trials. Following isolation and infection with adenovirus, mouse hepatocytes plated on 6-well dishes were allowed to recover 16 h. Incorporation of d-[14C]glucose (317 mCi/mmol, ICN Biochemicals) into glycogen was measured as described (25.Greenberg C.C. Meredith K.N. Yan L. Brady M.J. J. Biol.

The cells were then incubated for 2 h in DMEM with 25 mm glucose, 10% FBS, and 1 μCi/well d-[14C]glucose. Radiolabeled media was removed, and the cells were rinsed in PBS. Half of the wells are frozen at −80 °C, and replicate wells were recovered overnight in DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and 0.5% FBS. The next day, all of the wells are scraped in 30% KOH and radioactivity incorporated into glycogen was determined as above. Total cellular glycogen levels were measured as described (25.Greenberg C.C. Meredith K.N. Yan L. Brady M.J. J. Biol.

Assays were performed in replicate in the absence and presence of 3 mm AMP. Samples were incubated 30 °C for 30 min and then spotted onto 24-mm GF/A filters (Whatman) and washed in ice-cold 70% ETOH with 1% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, and then washed three times with room temperature ETOH for 20 min.

Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that glycogen was omitted from all buffers. Rabbit skeletal muscle GPa and GPb (Sigma) were dissolved at 0.2 mg/ml in PBS. Immobilized GST-GL bound to beads was added to 500 μl of GPa or GPb in triplicate and nutated at 4 °C for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with 500 μl of PBS, and protein binding was determined by anti-total GP immunoblotting. Data comparisons were analyzed by Student's t test. Analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel XP and was considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Previous work had located the high affinity GPa-binding site in the extreme C terminus of GL (17.Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18.Kelsall I.R. Munro S. Hallyburton I. Treadway J.L. Cohen P.T.

However, the effects of removing the GPa-binding site on GL function upon overexpression have not been explored. Additionally, it was not clear whether addition of this high affinity GPa-binding site to other glycogen-targeting subunits would regulate bound PP1 activity. To address these issues, two novel PP1-glycogen targeting subunits were generated by PCR (Fig. 1): 1) a GL construct lacking the high affinity GPa-binding site (GLtr); 2) a full-length PTG construct onto which the last 16 amino acids of GL were added to the C terminus of PTG (PTG-GL). These mutant and corresponding wild-type constructs were expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins and as FLAG-tagged proteins in primary hepatocytes. In the first set of experiments, recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with hepatic lysate, washed extensively, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The removal of the GL tail had no effect on PP1 binding to GST-GL versus GST-GLtr (Fig. 2A), whereas deletion of the last 16 amino acid residues greatly reduced binding of GPa to GLtr (Fig. 2B). The ability of phospho- and dephospho-GP (GPa and GPb, respectively) to bind to recombinant full-length GL was compared in vitro. Interestingly, GPa exhibited preferential binding to GL (Fig. 2C), supporting a physiological role for GPa-GL interaction in vivo. Although the differential interaction of GPa versus GPb with GL has been inferred (20.Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), to our knowledge this is the first direct assessment of the phosphorylation-dependent binding of GP to purified GL. Next, primary murine hepatocytes were infected with GL or GLtr adenoviral constructs. In parallel, replicate wells were subjected to identical conditions but not exposed to adenovirus (mock infected). After an overnight incubation in media containing 25 mm glucose, half the cells were incubated for 2 h in 5 mm glucose. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting and enzyme activity assays. Equivalent expression of GL and GLtr was achieved under conditions used, whereas the loss of the last 16 amino acids caused GLtr to run at a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Total GP levels (Fig. 3A, middle panel) were identical between mock and adenoviral infected cells, which served as a protein loading control. In agreement with previous work (9.Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), GL overexpression in decreased GPa levels measured by phospho-specific immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, top panel). These results were confirmed by in vitro GP activity assays (Fig. 3C), although the changes were greater in the less sensitive immunoblotting experiments. Lysates were passed over desalting columns prior to enzymatic assays to remove contaminating allosteric regulators of GP, but this partial discrepancy remained. Interestingly, GLtr expression caused a further decrease in GPa dephosphorylation compared with GL-expressing cells, as measured by both immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, top panel) and activity assays (Fig. 3C), which was significant at 5 mm glucose and approached significance at 25 mm glucose. Under all three conditions, decreasing extracellular glucose from 25 to 5 mm caused a significant increase in GP activity (Fig. 3C), and to a lesser extent, increased phospho-GP levels in GL- and GLtr-expressing cells, (Fig. 3A). In mock infected cells, results were more variable but no significant change in GPa levels were observed when multiple experiments were analyzed and averaged (Fig. 3B). The decreased GPa levels upon GLtr versus GL expression suggested differential regulation of bound PP1 activity. Cellular lysates were prepared, and PP1 activity was measured in vitro against purified 32P-labeled GPa. Surprisingly, no significant difference in PP1 activity against GPa could be detected in lysates from GL-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D), despite the significant reduction in GPa levels in intact hepatocytes (Fig. 3A). These apparently conflicting results suggest potential allosteric regulation of the GL-PP1 complex that is lost upon cell lysis. In contrast, expression of GLtr increased in vitro PP1 activity (Fig. 3D), indicating removal of the C-terminal tail relieved autoinhibition of bound PP1. Previous work has demonstrated that GPa binding to GL inhibits bound PP1 activity against GS (3.Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 37.Kelsall I.R. Rosenzweig D. Cohen P.T. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further, elevation of extracellular glucose promoted glycogen synthesis by relieving PP1 inhibition by GPa, thus promoting GS activation. To further explore this model, GL or GLtr was expressed in primary hepatocytes, and cells were treated as above. Lysates were prepared, and GS activity and protein levels were determined. Both GL and GLtr expression increased GS activity ratio (Fig. 4A). In these experiments, immunoblots were probed with an anti-GL instead of anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B), and the lower band observed is likely an N-terminal degradation product, because it was not observed in FLAG immunoblots (Fig. 3A). These constructs also caused a large but variable increase in total GS protein levels (Fig. 4B), likely due to stabilization of GS expression by augmented glycogen stores, because no change in GS mRNA levels was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Two important differences were delineated in the regulation of GS activity by these constructs. First, under high glucose conditions, equivalent expression of GLtr caused a higher degree of GS activation as compared with GL overexpression (Fig. 4A). Second, lowering of extracellular glucose from 25 to 5 mm had no effect on GS activity in GLtr-expressing cells, but led to a substantial reduction in enzyme activity in GL-expressing hepatocytes. In mock treated cells, 5 mm glucose incubation had no discernable effect on the much lower GS activity in comparison to 25 mm (data not shown). Both results support the notion that loss of GPa-binding site on GLtr increases bound PP1-activity against GS, especially under lower glucose conditions. To investigate this possibility, phospho-specific immunoblotting was performed with an antibody against site 3a of hepatic GS. Lower titers of adenovirus were used in these experiments to preclude the confounding effects of elevation of total GS on detection of phospho-GS levels. Phospho-GS was readily detectable in mock infected cells, with a variable, faster migrating breakdown product. Interestingly, in GL-expressing cells, reduction of extracellular glucose to 5 mm caused a significant increase in phospho-GS levels (Fig. 4, D and E), paralleling changes detected in the GS activity assays (Fig. 4C). To determine the metabolic consequences of altered enzymatic activities upon GL versus GLtr expression, glycogen metabolism was examined. After infection and recovery, cellular glycogen stores were labeled with [14C]glucose. Cells were then washed with PBS, and half the wells were harvested to determine glycogen synthetic rates (Fig. 5A, day 1). The remaining cells were incubated overnight in 5 mm media to determine loss of 14C label from glycogen (Fig. 5A, day 2). Removal of the regulatory tail from GLtr caused a doubling in [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen versus GL-expressing cells (Fig. 5A), likely d"

Nevertheless, retrieving only the sequences of interest from public databases can be difficult, in particular, when working with highly divergent sequences. The difficulty increases substantially when one wants to include in the study sequences from many (or less well studied) species whose genomes are non-annotated or incompletely annotated. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work we evaluate the usefulness of different approaches of gene retrieval and classification, using the distal-less (DLX) gene family as a test case. Furthermore, we evaluate whether the use of a large number of gene sequences from a wide range of animal species, the use of multiple alternative alignments, and the use of amino acids aligned with high confidence only, is enough to recover the accepted DLX evolutionary history. Conclusions/Significance The canonical DLX homeobox gene sequence here derived, together with the characteristic amino acid variants here identified in the DLX homeodomain region, can be used to retrieve and classify DLX genes in a simple and efficient way. A program is made available that allows the easy retrieval of synteny information that can be used to classify gene sequences. Maximum likelihood trees using hundreds of sequences can be used for gene identification. Nevertheless, for the DLX case, the proposed DLX evolutionary is not recovered even when multiple alignment algorithms are used."
