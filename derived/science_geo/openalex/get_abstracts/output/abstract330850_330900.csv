https://openalex.org/W2066270387,"The marine tube-building polychaete, Owenia fusiformis, selects sand grains of tablet form for its tube. It can concentrate the mineral hornblende at least 25-fold and these concentrations may persist after the death of the worm. Owenia and a small anemone, Zaolutus actius, can act together to stabilize the sand surface against movement by wave surge. The result is the formation of an area of stabilized substrate, with which characteristic animals and plants are associated, in the midst of a region of shifting granular substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2030693351,"Jupiter's magnetic field and its interaction with the magnetized solar wind were observed with the Pioneer 10 vector helium magnetometer. The magnetic dipole is directed opposite to that of the earth with a moment of 4.0 gauss R(J)(3) (R(J), Jupiter radius), and an inclination of 15 degrees lying in a system III meridian of 230 degrees . The dipole is offset about 0.1 R(J) north of the equatorial plane and about 0.2 R(J) toward longitude 170 degrees . There is severe stretching of the planetary field parallel to the equator throughout the outer magnetosphere, accompanied by a systematic departure from meridian planes. The field configuration implies substantial plasma effects inside the magnetosphere, such as thermal pressure, centrifugal forces, and differential rotation. As at the earth, the outer boundary is thin, nor diffuse, and there is a detached bow shock."

https://openalex.org/W1968317582,"Fluxes of high energy electrons and protons are found to be highly concentrated near the magnetic equatorial plane from distances of ∼ 30 to ∼ 100 Jovian radii (RJ). The 10-hour period of planetary rotation is observed as an intensity variation, which indicates that the equatorial zone of high particle fluxes is inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the planet. At radial distances ≲ 20 RJ the synchrotron-radiation-producing electrons with energies ≳ 3 million electron volts rise steeply to a maximum intensity of ∼ 5 × 108 electrons per square centimeter per second near the periapsis at 2.8 RJ. The flux of protons with energies ≳ 30 million electron volts reaches a maximum intensity of ∼ 4 × 106 protons per square centimeter per second at ∼ 3.5 RJ with the intensity decreasing inside this radial distance. Only for radial distances ≲ 20 RJ does the radiation behave in a manner which is similar to that at the earth. Burst of electrons with energies up to 30 million electron volts, each lasting about 2 days, were observed in interplanetary space beginning approximately 1 month before encounter. This radiation appears to have escaped from the Jovian bow shock or magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2046376191,"The density of tracks from spontaneously fissioning uranium atoms in mica has been used to make quantitative measurements of geologic ages. In comparison with methods in which ages are derived from measurements of radioactive decay products, the fission track method is much simpler and is usually accurate for micas up to a few hundred million years old. Annealing experiments suggest that high ambient temperatures are responsible for track fading in the older samples."
https://openalex.org/W1976316970,"Observations of energetic electrons (≳ 0.07 million electron volts) show that the outer magnetosphere of Jupiter consists of a thin disklike, quasitrapping region extending from about 20 to 100 planetary radii (RJ). This magnetodisk is confined to the vicinity of the magnetic equatorial plane and appears to be an approximate figure of revolution about the magnetic axis of the planet. Hard trapping is observed within a radial distance of about 20 RJ. The omnidirectional intensity J0 of electrons with energy ≳ 21 million electron volts within the region 3 < r < 20 RJ is given by the following provisional expression in terms of radial distance r and magnetic latitude θ: J0 = 2.1 × 108 exp[-(r/a) - (θ/b)2]. In this expression J0 is particles per square centimeter per second; a = 1.52 RJ for 3 ≤ r ≤ 20 RJ; and b = 15° for 3 ≤ r ≤ 10 RJ, diminishing gradually for larger r. There is tentative evidence for mild effects of the Galilean satellite Europa and possibly Io and Ganymede but not Callisto."

https://openalex.org/W2029429602,"Preliminary results from the Ames Research Center plasma analyzer experiment for the Pioneer 10 Jupiter encounter indicate that Jupiter has a detached bow shock and magnetopause similar to the case at Earth but much larger in spatial extent. In contrast to Earth, Jupiter's outer magnetosphere appears to be highly inflated by thermal plasma and therefore highly responsive in size to changes in solar wind dynamic pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2083597709,"Thermal maps of Jupiter at 20 and 40 micrometers show structure closely related to the visual appearance of the planet. Peak brightness temperatures of 126 degrees and 145 degrees K have been measured on the South Equatorial Belt, for the 20- and 40-micrometer channels, respectively. Corresponding values for the South Tropical Zone are 120 degrees and 138 degrees K. No asymmetries between the illuminated sunlit and nonilluminated parts of the disk were found. A preliminary discussion of the data, in terms of simple radiative equilibrium models, is presented. The net thermal energy of the planet as a whole is twice the solar energy input."

Graphs illustrate electron and proton flux levels as a function of distance from the planet for different particle energy intervals. Times of predicted equatorial crossing are marked along with positions corresponding to the bowshock, magnetopause, and other features. The general patterns of particle distribution in the Jovian vicinity are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2032503503,"Pioneer 10 counted relativistic electrons throughout the magnetosphere of Jupiter, with the greatest fluxes being inside 20 Jupiter radii. The peak flux of electrons with energy greater than 50 million electron volts was 1.3 × 107 per square centimeter per second at the innermost penetration of the radiation belts."
https://openalex.org/W1965324531,"Gametophytes of the fern Anemia phyllitidis respond to seven different gibberellins (A(1), A(3); A(4), A(5), A(7), A(8), and A(9)) by forming antheridia. Gibberellin A(7) is active at concentrations as low as 5 X 10(-10) g/ ml. Species from two of the three other genera in the family Schizaeaceae respond similarly to gibberellin A(3). In contrast, nearly 40 species from 7 other families of ferns do not develop antheridia when supplied with gibberellin."

This current is similar in many respects to the undercurrent in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The undercurrent in the Indian Ocean is located in the thermocline and is of low magnitude, unsteady, and more strongly developed on the eastern side of the ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2023942984,"Data on the Jovian atmosphere and radiation environment transmitted by Pioneer 10 as it passed by Jupiter are discussed. The presence of a strong magnetic field, of energetic electron precursers, and of flat disk-shaped particle distribution is noted at a distance of 360 Jovian radii from the planet. Previously available data on Jovian satellites are augmented from Pioneer 10 data. The normal operation of the data collecting and transmitting systems of the mission after encounter with Jupiter is noted."

https://openalex.org/W2056844162,"In trees labeled with cesium-137, the isotope in the sap streams is primarily in the free ionic form. Much ionic Cs(137) also appears to occur in intracellular fluids other than the sap streams. However, a small quantity of Cs(137) forms ionic bonds with organic compounds (probably as salts of carboxylic acids). Even though most of the activity appears in the phloem tissue, some activity is dispersed in much of the sapwood and even in the dead xylem tissue of the heartwood. Some of this Cs(137) is retained, at least temporarily, by the numerous carboxylic groups of the natural plant compounds of cell walls, cytoplasm of living cells, and cell debris of heartwood."
