https://openalex.org/W2078963671,"An enzyme preparation from Pseudomonas sp., isolated from a soil culture by an enrichment technique, liberated 3-chloroaniline from the herbicide isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate. Aniline, 3-chloroaniline, and 3,4-dichloroaniline were detected when the enzyme preparation was incubated with several alkyl esters of the phenylcarbamates and chlorophenylcarbamates. No chloroaniline was detected when the 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) was used as a substrate. The substrate specificity of the isolated enzyme suggests that it catalyzes the initial hydrolysis of many biologically active phenylcarbamates in soils."
https://openalex.org/W2081648696,"Famines are generally caused by decline in food production in successive years brought about by poor weather, war, or both. The consequent complex interactions between prices, employment, and assets impoverish victims and lead to sharply increased mortality. Government policy is a key determinant as to whether or not these conditions mature into wisespread famine. India and Bangladesh have succeeded in controlling famines in recent years, but problems in most of Africa remain intractable due to civil unrest and a paucity of resources, including trained people, institutions, and infrastructure. General economic development and political consensus is needed to reduce Africa's vulnerability to famine. In this context, judiciously provided foreign aid can be of immense help."
https://openalex.org/W2060235101,"Somatic carrot cells in culture divide to produce undifferentiated preglobular proembryos which exhibit a wide variety of segmentation patterns. One or more globular proembryos, which exhibit normal histological zonation, may develop from single preglobular proembryos. Regeneration of normal embryos from cultured cells grown on media containing only minerals, sucrose, vitamins, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid suggests that the embryo sac may have less of a formative role than currently ascribed to it."
https://openalex.org/W2005085936,"The evidence for volcanism on Mars is commonly accepted, but none has been documented in the Valles Marineris equatorial rift system. A recent survey of the troughs in this valley revealed dark patches that are interpreted to be volcanic vents. The configuration and association of these patches with tectonic structures suggest that they are of internal origin; their albedo and color ratios indicate a mafic composition; and their stratigraphic position, crispness of morphologic detail, and low albedo imply that they are young, perhaps even recent."
https://openalex.org/W2104402474,"The structure (2,2-dimethyl-3-isopropylidenecyclopropyl propionate) previously assigned to the sex attractant of the American cockroach has now been shown by additional physical and chemical data and biological inactivity of the synthetic preparation to be incorrect. The structure of this attractant remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W2021025981,"Mass spectrometry has advanced with the renaissance of time-of-flight mass analysis, the use of ion traps as analyzers and reactors, the application of tandem mass spectrometers to problems in ionic reaction mechanisms and chemical analysis, and the development of new desorption ionization techniques. These developments have allowed determination of the molecular weight distributions for polymers through the 10,000-dalton range, as well as the molecular weight and partial sequence of biopolymers of similar size. Surfaces can be characterized by use of the mass, energy, and angle distributions of particles ejected by sputtering or by laser-induced desorption. Mass spectrometry has yielded new information on the kinetics of catalytic surface reactions and on the reactivity of metal clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2066842626,"(1) By seeding sugar-beets in the greenhouse in early December or sooner, by exposing the growing beets to electric light for a few hours in the evening and by transplanting the roots into the field in spring, a seed generation may be produced every year. (2) The beets must have reached a minimum stage of maturity at transplanting time, otherwise many may fail to produce seed. (3) Storage for one month in a cellar before transplanting failed to give any observable benefit."
