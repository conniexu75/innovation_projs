https://openalex.org/W2899224111,"The hypothalamus controls essential social behaviors and homeostatic functions. However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei-including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types-is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled ~1 million cells, identified ~70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms."

However, understanding structural gradient-related mechanical behaviors in all gradient structures, including those in engineering materials, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned structure with highly tunable structural gradients in pure copper. A large structural gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the gradient structure. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient structures, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of materials through gradient design."

We screened the human C2H2 zinc finger proteome for degradation in the presence of thalidomide analogs, identifying 11 zinc finger degrons. Structural and functional characterization of the C2H2 zinc finger degrons demonstrates how diverse zinc finger domains bind the permissive drug-CRBN interface. Computational zinc finger docking and biochemical analysis predict that more than 150 zinc fingers bind the drug-CRBN complex in vitro, and we show that selective zinc finger degradation can be achieved through compound modifications. Our results provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting transcription factors that were previously considered undruggable."

Kam et al. studied the α-syn preformed fibril (α-syn PFF) model of sporadic PD (see the Perspective by Brundin and Wyse). They found that pathologic α-syn–activated poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase–1 (PARP-1) and inhibition of PARP or knockout of PARP-1 protected mice from pathology. The generation of PAR by α-syn PFF–induced PARP-1 activation converted α-syn PFF to a strain that was 25-fold more toxic, termed PAR–α-syn PFF. An increase of PAR in the cerebrospinal fluid and evidence of PARP activation in the substantia nigra of PD patients indicates that PARP activation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD through parthanatos and conversion of α-syn to a more toxic strain.

Practical applications, such as quantum computing, will likely be based on an optical-chip platform and require the manipulation of multiphoton states. The inevitable scattering and loss of photons in such a platform would be detrimental for application. Blanco-Redondo et al. show how a specially designed optical circuit based on topology can offer protection for propagating biphoton states. The results show that topological design consideration could provide the desired robustness required for quantum optical circuitry. Science , this issue p. 568"

They provide magnificent, detailed records of hydroclimate, but precisely what aspects of hydroclimate they record is unclear. Zhang et al. present data from two speleothems from central eastern China for the period from 21,000 to 10,000 years ago and suggest that the cause of the oxygen isotopic variability that they observe is more complex than simple changes in monsoon strength or intensity (see the Perspective by McGee). Alternatively, this variation may reflect the lengths of various phases of the monsoon and the regional heterogeneity of the East Asian hydroclimate. Science , this issue p. 580 ; see also p. 518"
https://openalex.org/W2899480717,"Gut microbiota selects fungi Fungi, such as Candida albicans , are found in the mammalian gut, but we know little about what they are doing there. Tso et al. put C. albicans under evolutionary pressure by serial passage in mice that were treated with antibiotics and were thus lacking gut bacteria (see the Perspective by d'Enfert). Passage accelerated fungal mutation, especially around the FLO8 gene, resulting in low-virulence phenotypes unable to form hyphae. Nevertheless, these phenotypes stimulated proinflammatory cytokines and conferred transient cross-protection against several other gut inhabitants. However, if an intact microbiota was present, only the virulent hyphal forms persisted. Science , this issue p. 589 ; see also p. 523"
https://openalex.org/W2899050862,"The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic nanoparticles (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential adsorption of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, adsorption of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH3)42+] followed by adsorption of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl42-] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) nanoparticles. These supported bimetallic nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic performance in acetylene selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals."

Some individuals respond poorly to vaccination, and virus variation makes targeting optimal antigens difficult. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are one solution, but they have their own pitfalls, including limited cross-reactivity to both influenza A and B strains and the need for repeated injections. Now, Laursen et al. have developed multidomain antibodies with breadth and potency. Administered intranasally to mice with an adeno-associated virus vector, the antibodies provided durable and continuous protection from a panoply of influenza strains. Science , this issue p. 598"
https://openalex.org/W2899370069,"Snapshots of a phase transition Time-resolved x-ray scattering can be used to investigate the dynamics of materials during the switch from one structural phase to another. So far, methods provide an ensemble average and may miss crucial aspects of the detailed mechanisms at play. Wall et al. used a total-scattering technique to probe the dynamics of the ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) (see the Perspective by Cavalleri). Femtosecond x-ray pulses provide access to the time- and momentum-resolved dynamics of the structural transition. Their results show that the photoinduced transition is of the order-disorder type, driven by an ultrafast change in the lattice potential that suddenly unlocks the vanadium atoms and yields large-amplitude uncorrelated motions, rather than occurring through a coherent displacive mechanism.

A combination of increasing experience with outbreaks and genome-sequencing technology now means the pathogen can often be identified within days. But for some of the most frightening viral pathogens, the originating hosts and possible vectors often remain obscure. Babayan et al. took sequence data from more than 500 single-stranded RNA viruses (see the Perspective by Woolhouse) and used machine-learning algorithms to extract evolutionary signals imprinted in the virus sequence that offer information about its original hosts and if an arthropod vector, and what type, plays a part in the virus's natural ecology.

https://openalex.org/W2898900122,"Melanomas originating from mucosal surfaces have low mutation burden, genomic instability, and poor prognosis. To identify potential driver genes, we sequenced hundreds of cancer-related genes in 43 human mucosal melanomas, cataloging point mutations, amplifications, and deletions. The SPRED1 gene, which encodes a negative regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, was inactivated in 37% of the tumors. Four distinct genotypes were associated with SPRED1 loss. Using a rapid, tissue-specific CRISPR technique to model these genotypes in zebrafish, we found that SPRED1 functions as a tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of KIT mutations. SPRED1 knockdown caused MAPK activation, increased cell proliferation, and conferred resistance to drugs inhibiting KIT tyrosine kinase activity. These findings provide a rationale for MAPK inhibition in SPRED1-deficient melanomas and introduce a zebrafish modeling approach that can be used more generally to dissect genetic interactions in cancer."

Mimica et al. investigated neuronal representations of body postures in the posterior parietal and frontal motor cortices with three-dimensional tracking of freely moving rodents (see the Perspective by Chen). Both brain regions represented posture rather than movements and self-motion. Decoding the activity of neurons in the two regions accurately predicted an animal's posture.

https://openalex.org/W2899315113,"Purpose Radiomics provides quantitative tissue heterogeneity profiling and is an exciting approach to developing imaging biomarkers in the context of precision medicine. Normal-appearing parenchymal tissues surrounding primary tumors can harbor microscopic disease that leads to increased risk of distant metastasis (DM). This study assesses whether computed-tomography (CT) imaging features of such peritumoral tissues can predict DM in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material and methods 200 NSCLC patients of histological adenocarcinoma were included in this study. The investigated lung tissues were tumor rim, defined to be 3mm of tumor and parenchymal tissue on either side of the tumor border and the exterior region extended from 3 to 9mm outside of the tumor. Fifteen stable radiomic features were extracted and evaluated from each of these regions on pre-treatment CT images. For comparison, features from expert-delineated tumor contours were similarly prepared. The patient cohort was separated into training and validation datasets for prognostic power evaluation. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for each region using concordance index (CI). Results Univariable analysis reveals that six out of fifteen tumor rim features were significantly prognostic of DM (p-value < 0.05), as were ten features from the visible tumor, and only one of the exterior features was. Multivariablely, a rim radiomic signature achieved the highest prognostic performance in the independent validation sub-cohort (CI = 0.64, p-value = 2.4×10−5) significantly over a multivariable clinical model (CI = 0.53), a visible tumor radiomics model (CI = 0.59), or an exterior tissue model (CI = 0.55). Furthermore, patient stratification by the combined rim signature and clinical predictor led to a significant improvement on the clinical predictor alone and also outperformed stratification using the combined tumor signature and clinical predictor. Conclusions We identified peritumoral rim radiomic features significantly associated with DM. This study demonstrated that peritumoral imaging characteristics may provide additional valuable information over the visible tumor features for patient risk stratification due to cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2899236679,"Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy or enema has become a commonly used treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI). Aims To compare the safety and preliminary efficacy of orally administered lyophilized microbiota product compared with frozen product by enema. Methods In a single center, adults with ≥ 3 episodes of recurrent CDI were randomized to receive encapsulated lyophilized fecal microbiota from 100–200 g of donor feces (n = 31) or frozen FMT from 100 g of donor feces (n = 34) by enema. Safety during the three months post FMT was the primary study objective. Prevention of CDI recurrence during the 60 days after FMT was a secondary objective. Fecal microbiome changes were examined in first 39 subjects studied. Results Adverse experiences were commonly seen in equal frequency in both groups and did not appear to relate to the route of delivery of FMT. CDI recurrence was prevented in 26 of 31 (84%) subjects randomized to capsules and in 30 of 34 (88%) receiving FMT by enema (p = 0.76). Both products normalized fecal microbiota diversity while the lyophilized orally administered product was less effective in repleting Bacteroidia and Verrucomicrobia classes compared to frozen product via enema. Conclusions The route of delivery, oral or rectal, did not influence adverse experiences in FMT. In preliminary evaluation, both routes appeared to show equivalent efficacy, although the dose may need to be higher for lyophilized product. Spore-forming bacteria appear to be the most important engrafting organisms in FMT by the oral route using lyophilized product. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02449174"

https://openalex.org/W2899401674,"Galectins compose a protein family defined by a conserved sequence motif conferring affinity for β-galactose–containing glycans. Moreover, galectins gain higher affinity and fine-tune specificity by glycan interactions at sites adjacent to their β-galactoside–binding site, as revealed by extensive testing against panels of purified glycans. However, in cells, galectins bind glycans on glycoproteins and glycolipids in the context of other cellular components, such as at the cell surface. Because of difficulties in characterizing natural cellular environments, we currently lack a detailed understanding of galectin-binding specificities in the cellular context. To address this challenge, we used a panel of genetically stable glycosylation mutated CHO cells that express defined glycans to evaluate the binding affinities of 10 different carbohydrate-recognition domains in galectins to N-glycans and mucin-type O-glycans. Using flow cytometry, we measured the cell-surface binding of the galectins. Moreover, we used fluorescence anisotropy to determine the galectin affinities to recombinant erythropoietin used as a reporter glycoprotein produced by the glycoengineered cells and to synthetic N-glycans with defined branch structures. We found that all galectins, apart from galectin-8N, require complex N-glycans for high-affinity binding. Galectin-8N targeted both N- and O-linked glycans with high affinity, preferring 2,3-sialylated N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) structures. Furthermore, we found that 2,3-sialylation suppresses high-affinity binding of select galectins, including galectin-2, -3, -4N, and -7. Structural modeling provided a basis for interpreting the observed binding preferences. These results underscore the power of a glycoengineered platform to dissect the glycan-binding specificities of carbohydrate-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2898796699,"The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) is one of the most serious insect pest species to evolve resistance against many insecticides from different chemical classes. This species has evolved resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides across its native range and is becoming a truly global pest after establishing in South America and having been recently recorded in North America. A chimeric cytochrome P450 gene, CYP337B3, has been identified as a resistance mechanism for resistance to fenvalerate and cypermethrin. Here we show that this resistance mechanism is common around the world with at least eight different alleles. It is present in South America and has probably introgressed into its closely related native sibling species, Helicoverpa zea. The different alleles of CYP337B3 are likely to have arisen independently in different geographic locations from selection on existing diversity. The alleles found in Brazil are those most commonly found in Asia, suggesting a potential origin for the incursion of H. armigera into the Americas."
https://openalex.org/W2898963916,"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is widely used in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. Nevertheless, this technique suffers from two main problems in the case of partial shading conditions (PSCs). The first problem is that PSO is a time invariant optimization technique that cannot follow the dynamic global peak (GP) under time variant shading patterns (SPs) and sticks to the first GP that occurs at the beginning. This problem can be solved by dispersing the PSO particles using two new techniques introduced in this paper. The two new proposed PSO re-initialization techniques are to disperse the particles upon the SP changes and the other one is upon a predefined time (PDT). The second problem is regarding the high oscillations around steady state, which can be solved by using fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to fine-tune the output power and voltage from the PV system. The new contribution of this paper is the hybrid PSO-FLC with two PSO particles dispersing techniques that is able to solve the two previous mentioned problems effectively and improve the performance of the PV system in both normal and PSCs. A detailed list of comparisons between hybrid PSO-FLC and original PSO using the two proposed methodologies are achieved. The results prove the superior performance of hybrid PSO-FLC compared to PSO in terms of efficiency, accuracy, oscillations reduction around steady state and soft tuning of the GP tracked."

https://openalex.org/W2899338876,"In oviparous animals, vitellogenesis is prerequisite to egg production and embryonic growth after oviposition. For successful insect vitellogenesis and oogenesis, vitellogenin (Vg) synthesized in the fat body (homologue to vertebrate liver and adipose tissue) must pass through the intercellular channels, a condition known as patency in the follicular epithelium, to reach the surface of oocytes. This process is controlled by juvenile hormone (JH) in many insect species, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Previous work has suggested the possible involvement of Na+/K+-ATPase in patency initiation, but again, the regulatory cascade of Na+/K+-ATPase for patency initiation has been lacking. Using the migratory locust Locusta migratoria as a model system, we report here that RNAi-mediated knockdown of gene coding for Na+/K+-ATPase, inhibition of its phosphorylation, or suppression of its activity causes loss of patency, resulting in blocked Vg uptake, arrested oocyte maturation, and impaired ovarian growth. JH triggers G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), phospholipase C (PLC), inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and protein kinase C (PKC) to phosphorylate Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit at amino acid residue Ser8, consequently activating Na+/K+-ATPase for the induction of patency in vitellogenic follicular epithelium. Our results thus point to a previously unidentified mechanism by which JH induces the phosphorylation and activation of Na+/K+-ATPase via a signaling cascade of GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC.

JH exerts both genomic and nongenomic actions.

In nongenomic actions, JH is reported to trigger receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), phospholipase C (PLC), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to stimulate the phosphorylation of Met for enhanced transcriptional regulation activity in A. aegypti (40Cai M.J.

In the bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, JH acts on phosphorylation of BrC-Z7 to inhibit 20E-mediated metamorphosis via a GPCR, PLC, and PKC signaling pathway (40Cai M.J. Liu W. Pei X.Y. Li X.R. He H.J.

Through PLC and PKC, JH also stimulates Hsp90 phosphorylation to regulate JH-responsive gene transcription (43Liu W. Zhang F.X. Cai M.J. Zhao W.L. Li X.R. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F.

Previously, pharmaceutical experiments with PKC inhibitors and activators have suggested that this enzyme is involved in the activation of Na+/K+-ATPase (1Wyatt G.R. Davey K.G. Cellular and molecular actions of juvenile hormone. II. Roles of juvenile hormone in adult insects.Adv.

We therefore hypothesized that JH might trigger nongenomic pathways to activate PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase for patency in vitellogenic follicular epithelium. L. migratoria is a favorable model for studying JH-dependent patency and vitellogenesis (1Wyatt G.R. Davey K.G. Cellular and molecular actions of juvenile hormone. II. Roles of juvenile hormone in adult insects.Adv. Insect Physiol. 1996; 26: 1-15510.1016/S0065-2806(08)60030-2Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). With this model system, we report in the present study that depletion of Na+/K+-ATPase or blocking its activity caused loss of patency, leading to inhibited Vg uptake, accompanied by arrested oocyte maturation and impaired ovarian growth. We demonstrated that JH triggered a GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC pathway to phosphorylate the α-subunit at Ser8, consequently activating Na+/K+-ATPase for the induction of patency during vitellogenesis. These results shed some light on the regulatory mechanisms of JH-dependent vitellogenesis and oogenesis in insects. As the role of Na+/K+-ATPase in locust vitellogenesis and oogenesis had not been previously determined by gene knockdown, we initially performed Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit (GenBankTM number MH450018) RNAi in vitellogenic adult female locusts. qRT-PCR showed that the mRNA levels of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit were reduced by 81% in the ovary of adult females at 6 days post-adult eclosion (PAE) (Fig. 1A). Western blotting demonstrated that the protein levels of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit declined by 85% after RNAi (Fig. 1B). The migratory locust has two Vg genes, VgA (GenBankTM number KF171066) and VgB (GenBankTM number KX709496) (45Locke J. White B.N. Wyatt G.R. Cloning and 5′ end nucleotide sequences of two juvenile hormone-inducible vitellogenin genes of the African migratory locust.DNA. 1987; 6 (2820677): 331-34210.1089/dna.1987.6.331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Depletion of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit caused 77 and 73% reduction of VgA and VgB protein levels, respectively, in the ovaries (Fig. 1, B and C). Consequently, the primary oocytes and ovaries of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit–depleted adult females remained small on day 6 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the primary oocytes and ovaries of dsGFP controls were remarkably enlarged (Fig. 1D). We measured the length of primary oocyte as an indicator of oocyte maturation. Statistically, the average length of primary oocytes of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit–depleted locusts was 1.9 mm, whereas that of dsGFP controls was 5.3 mm (Fig. 1D). These results reinforce our view that Na+/K+-ATPase plays a pivotal role in ovarian Vg uptake and oocyte maturation of L. migratoria. Western blots were conducted to reveal the dynamics of ovarian Vg uptake during the first gonadotrophic cycle, using the proteins extracted from ovaries of adult females collected from 1 to 8 days PAE. As shown in Fig. 2A, the levels of VgA and VgB proteins in the ovary were substantially increased after day 4 and remained high at 5–7 days PAE and then decreased at the end of the first gonadotrophic cycle. Our ELISA showed that Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the ovary was significantly increased on day 4, continually elevated at 5–6 days PAE, and thereafter (7–8 days PAE) declined to levels similar to those at 0–3 days PAE (Fig. 2B). The Na+/K+-ATPase activity was lowest at 8 days PAE (Fig. 2B). These data suggest a correlation between Na+/K+-ATPase activity and ovarian Vg uptake in the vitellogenic stage. As PKC has been suggested to phosphorylate and activate Na+/K+-ATPase (1Wyatt G.R. Davey K.G. Cellular and molecular actions of juvenile hormone. II. Roles of juvenile hormone in adult insects.Adv.

As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), the levels of phosphorylated Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit were significantly increased on day 2, reached peaks at 4–7 days PAE, and then declined on day 8. As locust hemolymph JH titer is undetectable at eclosion but elevates significantly in the previtellogenic stage and rises to a peak during vitellogenesis (46Guo W. Wu Z. Yang L. Cai Z. Zhao L. Zhou S.

Int. 1995; 35 (7663387): 323-328PubMed Google Scholar), the elevation of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit phosphorylation appeared to correlate with its enhanced activity and the phase of increased JH titers. To assess the responsiveness of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit phosphorylation and activation to JH, we performed ELISA and immunoprecipitation using proteins extracted from ovaries of 2-day-old adult females treated with methoprene for 0–60 min. The activity of Na+/K+-ATPase was significantly enhanced 30 min post-methoprene administration (Fig. 2E). With respect to PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit, the levels were significantly increased 15 min after methoprene application (Fig. 2, F and G). Collectively, the above data indicate that JH stimulates PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit for its activation. To determine the effect of Na+/K+-ATPase phosphorylation and activation on ovarian Vg uptake, we carried out in vivo Vg uptake assays by treating JH-deprived adult females with methoprene and the hemolymph containing Vg but without endogenous JH. As evaluated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, depletion of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit led to significant reduction of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit (Fig. 3, A and B). Application of ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit (48Sandtner W. Egwolf B. Khalili-Araghi F. Sánchez-Rodríguez J.E. Roux B. Bezanilla F. Holmgren M. Ouabain binding site in a functioning Na+/K+-ATPase.J. Biol.

Either Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit knockdown or ouabain treatment caused significant reduction of Na+/K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3 (D–F), methoprene treatment induced Vg uptake in the ovary. Knockdown of Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit precluded methoprene-induced ovarian Vg uptake (Fig. 3, D–F). The capacity of methoprene to induce ovarian Vg uptake was also blocked by ouabain treatment (Fig. 3, D–F). These observations indicate that activated Na+/K+-ATPase by JH and PKC is crucial to Vg uptake in the ovary. It is well-known that PKC phosphorylates R. norvegicus Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit 1 at Ser23 (49Logvinenko N.S. Du"
https://openalex.org/W2898709937,"Although recent therapeutic advances based on our understanding of molecular phenomena have prolonged the survival of melanoma patients, the prognosis of melanoma remains dismal and further understanding of the underlying mechanism of melanoma progression is needed. In this study, differential expression analyses revealed that many genes, including AKT1 and CDK2, play important roles in melanoma. Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), obtained from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, indicated that high proliferative and metastatic abilities are the main characteristics of melanoma and that the PI3K and MAPK pathways play essential roles in melanoma progression. Among these DEGs, major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 12 (MFSD12) was found to have significantly and specifically upregulated expression in melanoma, and elevated MFSD12 level promoted cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, MFSD12 upregulation was found to activate PI3K signaling, and a PI3K inhibitor reversed the increase in cell proliferation endowed by MFSD12 upregulation. Clinically, high MFSD12 expression was positively associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in melanoma patients, and MFSD12 was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in melanoma patients. Therapeutically, in vivo assays further confirmed that MFSD12 interference inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in melanoma. In conclusion, elevated MFSD12 expression promotes melanoma cell proliferation, and MFSD12 is a valuable prognostic biomarker and promising therapeutic target in melanoma."

Cry1Ab is produced as a 130-kDa protoxin that is activated by proteolytic removal of an inert 500 amino-acid-long C-terminal region, enabling the activated toxin to bind to insect midgut receptor proteins, leading to its membrane insertion and pore formation. It has been proposed that the C-terminal region is only involved in toxin crystallization, but its role in receptor binding is undefined. Here we show that the C-terminal region of Cry1Ab protoxin provides additional binding sites for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aminopeptidase N (APN) insect receptors. ELISA, ligand blot, surface plasmon resonance, and pulldown assays revealed that the Cry1Ab C-terminal region binds to both ALP and APN but not to cadherin. Thus, the C-terminal region provided a higher binding affinity of the protoxin to the gut membrane that correlated with higher toxicity of protoxin than activated toxin. Moreover, Cry1Ab domain II loop 2 or 3 mutations reduced binding of the protoxin to cadherin but not to ALP or APN, supporting the idea that protoxins have additional binding sites. These results imply that two different regions mediate the binding of Cry1Ab protoxin to membrane receptors, one located in domain II–III of the toxin and another in its C-terminal region, suggesting an active role of the C-terminal protoxin fragment in the mode of action of Cry toxins.

The “classical model” of the Bt mode of action asserts that protoxins must be converted to activated toxins before receptor binding, toxin oligomerization, and pore formation.

These results with whole insects imply that the intact protoxin or some part of the protoxin other than the activated toxin contributes to toxicity. In vitro experiments with different fragments of CAD receptor from Pectinophora gossypiella and Manduca sexta demonstrated that both the protoxin and activated toxin forms of Cry1Ac or Cry1Ab bind to the CAD receptor, specifically to CAD repeats 8–11 (CR8–11) from P. gossypiella CAD and to CR7–12 from M. sexta (21Gómez I.

In bioassays performed in the cell line CF203 from Choristoneura fumiferana showed that both the intact Cry1Ac protoxin without activation and the activated Cry1Ac toxin were toxic to these cells, but the cytological damage to treated cells differed between them (23Li X.

The aforementioned in vitro experiments performed in the cell line directly tested the effects of intact protoxins because they excluded the proteolytic activation that occurs in insect midguts. The C-terminal protoxin region of Cry1A toxins has been proposed to be an inert region of the protein that is only involved in crystallization of Cry proteins during the sporulation phase of Bt, and no other role in the mechanism of action of Cry proteins has been attributed to this region (15Adang M.J.

The objective of this work was to determine whether the C-terminal region of the protein has a role in Cry toxicity.

Here we report the first tests of that hypothesis, performed with different binding assays.

Overall, our results indicate that the C-terminal fragment of Cry1Ab protoxin is directly involved in the protoxin mode of action by binding to Cry toxin receptors. This region of protoxin contributes to toxicity with additional binding sites to ALP and APN, whereas domain II contributes to CAD binding. To determine whether the C-terminal portion of Cry1Ab protoxin binds to insect midgut receptors, the C-terminal region of Cry1Ab protoxin was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). The Cry1Ab protoxin was obtained from solubilized purified crystal inclusions, and the Cry1Ab activated toxin was purified by anion exchange chromatography after protoxin activation with trypsin (Fig. S1). Fig. S2 shows the Western blot analysis of these samples using anti-Cry1Ab toxin or anti-C-terminal antibodies, showing that anti-Cry1Ab toxin antibody cross-reacts with activated toxin and protoxin, but not with the C-terminal fragment and the anti-C-terminal antibody recognized both protoxin and the C-terminal fragment, and did not recognize the activated toxin. The toxicity of these samples was tested against M. sexta neonate larvae. The C-terminal fragment was not toxic to the larvae; no toxicity was observed with 5 μg/cm2 of this protein. However, the protoxin showed an LC50 value of 3.4 ng/cm2 (95% fiducial limits, 2.5–4.3), in contrast to the activated toxin, which showed an LC50 value of 10.3 ng/cm2 (By 95% fiducial limits, 7.8–13), showing that the protoxin was 3-fold more toxic than the activated toxin. The binding analysis of purified protoxin, activated toxin, or C-terminal fragment to BBMVs from M. sexta showed that the C-terminal fragment also interacts with BBMVs with a high apparent binding affinity (Kd = 25 nm), similar to the apparent binding affinity of the protoxin (Kd = 16 nm) and the activated toxin (Kd = 18 nm) (Fig. 2). To determine whether the C-terminal fragment was able to bind to Cry protein receptors such as CAD, APN, or ALP, we performed ELISA binding assays using purified ALP, APN, and CAD (CR7–12 fragment) expressed in E. coli cells (Fig. S3). We used the CAD fragment CR7–12 (residues M810-A1485 of M. sexta CAD) because this fragment contains all three epitopes of CAD protein involved in Cry1Ab binding (32Chen J. Hua G. Jurat-Fuentes J.L.

Our data show that the C-terminal fragment bound to ALP and APN with high affinity (Kd values of 55 ± 9 nm and 24 ± 3 nm, respectively) (Fig. 3A) but showed extremely low absorbance values at 490 nm in the ELISA binding assay in the interaction with CAD (CR7–12). These data were confirmed by kinetic binding studies performed with the immobilized C-terminal fragment in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, which showed that the C-terminal region was able to bind to APN and ALP with high affinity (Kd values of 185 ± 3 nm and 88 ± 5 nm, respectively) but not to CAD (CR7–12) (Fig. 3B). We also performed ligand blot assays of the protoxin, activated toxin, and C-terminal fragment to different concentrations of each receptor molecule (CR7–12, ALP, and APN). These data confirmed that the C-terminal fragment did not bind to CAD (CR7–12) but was able to bind to ALP and APN (Fig. 4).Figure 3Binding analysis of the C-terminal fragment to CAD, APN, and ALP.

https://openalex.org/W2898763207,"Anaerobic digestion is a key process for the conversion of waste organics to biogas for energy and is reliant on the synergistic activities of complex microbial communities. Members of the phylum Chloroflexi are often found to be abundant in these systems, yet little is known of their role, with most members yet to be cultured or identified. The aim of this study was to characterize the Chloroflexi communities present in full-scale anaerobic digesters receiving excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The core genus-level-phylotypes were identified from extensive 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing surveys of 19 full-scale systems over a 6 year period. The T78 and Leptolinea, and the RB349 and SJA-170, were found to be the most abundant genera of mesophilic and thermophilic digesters, respectively. With the exception of Leptolinea, these phylotypes are known only by their 16S rRNA gene sequence, and their morphology and metabolic potentials are not known. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes were designed for these phylotypes, with their application revealing a similar thin filamentous morphology, indicating a possible role for these organisms in maintaining floc structure. The new FISH probes provide a useful tool for future efforts to characterize these organisms in situ. FISH also suggests that immigrating Chloroflexi species die off in the anaerobic digester environment and their high abundance in anaerobic digesters, observed with DNA based sequencing surveys, was quite possibly due to the persistence of their DNA after their death. This observation is important for the interpretation of popular DNA-based sequencing methods applied for the characterisation of communities with substantial immigration rates, such as anaerobic digesters."
https://openalex.org/W2898849930,"We recently reported a previously unrecognized mitochondrial respiratory phenomenon. When [ADP] was held constant (“clamped”) at sequentially increasing concentrations in succinate-energized muscle mitochondria in the absence of rotenone (commonly used to block complex I), we observed a biphasic, increasing then decreasing, respiratory response. Here we investigated the mechanism. We confirmed decades-old reports that oxaloacetate (OAA) inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). We then used an NMR method to assess OAA concentrations (known as difficult to measure by MS) as well as those of malate, fumarate, and citrate in isolated succinate-respiring mitochondria. When these mitochondria were incubated at varying clamped ADP concentrations, respiration increased at low [ADP] as expected given the concurrent reduction in membrane potential. With further increments in [ADP], respiration decreased associated with accumulation of OAA. Moreover, a low pyruvate concentration, that alone was not enough to drive respiration, was sufficient to metabolize OAA to citrate and completely reverse the loss of succinate-supported respiration at high [ADP]. Further, chemical or genetic inhibition of pyruvate uptake prevented OAA clearance and preserved respiration. In addition, we measured the effects of incremental [ADP] on NADH, superoxide, and H2O2 (a marker of reverse electron transport from complex II to I). In summary, our findings, taken together, support a mechanism (detailed within) wherein succinate-energized respiration as a function of increasing [ADP] is initially increased by [ADP]-dependent effects on membrane potential but subsequently decreased at higher [ADP] by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by OAA.

The physiologic relevance is discussed. Understanding mitochondrial electron transport is fundamental to our knowledge of a myriad of metabolic, neurologic, neoplastic, and other physiologic and pathophysiologic states.

Mitochondrial respiration is commonly studied by adding substrates to generate electrons, most often using donors to complex I and/or complex II and under state 4 4For the purposes of this manuscript, we refer to state 4 as respiration in the presence of substrate but absence of added ADP, slightly at variance with the original description by Chance and Williams in 1955 (37Chance B. Williams G.R. Respiratory enzymes in oxidative phosphorylation. III. The steady state.J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217 (13271404): 409-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as respiration after depletion of added ADP. (no ATP production) and state 3 (ADP present in high amounts to generate maximal ATP production) conditions. However, when ADP is added to succinate-energized mitochondria in amounts expected to induce state 3 respiration, O2 flux drops to low levels (1Chance B. Hagihara B. Activation and inhibition of succinate oxidation following adenosine diphosphate supplements to pigeon heart mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237 (14019996): 3540-3545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schollmeyer P. Klingenberg M. Oxaloacetate and adenosinetriphosphate levels during inhibition and activation of succinate oxidation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1961; 4 (13748457): 43-4710.1016/0006-291X(61)90252-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By adding incremental amounts of ADP rather than large amounts and by clamping the concentrations of added ADP, we recently observed a phenomenon not reported previously (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The phenomenon is that respiration energized by succinate (without rotenone, commonly used with succinate to prevent reverse electron transport to complex I) actually increases over state 4 at low [ADP], reaches a peak at an intermediate concentration, and then sharply decreases to very low levels at high [ADP]. The loss of respiration at high ADP was clearly not because of simple loss of function over time of incubation, lower O2 tension, or opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, because the loss was rapidly reversible by complex I substrates or downstream electron donors and there was no evidence of pore opening (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find no prior report indicating that succinate-energized respiration peaks at low [ADP] before declining at higher [ADP]. One reason may be that, as stated above, most past studies of respiration by isolated mitochondria have been carried out in the absence and/or presence of substantial amounts of ADP rather than at intermediate concentrations. It is not physiologic to study respiration only under state 3 or state 4 conditions. Mitochondria in vivo do not function at either extreme, but rather in between (4Brand M.D. Nicholls D.G. Assessing mitochondrial dysfunction in cells.Biochem. J. 2011; 435 (21726199): 297-31210.1042/BJ20110162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Another reason may be that the large portion of early studies of mitochondrial metabolism used liver mitochondria wherein we found that this biphasic succinate-energized effect is barely evident (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, an additional reason this phenomenon had not received past attention may be that, as above, it has become common practice to carry out studies of succinate-energized respiration in the presence of rotenone. However, rotenone is also not physiologic. In the current report, we describe the mechanism underlying the above-mentioned phenomenon. To do this, we used ADP clamp methodology, 2-deoxyglucose plus hexokinase (5Yu L. Fink B.D. Sivitz W.I. Simultaneous quantification of mitochondrial ATP and ROS production.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1264 (25631011): 149-15910.1007/978-1-4939-2257-4_14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), combined with sensitive NMR technology to detect TCA cycle metabolites. In particular, this includes quantification of oxaloacetic acid (OAA), a metabolite that is very difficult to measure by MS because of instability (6Al Kadhi O. Melchini A. Mithen R. Saha S. Development of a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous detection of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in a range of biological matrices.J. Anal.

Here we provide compelling evidence for the role of OAA in regulating biphasic complex II–supported respiration. Further, we describe how this process is related to changes in reverse electron transport (RET), reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane potential (ΔΨ), and the oxidation/reduction state of NAD+ and NADH. These findings advance our understanding of complex II–energized respiration and, moreover, suggest that we may need to re-think how complex II respiration is studied, i.e. that we might best do this at intermediate degrees of ADP availability without rotenone. The physiologic relevance of our findings is discussed. Mitochondria were incubated for 20 min and the ADP concentration was clamped at the desired level (Fig. 1). On a given day separate 20-min incubations were carried out at all ADP concentrations shown on the x axis and the experiment was repeated on 6 different days. The O2 tension in the Oxygraph drops with time but respiration is not affected until O2 levels become very low. Nonetheless, because incubations were carried out for 20 min, it was necessary to periodically open the chamber to prevent marked deterioration in the oxygen content of the medium. O2 flux (Fig. 1A) is depicted as the average respiration over time assuming that respiration, which cannot be measured while the chamber is open, remains at the average of the value between the time of chamber opening and closing (see “Experimental procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1A, succinate-energized respiration was [ADP]-dependent, reaching a peak at 8 μm ADP before decreasing at higher concentrations. Metabolite and nucleotide concentrations were measured in the respiratory medium obtained at the end of each run (Fig. 1, B–G). Notably, the increase in OAA corresponded closely with the decrease in O2 flux whereas precursors (malate and fumarate) paralleled O2 flux and succinate utilization varied as expected dependent on consumption of the added substrate. NADH began to decrease as respiration peaked. Measurements of NAD+ were more variable but trended upward as NADH decreased. In these experiments (Fig. 2), incubations were performed on succinate-energized mitochondria with or without a low (0.5 mm) concentration of pyruvate or carried out in the presence of pyruvate alone (no succinate). In each individual incubation, ADP was sequentially added at intervals to increase clamped [ADP] to the levels indicated. Respiration and ΔΨ were measured as the plateau values at each ADP concentration. These data show that pyruvate prevented the loss in succinate-energized respiration (Fig. 2A) and potential (Fig. 2B) at higher [ADP]. This was the case even though pyruvate was not sufficient to drive respiration on its own (Fig. 2A). Succinate-energized mitochondria were incubated for 20 min in the presence of ADP clamped at 32 μm. Table 1 depicts respiration determined in the presence or absence of pyruvate and in the presence of pyruvate plus UK5099, a chemical inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (8Hildyard J.C. Ammälä C. Dukes I.D. Thomson S.A. Halestrap A.P. Identification and characterisation of a new class of highly specific and potent inhibitors of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.Biochim. Biophys.

Metabolite and NADH concentrations were measured in the respiratory medium obtained at the end of each run. These data show that pyruvate rescue of respiration (otherwise very low at 32 μm ADP) was blocked by UK5099 and the clearance of OAA to citrate was prevented. Changes in the OAA precursors (malate and fumarate) and succinate utilization were as expected based on respiration. The lower concentrations of NADH in the absence of pyruvate or in the presence of pyruvate carrier inhibition are consistent with what was observed in Fig. 1F at high [ADP].Table 1Respiration and metabolite and NADP concentrations in succinate (10 mm) -energized mouse hind limb skeletal muscle mitochondria incubated in the presence of 32 μm ADPSuccinate aloneSuccinate + pyruvateSuccinate + pyruvate + UK5099Respiration (pmol O2/mg/min)652 ± 19**††6406 ± 2381393 ± 37**OAA (μm)8.63 ± 0.65**†0 ± 06.68 ± 0.29**Citrate (μm)0 ± 0**5.60 ± 0.420 ± 0**Malate (μm)215.6 ± 6.2**1641 ± 66351.3 ± 7.2**Fumarate (μm)10.2 ± 0.40**††40.0 ± 1.717.7 ± 0.19**Succinate (mm)9.53 ± 0.11**†7.43 ± 0.208.87 ± 0.12**NADH (pmol/mg)335 ± 30**†1019 ± 44541 ± 57**NADH/NAD+0.083 ± 0.006**0.263 ± 0.0260.146 ± 0.025* Open table in a new tab In further experiments (Table 2), succinate-energized mitochondria were isolated from mice deficient in the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) or littermate controls in presence or absence of 0.5 mm pyruvate.

Consistent with the data for chemical inhibition of the pyruvate carrier (Table 1), pyruvate rescue of respiration required the carrier protein whereas the variations in metabolite concentrations were consistent with that observed for chemical inhibition.Table 2Respiration and metabolite concentrations in succinate (10 mm) -energized mouse hind limb skeletal muscle mitochondria isolated from the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 knock out (MCP1 KO) and littermate control mice incubated in the presence of 32 μm ADPControlMCP1 KOp value (interaction)No pyruvate0.5 mm pyruvateNo pyruvate0.5 mm pyruvateRespiration (pmol O2/mg/min)832 ± 876553 ± 185***697 ± 411335 ± 45**p < 0.0001OAA (μm)8.70 ± 0.530 ± 0***10 ± 0.938.98 ± 1.2p < 0.001Citrate (μm)0 ± 06.58 ± 0.78***0 ± 00 ± 0p < 0.0001Malate (μm)274 ± 331538 ± 51***207 ± 10342 ± 12*p < 0.0001Fumarate (μm)14.2 ± 1.241.0 ± 1.3***13.9 ± 1.318.6 ± 0.69*p < 0.0001Succinate (mm)9.04 ± 0.167.74 ± 0.16***8.97 ± 0.058.95 ± 0.09p < 0.001 Open table in a new tab SDH activity of the extracted complex was first determined in the absence of ADP or in the presence of ADP at a low or high concentration (Fig. 3A). As opposed to the effect of ADP on succinate-driven respiration in the presence of functioning mitochondria (Fig. 1A), ADP, as expected, had no direct effect on the activity of the isolated complex. In further experiments, we found that OAA as low as 5 μm strongly inhibited SDH (Fig. 3B). To assess the specificity of the antibody employed in these assays, SDH was extracted by immune immobilization. The eluted protein was then run on a gradient gel and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3C). Visualization revealed bands at kDa values consistent with those expected for the four subunits of the SDH complex with little to suggest nonspecific extraction of other proteins and with a pattern very similar to that reported by the manufacturer of the antibody. Mitochondria were incubated in microplate wells with shaking within a plate reader for 20 min at different concentrations of clamped ADP in the presence or absence of pyruvate (0.5 mm). Mitochondria were energized by succinate under the same conditions used for the Oxygraph incubations of Fig. 1. H2O2 production under these conditions is largely generated at complex I through conversion from superoxide by MnSOD and serves as a marker for reverse electron transport (9Lambert A.J.

As shown in Fig. 4A, H2O2 production with or without pyruvate decreased markedly in incubations performed at higher [ADP]. In other experiments (Fig. 4, B–D), we measured ROS production by EPR spectroscopy, a specific signal for superoxide. Although superoxide may be generated at complex III or other sites beyond complex I, the marked decrease in superoxide at high [ADP] confirms the overall loss of ROS. In our prior report (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we showed that the effect of decreasing potential with incremental ADP additions on O2 flux could be mimicked using the chemical uncoupler, p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). However, we have become aware that the amount of incremental FCCP in our prior report was high compared with what has been used to titrate potential in other reports. Therefore, we reexamined this issue, using both FCCP and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) to titrate potential. As shown in Fig. S1, when these uncouplers were employed, the relationship between potential and O2 flux was similar to that observed for ADP titration. We noted that the amount of FCCP needed to titrate potential to a given degree was less in this current study than in our above-mentioned past report. Mitochondria isolated from extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, and gastrocnemius muscle from normal Sprague-Dawley rats (rats were used instead of mice for ease in isolating specific muscle types) were energized with 10 mm succinate and incubated with sequential increments in clamped ADP. Fig. S2A shows that respiration reached much higher levels in mitochondria from gastrocnemius (mixed fiber type) compared with soleus (oxidative) or EDL (glycolytic). However, when respiration was expressed as a percent of state 4 (Fig. S2B), there was no difference in peak respiration between these muscle types. Interestingly, however, for the oxidative soleus mitochondria, respiration maintained a greater fractional increase over state 4 through higher concentrations of ADP. As expected, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased for all muscle types with sequential additions of ADP (Fig. S2C), while appearing initially higher in gastrocnemius mitochondria presumably because of the initial higher respiratory rate (Fig. S2A). Studies dating back decades describe OAA inhibition of SDH (1Chance B. Hagihara B.

However, those studies did not address the role of OAA in regulating O2 flux in intact respiring mitochondria. An older report showed that pyruvate prevented the loss of succinate-supported state 3 respiration, presumably by clearing OAA (16Panov A. Schonfeld P. Dikalov S. Hemendinger R. Bonkovsky H.L. Brooks B.R. The neuromediator glutamate, through specific substrate interactions, enhances mitochondrial ATP production and reactive oxygen species generation in nonsynaptic brain mitochondria.J.

That report did not actually demonstrate OAA clearance, however. Also, until our recent report (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the biphasic dependence of succinate-supported respiration on [ADP] had not been reported. Here we clarify the mechanism underlying this biphasic phenomenon (Fig. 5). The initial increase in respiration with incremental but lower amounts of ADP is easily understandable because of the reduction in ΔΨ as ADP phosphorylation consumes potential (4Brand M.D. Nicholls D.G. Assessing mitochondrial dysfunction in cells.Biochem. J. 2011; 435 (21726199): 297-31210.1042/BJ20110162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). It has long been known, that respiration increases with consumption of potential because of reduced downstream resistance to electron flow (17Sivitz W.I. Yorek M.A. Mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes: From molecular mechanisms to functional significance and therapeutic opportunities.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 12 (19650713): 537-57710.1089/ars.2009.2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In fact, in our past report we documented that ATP production, along with respiration, rises and falls with respiration as [ADP] is sequentially incremented and that the phenomenon can be mimicked by sequential addition of a chemical uncoupler (3Bai F. Fink B.D. Yu L. Sivitz W.I. Voltage-dependent regulation of complex II energized mitochondrial oxygen flux.PloS One. 2016; 11 (27153112)e015498210.1371/journal.pone.0154982Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is more difficult to explain the decrease in respiration despite continued reduction in ΔΨ at higher ADP concentrations (Figs. 1A and 2, A and B). Our current data strongly imply that this is because of inhibition of SDH by OAA. First, OAA accumulation closely paralleled the decrease in respiration (Fig. 1B) as well as the decrease in malate and fumarate precursors (Fig. 1, C and D) consistent with OAA feedback inhibition of SDH. Second, we show that metabolism of OAA to citrate by a low concentration of added pyruvate, in uninhibited and genetically normal mitochondria, prevents the inhibition of respiration and the decline in the succinate metabolites, malate and fumarate (Table 1, Table 2). Further, this effect of pyruvate was not because of pyruvate-energized respiration because the concentration of pyruvate required for reversal was too low to generate meaningful O2 flux on its own (Fig. 2A). Third, we show that the reversal effect of pyruvate was prevented by chemical or genetic inhibition of pyruvate uptake (Table 1, Table 2), indicating dependence on direct mitochondrial pyruvate utilization. Finally, we used modern methods to confirm decades-old reports that OAA, in fact, inhibits the extracted SDH complex and to add information indicating that it does so well within the range of the metabolite concentrations measured herein (Fig. 3B). Further, it is important to note that the activity of the extracted complex is not directly affected by ADP (Fig. 3A). This is as expected because any such effect would be dissociated from the effect of ADP to consume potential. Although OAA inhibition can explain the post-peak decrease in succinate-supported respiration, other processes come into play. It is important to consider the following. ADP additions decrease ΔΨ. Higher ΔΨ impairs forward electron transport and favors RET (18Brand M.D. Buckingham J.A. Esteves T.C. Green K. Lambert A.J. Miwa S. Murphy M.P. Pakay J.L. Talbot D.A. Echtay K.S.

Conversely, lowering ΔΨ enhances forward electron transport and electron donation by NADH at complex I. Such electron donation allows NADH cycling back to NAD+, whereas the consequent reduction in [NADH] favors a shift in the malate < > OAA equilibrium toward OAA. RET generates ROS at complex I, and H2O2 production is a known marker of RET (9Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Inhibitors of the quinone-binding site allow rapid superoxide production from mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).J. Biol.

With these factors in mind, the sequence of events (over increasing [ADP]) would be as follows. As ADP is incremented to low concentrations ΔΨ drops mildly and, therefore, respiration increases. ΔΨ is still high and RET is active, however, so [NADH] is maintained, limiting electron donation by NADH at complex I and limiting NADH/NAD+ cycling. Hence, malate conversion to OAA will be impaired and SDH is not inhibited. As ADP is further incremented to intermediate concentrations, conditions begin to change. Although, RET (as detected by H2O2) decreases, OAA is still absent (or too low to detect) either because potential is still high enough or RET is still active enough that electron donation by NADH to CoQ at complex I is minimal. Given the leftward nature of the malate < > OAA equilibrium (22McEvily A.J. Mullinax T.R. Dulin D.R. Harrison J.H. Regulation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase: Kinetic modulation independent of subunit interaction.Arch. Biochem.

However, as ADP is further incremented to higher concentrations, the greater drop in ΔΨ will prevent RET and favor forward electron transport, now enabling NADH electron donation and NADH/NAD+ cycling. OAA can now be generated in sufficient amounts to inhibit SDH and respiration. The concentrations of OAA are still small compared with malate, again consistent with the leftward nature of the malate dehydrogenase reaction, but only small concentrations of OAA are needed to inhibit SDH (Fig. 3B). The above processes at low and high [ADP] are depicted in Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2898758414,"Mitochondrial inner membrane protein MPV17 is a protein of unknown function that is associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depletion syndrome (MDS). MPV17 loss-of-function has been reported to result in tissue-specific nucleotide pool imbalances, which can occur in states of perturbed folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM), but MPV17 has not been directly linked to FOCM. FOCM is a metabolic network that provides one-carbon units for the de novo synthesis of purine and thymidylate nucleotides (e.g. dTMP) for both nuclear DNA (nuDNA) and mtDNA replication. In this study, we investigated the impact of reduced MPV17 expression on markers of impaired FOCM in HeLa cells. Depressed MPV17 expression reduced mitochondrial folate levels by 43% and increased uracil levels, a marker of impaired dTMP synthesis, in mtDNA by 3-fold. The capacity of mitochondrial de novo and salvage pathway dTMP biosynthesis was unchanged by the reduced MPV17 expression, but the elevated levels of uracil in mtDNA suggested that other sources of mitochondrial dTMP are compromised in MPV17-deficient cells. These results indicate that MPV17 provides a third dTMP source, potentially by serving as a transporter that transfers dTMP from the cytosol to mitochondria to sustain mtDNA synthesis. We propose that MPV17 loss-of-function and related hepatocerebral MDS are linked to impaired FOCM in mitochondria by providing insufficient access to cytosolic dTMP pools and by severely reducing mitochondrial folate pools."

However, fish diversity has rapidly declined in the Ganjiang River, especially migratory fish. In this study, 107 fish species (including 43 Chinese endemic species) were found in the middle and lower reaches of the Ganjiang River. However, only 91 fish species were found in the main channel of the Ganjiang River, which was lower than the 108 fish species historically found there. According to the Chinese Red List, 85 Least Concern, two Critically Endangered, three Vulnerable, one Near Threatened and 16 Data Deficient fish species were found in the Ganjiang River. In addition, the species number, diversity and CPUE in the channel were all greater than in the reservoir. The Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that the habitats of the Ganjiang River were divided into three areas. The analysis of RDA showed that turbidity, dissolved oxygen and water depth significantly affected fish distributions and assemblage composition. These results indicated that dam construction and other human activities have seriously destroyed the fish habitat and led to the decline in fish diversity. Therefore, the conservation of fish has become urgent in the Ganjiang River, and an integrated management plan should be developed and effectively implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2899028345,"Background The presence of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in nectar, honey, pollen, beebread and beeswax has been implicated in declines worldwide in the health of the western honey bee Apis mellifera. Certain phytochemicals, including quercetin and p-coumaric acid, are ubiquitous in the honey bee diet and are known to upregulate cytochrome P450 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify insecticides. Thus, the possibility exists that these dietary phytochemicals interact with ingested imidacloprid to ameliorate toxicity by enhancing its detoxification. Approach Quercetin and p-coumaric acid were incorporated in a phytochemical-free artificial diet individually and together along with imidacloprid at a range of field-realistic concentrations. In acute toxicity bioassays, honey bee 24- and 48- hour imidacloprid LC50 values were determined in the presence of the phytochemicals. Additionally, chronic toxicity bioassays were conducted using varying concentrations of imidacloprid in diets with the phytochemicals to test impacts of phytochemicals on longevity. Results In acute toxicity bioassays, the phytochemicals had no effect on imidacloprid LC50 values. In chronic toxicity longevity bioassays, phytochemicals enhanced honey bee survival at low imidacloprid concentrations (15 and 45 ppb) but had a negative effect at higher concentrations (105 ppb and 135 ppb). p-Coumaric acid alone increased honey bee longevity at concentrations of 15 and 45 ppb imidacloprid (hazard ratio (HR): 0.83 and 0.70, respectively). Quercetin alone and in combination with p-coumaric acid similarly enhanced longevity at 45 ppb imidacloprid (HR:0.81 and HR:0.77, respectively). However, p-coumaric acid in combination with 105 ppb imidacloprid and quercetin in combination with 135 ppb imidacloprid increased honey bee HR by approximately 30% (HR:1.33 and HR:1.30, respectively). Conclusions The biphasic concentration-dependent response of honey bees to imidacloprid in the presence of two ubiquitous dietary phytochemicals indicates that there are limits to the protective effects of the natural diet of honey bees against neonicotinoids based on their own inherent toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2898778770,"The bilingual executive advantage (BEA) hypothesis has attracted considerable research interest, but the findings are inconclusive. We addressed this issue in the domain of working memory (WM), as more complex WM tasks have been underrepresented in the previous literature. First, we compared early and late bilingual vs. monolingual WM performance. Second, we examined whether certain aspects of bilingual experience, such as language switching frequency, are related to bilinguals' WM scores. Our online sample included 485 participants. They filled in an extensive questionnaire including background factors such as bilingualism and second language (L2) use, and performed 10 isomorphic verbal and visuospatial WM tasks that yielded three WM composite scores (visuospatial WM, verbal WM, n-back). For verbal and visuospatial WM composites, the group comparisons did not support the BEA hypothesis. N-back analysis showed an advantage of late bilinguals over monolinguals and early bilinguals, while the latter two groups did not differ. This between-groups analysis was followed by a regression analysis relating features of bilingual experience to n-back performance, but the results were non-significant in both bilingual groups. In sum, group differences supporting the BEA hypothesis were limited only to the n-back composite, and this composite was not predicted by bilingualism-related features. Moreover, Bayesian analyses did not give consistent support for the BEA hypothesis. Possible reasons for the failure to find support for the BEA hypothesis are discussed."

Optimization algorithm of a model may be used to prospect the more favourable combination of selected factors resulting in the higher performance. This study was conducted to determine the combination of factors (pH, enzyme:substrate ratio, and reaction time) leading to highest bioavailability of proteins and carbohydrates in the gilthead seabream gastrointestinal tract. Besides, a novel multi-objective algorithm, desirability function, was introduced for optimization of the digestive hydrolysis of nutrients within the simulated gut of the species, using models based on the Response Surface Methodology. Design of experiment was defined based on the physiology and culture conditions of the species, and in vitro assays were performed in a two-phase (stomach ad intestine) digestion process, using the species-specific enzyme extract. According to results, intestinal phase of digestion makes the major contribution to the total protein hydrolysis, being the efficiency of the process directly correlated to all the three studied factors. In contrast, the efficiency of carbohydrate hydrolysis was directly correlated to the amount of substrate and inversely to the pH, while reaction time did not exert a significant effect. The physiological range of the factors studied in the assays favoured the hydrolysis of proteins over carbohydrates, a similar scenario to that observed in the live fish. Results from the mathematical models and their simultaneous optimization obtained from this work may have practical applications in design of feeds for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2898948458,"Mouthrot, caused by Tenacibaculum maritimum is a significant disease of farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar on the West Coast of North America. Smolts recently transferred into saltwater are the most susceptible and affected fish die with little internal or external clinical signs other than the characteristic small (usually < 5 mm) yellow plaques that are present inside the mouth. The mechanism by which these smolts die is unknown. This study investigated the microscopic pathology (histology and scanning electron microscopy) of bath infected smolts with Western Canadian T. maritimum isolates TmarCan15-1, TmarCan16-1 and TmarCan16-5 and compared the findings to what is seen in a natural outbreak of mouthrot. A real-time RT-PCR assay based on the outer membrane protein A specific for T. maritimum was designed and used to investigate the tissue tropism of the bacteria. The results from this showed that T. maritimum is detectable internally by real-time RT-PCR. This combined with the fact that the bacteria can be isolated from the kidney suggests that T. maritimum becomes systemic. The pathology in the infected smolts is primarily mouth lesions, including damaged tissues surrounding the teeth; the disease is similar to periodontal disease in mammals. The pathological changes are focal, severe, and occur very rapidly with little associated inflammation. Skin lesions are more common in experimentally infected smolts than in natural outbreaks, but this could be an artefact of the challenge dose, handling and tank used during the experiments."

Whether mitochondria could regulate the cytosolic ribosomes on the mitochondrial outer membrane, however, remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs have very different decay patterns from both endoplasmic reticulum–associated and –nonassociated cytosolic rRNAs and that mitochondrial IMS RNase T2 (RNASET2) selectively degrades the rRNAs. The RNase activity also has a positive effect on nuclear transcription of rRNAs and affects translation within mitochondria and that on the outer surface of mitochondrial outer membrane. These findings establish a mechanism for regulation of cytosolic ribosomes and co-regulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic translation programs by mitochondria. During our previous attempt to understand mtRNA degradation, we examined the total nucleic acids isolated from mitochondria. A few bands, including a mitochondrial DNA band, were observed after the samples were run on an agarose gel with ethidium bromide (EtBr) (Fig. 1A). Originally, we thought the two major RNA bands were 16S and 12S mitochondrial rRNAs. However, by comparing them to molecular markers and RNAs isolated from cytosol and purified ER, we realized that the two major RNA bands are 28S and 18S cytosolic rRNAs (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that a fraction of cytosolic ribosomes bind tightly to mitochondrial outer membrane and that some cytosolic mRNAs are also associated with mitochondria (19Williams C.C. Jan C.H. Weissman J.S. Targeting and plasticity of mitochondrial proteins revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling.Science. 2014; 346 (25378625): 748-75110.1126/science.1257522Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 20Crowley K.S.

We estimated that in equal cell volume the amount of rRNAs on mitochondria is approximately the same as that on ER and that in equal protein volume the amount of rRNAs on mitochondria is ∼30% of that on ER in HEK cells (Fig. 1A). Based on the number and the Western controls, it seems unlikely that the cytosolic rRNAs on purified mitochondria are from ER contamination. Next we examined how strong the binding between the cytosolic rRNAs and the mitochondria is. After 1 h of incubation in an isotonic buffer, very little dissociation of the rRNAs from mitochondrial outer membrane occurred (Fig. 1B). However, a decrease of the amount of the RNAs was observed. The rate of 28S rRNA decay appeared to be faster than that of 18S rRNA (Fig. 1B). In addition, the patterns of decay on isolated mitochondria were vastly different from those on ER. At pH 7.4, very little degradation occurred on ER after 1 h of incubation, whereas ∼50% of the 28S rRNA was degraded in the same period of time on mitochondria (Fig. 1C). At pH 6.5, however, degradation rate on ER increased dramatically but only slightly on mitochondria (Fig. 1C). The degradation patterns on mitochondria were also very different from those of the soluble cytosolic rRNAs with the rate of 28S rRNA on mitochondria much faster than that of the cytosolic 28S rRNA (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that mitochondria contain a distinct pool of cytosolic rRNAs that are degraded by a different mechanism from that of the ER rRNAs or the soluble rRNAs. To understand how cytosolic rRNAs are degraded on isolated mitochondria, we first examined whether there is a RNase activity on the outside of mitochondrial outer membrane. In vitro synthesized 28S rRNA fragment was incubated with isolated mitochondria in an isotonic buffer or a hypotonic buffer that ruptures the mitochondrial outer membrane. In the isotonic buffer, no degradation of the added 28S rRNA occurred, but in the hypotonic buffer, the added 28S rRNA was quickly degraded, indicating that there is no RNase activity on the outer surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 2A). Instead, a strong RNase activity resides in the mitochondrial IMS, consistent with the previous results (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The integrity of the outer membrane during 1 h of incubation in the isotonic buffer was also examined. No leakage of the soluble mitochondrial IMS protein DDP2 was observed at the end of the incubation (Fig. 2B). By contrast, majority of DDP2 was leaked out of mitochondria in the hypotonic buffer that ruptures the outer membrane but leaves the inner membrane intact (Fig. 2B). We still could not rule out the possibility that the small amount of IMS leaked during incubation is responsible for the decay of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs, so we isolated the mitochondrial IMS and added it into the in organello degradation mixture. Purified IMS readily degraded TRIzol purified rRNAs but had no significant effect on the decay of the mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs (Fig. 2, C and D). These results have three implications: first, the cytosolic rRNAs on the mitochondrial outer membrane are most likely in the ribosomes because they seem to be resistant to the exogenously added IMS; second, an active extraction of the rRNAs from the ribosomes should be involved in the in organello decay; and third, rRNAs on the outer surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane are degraded within mitochondria. Because the mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs are most likely in the ribosomes, we investigated whether stabilizing or destabilizing the ribosomes has any effect on the degradation of the rRNAs. Mg2+ is essential for ribosome stability and has been shown to be involved in regulation of RNase activities (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Nierhaus K.H.

A small amount of Mg2+ (2 mm) appeared to have only minor effect on 28S rRNA degradation but completely inhibited the degradation of 18S rRNA, whereas higher concentration of Mg2+ (20 mm) blocked both 18S and 28S rRNA degradation (Fig. 3A). qRT-PCR of the RNA samples isolated from mitochondria at different time points also show that in addition to 18S rRNA, other mitochondrion-associated RNAs were not degraded in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and that only 28S was selectively degraded under the condition (Fig. 3B). Adding metal ion chelator EDTA to the degradation buffer led to a faster degradation of 28S rRNA and other mitochondrion-associated RNAs (Fig. 3, C and D). In comparison, the effect of EDTA on rRNAs in isolated cytosol was much milder, which is another indication that the degradation of mitochondrion-associated RNAs is not due to contamination of a cytosolic RNase activity (Fig. 3E). The degradation of the mitochondrion-associated 28S rRNA was also inhibited by high ATP concentration and lower temperature, two conditions that have been shown to negatively affect certain RNase activities (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, F and G). It has been shown previously that the IMS RNASET2 is directly involved in degradation of mtRNA and processing of noncoding RNA imported from the cytosol into mitochondria (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Cheng Y.

The RNase RNASET2 is sensitive to multiple cellular conditions, such as pH, Mg2+, temperature, and ATP (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The characteristics of in organello degradation of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic RNAs show a striking resemblance to those of mtRNAs degradation and the RNase RNASET2 (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine whether mitochondrion-localized RNASET2 is involved in degradation of the mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs, cell lines were constructed with RNASET2 overexpressed or knocked down. Mitochondria were isolated and in organello degradation was performed. On RNASET2-overexpressing mitochondria, the 28S rRNA level was much lower, making it difficult to compare the degradation rate directly, but the degradation of 18S rRNA was clearly faster on the RNASET2-overexpressing mitochondria (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutations (H65Y and H118Y) that result in a catalytically inactive form of RNASET2 (29Campomenosi P. Salis S. Lindqvist C. Mariani D. Nordström T. Acquati F. Taramelli R. Characterization of RNASET2, the first human member of the Rh/T2/S family of glycoproteins.Arch. Biochem.

Knockdown of RNASET2 led to slower degradation of the mitochondrion-associated 18S and 28S rRNAs (Fig. 4, E and F). Because RNASET2 is a protein with multiple subcellular localizations, the effects of overexpression and knockdown could be indirect (9Liu P. Huang J. Zheng Q. Xie L. Lu X. Jin J. Wang G. Mammalian mitochondrial RNAs are degraded in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by RNASET2.Protein Cell. 2017; 8 (28730546): 735-74910.1007/s13238-017-0448-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Acquati F.

To rule out the possibility, we fused RNASET2 without the N-terminal 24 amino acids to the targeting sequence of cytochrome C1 that targeted the protein to the IMS and expressed the fusion protein (C1ΔNT2) in HEK cells (Fig. 4, G–I). Subcellular fractionation showed that C1ΔNT2 is localized in mitochondria (Fig. 4, H and I). Expression of the C1ΔNT2 had a similar but milder effect on degradation of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs as overexpression of RNASET2. The milder effect is likely due to the much lower expression level of the fusion protein compared with that of the WT RNASET2 (Fig. 4G). To examine whether the in organello findings are relevant in vivo, the levels of nuclear transcription, cytosolic rRNA, and mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs were examined. In vivo, the level of an RNA is the result of a fine balance among synthesis, transport, and degradation. To examine whether manipulation of RNASET2 level has an effect on nuclear rRNA transcription, in vivo RNA synthesis was performed using live cells and biotin RNA labeling mix (Roche). Two major biotin-labeled rRNA bands were observed. Remarkably, RNASET2 overexpression led to a 2-fold up-regulation of nuclear rRNA synthesis (Fig. 5A). The level of mitochondrial 28S rRNA in the RNASET2-overexpressing cells was approximately one-third of that in the control HEK cells, even though the cytosolic levels were approximately the same (Fig. 5B). A faster synthesis rate and similar cytosolic level combined with a lower mitochondrial 28S level in vivo suggests a faster degradation, consistent with the in organello degradation results. Knockdown of RNASET2 also had a dramatic effect on nuclear transcription, with the transcription rate dropping to approximately one-third of that in the control cells (Fig. 5C). Only a small increase of mitochondrial 28S rRNA level was observed, mostly likely because of the strong feedback down-regulation of nuclear RNA synthesis (Fig. 5D). However, a slightly higher mitochondrial 28S rRNA level combined with a significantly lower synthesis rate also suggests a slower degradation in vivo in the RNASET2 knockdown cells. Expression of the mitochondrion-targeted fusion protein C1ΔNT2 had a similar effect on nuclear transcription and on the level of the mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs as RNASET2 overexpression (Fig. 5, E and F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that mitochondrial RNASET2 regulates not only the mitochondrion-associated cytosolic ribosomes but also nuclear transcription possibly through a compensatory feedback. To understand substrate delivery in degradation of mitochondrion-associated cytosolic rRNAs, the existing mitochondrial RNA import pathway was examined. Mammalian PNPASE has been shown to be a major component of the pathway (2Wang G. Chen H.W. Oktay Y. Zhang J. Allen E.L. Smith G.M. Fan K.C. Hong J.S. French S.W. McCaffery J.M. Lightowlers R.N. Morse 3rd, H.C. Koehler C.M. Teitell M.A. PNPASE regulates RNA import into mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142 (20691904): 456-46710.1016/j.cell.2010.06.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PNPASE in HEK cells led to an acceleration of cytosolic rRNA degradation in the isolated mitochondria without affecting RNASET2 protein level, whereas knockdown of the protein in an immortalized mouse cell line TM6 decreased the degradation rate (Fig. 6, A–D). Another known component of mitochondrial RNA import pathway is voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the mitochondrial outer membrane (31Salinas T. Duchêne A.M. Delage L. Nilsson S. Glaser E. Zaepfel M. Maréchal-Drouard L. The voltage-dependent anion channel, a major component of the tRNA import machinery in plant mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Overexpression of VDAC1 in HEK cells led to a decrease of the cytosolic rRNA level on the mitochondrial outer membrane without affecting RNASET2 protein level, suggesting a faster degradation rate (Fig. 6, E and F). When a negatively charged His tag was added to the C terminus of VDAC1, the fusion protein inhibited the degradation of cytosolic rRNA in the mitochondria, suggesting that electrostatic interaction between RNA and VDAC plays an important role in cytosolic rRNA import and degradation (Fig. 6, E and G). Mitochondrial proteins are encoded in both mitochondrial genome and nuclear genome. The expressions of these two pools of mitochondrial genes are co-regulated and synchronized (14Couvillion M.T. Soto I.C. Shipkovenska G. Churchman L.S.

It has been shown that most inner membrane proteins are translated on the outer membrane (19Williams C.C. Jan C.H. Weissman J.S.

To understand the biological function of cytosolic rRNA degradation by mitochondrial RNASET2, translation programs within mitochondria and on the mitochondrial outer membrane were examined using 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine in the presence of emetine or pentamidine, which enables observation of mitochondrial translation or cytosolic translation separately.

https://openalex.org/W2899041106,"Obesity, a principal risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and hypertension, is a growing and serious health problem all over the world. Leptin is a weight-reducing hormone produced by adipose tissue, which decreases food intake via hypothalamic leptin receptors (Ob-Rb) and the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates leptin signaling by dephosphorylating JAK2, and the increased activity of PTP1B is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity. Hence, inhibition of PTP1B may help prevent and reduce obesity. In this study, we revealed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate in certain cruciferous vegetables, potently inhibits recombinant PTP1B by binding to the reactive cysteinyl thiol. Moreover, we found that PEITC causes the ligand-independent phosphorylation of Ob-Rb, JAK2, and STAT3 by inhibiting cellular PTP1B in differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. PEITC treatment also induced nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3, resulting in enhanced anorexigenic POMC expression and suppressed orexigenic NPY/AGRP expression. We demonstrated that oral administration of PEITC to mice significantly reduces food intake, and stimulates hypothalamic leptin signaling. Our results suggest that PEITC might help prevent and improve obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2899208451,"Given GDF5 involvement in hip development, and osteoarthritis (OA) and developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) risk, here we sought to assess the role(s) of GDF5 and its regulatory sequence on the development of hip morphology linked to injury risk. The brachypodism (bp) mouse, which harbors a Gdf5 inactivating mutation, was used to survey how Gdf5 loss of function impacts the development of hip morphology. Two transgenic Gdf5 reporter BAC lines were used to assess the spatiotemporal expression of Gdf5 regulatory sequences. Each BAC line was also used to assess the functional roles of upstream and downstream sequence on hip morphology. bp/bp mice had shorter femora with smaller femoral heads and necks as well as larger alpha angles, smaller anterior offsets, and smaller acetabula, compared to bp/+ mice (p<0.04). Regulatory sequences downstream of Gdf5 drove strong prenatal (E17) expression and low postnatal (6 months) expression across regions of femoral head and acetabulum. Conversely, upstream regulatory sequences drove very low expression at E17 and no detectable expression at 6 months. Importantly, downstream, but not upstream Gdf5 regulatory sequences fully restored all the key morphologic features disrupted in bp/bp mice. Hip morphology is profoundly affected by Gdf5 absence, and downstream regulatory sequences mediate its effects by controlling Gdf5 expression during development. This downstream region contains numerous enhancers harboring risk variants related to hip OA, DDH, and dislocation. We posit that subtle alterations to morphology driven by changes in downstream regulatory sequence underlie this locus' role in hip injury risk."
https://openalex.org/W2899258948,"The associations of Cesarean delivery with offspring metabolic and immune-mediated diseases are believed to derive from lack of mother-to-newborn transmission of specific microbes at birth. Bifidobacterium spp., in particular, has been hypothesized to play a health-promoting role, yet little is known about how delivery mode modifies colonization of the newborn by this group of microbes. The aim of this research was to examine the presence of Bifidobacterium in meconium and in the transitional stool, and to assess cytokine levels and hematological parameters in the venous cord blood of infants born by elective, pre-labor Cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery in Southern Brazil. We recruited 89 mother-newborn pairs (23 vaginal delivery and 66 elective cesarean delivery), obtained demographic information from a structured questionnaire and clinical information from medical records. We obtained umbilical cord venous blood and meconium samples following delivery and the transitional stool (the first defecation after meconium) before discharge. We determined plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-10, IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-5, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-8 in the cord blood, and presence of stool Bifidobacterium by real time PCR. Compared to vaginally-delivered neonates, Cesarean-delivered neonates had a lower leukocyte count (p = 0.037), lower hemoglobin (p = 0.04), and lower levels of the cytokine GM-CSF (p = 0.009) in the cord blood. Moreover, Bifidobacterium was detected less often in the transitional stool of Cesarean-delivered neonates compared to vaginally-delivered neonates (p = 0.001). The results indicate that pre-labor Cesarean birth may be associated with microbial and hematological alterations in the neonate. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined in larger prospective birth cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W2899335021,"Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) cross-talk have been involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process during carcinogenesis. Since EMT also contributes to maladaptive repair and parenchymal damage during renal fibrosis, we became encouraged to explore the role of NCAM/FGFR1 signaling as initiating or driving forces of EMT program in cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). TECs stimulated with TGF-β1 (10ng/mL) was used as an established in vitro EMT model. TGF-β1 downstream effectors were detected in vitro, as well as in 50 biopsies of different human kidney diseases to explore their in vivo correlation. NCAM/FGFR1 signaling and its modulation by FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 (100nM) were analyzed by light microscopy, immunolabeling, qRT-PCR and scratch assays. Morphological changes associated with EMT appeared 48h after TGF-ß1 treatment and was clearly apparent after 72 hours, followed by loss of CDH1 (encoding E-Cadherin) and transcriptional induction of SNAI1 (SNAIL), SNAI2 (SLUG), TWIST1, MMP2, MMP9, CDH2 (N-Cadherin), ITGA5 (integrin-α5), ITGB1 (integrin-β1), ACTA2 (α-SMA) and S100A4 (FSP1). Moreover, at the early stage of EMT program (24 hours upon TGF-β1 exposure), transcriptional induction of several NCAM isoforms along with FGFR1 was observed, implicating a mechanistic link between NCAM/FGFR1 signaling and induction of EMT. These assumptions were further supported by the inhibition of the EMT program after specific blocking of FGFR1 signaling by PD173074. Finally, there was evidence for an in vivo TGF-β1 pathway activation in diseased human kidneys and correlation with impaired renal excretory functions. Collectively, NCAM/FGFR1 signaling appears to be involved in the initial phase of TGF-ß1 initiated EMT which can be effectively suppressed by application of FGFR inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2899170692,"Urate is often viewed as an antioxidant. Here, we present an alternative perspective by showing that, when oxidized, urate propagates oxidative stress.

We investigated whether urate-derived electrophiles are intercepted by nucleophilic amino acid residues to form stable adducts on proteins. When urate was oxidized in the presence of various peptides and proteins, two adducts derived from urate (Mr 167 Da) were detected and had mass additions of 140 and 166 Da, occurring mainly on lysine residues and N-terminal amines. The adduct with a 140-Da mass addition was detected more frequently and was stable. Dehydrourate (Mr 166 Da) also formed transient adducts with cysteine residues. Urate-derived adducts were detected on human serum albumin in plasma of healthy donors. Basal adduct levels increased when neutrophils were added to plasma and stimulated, and relied on the NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide. Adducts of oxidized urate on serum albumin were elevated in plasma and synovial fluid from individuals with gout and rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that rather than acting as an antioxidant, urate's conversion to electrophiles contributes to oxidative stress. The addition of urate-derived electrophiles to nucleophilic amino acid residues, a process we call oxidative uratylation, will leave a footprint on proteins that could alter their function when critical sites are modified."

The length of the interval remains a global problem, and in EU countries these figures vary between 160 and 325 min. Methods and results The aim of our research was to assess the benefit of the systematic implementation of the new smartphone-based communication technology “STEMI” enabling immediate ECG picture and voice consultation between an EMS crew in the field and a cardiologist in the PCI-center. The transfer of ECG was associated with 92% technical success. 5 Monthly data from 2016 were compared from the reference2 monthly data set in 2015 when the data in the same area was collected in the SLOVAKS registry. The 5-months data from 2016 were compared to the reference group from 2015, when similar 2-months data in the same area in SLOVAKS registry was collected but communication technology “STEMI” technology was not used. In the monitored period in 2016 we recorded a significant decrease in unwanted secondary STEMI transportations (34.32% vs. 12.9%, p<0.001) and a significant reduction in the total ischemic interval (241 min vs. 181 min, p = 0.03). There was no significant decrease in the subinterval of “admission-pPCI” (28min vs. 23 min, p = 0.144). Conclusion The systematic use of smartphone-based communication technology ”STEMI” enabling remote ECG picture consultation between an EMS crew and a cardiologist in PCI-center had a positive impact on the quality of care for patients with acute STEMI and brought clinical practice closer to the current ESC Guidelines. It significantly decreased the ratio of unwanted secondary transportations and led to a significant reduction in the total ischemic interval."
https://openalex.org/W2899142419,"Although modern methods of whole genome DNA methylation analysis have a wide range of applications, they are not suitable for clinical diagnostics due to their high cost and complexity and due to the large amount of sample DNA required for the analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to identify a relatively small number of methylation sites that provide high precision and sensitivity for the diagnosis of pathological states. We propose an algorithm for constructing limited subsamples from high-dimensional data to form diagnostic panels. We have developed a tool that utilizes different methods of selection to find an optimal, minimum necessary combination of factors using cross-entropy loss metrics (LogLoss) to identify a subset of methylation sites. We show that the algorithm can work effectively with different genome methylation patterns using ensemble-based machine learning methods. Algorithm efficiency, precision and robustness were evaluated using five genome-wide DNA methylation datasets (totaling 626 samples), and each dataset was classified into tumor and non-tumor samples. The algorithm produced an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99, 9 sites) for prostate adenocarcinoma and an AUC of 1.0 (from 2 to 6 sites) for urothelial bladder carcinoma, two types of kidney carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma. For prostate adenocarcinoma we showed that identified differential variability methylation patterns distinguish cluster of samples with higher recurrence rate (hazard ratio for recurrence = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.05-0.92; log-rank test, p-value < 0.03). We also identified several clusters of correlated interchangeable methylation sites that can be used for the elaboration of biological interpretation of the resulting models and for further selection of the sites most suitable for designing diagnostic panels. LogLoss-BERAF is implemented as a standalone python code and open-source code is freely available from https://github.com/bioinformatics-IBCH/logloss-beraf along with the models described in this article."
https://openalex.org/W2949315604,"Pathological calcium-containing crystals accumulating in the joints, synovial fluid, and soft tissues are noted in most elderly patients, yet arthritic crystal formation remains idiopathic. Interestingly, elevated lactic acid and bone erosion are frequently among the comorbidities and clinical features of patients with highest incidence of crystal arthropathies. This work shows that bone particulates (modeling bone erosion) dissolve in lactic acid and directly generate crystals, possibly presenting a mechanism for crystal accumulation in osteoarthritis.Micronized human bone (average particle size of 160 μm x 79 μm) completely dissolved in lactic acid in 48 hours, and in synovial fluid with 500 mMol lactic acid in 5 days, generating birefringent rhomboid and rod-shaped crystals. SEM analysis with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy of these crystals showed average dimensions of around 2 μm x 40 μm, which contained oxygen, calcium and phosphorous at 8.64:1.85:1. Raman spectroscopy of the generated crystals further showed 910/cm and 1049/cm peaks, aligning with calcium oxalate monohydrate and calcium pyrophosphate, respectively.This work shows that lactic acid and micronized mineralized bone together directly generate calcium-containing crystals. These observations may provide insights into the elusive etiology of arthritis with crystal involvement, possibly indicating lactic acid as a clinical target for treatment."

The world we interact with is dominated by intertwined materials known as composites. Unlike in metal alloys or polymer blends, where the atoms or molecules are intimately mixed, components of a composite material retain their individual identities, and their careful selection and combination maximizes certain sets of properties. Here, too, another facet of composite materials emerges—they typically have stronger and weaker directions (i.e., asymmetric properties), as they are designed to fulfill the needs of specific applications.

The benefits of combining materials are easily learned from nature. Natural composites such as nacre, wood, and teeth have impressive properties arising from their hierarchical structures, especially as they are generated from easily obtained starting materials that often have limited capabilities. Though scientists have long studied mechanically tough natural composites, recent research has shown that biological sponges transform materials as simple as silica into components that are both tough and exceptionally efficient at manipulating light. Further, natural materials, many of which end up as waste in the process of harvesting food, may have properties that can compete with those of synthetic materials and have the advantage of originating from renewable resources.

Carbon-based composites such as those fabricated from carbon fiber offer the unique combination of high strength and low density. Replacing carbon fiber with graphene or carbon nanotubes opens a wide range of new properties for optimization. The potential to develop composites with exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties provides great incentive to overcome processing hurdles to efficient production scale-up.

In all good composites, the whole is better than the sum of the parts. The same may be true of research on composites, as looking beyond one's traditional sources of materials may lead to better composite materials.

https://openalex.org/W2898780975,"This fall, the U.S. Geological Survey released ShakeAlert, its earthquake early warning system for the West Coast. If all goes as planned, a dense network of seismometers in California, Oregon, and Washington will detect the first, weak waves of an earthquake and relay a rapid warning of ground shaking to come. To start, those warnings will go to first responders, power companies, and transit agencies. In the next couple of years, alerts could roll out to the public to provide at least a few seconds of warning. But the process of developing this system also led to a humbling of scientific ambitions. The scientists developing ShakeAlert once promised it could warn of strong, violent shaking from a distant earthquake far in advance, thanks to a belief that the first few seconds of an earthquake could predict its final magnitude. Reality has intruded: Faults fracture in complex, unpredictable ways. The current incarnation of ShakeAlert might offer 10 seconds of warning for a severe event—if you9re lucky. Even that is a victory."
https://openalex.org/W2899222523,"Background Peritumoral inflammation—a response mainly involving polimorphonuclear neutrophils—has traditionally been thought protumoral in its effects. In recent years, however, a number of studies have indicated that it may play an important antitumoral role. This discrepancy has been difficult to explain. Methods and findings This work describes a tool for simulating tumor growth that obeys the universal model of tumor growth dynamics, and shows through its use that low intensity peritumoral inflammation exerts a protumoral effect, while high intensity inflammation exerts a potent antitumoral effect. Indeed, the simulation results obtained indicate that a sufficiently strong antitumoral effect can reverse tumor growth, as has been suggested several times in the clinical literature. Conclusions The present result indicate that an ‘immunological threshold’ must exist, marking the boundary between states in which peritumoral inflammation is either harmful or beneficial. These findings lend support to the idea that stimulating intense peritumoral inflammation could be used as a treatment against solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2899481878,"When I was hired as an assistant professor in 1969, mandatory retirement at age 65 was the law of the land for tenured faculty members. I was 26 years old at the time, so that seemed impossibly far away. But by the time I was 50, two amendments to federal law had removed all age limits. I could stay in my tenured position forever! That's how, in 2011, I found myself still an active professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge at age 68. I might still be in my tenured job today, if not for a meeting that year with the official who administered my federal research funding.

> “Professors older than 65 were blocking the way of many young scholars.” 

The official asked me to investigate how eliminating mandatory retirement had affected the availability of positions for new assistant professors. The question struck me as important but not personally relevant—until my colleagues and I got our results.

Our initial intuition was that there would be no substantial long-term effect. We expected to find that the number of open positions dipped just after the law's two changes. After all, the number of available tenure-track faculty slots is essentially fixed—at MIT, there are approximately 1000. To create room for a new faculty member, an existing one has to leave. But after a brief dip, we thought, retirements should return to normal, creating room for new recruits.

One word for such intuition: wrong! Through modeling, we discovered that eliminating the retirement age had reduced the number of new slots for MIT assistant professors by 19%, from 57 to 46 per year. Put simply, without a mandatory retirement age, senior faculty members are much slower to leave. When our paper was published, I viewed it as just another finding. But eventually, I had serious reflections about what the results really meant.

Around that time, I had hired a postdoc named Navid Ghaffarzadegan. He was a superlative young scholar. Yet he worried that, like many postdocs, he might not be able to get the tenure-track position he sought. There are simply too many applicants seeking too few positions. And I began to realize that I and other professors older than 65 were blocking the way of many young scholars who seek academic careers. I started to wonder whether it was time for me to step aside, but the idea of leaving the job I had been tied to for so long was hard to swallow. (In the meantime, Navid secured that tenure-track position and is now an associate professor with tenure.)

Then, the dean of the engineering school heard about our paper and asked me to go over the details with him. It must have resonated with him, because he briefed the department heads about the need for a flexible after-tenure option that would vacate a position and open the way for a new hire. They soon invented “professor, post-tenure,” tossing out an earlier option with the horrendous name “professor without tenure, retired,” or PWOTR, pronounced “pee-water.”

Once “professor, post-tenure” was announced in 2016, I found it increasingly attractive. It wasn't the same as “emeritus”—not full retirement. I could retain my office, teach and supervise students, and be a principal investigator on research grants—all with great flexibility. I would get to choose which projects I wanted to do and be paid accordingly, up to 49% of my previous salary. I could also access retirement and pension funds. My wife and I would be able to spend more time together and with our children and grandchildren. Decision made!

I submitted my tenure resignation in 2017. I've enjoyed every minute since, busy as ever but only on activities I select—such as MIT BLOSSOMS, a project I co-founded to create interactive video lessons for high school math and science classes. I feel lucky to have this option. Too few institutions offer these types of transitional positions to ease the challenge for us senior professors. At 74, I in essence removed 9 years from someone else's career. I should have stepped aside sooner.
