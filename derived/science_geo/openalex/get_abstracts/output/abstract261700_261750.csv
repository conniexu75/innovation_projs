The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 is degraded by autophagy. It is found in cellular inclusion bodies together with polyubiquitinated proteins and in cytosolic protein aggregates that accumulate in various chronic, toxic, and degenerative diseases. Here we show for the first time a direct interaction between p62 and the autophagic effector proteins LC3A and -B and the related γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein and γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated-like proteins. The binding is mediated by a 22-residue sequence of p62 containing an evolutionarily conserved motif. To monitor the autophagic sequestration of p62- and LC3-positive bodies, we developed a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent tag consisting of a tandem fusion of the red, acid-insensitive mCherry and the acid-sensitive green fluorescent proteins. This approach revealed that p62- and LC3-positive bodies are degraded in autolysosomes. Strikingly, even rather large p62-positive inclusion bodies (2 μm diameter) become degraded by autophagy. The specific interaction between p62 and LC3, requiring the motif we have mapped, is instrumental in mediating autophagic degradation of the p62-positive bodies. We also demonstrate that the previously reported aggresome-like induced structures containing ubiquitinated proteins in cytosolic bodies are dependent on p62 for their formation. In fact, p62 bodies and these structures are indistinguishable. Taken together, our results clearly suggest that p62 is required both for the formation and the degradation of polyubiquitin-containing bodies by autophagy.

All eukaryotic cells use the following two systems for protein degradation: the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosome. The proteasome is used for selective degradation of short lived and abnormal/misfolded proteins following labeling with Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains (1Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The lysosome degrades extracellular and plasma membrane proteins brought there by endocytosis and cytoplasmic components delivered by autophagy. Various categories of autophagy have been defined differing in the delivery route of cytoplasmic material. These include macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy), microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (2Cuervo A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 3Klionsky D.J. J.

Macroautophagy is regarded as the main pathway. This process involves the sequestration of a region of the cytoplasm within a double or multiple membrane-bounded autophagosome. Autophagosomes then undergo a maturation process, including fusion events with endosomes and/or lysosomes forming structures called amphisomes and autolysosomes, respectively (3Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 4Yoshimori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5Eskelinen E.L. Autophagy. 2005; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Autophagy is thought to be mainly a nonselective, bulk degradation pathway responsible for degradation of the majority of long lived proteins and some organelles. Two evolutionarily conserved protein conjugation systems are necessary for the formation of the autophagosome, the Atg12-Atg5- and the Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation systems (6Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The best characterized mammalian Atg8 homologue is light chain 3 (LC3). 3The abbreviations used are: LC3, light chain 3; ALIS, aggresome-like induced structures; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; mCherry, monomeric red fluorescent protein; GABARAP, γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; LIR, LC3-interacting region; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MEF, murine embryo fibroblasts; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody. 3The abbreviations used are: LC3, light chain 3; ALIS, aggresome-like induced structures; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; mCherry, monomeric red fluorescent protein; GABARAP, γ-aminobutyrate receptor-associated protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; LIR, LC3-interacting region; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; MEF, murine embryo fibroblasts; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody. After synthesis pro-LC3 is cleaved by Atg4B to expose a C-terminal glycine residue (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J.

Conjugation of phosphatidylethanolamine to the C terminus of LC3-I defines the LC3-II form that is tightly associated with the autophagosomal membrane (7Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A.

The LC3-II form is involved during the late steps of autophagy after the isolation membrane has formed (3Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In humans, three LC3 isoforms (LC3A, -B, and -C) and four additional human Atg8 homologues have been identified (GABARAP, GEC1/GABARAPL1, GATE16/GABARAPL2, and GABARAPL3) (10He H. Dang Y. Dai F.

Chen Z. Zheng L. Fu Q. Jiang J. Zhang P. Gong R. Zhao S. Genomics. 2001; 74: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The role(s) of the GABARAP isoforms in autophagy is not known.A number of studies have identified autophagy as a crucial cellular process to avoid accumulation of abnormal proteins in different neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in Ref. 12Nixon R.A. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mice carrying neuron-specific knock-outs of Atg5 or Atg7 display intracellular accumulation of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates in the neural cells and show clear symptoms of progressive neurodegeneration (13Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). By generating mice with a conditional liver-specific knock-out of Atg7, it was also demonstrated that loss of autophagy causes liver dysfunction accompanied by intracellular accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates (15Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). These results suggest that it is the basal constitutive autophagy that is needed in order to avoid accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates (13Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 14Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S.

Autophagy. 2006; 2: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Recently, the term ALIS (aggresome-like induced structures) was used to describe ubiquitin-containing bodies induced in response to various stressors, including amino acid starvation, oxidative stress, and puromycin (17Szeto J. Kaniuk N.A. Canadien V. Nisman R. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Bazett-Jones D.P. Brumell J.H. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). ALIS refers to DALIS (dendritic cell aggresome-like induced structures) originally described in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated dendritic cells as storage compartments for polyubiquitinated proteins prior to their degradation (18Lelouard H. Gatti E. Cappello F. Gresser O. Camosseto V. Pierre P. Nature. 2002; 417: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). ALIS or DALIS are inclusion bodies where newly synthesized ubiquitinated proteins transiently accumulate, many of which are defective ribosomal products (17Szeto J. Kaniuk N.A. Canadien V. Nisman R. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Bazett-Jones D.P. Brumell J.H. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Lelouard H. Gatti E. Cappello F. Gresser O. Camosseto V. Pierre P.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, also long lived proteins are targeted to ALIS (17Szeto J. Kaniuk N.A. Canadien V. Nisman R. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Bazett-Jones D.P. Brumell J.H. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Puromycin increases the formation of defective ribosomal products and is an efficient inducer of ALIS. ALIS are distinct from aggresomes that are aggregates that form at the pericentriolar area by microtubule-dependent conglomeration of smaller aggregates (20Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar).The p62 protein, also called sequestosome 1(SQSTM1), is commonly found in inclusion bodies containing polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. In neurodegenerative diseases p62 is detected in ubiquitinated protein aggregates, including Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease, and Huntingtin aggregates in Huntington disease (21Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Kuusisto E. Salminen A. Alafuzoff I. Neuropathol. Appl.

Pathol. 2002; 160: 255-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In protein aggregate diseases of the liver, large amounts of p62 are found in Mallory bodies of alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hyaline bodies in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in α1-antitrypsin aggregates (24Zatloukal K. Stumptner C. Fuchsbichler A. Heid H. Schnoelzer M. Kenner L. Kleinert R. Prinz M. Aguzzi A. Denk H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 255-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The p62 protein is able to polymerize via the N-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain (25Lamark T.

A short 22-amino acid region located N-terminally to the UBA domain in p62 was found to be required for this interaction. We developed a novel, pH-sensitive, fluorescent tandem tag, which we use to show that this interaction is necessary for autophagic degradation of p62-positive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing ubiquitinated proteins. We also demonstrate that ALIS are indistinguishable from p62 inclusion bodies and that p62 is required for their formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-p62 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-p62 C-terminal guinea pig polyclonal antibody (Progen Biotechnik); FK2 monoclonal antibody to mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins (Biomol International); anti-GFP antibody (Ab290, Abcam Ltd.); anti-GFP IRDye800-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals); anti-LC3 monoclonal antibody (NanoTools Antikorpertechnik); anti-actin and anti-LAMP1 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and antirabbit polyclonal antibody (Pharmingen). The following fluorescent secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse IgG; AlexaFluor 488, AlexaFluor 568, and AlexaFluor 680; goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 488; and goat anti-guinea pig AlexaFluor 568 and AlexaFluor 633 (all from Invitrogen). LysoTracker Green and Red and AlexaFluor 647 dextran (Mr 10,000) were obtained from Invitrogen. Bafilomycin A1 and puromycin were purchased from Sigma. Redivue Pro-mix [35S]methionine was obtained from GE Healthcare.Plasmids—Plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. Details on their construction are available upon request. Point mutants were made using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Gateway LR recombination reactions were done as described in the Gateway cloning technology instruction manual (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis, PCR, and DNA sequencing reactions were obtained from Operon. All plasmid constructs were verified by restriction digestion and/or DNA sequencing (BigDye; Applied Biosystems).TABLE 1Plasmids used in this study Open table in a new tab Cell Transfections—Subconfluent HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (a generous gift from Noboru Mishizuma) were transfected using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). The p62 siRNA SMARTpool oligonucleotide mixture (catalogue number M-010230-00, Dharmacon) or nontargeting siRNAs controls (catalogue number 4635, Ambion; and catalogue number D-001210, Dharmacon) were routinely transfected twice with a 24-h interval at a 20 nm final concentration using Lipofectamine 2000. The specific human p62 siRNA oligonucleotide sequence from the SMARTpool, 5′-GCATTGAAGTTGATATCGAT-3′, was used for most experiments (see supplemental Fig. 1).Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblots—For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed 24 or 48 h after transfection in HA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) with phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (Calbiochem) and Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (29Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Øvervatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 the membrane was stained with Ponceau S, destained, and developed with anti-p62 (BD Transduction Laboratories) followed by AlexaFluor 680-conjugated antimouse (Invitrogen) and IRDye800-conjugated anti-GFP (Rockland Immunochemicals) antibodies. The membrane was imaged on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).Mass Spectrometry—Gel bands were excised and subjected to in-gel reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion using 2–10 ng/μl trypsin (V511A, Promega) (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Peptide mixtures containing 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto a nanoAcquity™ Ultra Performance LC (Waters), containing a 3-μm Symmetry® C18 Trap column (180 μm × 22 mm) (Waters) in front of a3-μm Atlantis™ C18 analytical column (100 μm × 100 mm) (Waters). Peptides were separated with a gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, with a flow of 0.4 μl/min eluted to a Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters) and subjected to data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Peak lists were generated by the ProteinLynx Global server software (version 2.1). The resulting pkl files were searched against the Swiss-Prot 51.6 protein sequence data bases using an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Sciences, London UK). Peptide mass tolerances used in the search were 50 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was 0.1 Da.GST- and MBP Pulldown Assays—All GST- and His6-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). His6 fusion proteins were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen) and eluted with 0.2 m imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. MBP fusion proteins were purified on amylose resin (New England Biolabs). 35S-Labeled GFP-tagged proteins were co-transcribed/translated in vitro using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). For GST pulldowns with His6-tagged p62 constructs, 2–4 μg of GST-LC3B was incubated with 0.3–0.5 μg of His6-tagged proteins in 800 μl of NETN-E buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with 1 ml of NETN-E buffer. For GST pulldowns with 35S-labeled GFP-tagged proteins in vitro, translation reaction products from 0.5 μg of plasmid were incubated with 1–2 μg of GST-LC3 or LC3 homologues in 300 μl of NETN-E buffer for 1 h at 4°C, washed six times with 1 ml of NETN-E buffer, boiled with 2× SDS gel loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For GST-pulldowns with 35S-labeled proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and vacuum-dried. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected on a Fujifilm bioimaging analyzer BAS-5000 (Fuji). For GST pulldowns with His6-tagged protein, SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by staining with Ponceau S or immunoblotting with anti-p62 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). For MBP pulldowns, 1 μg of MBP or MBP-p62 proteins bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) were mixed with 1 μg of GST-LC3B in 200 μl of NETN-E buffer, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, washed six times with 1 ml of NETN-E buffer, boiled with 15 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with Ponceau S, followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody.Confocal Microscopy Analyses—The cell cultures were directly examined under the microscope or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained as described previously (25Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Øvervatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Live cells were placed in Hanks’ medium with or without amino acids and serum at 37 °C and imaged for up to 1 h. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a ×40, 1.2W C-Apochroma objective, equipped with an LSM510-META confocal module using the LSM 5 software version 3.2 (Carl Zeiss Inc.), or a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, 60×, 1.2W objective, equipped with incubation chamber with CO2 and temperature control. Images were processed using Canvas version 9 (ACD Systems).Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed and embedded as described previously (31Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Small blocks were cut and infused with 2.3 m sucrose for 1 h, mounted on silver pins, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were cut at -110 °C on a Leica Ultracut and collected with a 1:1 mixture of 2% methyl cellulose and 2.3 m sucrose. Sections were transferred to Formvar/carbon-coated grids and labeled with primary antibodies followed by protein A-gold conjugates essentially as described (32Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). After embedding in 2% methyl cellulose, 0.4% uranyl acetate, we observed sections at 60–80 kV in a JEOL 1230 electron microscope. Micrographs were recorded with a Morada digital camera using iTEM (SIS) software. Further image processing was performed using Adobe Photoshop software.RESULTSp62/SQSTM1 Binds Directly to LC3—We have shown previously that both endogenous and overexpressed p62 co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-LC3 from HeLa cell extracts (29Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Øvervatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). However, it is not established if this is because of an indirect or direct protein-protein interaction. It is also not known whether p62 is a major interaction partner for LC3 or not. To begin evaluating the significance of this interaction, we immunoprecipitated GFP-LC3B or GFP from HeLa cells and detected co-immunoprecipitated proteins by staining the membrane with Ponceau S after gel electrophoresis and blotting (Fig. 1A, left panel). Two bands co-purified specifically with GFP-LC3B as follows: a major 60-kDa band and another larger than the 175-kDa band. The p62 protein was identified in the 60-kDa protein band using a p62 antibody (Fig. 1A, right panel). To evaluate if the Ponceau S-stained 60-kDa protein band could be a mixture of several proteins, we immunoprecipitated triple FLAG-tagged LC3B, Coomassie-stained the gel after electrophoresis, and excised the 60-kDa band. The gel piece was trypsinized, and eluted peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the only cellularly derived protein identified in the 60-kDa protein band was p62 (supplemental Fig. 1). To identify the >175-kDa protein, we passed HeLa cell extract over a GST-LC3B column. Bound proteins were eluted and separated by electrophoresis, and the >175-kDa protein band was cut out of the gel and identified as MAP-1B (supplemental Fig. 1). This approach also identified p62 as the major endogenous LC3B-binding protein in the HeLa cell extract. To test whether there is a direct or indirect association between p62 and LC3, we performed pulldown assays with recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli (Fig. 1, B–D). We found a strong binding between GST-LC3B bound to beads and His-tagged p62 (Fig. 1C). This was also the case in the reverse experiment where MBP-p62 bound to beads pulled down GST-LC3B (Fig. 1D). From the first set of pulldowns the region of p62 binding to LC3B was found to be located somewhere between the N-terminal PB1 domain and the C-terminal UBA domain (Fig. 1C). To avoid polymerization of p62 via the PB1 domain, which complicates direct comparison of the binding of full-length, polymeric, and truncated monomeric forms of p62, we used a K7A/D69A mutant of p62 compromising both interaction surfaces of the PB1 domain (25Lamark T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Mapping of the LC3 Interacting Region (LIR) of p62—To further map the LC3 interaction region, we made a series of deletion constructs of GFP-tagged p62 that were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and subjected to GST pulldown experiments with GST-LC3B bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2). This enabled us to define the region encompassing amino acids 321–342 of human p62 as an LIR. We could confirm this result by pulldown assays with internal deletions of p62. Deleting amino acids 303–349 in the context of full-length p62 abolished binding to GST-LC3B, whereas deleting amino acids 303–320 did not affect binding of p62 lacking the N-terminal PB1 domain (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 2The region spanning amino acids 321–342 of p62 is sufficient for interaction with LC3B. A, constructs used for GST pulldown between full-length LC3B, fused to GST, and deletion mutants of p62.

We therefore asked if the binding to LC3 could be dependent on electrostatic interactions between acidic residues in LIR and a basic surface of LC3. Because there are acidic residues both in the N- and C-terminal half of LIR, we decided to mutate both clusters separately. Thus, we mutated two consecutive glutamate residues in the N-terminal cluster to alanines (E323A/E324A) and three consecutive aspartate residues in the C-terminal half to alanines (D335A/D336A/D337A) (see Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2008713912,"On activation, naive T cells differentiate into effector T-cell subsets with specific cytokine phenotypes and specialized effector functions. Recently a subset of T cells, distinct from T helper (T(H))1 and T(H)2 cells, producing interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17) was defined and seems to have a crucial role in mediating autoimmunity and inducing tissue inflammation. We and others have shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-6 together induce the differentiation of T(H)17 cells, in which IL-6 has a pivotal function in dictating whether T cells differentiate into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) or T(H)17 cells. Whereas TGF-beta induces Foxp3 and generates T(reg) cells, IL-6 inhibits the generation of T(reg) cells and induces the production of IL-17, suggesting a reciprocal developmental pathway for T(H)17 and T(reg) cells. Here we show that IL-6-deficient (Il6-/-) mice do not develop a T(H)17 response and their peripheral repertoire is dominated by Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. However, deletion of T(reg) cells leads to the reappearance of T(H)17 cells in Il6-/- mice, suggesting an additional pathway by which T(H)17 cells might be generated in vivo. We show that an IL-2 cytokine family member, IL-21, cooperates with TGF-beta to induce T(H)17 cells in naive Il6-/- T cells and that IL-21-receptor-deficient T cells are defective in generating a T(H)17 response."

https://openalex.org/W2050376918,"A previously unidentified modulator of vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) number has been discovered using a chemical genetic screen in zebrafish. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increases HSCs in the embryo and enhances marrow recovery following irradiation of adult fish. These effects of PGE2 on stem and progenitor cell number are conserved across vertebrate species. This suggests that modulation of this pathway could be used to treat patients undergoing bone marrow transplant and for some forms of anaemia. This study identifies Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an important modulator of vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) number. Chemicals that enhance PGE2 synthesis increase the number of HSCs whereas the opposite effect is achieved by blocking PGE2 synthesis. Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis is tightly controlled by growth factors, signalling molecules and transcription factors. Definitive HSCs derived during embryogenesis in the aorta–gonad–mesonephros region subsequently colonize fetal and adult haematopoietic organs1,2. To identify new modulators of HSC formation and homeostasis, a panel of biologically active compounds was screened for effects on stem cell induction in the zebrafish aorta–gonad–mesonephros region. Here, we show that chemicals that enhance prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis increased HSC numbers, and those that block prostaglandin synthesis decreased stem cell numbers. The cyclooxygenases responsible for PGE2 synthesis were required for HSC formation. A stable derivative of PGE2 improved kidney marrow recovery following irradiation injury in the adult zebrafish. In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays, PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, ex vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony forming units at day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term repopulating HSCs present in murine bone marrow after limiting dilution competitive transplantation. The conserved role for PGE2 in the regulation of vertebrate HSC homeostasis indicates that modulation of the prostaglandin pathway may facilitate expansion of HSC number for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2000244215,"How natural speech is represented in the auditory cortex constitutes a major challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Although many single-unit and neuroimaging studies have yielded valuable insights about the processing of speech and matched complex sounds, the mechanisms underlying the analysis of speech dynamics in human auditory cortex remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the phase pattern of theta band (4-8 Hz) responses recorded from human auditory cortex with magnetoencephalography (MEG) reliably tracks and discriminates spoken sentences and that this discrimination ability is correlated with speech intelligibility. The findings suggest that an approximately 200 ms temporal window (period of theta oscillation) segments the incoming speech signal, resetting and sliding to track speech dynamics. This hypothesized mechanism for cortical speech analysis is based on the stimulus-induced modulation of inherent cortical rhythms and provides further evidence implicating the syllable as a computational primitive for the representation of spoken language."
https://openalex.org/W2055720472,"Neuroligins enhance synapse formation in vitro, but surprisingly are not required for the generation of synapses in vivo. We now show that in cultured neurons, neuroligin-1 overexpression increases excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic responses, and potentiates synaptic NMDAR/AMPAR ratios. In contrast, neuroligin-2 overexpression increases inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic responses. Accordingly, deletion of neuroligin-1 in knockout mice selectively decreases the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio, whereas deletion of neuroligin-2 selectively decreases inhibitory synaptic responses. Strikingly, chronic inhibition of NMDARs or CaM-Kinase II, which signals downstream of NMDARs, suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-1, whereas chronic inhibition of general synaptic activity suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-2. Taken together, these data indicate that neuroligins do not establish, but specify and validate, synapses via an activity-dependent mechanism, with different neuroligins acting on distinct types of synapses. This hypothesis reconciles the overexpression and knockout phenotypes and suggests that neuroligins contribute to the use-dependent formation of neural circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2070948590,"TRPV1 plays a key role in nociception, as it is activated by heat, low pH, and ligands such as capsaicin, leading to a burning pain sensation. We describe the structure of the cytosolic ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 and identify a multiligand-binding site important in regulating channel sensitivity within the TRPV1-ARD. The structure reveals a binding site that accommodates triphosphate nucleotides such as ATP, and biochemical studies demonstrate that calmodulin binds the same site. Electrophysiology experiments show that either ATP or PIP2 prevent desensitization to repeated applications of capsaicin, i.e., tachyphylaxis, while calmodulin plays an opposing role and is necessary for tachyphylaxis. Mutations in the TRPV1-ARD binding site eliminate tachyphylaxis. We present a model for the calcium-dependent regulation of TRPV1 via competitive interactions of ATP and calmodulin at the TRPV1-ARD-binding site and discuss its relationship to the C-terminal region previously implicated in interactions with PIP2 and calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W2097532290,"Experience-dependent plasticity is crucial for the precise formation of neuronal connections during development. It is generally thought to depend on Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity. In addition, neurons possess other, homeostatic means of compensating for changes in sensory input, but their role in cortical plasticity is unclear. We used two-photon calcium imaging to investigate whether homeostatic response regulation contributes to changes of eye-specific responsiveness after monocular deprivation (MD) in mouse visual cortex. Short MD durations decreased deprived-eye responses in neurons with binocular input. Longer MD periods strengthened open-eye responses, and surprisingly, also increased deprived-eye responses in neurons devoid of open-eye input. These bidirectional response adjustments effectively preserved the net visual drive for each neuron. Our finding that deprived-eye responses were either weaker or stronger after MD, depending on the amount of open-eye input a cell received, argues for both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulating neuronal responsiveness during experience-dependent plasticity."

Physiol. 2005; 569: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the subcellular trafficking of Kv4.2 has yet to be been investigated. We report here an activity-dependent redistribution of Kv4.2 out of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. This redistribution requires NMDAR activation and Ca2+ influx and occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Glycine-induced long-term potentiation (chem-LTP) resulted in concurrent synaptic GluR1 insertion and Kv4.2 internalization. Whole-cell recordings supported these results, showing that endogenous A-type, but not sustained, K+ currents are reduced after chem-LTP induction. Expression of a Kv4.2 dominant-negative mutant was found to increase mEPSC amplitudes and stimuli that induce Kv4.2 internalization resulted in enhanced synaptic currents. Finally, in hippocampal organotypic slice cultures we show that synaptically induced LTP is reduced by hyperpolarization, suggesting that Kv4.2 internalization contributes to LTP. Activity-dependent regulation of Kv4.2 surface expression thus presents a synapse-specific molecular mechanism for the fine-tuning of dendritic signals. To monitor the subcellular distribution and activity-dependent trafficking of Kv4.2, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was attached to the C terminus (Kv4.2g). This construct mimics the somatodendritic expression pattern of endogenous Kv4.2 in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, with nearly identical biophysical properties (Kim et al., 2005Kim J. Wei D.S. Hoffman D.A. Kv4 potassium channel subunits control action potential repolarization and frequency-dependent broadening in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones.J. Physiol. 2005; 569: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Using immunogold labeling of endogenous Kv4.2, electron micrographs showed Kv4.2 subunits located in hippocampal CA1 spines, supporting our previous observation of Kv4.2g spine localization (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In mature, cultured hippocampal neurons, application of a selective AMPAR agonist (100 μM AMPA, 15 min) caused a redistribution of Kv4.2g out of spines, accumulating in puncta both in the dendritic shaft and soma (Figure 1A). This AMPA-induced redistribution of Kv4.2g was reversible, indicating that the treatment was not excitotoxic and showing that Kv4.2g returns to spines within 6 hr (Figure 1A). Redistribution of Kv4.2g was also observed with KCl (25 mM) depolarization, glutamate (50 μM), and NMDA (20 μM) treatment (Figure S2). The loss of spine Kv4.2g fluorescence upon stimulation could be due to spine retraction, lateral mobilization of Kv4.2g within the membrane but out of spines, or internalization of Kv4.2g out of the membrane as has been found for AMPARs (Collingridge et al., 2004Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Wang Y.T. Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R. Malenka R.C. AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). To test for Kv4.2 internalization, we performed a biotinylation assay to detect surface Kv4.2g levels before and after stimulation. Surface Kv4.2g was markedly decreased in stimulated neurons without a significant change in total protein level (AMPA: 52.5% ± 2.9%, n = 3; total protein: 98.4% ± 2.1%, n = 3; Figure 1B). Again, the stimulation-induced decrease in surface Kv4.2g was almost completely recovered 6 hr after withdrawal of AMPA (normalized surface Kv4.2g level: 53.1% ± 2.7% of basal for 1 hr washout, 59.4% ± 5.1% for 2 hr, 76.4% ± 10.7% for 4 hr, 96.3% ± 1.1% for 6 hr, n = 3; Figure 1B, bottom). Given the large number of synapses stimulated in these conditions, we were able to directly measure internalization as a decrease in the endogenous whole-cell transient K+ current from young, uninfected hippocampal neurons (Figures 1C and 1D). After a control recording period, AMPA (50 μM) was applied for 5 min. Endogenous transient K+ currents measured at +120 mV decreased by 24.5% ± 5.0% after AMPA stimulation (from 2.96 ± 0.19 nA to 2.24 ± 0.19 nA, n = 12, p < 0.05, paired Student's t test) without a change in sustained or noninactivating delayed rectifier-type voltage-gated K+ current amplitudes (0.96 ± 0.05, n = 12, p > 0.05, paired Student's t test; Figure 1D). We also noted an increase in the rate of inactivation of the transient K+ currents after stimulation (from 57.8 ± 7.3 ms to 41.8 ± 8.8 ms, n = 12, p < 0.05, paired Student's t test; data not shown). This change in average inactivation rate may indicate targeted internalization of a subset of Kv4.2-containing channels exhibiting slower inactivation (depending on their phosphorylation state or complement of auxiliary β-subunits) (Hoffman and Johnston, 1998Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. Downregulation of transient K+ channels in dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by activation of PKA and PKC.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3521-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Jerng et al., 2004Jerng H.H. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. Molecular physiology and modulation of somatodendritic A-type potassium channels.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 343-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Consistent with our imaging and biochemical analysis of Kv4.2g expression, as well as electrophysiological recordings of the endogenous transient K+ currents, the surface expression level of endogenous Kv4.2 is reduced by AMPA stimulation in acute hippocampal slices as well as in dissociated neurons (normalized surface Kv4.2g level: 67.8% ± 6.1% of basal, n = 4 for slices; Figure 1E; 71.8 8% ± 5.7% of basal, n = 3 for dissociated neurons; data not shown). Thus, the surface expression level of Kv4.2 is regulated by membrane internalization and reinsertion in an activity-dependent manner. Stimulation triggering Kv4.2g internalization might also lead to changes in synapse number or structure. To determine this, we visualized pre- and postsynaptic elements using antibodies against endogenous Synaptophysin and the primary NMDAR subunit (NR1), respectively (Figure S3). In AMPA-stimulated dendrites, the number of Kv4.2g puncta colabeled with Synaptophysin decreased by approximately 84% (11.9% ± 2.4%, n = 552 puncta from 11 neurons after AMPA versus 75% ± 2.5%, n = 539 puncta from 11 neurons for unstimulated sister cultures, “basal”). Likewise, the number of Kv4.2g puncta colabeled with NR1 was considerably reduced (∼82%) upon AMPA stimulation (15.4% ± 3.2%, n = 443 puncta from 12 neurons for AMPA versus 87.7% ± 1.7%, n = 489 puncta from 12 neurons for basal). The number of NR1 clusters per 10 μm of dendrite was unchanged after stimulation (6.54 ± 0.31, n = 24 for AMPA stimulation versus 6.52 ± 0.41, n = 19 for basal). Another spine marker, fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin used to label F-actin, showed similar results (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 17.9% ± 4.5%, n = 500 from 16 neurons for AMPA stimulation versus 89.4% ± 2.2%, n = 1186 from 26 neurons for basal; Figure 2). Kv4.2g therefore appears to undergo activity-induced internalization, without a gross change in synaptic architecture or number. Preventing synaptic release with tetanus toxin (TeTN) largely eliminated AMPA-induced Kv4.2g redistribution (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 65.6% ± 2.0%, n = 1402 from 27 neurons; Figure 2). In addition, the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker TTX (1 μM) reduced the AMPA-induced redistribution of Kv4.2g but not redistribution induced by KCl depolarization (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 55.7% ± 7.3%, n = 403 from 9 neurons for AMPA + TTX; Figure 2; 10.0% ± 3.0%, n = 264 from 7 neurons for KCl + TTX; Figure S2). These results indicate that, although synaptic release is necessary to trigger Kv4.2g redistribution, AMPAR activation alone is insufficient, suggesting a role for NMDARs. To test for NMDAR dependence, the NMDAR antagonist D,L-APV (100 μM) was applied 15 min prior to AMPA stimulation. NMDAR block largely prevented activity-induced redistribution of Kv4.2g (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 74.9% ± 3.6%, n = 302 from 8 neurons for AMPA + APV; Figure 2; and 59.7% ± 3.3%, n = 270 from 7 neurons for KCl + APV; Figure S2). Consistent with the requirement of synaptic release and NMDAR activation, we found AMPA-induced Kv4.2g redistribution to be blocked by preincubating neurons with the membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μM) (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 78.4% ± 2.6%, n = 544 from 16 neurons for AMPA + BAPTA-AM; Figure 2). Kv4.2g redistribution thus requires NMDAR activation and Ca2+ influx. To estimate the time course of Kv4.2g redistribution, we performed live imaging experiments in cultured hippocampal neurons coexpressing Kv4.2g and the improved red fluorescent protein tdTomato (Shaner et al., 2004Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Improved monomeric red, orange and yellow fluorescent proteins derived from Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3264) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging showed that AMPA-driven Kv4.2g redistribution from spines begins rapidly upon stimulation and progresses over a period of about 15 min (ΔF/F0 of normalized Kv4.2g in spines after 15 min AMPA: −0.25 ± 0.02, n = 192 spines from 9 neurons; Figure 3 and Movie S1). Only a small change in ΔF/F0 was found in the adjacent dendritic shaft after 15 min AMPA treatment (−0.08 ± 0.03; data not shown). Preincubation with APV almost completely blocked AMPA-induced Kv4.2g fluorescence changes in spines (ΔF/F0 of normalized Kv4.2g at 15 min time point: −0.05 ± 0.02, n = 100 spines from six APV-treated neurons versus −0.02 ± 0.01, n = 75 spines from nontreated four neurons; Figure 3 and Movie S2; non- or APV-pretreated dendritic shafts: −0.01 ± 0.01; data not shown). We next addressed the mechanism of Kv4.2g redistribution using a synthetic Dynamin-derived peptide (DYN) to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis by blocking the recruitment of Dynamin to clathrin-coated pits (Damke, 1996Damke H. Dynamin and receptor-mediated endocytosis.FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 48-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Nong et al., 2003Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Glycine binding primes NMDA receptor internalization.Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This peptide has been used previously to show that functional AMPA receptor expression level is controlled by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization (Brebner et al., 2005Brebner K. Wong T.P. Liu L. Liu Y. Campsall P. Gray S. Phelps L. Phillips A.G. Wang Y.T. Nucleus accumbens long-term depression and the expression of behavioral sensitization.Science. 2005; 310: 1340-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Imaging and electrophysiological experiments both show that activity-dependent Kv4.2g redistribution and/or endogenous A current reduction is blocked by the DYN peptide (Figure 4). Preincubation of cultured neurons with membrane-permeable myrs-DYN for 10 min almost completely eliminated AMPA-mediated Kv4.2g redistribution, whereas a scrambled peptide (myrs-scramDYN) had no effect on Kv4.2g redistribution (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 82.3% ± 1.6%, n = 927 from 20 neurons for AMPA + myrs-DYN and 20.0% ± 2.6%, n = 455 from 13 neurons for AMPA + myrs-scramDYN; Figures 4A and 4B). Preventing endocytosis by preincubating neurons in hypertonic media (0.45 M sucrose) also abolished AMPA-induced Kv4.2g redistribution (Kv4.2g-positive spines: 92.1% ± 1.9%, n = 685 from 19 neurons; data not shown). AMPA-driven Kv4.2g redistribution thus occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In support of the imaging results, inclusion of membrane-impermeable DYN (but not scramDYN) in the patch pipette in whole-cell recordings prevented the AMPA-induced reduction of endogenous A currents in cultured hippocampal neurons (normalized peak transient current after AMPA stimulation for DYN, 0.91 ± 0.02, p > 0.05, paired Student's t test, n = 7; Figures 4C and 4D). In recordings using scramDYN, AMPA again reduced endogenous transient but not sustained K+ currents (normalized peak transient current after AMPA stimulation for scramDYN, 0.57 ± 0.07, p < 0.05, paired Student's t test, n = 4; Figures 4C and 4D). These experiments revealed a physiological consequence of Kv4.2 internalization: a reduced capacity for neurons to counter membrane depolarization. In these recordings, we monitored the peak AMPA-induced membrane depolarization (see Experimental Procedures) and the time it took to recover after washout. Upon AMPA stimulation, intracellular DYN reduced both peak membrane depolarization and recovery time compared to scramDYN (Figure 4E) and control recordings (no peptide, −36.42 ± 1.69 mV peak depolarization and 305.83 ± 16.01 s for recovery, n = 12). These data show that regulated Kv4.2 trafficking provides a potent mechanism for controlling membrane excitability. Previous investigations demonstrated AMPAR internalization by a number of different stimuli (synaptic activity, insulin treatment, Ca2+ influx, and ligand binding to AMPARs) (Brown et al., 2005Brown T.C.

Rapid, activation-induced redistribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a separate internalization mechanism from our results with Kv4.2. To compare the trafficking of Kv4.2 and AMPARs, Kv4.2g-expressing neurons were stimulated by AMPA (50 μM, 15 min) and subsequently immunostained with anti-GluR1 to detect endogenous AMPARs. AMPA treatment triggered the internalization of both Kv4.2g and GluR1 away from spines into the dendritic shaft (Figure 5). For analysis, Kv4.2g and GluR1 fluorescent signal intensity was plotted for both the dendritic shaft and spines, as illustrated in Figure 5B. Line plots of spine fluorescence indicated almost complete colocalization of Kv4.2g and GluR1 in unstimulated dendritic spines, which was abolished with AMPA stimulation (Figures 5A and 5C). Within the dendritic shaft, after AMPA stimulation, fluorescent signals from internalized Kv4.2g and GluR1 were nonoverlapping. Coapplication of APV and AMPA resulted in GluR1 but not Kv4.2g redistribution (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5D). These results show that AMPA-dependent internalization of the two channels proceeds through distinct intracellular pathways. We note that GluR1 internalization during AMPA stimulation would be expected to decrease neuronal excitability. Thus, the reduced depolarization observed upon AMPA stimulation in experiments where internalization is blocked using an inhibitory dynamin peptide (DYN, Figure 4E) may actually reflect an underestimate of the effect of Kv4.2 internalization on membrane excitability. To determine if surface Kv4.2 expression affects synaptic integration, we altered the level of functional Kv4.2 by expressing Kv4.2g or the dominant-negative mutant Kv4.2gW362F (Kim et al., 2005Kim J.

Whole-cell transient K+ currents were increased ∼2-fold in Kv4.2g-expressing neurons, and decreased ∼60% in Kv4.2gW362F-expressing neurons compared to control, with no change in the sustained K+ current amplitude (transient: 7.85 ± 0.56 nA, n = 6 for Kv4.2g-expressing versus 3.87 ± 0.46 nA, n = 7 for control and 1.97 ± 0.22 nA, n = 7 for Kv4.2gW362F, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA; sustained: 1.23 ± 0.13 nA, n = 6, 1.19 ± 0.38 nA, n = 6 and 1.56 ± 0.86 nA, n = 7 for Kv4.2g, control, and Kv4.2gW362F, respectively, p > 0.05; data not shown) (Kim et al., 2005Kim J.

Functional Kv4.2 expression level determined basal mEPSC amplitude (11.7 ± 0.5 pA, n = 31 for control versus 10.8 ± 0.8 pA, n = 17 for Kv4.2g and 17.6 ± 1.5 pA, n = 15 for Kv4.2gW362F, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA; Figures 6A and 6B) and rise time (11.7 ± 0.5 pA, n = 31 for control versus 10.8 ± 0.8 pA, n = 17 for Kv4.2g and 17.6 ± 1.5 pA, n = 15, for Kv4.2gW362F, p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA; data not shown). Due to inadequate voltage control of the synapse, synaptic charge is a more accurate measure of synaptic efficacy than amplitude (Barrett and Crill, 1974Barrett J.N. Crill W.E.

https://openalex.org/W1969786859,"The development of GABAergic inhibitory circuits is shaped by neural activity, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of GABA in regulating GABAergic innervation in the adolescent brain, when GABA is mainly known as an inhibitory transmitter. Conditional knockdown of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme GAD67 in basket interneurons in adolescent visual cortex resulted in cell autonomous deficits in axon branching, perisomatic synapse formation around pyramidal neurons, and complexity of the innervation fields; the same manipulation had little influence on the subsequent maintenance of perisomatic synapses. These effects of GABA deficiency were rescued by suppressing GABA reuptake and by GABA receptor agonists. Germline knockdown of GAD67 but not GAD65 showed similar deficits, suggesting a specific role of GAD67 in the maturation of perisomatic innervation. Since intracellular GABA levels are modulated by neuronal activity, our results implicate GAD67-mediated GABA synthesis in activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory innervation patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2060612598,"In the mouse telencephalon, Dlx homeobox transcription factors are essential for the tangential migration of subpallial-derived GABAergic interneurons to neocortex. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dlx1/2 has a central role in restraining neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons at a stage when they migrate tangentially to cortex. In Dlx1-/-;Dlx2-/- mutants, neurite length is increased and cells fail to migrate. In Dlx1-/-;Dlx2+/- mutants, while the tangential migration of immature interneurons appears normal, they develop dendritic and axonal processes with increased length and decreased branching, and have deficits in their neocortical laminar positions. Thus, Dlx1/2 is required for coordinating programs of neurite maturation and migration. In this regard, we provide genetic evidence that in immature interneurons Dlx1/2 repression of the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase PAK3, a downstream effector of the Rho family of GTPases, is critical in restraining neurite growth and promoting tangential migration."

https://openalex.org/W2004015245,"Innate sensory biases could play an important role in helping naïve animals to find food. As inexperienced bees are known to have strong innate colour biases we investigated whether bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies with stronger biases for the most rewarding flower colour (violet) foraged more successfully in their local flora. To test the adaptive significance of variation in innate colour bias, we compared the performance of colour-naïve bees, from nine bumblebee colonies raised from local wild-caught queens, in a laboratory colour bias paradigm using violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee blue) artificial flowers. The foraging performance of the same colonies was assessed under field conditions. Colonies with a stronger innate bias for violet over blue flowers in the laboratory harvested more nectar per unit time under field conditions. In fact, the colony with the strongest bias for violet (over blue) brought in 41% more nectar than the colony with the least strong bias. As violet flowers in the local area produce more nectar than blue flowers (the next most rewarding flower colour), these data are consistent with the hypothesis that local variation in flower traits could drive selection for innate colour biases."

CD177 (NB1 and PRV-1) is a 58- to 64-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein expressed exclusively by neutrophils, neutrophilic metamyelocytes, and myelocytes, but not by any other blood cells (1Stroncek D.F.

The surface expression of CD177 is unique in that only a subpopulation of neutrophils expresses this protein on the cell surface, with the mean size of the CD177-positive subpopulation ranging from 45% to 65% (2Stroncek D.F. Shankar R.A. Noren P.A. Herr G.P. Clement L.T. Transfusion. 1996; 36: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Matsuo K. Lin A. Procter J.L. Clement L. Stroncek D. Transfusion. 2000; 40: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CD177 has been well studied as a target antigen in immunemediated disorders. During pregnancy, women with a CD177 null phenotype are prone to produce alloantibodies against CD177 that cross the placenta, react with fetal neutrophils, and cause neutropenia of the newborn. This mechanism let to the initial discovery of the NB1 antigen in 1971 (7Lalezari P. Murphy G.B. Allen Jr., F.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Alloantibodies to CD177, present in blood products obtained from immunized donors, have also been implicated as mediators of transfusion-related acute lung injury (8Sachs U.J. Hattar K. Weissmann N. Bohle R.M. Weiss T. Sibelius U. Bux J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1217-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although well characterized as an immunotarget, the function of CD177 is largely unknown. It has been reported that CD177 is up-regulated on the neutrophil surface upon stimulation, including during severe bacterial infections, and following granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor treatment (9Gohring K.

In addition, antibody-mediated clustering of CD177 primes the N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) 3The abbreviations used are: fMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sr, soluble recombinant; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IL, interleukin; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6-)carboxyfluorescein; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 3The abbreviations used are: fMLP, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; mAb, monoclonal antibody; sr, soluble recombinant; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IL, interleukin; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6-)carboxyfluorescein; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin.-activated respiratory burst reaction of the neutrophil (8Sachs U.J. Hattar K. Weissmann N. Bohle R.M. Weiss T. Sibelius U. Bux J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1217-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations make it reasonable to suppose that CD177 may be involved in processes of neutrophil-mediated host defense. One preliminary study suggests a participation of CD177 in neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction (10Stroncek D.F. Herr G.P. Plachta L.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). The latter observation is in line with the fact that CD177, as a member of the leukocyte antigen-6 superfamily, shares a similar structure with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (11Plesner T. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is expressed on numerous cell types and plays an important role in cell-extra-cellular matrix and cell-cell interaction by binding of vitronectin, and by regulating β1 and β2 integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes (12Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. May A.E. Preissner K.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our understanding of the role that CD177 might similarly play in mediating neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions is limited, however, by lack of an identifiable counter-receptor on the endothelial cell surface. A complex molecular crosstalk is known to be responsible for the interaction between neutrophils and endothelial cells (13McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Kakkar A.K. Lefer D.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whereas the initiating step of rolling and subsequent firm leukocyte adhesion have been well characterized (15McEver R.P. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), less is known about the mechanisms that mediate the migration of leukocytes through the endothelium. A number of adhesion molecules have been implicated in this process, including β2 integrins, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), CD99, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) (16Muller W.A.

All antibodies are of IgG1 isotype, except for PECAM1.1 (IgG2a). Recombinant Proteins—Soluble recombinant (sr) PECAM-1 derived from PECAM-1-stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells has been previously described (32Goldberger A. Middleton K.A. Oliver J.A.

All recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography before use. Fc protein as control was purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). Generation of CD177-Fc Construct—Full-length CD177 cDNA (3Kissel K. Santoso S. Hofmann C. Stroncek D. Bux J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-92CTGCTCTGCCAGTTTGGGAC111-3′ and reverse primer 5′-1224CTGCACATCACGCTTCTCACG1204-3′. Aliquots of 1 μl of CD177 construct were diluted with 10× PCR buffer, 0.5 μm of each primer, 5 μm dNTP, 2.5 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR amplification was performed for 32 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. In the final cycle, the sample was kept at a temperature of 72 °C for 10 min and chilled to 4 °C. The PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel by using QIAquick (Qiagen), subcloned into the EcoRV cloning site of Signal pIgplus plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. B. Nieswandt, Wuörzburg, Germany), and then transformed into DH5α competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Positive clones were screened by PCR using CD177 and T7 primer pairs as described above. A plasmid from selected positive clones was validated by nucleotide sequence analysis on an ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer 3100 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Production of Recombinant CD177-Fc Fusion Protein—HEK cells were grown in 24-well plates and were transfected with 0.2 μg of CD177 construct in 350 μl of Opti-Mem medium (Invitrogen) by the use of Effectene (Qiagen). Transfected cells were selected with increasing concentration of Geneticin (40-800 μg/ml, PAA Cell Culture Co.). Culture supernatants from stable cell lines were then tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In brief, microtiter wells were coated with 50 μl of donkey anti-human Fc (diluted 1:250, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with 100 μl PBS, wells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of 50 μl of supernatant was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed twice, and bound Fc fusion protein was detected with 50 μl of peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-human Fc (diluted 1:3000, Dianova) and ortho-phenylenediamine (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) as substrate. Reaction was stopped after 15 min with 50 μl of H2SO4 and was read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 405 nm. CD177-Fc fusion protein was isolated from 1 liter of culture supernatant and purified by the use of a protein G column. Purified protein was analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE by silver staining and verified by immunoblotting (see below). Analysis of CD177-Fc Binding to Endothelial Cells by Flow Cytometry—Aliquots of 4 × 106 HUVECs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min and washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 4 μg of CD177-Fc or Fc alone for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with 0.02% BSA in PBS buffer, and then labeled with 40 μl of fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (diluted 1:80, Dianova). After washing, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.2% BSA for flow cytometry analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). Antigen Capture Assay—Microtiter wells were coated with 100 μl of donkey anti-human Fc (see above) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed extensively three times with 0.2% BSA and blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of 250 ng of CD177-Fc fusion protein or Fc alone (as control) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed twice and then incubated with 100 μl of endothelial cell lysates (1 μg) for 30 min at 37 °C. Bound protein was detected by the addition of mAbs against PECAM-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin (1:500 dilutions) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washings, 100 μl of peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:8000, Dianova) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound antibodies were measured on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader as described above. Affinity Isolation of the CD177 Binding Partner—HUVECs were labeled with 2 ml of 5 mm NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors as previously described (33Santoso S. Kiefel V. Richter I.G. Sachs U.J. Rahman A. Carl B. Kroll H. Blood. 2002; 99: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After preclearing with protein-G beads (Amersham Biosciences), cell lysates were stored at -70 °C until use. Aliquots of 100 μl of Protein-G beads were coupled with 2.5 μg of CD177-Fc fusion protein or Fc control for 1 h at 4 °C. 300 μl of labeled cell lysates were added to the beads and were rotated overnight at 4 °C. After washings with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), bound proteins were eluted by adding SDS buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. Eluates were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and developed with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin and a chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After stripping with Restore™ Western blot (Pierce), the membrane was redeveloped with selected mAbs against endothelial cell markers (20 μg/ml). Bound mAbs were visualized with peroxidase labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:100,000, Dianova) and the ECL system. Expression of CD177 in U937 Monocyte Cell Line—U937 cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. An aliquot of 250 μl of cell suspension (2 × 107cells/ml) was transfected with 20 μg of CD177 in pcDNA3 vector (3Kissel K. Santoso S. Hofmann C. Stroncek D. Bux J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using electroporation technique for 40 ms (Bio-Rad GenePulser). After 10-min incubation on 4 °C, cells were seeded in 10 ml of RPMI medium. The next day, cells were washed and selected for stable expression by the use of RPMI medium containing Geneticin (1 mg/ml). Transfectants expressing recombinant CD177 were identified by flow cytometry analysis using mAb 7D8 as described above. Phenotyping of Neutrophils—Neutrophils were phenotyped for CD177 expression by flow cytometry as previously described (9Gohring K. Wolff J. Doppl W. Schmidt K.L. Fenchel K. Pralle H. Sibelius U. Bux J. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 126: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, granulocytes were isolated from EDTA-anti-coagulated blood by dextran sedimentation and gradient centrifugation. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by flow cytometry using mAb 7D8. Five thousand cells were analyzed. The size of the positive subpopulation was calculated from the histogram employing CellQuest software. To investigate the influence of fMLP (Sigma) or IL-8 (Immuno Tools, Friesoythe, Germany) on protein surface expression, granulocytes were isolated as described and incubated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the absence or presence of 10 nm fMLP or 100 ng/ml IL-8, respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as outlined above using mAbs 7D8 and Gi18. Isolation of CD177 Proteins from Human Neutrophils—Granulocyte concentrates were obtained from healthy volunteers by a standard leukapheresis procedure (34Sachs U.J. Reiter A. Walter T. Bein G. Woessmann W. Transfusion. 2006; 46: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Twelve hours prior to apheresis, all volunteers received 7.5 μg per kilogram bodyweight of human recombinant granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (ChugaiPharma, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), as approved by the local ethics committee. Granulocyte concentrates (medium volume, 230 ml) were diluted in PBS (1:5). Aliquots of 15 ml were layered onto Ficoll gradient and then centrifuged for 20 min at 800 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended into 12 ml of ammonium chloride for 5 min on ice to lyse erythrocytes. After washing twice, 108 cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.25% Triton-X, 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture, 100 μl of 5% EDTA) for 30 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 30 min at 800 × g at 4 °C and pooled for purification by affinity chromatography as previously described (3Kissel K. Santoso S. Hofmann C. Stroncek D. Bux J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Isolated CD177 protein was then intensively dialyzed against PBS, and the remaining trace of Triton X-100 was removed by filtration through YM-10 column (Amicon, Witten, Germany). Platelet-derived αIIbβ3 protein as a control was isolated from outdated platelet concentrates by mAb Gi5 affinity column under identical conditions. The purity and identity of both proteins was proved by silver staining and immunoblotting analysis, and protein concentration was determined by BCA™ (Pierce). Aliquots of purified proteins were stored at -80 °C until use. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Direct protein interaction between PECAM-1 and CD177 was examined in real-time with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique on a BIAcore 2000 (Biacore AB, Freiberg, Germany). Purified srPECAM-1 diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) to a concentration of 60 μg/ml was directly immobilized on a CM5-sensor chip via amino coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Aliquots of 20 μl of purified CD177 or BSA (Pierce) as control were injected at a flow rate of 15 μl/min at different concentrations as indicated. In some experiments, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 μm Zn2SO4, or 10 mm EDTA were added into CD177 analyte prior to analysis. For blocking studies, 50 μg of mAbs was added in selected experiments. Running buffer was PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (Biacore AB). The sensor chip was regenerated with 25 mm NaOH. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion to PECAM-1-coated wells was tested as described previously (35Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Lupu F. Hammes H.P. Muller-Esterl W. Pixley R.A. Colman R.W. Preissner K.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 514-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of Fc-PECAM-1 or Fc alone as control (10 μg/ml in PBS) and blocked with 3% BSA solution. Nontransfected or CD177-transfected U937 cells were incubated with 5 μl of 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6-)carboxyfluorescein (BCECF, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed twice in serum-free RPMI, and 105 cells/well were plated onto the precoated wells at 37 °C for 60 min. For inhibition studies, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml mAbs specific for CD177 (MEM166) and PECAM-1 (Gi18, PECAM1.1, and PECAM1.2) or with 50 μl of purified CD177 (10 μg/ml) during the adhesion period. After the incubation period, the wells were washed gently, and adhesion was quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader Flx-800 (Biotek, Neufahrn, Germany). Transmigration Assay—Briefly, transmigration assays were performed using 6.5-mm Transwells with an 8-μm pore size (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). Inserts were coated with gelatin (Sigma). HUVECs were seeded on Transwell filters 2 days prior to the assay and grown for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C and 5% CO2). The integrity of HUVEC monolayers was assessed microscopically. At the beginning of the transmigration assay, HUVECs in the upper chamber were washed with serum-free RPMI, the lower chamber was filled with serum-free RPMI medium containing 10 nm fMLP (Sigma) or 100 ng/ml IL-8 (Immuno Tools). 1 ml of neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) was labeled with 5 μl of BCECF as described above. An aliquot of 100 μl of untreated cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) or cells preincubated with mAbs (10 μg/ml, 15 min, room temperature) was added to the upper chamber on top of the endothelial monolayer. After incubation for 90 min h at 37 °C, the number of transmigrated cells in the lower chamber was measured using a fluorescence reader as above. Production and Characterization of CD177-Fc Fusion Protein—To determine the binding partner of CD177, we first established stably transfected mammalian HEK cells producing soluble recombinant CD177-Fc fusion protein. Supernatants were collected after 3 days of culture and purified by the use of a protein G column. The purified protein was analyzed by silver staining to document its purity (Fig. 1A, left panel) and by immunoblotting to prove the immunoreactivity of both CD177 and the Fc portion (Fig. 1A, right panel). Purified CD177-Fc showed positive reactions with mAb 7D8 specific for CD177, as well as with donkey anti-human Fc (lanes 1 and 2). In the control experiment, donkey anti-mouse Fc did not show any reaction (lane 3). These results demonstrate that both portions, CD177 and Fc, of our fusion protein are immunoreactive. Binding of CD177-Fc Fusion Protein to HUVECs—The reactivity of the CD177-Fc fusion protein with HUVECs was tested by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Isolated HUVECs were incubated with CD177-Fc or Fc alone as a control, and a specific reaction with CD177-Fc only was observed. These results indicate that endothelial cells carry a binding partner for CD177. To further characterize the binding partner of CD177, an antigen capture assay was performed using CD177-Fc fusion protein immobilized on microtiter wells. After adding HUVEC lysates, bound protein was screened with different mAbs against endothelial proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, a positive reaction was observed with anti-PECAM-1, whereas no reaction was detectable with mAbs against E-selectin, P-selectin, and against JAM-C, indicating that PECAM-1 may represent the binding partner of CD177. Immunoprecipitation was then performed with surface biotin-labeled HUVECs to confirm this finding. Labeled cell lysates were precipitated with Fc alone, CD177-Fc, and mAb 7D8 coupled to protein G beads. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin system (Fig. 2B, left panel). In comparison to control experiments with Fc alone and mAb 7D8, CD177-Fc precipitated a specific band with a mass of 120 kDa. The membrane was stripped extensively and stained with different mAbs against endothelial cell markers to identify the 120-kDa protein. Only when mAb Gi18 specific for PECAM-1 was applied, a positive staining was observed (Fig. 2B, right panel). In contrast, no reaction was detected with mAbs against P-selectin, E-selectin, and JAM-C (not shown). In the control experiments, pre-clearing of HUVEC lysates with anti-PECAM-1 mAb abrogated the specific reaction of CD177-Fc immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Real-time Analysis of CD177 and PECAM-1 Protein Interaction—To study the direct protein-protein interaction between CD177 and soluble recombinant PECAM-1 (srPECAM-1), a real-time analysis by SPR technique was performed. Both proteins were affinity-purified before use and verified by silver staining and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). srPECAM-1 was immobilized onto the sensor surface, and the binding of CD177 at various concentrations (0.5-2.0 μm) was measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, concentration-dependent binding of CD177 to immobilized PECAM-1 was observed. In the control experiment, no interaction between CD177 and immobilized BSA was detectable. According to the Langmuir 1:1 model, the association (KA) and dissociation constant (KD) of CD177 binding was 1.23 × 106 M and 8.15 × 10-7 m (χ2 = 1.85), respectively. To prove the accessibility of the homophilic binding region of PECAM-1, mAb Gi18 against domains 1 and 2 was injected. As shown in the insert, mAb Gi18, which was previously shown to interfere with the homophilic PECAM-1 binding (28Chavakis T. Keiper T. Matz-Westphal R. Hersemeyer K. Sachs U.J. Nawroth P.P.

https://openalex.org/W2133692971,"The ability to orient and navigate through the terrestrial environment represents a computational challenge common to all vertebrates. It arises because motion sensors in the inner ear, the otolith organs, and the semicircular canals transduce self-motion in an egocentric reference frame. As a result, vestibular afferent information reaching the brain is inappropriate for coding our own motion and orientation relative to the outside world. Here we show that cerebellar cortical neuron activity in vermal lobules 9 and 10 reflects the critical computations of transforming head-centered vestibular afferent information into earth-referenced self-motion and spatial orientation signals. Unlike vestibular and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, where a mixture of responses was observed, Purkinje cells represent a homogeneous population that encodes inertial motion. They carry the earth-horizontal component of a spatially transformed and temporally integrated rotation signal from the semicircular canals, which is critical for computing head attitude, thus isolating inertial linear accelerations during navigation."
https://openalex.org/W2027213843,"UBE1 is known as the human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent manner. Here, we identified a novel human ubiquitin-activating enzyme referred to as UBE1L2, which also shows specificity for ubiquitin. The UBE1L2 sequence displays a 40% identity to UBE1 and also contains an ATP-binding domain and an active site cysteine conserved among E1 family proteins. UBE1L2 forms a covalent link with ubiquitin in vitro and in vivo, which is sensitive to reducing conditions. In an in vitro polyubiquitylation assay, recombinant UBE1L2 could activate ubiquitin and transfer it onto the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5b. Ubiquitin activated by UBE1L2 could be used for ubiquitylation of p53 by MDM2 and supported the autoubiquitylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases HectH9 and E6-AP. The UBE1L2 mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the testis, suggesting an organ-specific regulation of ubiquitin activation.

Conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins occurs via a well known enzymatic pathway (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). In the first step, the activating enzyme (E1) 2The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; Ub, ubiquitin; SUMO, small Ublike modifier; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; HPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. forms an initial ubiquitin adenylate intermediate, which is then transferred to the active site cysteine of the E1, forming a thiolester linkage between this cysteine and the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin (3Ciechanover A. Heller H. Katz-Etzion R. Hershko A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, ubiquitin is transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2) and then to a protein ligase (E3), which forms an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and a lysine within the target protein (5Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The attachment of ubiquitin to substrates has several effects on cellular processes. In most cases, Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains are connected to target proteins, leading to degradation via the 26 S proteasome. On the other hand, chains linked via Lys-63 of ubiquitin or monoubiquitylation are involved in DNA repair, endocytosis, or activation of kinases (6Haglund K. Dikic I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme is highly conserved in yeast (7McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), plants (8Hatfield P.M. Callis J. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15813-15817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (9Handley P.M.M. Siegel N.R.M. Ciechanover A Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). So far, it has been assumed that only a single activating enzyme for ubiquitin exists. The E1 enzyme plays an essential role in yeast since the deletion of the yeast E1 enzyme called UBA1 is lethal (7McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, a hypomorphic allele of UBA1 was identified, which impairs ubiquitin conjugation to substrate proteins (10Swanson R. Hochstrasser M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several mammalian cell lines with mutations that render the Ube1 gene temperature-sensitive showed a severe defect in ubiquitin conjugation when shifted to a non-permissive temperature (11Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Zacksenhaus E. Sheinin R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, since the defect was not absolute, it could not be excluded that other ways of activating ubiquitin may exist (14Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). So far, several members of the family of ubiquitin-like modifiers, including ubiquitin, SUMO, NEDD8, ISG15, APG12, and UFM1, have been shown to possess their private E1-activating enzymes, which specifically bind and activate their cognate modifier (15Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). While searching for an E1 enzyme specific for the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10, we investigated a so far barely studied putative E1 enzyme named UBE1L2. Surprisingly, this enzyme, although failing to activate any of the tested ubiquitin-like modifiers, was readily able to activate ubiquitin in vitro and in vivo. Since UBE1L2 is highly expressed in testis, this second ubiquitin-specific E1 type enzyme may serve an organ-specific function. Vector Constructs—For generation of HA-UBE1L2, cDNA of total RNA from SW620 colon carcinoma cells was used to PCR-amplify human UBE1L2 using 5′-CGA AGA GGT ACC TAT GGA AGG ATC CGA GCC TGT-3′ as forward and 5′-GCC AGA CTC GAG TTA ATC AGT GTC ATG ACT GA-3′ as reverse primers. The PCR product was cloned with an N-terminal HA tag into the vector pcDNA3.1 using Asp-718 and XhoI restriction sites. UBE1L2 was also cloned in pGEX2TK using 5′-AGA GCT AGC ATG GAA GGA TCC GAG CCT GT-3′ as forward and 5′-GCG GCT AGC TTA ATC AGT GTC ATG ACT GA-3′ as reverse primer. The PCR product was then cut with NheI restriction enzyme and ligated into the XbaI-digested vector. cDNA prepared from total RNA of HEK293T cells was used to amplify human Ufm1ΔC2 using 5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG TCG AAG GTT TCC-3′ as forward and 5′-CGC GAA TTC TTA TCC AAC ACG ATC TCT AGG-3′ as reverse primer and human Urm1 using sense 5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GCT GCG CCC TTG TCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCG GAA TTC TCA GCC GCC GTG CAG AGT G-3′ primers. Both PCR products were cloned into pGEX2TK using BamHI and EcoRI for Ufm1ΔC2 and BamHI and XmaI sites for hUrm1. Bacterial expression constructs (pGEX-2TK) encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of ubiquitin, Nedd8, SUMO-1, and ISG15, respectively, and a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3) for HA-tagged human UBE1 were generated by PCR-based approaches (further details will be provided upon request). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The plasmids pGEX, pGEX-ubiquitin (16Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar), pGEX-ISG15, pGEX-Nedd8, pGEX-Sumo-1, pGEX-FAT10 (17Hipp M.S. Raasi S. Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16503-16510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pGEX-Ufm1ΔC2, and pGEX-hUrm1 were used for expression of GST and GST fusion proteins. Expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. pGEX-UBE1L2 was transformed into competent bacteria of Escherichia coli host strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL (Stratagene), and expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification was carried out using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. GST Pulldown Assay—HA-UBE1L2 and HA-UBE1 were in vitro transcribed and translated with the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. 10 μl of the lysate were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with GST or GST fusion proteins bound to 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B in a total volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase. After washing five times with phosphate-buffered saline, SDS sample buffer was added to the beads either with or without β-mercaptoethanol before boiling. The samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The expression of the GST fusion proteins was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-UBE1L2 or pcDNA3.1-HA-UBE1 either with or without p3×FLAG-CMV-ubiquitin (18Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 16 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 4 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 40 μl of HA-affinity matrix (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with NET-TON buffer (650 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin) and three times with NET-T buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3) prior to boiling in SDS sample buffer either with or without 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated on 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot probed with anti-HA Peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and monoclonal and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). Ubiquitylation Assays—For in vitro ubiquitylation experiments, E6-AP, UBE1, and UbcH5b were expressed in the baculovirus system or in E. coli BL21 as described (19Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HectH9 and Mdm2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 (20Adhikary S. Marinoni F. Hock A. Hulleman E. Popov N. Beier R. Bernard S. Quarto M. Capra M. Goettig S. Kogel U. Scheffner M.

For in vitro autoubiquitylation, 10 μg of E6-AP or GST-HectH9 were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 2 μg of UBE1 or 200 ng of GST-UBE1L2, 50 ng of UbcH5b, and 20 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) in 120-μl volumes. For in vitro ubiquitylation of p53, 1 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated 35S-labeled p53 was incubated with 50 ng of UBE1 or GST-UBE1L2, 50 ng of UbcH5b, and 20 μg of ubiquitin in the absence or in the presence of 200 ng of GST-Mdm2 in 40-μl volumes (21Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 4 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, total reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was used to quantify expression levels of the ube1l2 gene in different mouse organs. Total RNA was extracted from indicated organs of 1-month-old C57BL/6 mice using a NucleoSpin® RNA II extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and the reverse transcription system (Promega). Quantitative PCR was performed with the LightCycler® instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the LightCycler® TaqMan® Master reaction mix with ube1l2-specific forward (5′-GTT CTC GCC CTT GTG TCA-3′) and reverse primers (5′-GAT TGC CTA GGG ATT CCA CA-3′) and probe number 84 of the Universal Probe Library (Roche Applied Science). Mouse hprt (hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase) was used as reference gene with the following primers: 5′-GCT GGT GAA AAG GAC CTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAC AGG ACT AGA ACA CCT-3′ (reverse). This reaction was performed with SybrGreen®. Identification of a Novel Human E1-like Enzyme, UBE1L2—We originally tried to identify a possible E1 enzyme for the ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10 by performing NCBI BLAST searches looking for proteins with homology to UBE1. Throughout the search, a protein sequence with 40% identity to the UBE1, named UBE1L2 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like protein 2) or MOP-4 (monocyte protein 4), was found comprising 1052 amino acids (Fig. 1). The theoretical molecular mass of UBE1L2 is 118 kDa, which corresponds well to the apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE. The ube1l2 gene is only found in vertebrates (human, mouse, chicken, fish) but neither in invertebrates (Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans) nor in plants or yeast. Recently, a splice variant of this gene named nUBE1L has been described as being strongly expressed in adult human testis (22Zhu H. Zhou Z.M. Huo R. Huang X.Y. Lu L. Lin M. Wang L.R. Zhou Y.D. Li J.M. Sha J.H. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2004; 36: 227-234Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The sequence of UBE1L2 also contains two important consensus motifs conserved among E1 enzymes: the highly conserved ATP-binding motif (GXGXX- GCE; amino acids 467–474) and the putative active site with the consensus sequence PXCTXXXP (amino acids 623–631) surrounding Cys-625, which may form a thiolester with ubiquitin. UBE1L2 Specifically Activates Ubiquitin in Vitro—Initially, the ability of UBE1L2 to activate ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins by thiolester formation was investigated in vitro. GST-tagged ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like proteins FAT10, ISG15, NEDD8, SUMO-1, UFM1, and URM1 were used to investigate an interaction with in vitro transcribed and translated HA-UBE1L2 in the presence of ATP in GST pulldown experiments. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. From Fig. 2A, it is evident that HA-UBE1L2 was unable to activate GST-FAT10 or other GST-tagged ubiquitin-like modifiers, although each of the used recombinant GST modifier proteins was able to interact specifically with their respective cognate E1 enzyme in vitro (data not show). Intriguingly, we found that UBE1L2 could form a thiolester linkage specifically with GST-ubiquitin, as seen in a higher molecular weight band when samples were applied to the gel in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 2A). The covalent linkage between UBE1L2 and ubiquitin could be broken in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that the two proteins were thiolester-linked (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation of UBE1L2 and Ubiquitin under Non-reducing Conditions—To determine whether the interaction between UBE1L2 and ubiquitin also occurs in intact cells, HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were transfected with expression constructs for either HA-UBE1L2 or HA-UBE1 alone or together with a FLAG-ubiquitin construct to carry out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. UBE1L2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibody. Fig. 2, C and D, illustrates that FLAG-ubiquitin coprecipitated with HA-UBE1L2 in cells coexpressing the two proteins. FLAG-ubiquitin and HA-UBE1L2 were found together in a high molecular weight band under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2C). A reduction by boiling in 10% β-mercaptoethanol strongly reduced this band (Fig. 2D), but complete separation of UBE1L2 and ubiquitin could not be achieved, which may indicate that UBE1L2 is also isopeptide-linked to ubiquitin to a low extent or that the reduction was incomplete. This phenomenon was also observed in a similar experiment with HA-UBE1 and FLAG-ubiquitin, where under reducing conditions, some adduct remained (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken together, it appears that human UBE1L2 also activates ubiquitin in intact cells. UBE1L2 Transfers Activated Ubiquitin onto UbcH5b and Supports E3-mediated Polyubiquitylation—Many E3 ligases including HectH9 and E6-AP serve as their own ubiquitylation substrates in vitro (autoubiquitylation) (20Adhikary S. Marinoni F. Hock A. Hulleman E. Popov N. Beier R. Bernard S. Quarto M. Capra M. Goettig S. Kogel U. Scheffner M. Helin K. Eilers M. Cell. 2005; 123: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, autoubiquitylation assays are ideally suited to determine whether UBE1L2 can indeed function as an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in protein ubiquitylation. To test whether UBE1L2 has E1 activity, HectH9 and E6-AP were expressed in bacteria (HectH9) or in the baculovirus system (E6-AP) and incubated in the presence of UBE1 or UBE1L2 under standard ubiquitylation conditions (19Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Adhikary S. Marinoni F. Hock A. Hulleman E.

As E2, bacterially expressed UbcH5b was used, which is known to interact with the E3s tested. As expected, incubation of HectH9 or E6-AP in the presence of UBE1, UbcH5b, and ubiquitin resulted in efficient autoubiquitylation of the respective E3 (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, bacterially expressed UBE1L2 facilitated ubiquitylation of HectH9 (Fig. 3A) as well as E6-AP (Fig. 3B) with an efficiency similar to UBE1. In addition, UBE1L2 supported Mdm2-mediated ubiquitylation of p53 in vitro (Fig. 3C) (21Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data clearly show that UBE1L2 can substitute for UBE1 in the ubiquitylation reactions tested and, thus, functions as an ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Expression Analysis of ube1l2 in Several Mouse Organs—Next, we determined the expression profile of UBE1L2 mRNA in different mouse organs. The mouse has a bona fide UBE1L2 protein that is well conserved with an identity of 88% to its human homologue. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted for lung, liver, kidney, intestine, brain, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, uterus, ovaries, and testis. The UBE1L2 mRNA expression was normalized to HPRT expression in each organ, and the relative UBE1L2 expression level was calculated with the value for the kidney being arbitrarily set to one. As shown in Fig. 4, it is striking that UBE1L2 expression in the testis is about 5-fold higher than in any of the other organs tested, which could point at a testis-specific function of UBE1L2. In the present study, human UBE1L2 was identified as a second ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Among the known E1 enzymes, UBE1L2 has the highest identity to the classical ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBE1 (40%) followed by the ISG15-activating enzyme UBE1L (35%) and the bipartite SUMO-activating enzyme UBA2 (25%)/AOS1 (16%). The similar length of the known ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBE1 and UBE1L2 suggested that UBE1L2 probably acts as a single molecule like UBE1 and not as a heterodimeric E1 complex, as formed by AOS1/Uba2 (23Desterro J.M.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Clear evidence that the UBE1L2 protein by itself is capable of forming a thiolester with ubiquitin was then provided by our in vitro assay and by the transfection experiments showing that UBE1L2 could also activate ubiquitin in vivo (Fig. 2). That UBE1L2 indeed functions as an E1 enzyme was then shown by its ability to transfer the activated ubiquitin to the broad spectrum E2 enzyme UbcH5b and to support the autopolyubiquitylation of two E3 enzymes (Fig. 3, A and B) and Mdm2-mediated ubiquitylation of p53 (Fig. 3C). It will remain to be investigated whether UBE1L2 displays some degree of selectivity with respect to the E2 enzymes, which can be supplied with activated ubiquitin. All known E1 enzymes are conserved from yeast to human, except for UBA5, which is found in several multicellular organisms but not in yeast (26Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). UBE1L2 is even more restricted in distribution because it is only found in vertebrates but not in lower organisms. This indicates that UBE1L2 might have a specialized role in tissues of higher organisms, and in particular, in the testis, where it is expressed by far most abundantly (Fig. 4). Gene targeting experiments will be required to determine this particular function of UBE1L2 and to elucidate the interesting question why nature has invented a second ubiquitin-activating enzyme that has the potential to selectively supply activated ubiquitin to a subset of E2 enzymes, E3 enzymes, and substrates.

Considering that heme induces neutrophil chemotaxis, we hypothesize that heme activates a G protein-coupled receptor. Here we show that similar to heme, several heme analogs were able to induce neutrophil migration in vitro and in vivo. Mesoporphyrins, molecules lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited heme-induced migration. Moreover, migration of neutrophils induced by heme was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gα inhibitory protein, and with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase Cβ, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or Rho kinase. The induction of reactive oxygen species by heme was dependent of Gα inhibitory protein and phosphoinositide 3-kinase and partially dependent of phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Rho kinase. Together, our results indicate that heme activates neutrophils through signaling pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules and suggest that mesoporphyrins might prove valuable in the treatment of the inflammatory consequences of hemorrhagic and hemolytic disorders.

The immune/inflammatory responses triggered by molecules of infectious agents or host origin are amplified by cytokines, lipid mediators, and reactive oxygen species (1Nathan C. Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Diseases of increased intra- and extravascular hemolysis or extensive cell damage can lead to high levels of free heme (2Muller-Eberhard U. Javid J. Liem H.H. Hanstein A. Hanna M.

As the prosthetic moiety of inactive apo-heme proteins, heme provides a wide range of biological functions determined in part by the polypeptide associated to it (5Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Once released from heme proteins, free heme can amplify the cell damage and the inflammatory response (6Wagener F.A. Volk H.D. Willis D. Abraham N.G. Soares M.P. Adema G.J. Figdor C.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A hallmark of inflammation is the recruitment of leukocytes out of the vasculature to tissues. This process depends on the interplay of selected molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells occurring in several stages, the so-called three steps paradigm of cell migration (7Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Heme seems to affect this process in several ways: (a) inducing cell adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells; (b) increasing vascular permeability; (c) enhancing chemokine expression and secretion; (d) inducing migration of leukocytes, especially neutrophils (6Wagener F.A.

It has been assumed and widely accepted that the mechanism by which heme exerts its damaging effects relies on its amphipathic nature, allowing heme to intercalate the cell or organelle membranes, and on its pro-oxidant effects (6Wagener F.A.

The ability of heme to induce neutrophil migration in vitro indicates that heme is a chemoattractant. To date, the nature of neutrophil chemoattractants includes a variety of peptides (for example, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, C3a and C5a, and CXC chemokines) and lipids (for example, PAF and LTB4), which are, without exception, ligands of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to a Gα inhibitory (Gαi) protein sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) (12Rot A. von Andrian U. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 891-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Binding and activation of these receptors activate Gαi protein, PI3K, and MAPKs, stimulating neutrophil migration (13Heit B. Tavener S. Raharjo E. Kubes P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Uriarte S. Powell D.W. Singh S. Butt W. Chen Q. McLeish K.R. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that heme acts on neutrophil migration by activating a Gαi-coupled receptor. In this study, we show the structural requirements by which porphyrins affect neutrophil migration in vitro and promote inflammation in vivo. Several heme analogs were able to induce neutrophil migration, whereas mesoporphyrins, molecules lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited the migration induced by heme. The neutrophil migration and ROS production induced by heme were inhibited by pertussis toxin, thus indicating the involvement of a Gαi protein. The use of selective inhibitors indicates that heme activates neutrophils through signaling pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules. Together, these results suggest that heme activates neutrophils through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Mice—C57BL/6 mice supplied by the breeding facilities of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were housed in temperature-controlled rooms and given water and food ad libitum until use. Care and handling of the animals were in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines. Materials—Heme and analog molecules were purchased from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT). Pertussis toxin, PD98059, SB203580, LY294002, U-73122, Y-27632, and bisindoylmaleimide IV were from Calbiochem. LPS (O111:B4), thioglycollate, and calphostin C were from Sigma-Aldrich. LTB4 and PAF were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Heme and Analogs—For in vivo neutrophil migration experiments, heme and analog molecule stock solutions (3 mg/ml) were made in NaOH and diluted in endotoxin-free saline solution immediately before use. For in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis experiments, heme and analog molecule stock solutions (5 mm) were made in NaOH and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium immediately before use. All these procedures were performed in the dark to avoid generation of free radicals. Human Neutrophil Isolation—Neutrophils were isolated from heparin-treated peripheral venous blood of healthy human volunteers using a gradient of Ficoll (Lymphoprep, Nycomed A/S). Erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis, and neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Neutrophil purity and viability were always higher than 97 and 99%, respectively. Neutrophil Chemotaxis—Chemotaxis was assayed in a 96-well chemotaxis microplate (ChemoTx System, Neuro-Probe, Inc.) or in a Transwell system (Corning) using 5-μm polycarbonate membrane. Inducers of neutrophil chemotaxis were added to the bottom wells in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 1% fetal calf serum. Neutrophils suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (5 × 104 cells/50 μl) were added to the top wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Following incubation, the migrated neutrophils were collected and counted on Neubauer chambers. Neutrophil migration toward RPMI 1640 medium alone (random chemotaxis) was used as negative control, and migration toward 1 nm leukotriene B4 was used as positive control. To evaluate the involvement of inhibitory G protein, PI3K, MAPK (p38 and ERK), phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), and Rho kinase (RhoK) on heme-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, the cells were pretreated with selective inhibitors at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. The trypan blue exclusion assay was used to evaluate the viability of cells treated with these inhibitors, and at the end of incubation, the cellular viability was always higher than 97%. The chemotactic indices were calculated as the ratio of the number of migrated neutrophils in chemoattractant-containing wells divided by the number of neutrophils that migrated to RPMI 1640 medium alone. Assay of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation—Human neutrophils (106 cells/microtube) were pretreated with selective inhibitors of Gαi protein, PI3K, PLCβ, RhoK, and MAPKs. After that, cells were stimulated with 30 μm heme for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere and incubated with 2 μm 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) in Hanks’ balanced saline solution for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. ROS production was analyzed by flow citometry, using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Acute Peritonitis—Acute peritonitis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of heme (3-300 μg/cavity), protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (3-300 μg/cavity), Zn-, Sn-, Mn-, Co-PPIX, mesoporphyrin IX, iron and palladium mesoporphyrin. X (100 μg/cavity) in a volume of 200 μl. The control group received an intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin-free saline solution in a same volume. After 4 h of injection, the animals were killed under ether anesthesia, and their peritoneal cavities were rinsed with 3 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total leukocytes in the peritoneal fluid were determined on Neubauer chambers after dilution in Turk solution. Differential counting of leukocytes was carried out on Diff-Quik (Baxter Travenol Laboratories)-stained slices. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed using a statistical software package (GraphPad Prism 4). Statistical differences among the experimental groups were evaluated by analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls correction or with the Student’s t test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Heme Analogs Are Chemotactic for Neutrophils in Vitro—We took advantage of the existence of several heme analogs to determine the structural determinants on heme required to neutrophil migration. Initially, we characterized the dose-response effect of heme on human neutrophil migration in vitro. A typical bell-shape curve is observed, with the dose of 3 μm heme consistently inducing the best response (Fig. 1A). The lack of the atom of iron did not affect the ability of PPIX to cause a concentration-dependent chemotactic effect on neutrophils, similar to the observed effect of heme (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the porphyrin ring is the essential part of the heme molecule involved in the activation of neutrophils. On the other hand, mesoporphyrin IX was unable to induce the migration of neutrophils in vitro (Fig. 1C). Mesoporphyrin IX has a similar structure of PPIX but lacks the two vinyl groups, which are substituted by two ethyl groups. These results indicate that the induction of neutrophil migration by heme and its analogs requires the presence of the two vinyl groups but not the atom of iron. Heme Analogs Are Chemotactic for Neutrophils in Vivo—Intraperitoneal injection of heme induced in a dose-dependent fashion the recruitment of neutrophils 4 h after injection (Fig. 2A). The effect of heme (30 μg/cavity) in vivo was selective to neutrophils, and no increase of mononuclear cells recruitment was observed from 90 min to 48 h (Fig. 2B). Similar to heme, PPIX caused a dose-dependent recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, analogs of heme with a metal substitution were still capable of recruiting neutrophils (Fig. 2D). Again, similar to the in vitro chemotaxis assay, mesoporphyrins were not able to induce neutrophil migration in vivo (Fig. 2E). Mesoporphyrin IX Inhibits Heme-induced Neutrophil Migration in Vitro—On the basis of the result showing that mesoporphyrins were not able to induce neutrophil migration in vitro, we investigated whether the mesoporphyrin IX could act as an antagonist of heme. When heme was added together with increasing concentrations of mesoporphyrin IX, an almost complete inhibition of the heme-induced neutrophil migration was observed (Fig. 3A), suggesting that mesoporphyrins might act as antagonists of heme. In addition, when PAF, a neutrophil chemoattractant molecule, was added with mesoporphyrin IX, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 3B). Mesoporphyrin IX Inhibits the Neutrophil Recruitment Induced by Heme—Hemorrhagic episodes are associated with an inflammatory process, characterized by a prominent leukocyte infiltration, which can cause tissue injury (15Davenport R.D. Strieter R.M. Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. Blood. 1990; 76: 2439-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Davenport R.D. Kunkel S.L. Transfus. Med.

Scand. 1996; 75: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blood or heme injection caused neutrophil accumulation into the peritoneal cavity of mice, and pretreatment with mesoporphyrin IX abolished this recruitment (Fig. 4A). Treatment with mesoporphyrin IX did not interfere with neutrophil migration induced by LPS or thioglycollate (Fig. 4B), thus suggesting that the inhibitory effect of mesoporphyrin IX is selective to heme. The Effect of Heme on Neutrophil Migration Is Dependent of Signaling Pathways Characteristic of Chemoattractants—We used PTX to define the involvement of Gαi protein activation on heme-induced neutrophil migration. Pretreatment of neutrophils with PTX blocked the effect of heme on neutrophil migration in vitro (Fig. 5A). Next, we analyzed the involvement of signaling pathways directly or indirectly regulated by the Gβγ subunit (18Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Treatment with selective inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002), PLCβ (U-73122), Rho kinase (Y-27632), ERK (PD98059), and p38 (SB203580) profoundly impaired the migration induced by heme (Fig. 5, B-E). Cell viability at the end of the experiments was always higher than 97% for controls as well as for cells treated with these inhibitors. These results indicate the involvement of signaling pathways triggered by the activation of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to a Gαi protein. The Production of ROS by Heme Is Dependent of Gαi Protein and PI3K—We used a similar panel of inhibitors to define the pathways involved in heme-induced ROS generation. Pretreatment with PTX or LY294002 completely blocked the neutrophil production of ROS induced by heme (Fig. 6, A and B). On the other hand, U-73122, bis-indoylmaleimide IV, Y-27632, or SB203580 partially inhibited this effect of heme (Fig. 6, C-F). Finally, the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was ineffective in reducing the ROS production induced by heme (Fig. 6G). These results indicate a selective effect of distinct signaling pathways on neutrophil migration and ROS generation induced by heme. Several studies indicated the existence of cell surface proteins in mammalian cells able to bind heme, and recent publications identified specific cell surface proteins that directly interact with heme (20Galbraith R.A.

Heme binds to Slo1 channels and inhibits transmembrane K+ currents by decreasing the frequency of channel opening (23Tang X. Xu R. Reynolds M. Garcia M. Heinemann S. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This effect occurred when heme was applied at the intracellular side of the cell membrane but was ineffective when applied to the channels from the extracellular side. Similarly, the cell surface receptor for feline leukemia virus is an exporter of intracellular heme, affecting erythropoiesis (22Quigley J.G. Yang Z. Worthington M.T. Phillips J.D. Sabo K.M. Sabath D.E. Berg C.L. Sassa S. Wood B.L. Abkowitz J.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), whereas a heme importer has been recently identified in intestine epithelial cells (24Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A. McCann F.E. Hider R.C. Frazer D.M. Anderson G.J. Vulpe C.D. Simpson R.J. McKie A.T. Cell. 2005; 122: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that heme induces the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α on macrophages and dendritic cells dependently of TLR4, CD14, and myeloid differentiation protein-88 (MYD88) (25Figueiredo R.T. Fernandez P.L. Moura-Sa D.S. Dutra F.F. Alves L.S. Oliveira M.F. Oliveira P.L. Graça-Souza A.V. Bozza M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20221-20229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These studies clearly demonstrate that heme requires defined membrane receptors to affect selected cell functions. The agonistic and antagonistic effects of heme and its analogs, together with the inhibitory effect of PTX, support the concept of a physical interaction of the porphyrin ring with a GPCR. PPIX, which lacks a metal atom, as well as porphyrins with metal substitutions, were all able to induce neutrophil migration. Previous studies demonstrated that PPIX and other metal porphyrins are unable to affect the K+ current (23Tang X. Xu R. Reynolds M. Garcia M. Heinemann S. Hoshi T. Nature. 2003; 425: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) or the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α by macrophages (25Figueiredo R.T. Fernandez P.L. Moura-Sa D.S. Dutra F.F. Alves L.S. Oliveira M.F. Oliveira P.L. Graça-Souza A.V. Bozza M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20221-20229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In these situations, the iron is likely to be involved in the interaction of heme with the Slo1 channel and with TLR4. These results suggest that a putative GPCR involved in porphyrin recognition by neutrophils would be more promiscuous in its activating properties by these molecules when compared with the ion channel or TLR4. Mesoporphyrin IX had a dose-dependent antagonistic effect on heme-induced neutrophil migration in vitro, suggesting that this analog competes by the same binding site of heme. This effect of mesoporphyrin IX seems to be selective to heme since no inhibition of neutrophil migration was observed when PAF was used as neutrophil chemoattractant. Furthermore, mesoporphyrin IX inhibited the migration of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity induced by blood or heme but not the recruitment induced by LPS or thioglycollate, again supporting the contention that mesoporphyrin IX is a selective antagonist of heme. These results also suggest that migration of neutrophils induced by hemorrhagic episodes might be dependent on heme activating a GPCR. The vinyl groups are known to be important to the association of heme with heme proteins, including cytochrome c (26Daltrop O. Allen J. Willis A. Ferguson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the vinyl groups of heme form thioether bonds with cysteine residues of cytochrome c. Moreover, the vinyl groups are highly hydrophobic, thus facilitating the interaction of the porphyrin ring with selected protein regions or with cell membranes. Future studies are required to define the molecular mechanism involved in mesoporphyrin IX inhibitory effects on heme-induced neutrophil activation. It has been previously shown that neutrophil migration induced by heme requires PKC activity (8Graça-Souza A.V. Arruda M.A. Freitas M. Barja-Fidalgo C. Oliveira P. Blood. 2002; 99: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We now extended this observation by showing that besides the requirement of Gαi, heme also activates PI3K, PLCβ, RhoK, ERK, and p38 to induce the migration of neutrophils. These pathways were analyzed because they are known to be downstream of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to Gαi protein. In fact, various neutrophil chemoattractants such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, LTB4, C5a, and interleukin-8 activate Gαi protein, PI3K, and MAPKs to stimulate neutrophil migration (13Heit B. Tavener S. Raharjo E. Kubes P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Coxon P.Y. Rane M.J. Uriarte S. Powell D.W. Singh S. Butt W. Chen Q. McLeish K.R. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The βγ subunits released from the Gαi directly couple to effector molecules such as PLCβ and PI3K and indirectly couple to the small GTPase Ras to activate MAPKs (18Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). As we demonstrated, PLCβ, PKC, PI3K, RhoK, and MAPK signaling pathways are involved in heme-induced neutrophil migration. Interestingly, the generation of ROS by heme requires Gαi and PI3K. This effect was partially dependent on PLCβ, PKC, RhoK, and p38 but independent of ERK. Our results indicate that heme acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant, activating Gαi protein and inducing signaling pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules. A previous study has shown that heme protects neutrophils from apoptosis dependently of PI3K and MAPK pathways, thus suggesting that similar signaling pathways might be involved in heme-induced neutrophil survival and migration (11Arruda M.A. Rossi A.G. Freitas M.S. Barja-Fidalgo C. Graça-Souza A.V. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PKC activation by heme could be a downstream event of the release of βγ subunits from an activated Gαi protein (19Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In fact, our results with a PLCβ inhibitor support this concept. A second possibility is that PKC is activated as a consequence of ROS generation. It is known that superoxide anion, redox-cycling quinones, and periodate can directly activate PKC (27Kass G.E.N. Duddy S.K. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One could envisage the following scenario: heme activates neutrophil Gαi protein, inducing migration and ROS production, which in turn activates adjacent cells through PKC, thus amplifying the inflammatory response. It will be important to further define and discriminate the signaling events involved in the effects of heme on neutrophil physiology. Our results, however, do not prove the requirement of a GPCR for the observed heme effects on neutrophils. Because of its amphipathic nature, heme could also intercalate the lipid membrane activating the Gαi protein directly inside the cell. In fact, G proteins and ion channels, among other membrane proteins, are mechanosensitive to specific amphipathic molecules (29Gudi S.R. Lee A.A. Clark C.B. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274 (-C1428): C1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Suchyna T.M. Besch S.R. Sachs F. Phys. Biol. 2004; 1: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been shown that human neuroglobin, a heme protein, is able to bind directly to the α subunit of the Gαi protein in vitro (31Wakasugi K. Nakano T. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36505-36512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the requirement and identity of a putative GPCR for the effect of heme on neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. During hemolysis, free vascular hemoglobin became associated with its scavenger haptoglobin, which in turn binds to CD163 on macrophages, promoting the endocytosis of the complex (32Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). However, hemoglobin can be rapidly converted into methemoglobin, which liberates heme. The pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory nature of heme requires an efficient system of transport and degradation to avoid cellular damage. Several species produce heme binding plasma proteins, such as hemopexin or albumin, which bind and remove the intravascular free heme (33Muller-Eberhard U. Fraig M. Am. J. Hematol. 1993; 42: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, when large amounts of heme accumulate, the scavengers get overwhelmed or are unable to reach them, as in the case of extravascular deposition of heme (2Muller-Eberhard U. Javid J. Liem H.H. Hanstein A. Hanna M. Blood. 1968; 32: 811-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jacob H.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 808-816PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jeney V. Balla J. Yachie A. Varga Z. Vercellotti G.M. Eaton J.W. Balla G. Blood. 2002; 100: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used concentrations of heme, in vitro and in vivo, compatible with concentrations observed during hemorrhagic and hemolytic episodes, indicating that the mechanism of neutrophil recruitment and activation we are describing might be clinically relevant. Interestingly, a recent study indicates that heme is critically involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria affecting the blood-brain barrier integrity and causing neuro-inflammation (34Pamplona A. Ferreira A. Balla J. Jeney V. Balla G. Epiphanio S. Chora A. Rodrigues C.D. Gregoire I.P. Cunha-Rodrigues M. Portugal S. Soares M.P. Mota M.M. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Considering the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria, we speculate that the mechanism by which heme potentiates neuro-inflammation might involve activation of Gαi protein in these leukocytes. The molecular mechanisms of heme-induced inflammation during cerebral malaria require further characterization. In conclusion, our results suggest that heme released in situations of hemorrhage or hemolysis acts as a chemoattractant, which can stimulate neutrophil migration and ROS generation through Gαi protein and selected down-stream signaling pathways, thus amplifying the inflammatory response. The characterization of mesoporphyrins as selective antagonists of heme will allow defining the role of endogenous heme on inflammatory conditions triggered by intra- and extravascular hemolysis or extensive cell damage as in sickle cell anemia, trauma, malaria, hemorrhagic fevers, and leptospirosis. Furthermore, mesoporphyrins might prove valuable in the treatment of the inflammatory consequences of hemorrhagic and hemolytic disorders.

Although many studies have been dedicated to CDO, resulting in the identification of its gene and even characterization of the tertiary structure of the protein, relatively little is known about cysteamine dioxygenase. The failure to identify the gene for this protein has significantly hampered our understanding of the metabolism of cysteamine, a product of the constitutive degradation of coenzyme A, and the synthesis of taurine, the final product of cysteamine oxidation and the second most abundant amino acid in mammalian tissues. In this study we identified a hypothetical murine protein homolog of CDO (hereafter called ADO) that is encoded by the gene Gm237 and belongs to the DUF1637 protein family. When expressed as a recombinant protein, ADO exhibited significant cysteamine dioxygenase activity in vitro. The reaction was highly specific for cysteamine; cysteine was not oxidized by the enzyme, and structurally related compounds were not competitive inhibitors of the reaction. When overexpressed in HepG2/C3A cells, ADO increased the production of hypotaurine from cysteamine. Similarly, when endogenous expression of the human ADO ortholog C10orf22 in HepG2/C3A cells was reduced by RNA-mediated interference, hypotaurine production decreased. Western blots of murine tissues with an antibody developed against ADO showed that the protein is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle.

Because of their reactivity, free sulfhydryl groups are highly susceptible to oxidation that results in the formation of disulfides, sulfenates, sulfinates, and sulfonates. Many of these reactions occur nonenzymatically, principally as a consequence of adventitious free radicals arising from aerobic respiration. Nevertheless, there are a small number of thiol oxidation reactions that are known to occur directly via enzymatic catalysis. The enzymes that catalyze these reactions show a high degree of substrate specificity and confer to cells the advantage of being able to precisely regulate the level of a particular reduced thiol. One interesting subset of the enzymes capable of specifically oxidizing free sulfhydryl groups are the thiol dioxygenases. In mammals this family comprises only two known proteins: cysteine dioxygenase (CDO, 3The abbreviations used are:CDOcysteine dioxygenaseADO2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenaseSSAsulfosalicylic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNA duplexesMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidORFopen reading frameWTwild type. 3The abbreviations used are:CDOcysteine dioxygenaseADO2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenaseSSAsulfosalicylic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNA duplexesMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidORFopen reading frameWTwild type. EC 1.13.11.20) and cysteamine dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.19). CDO adds two atoms of oxygen to free cysteine to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, whereas cysteamine dioxygenase adds two atoms of oxygen to free cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) to form hypotaurine (Fig. 1). The activities for these two proteins were first reported in mammalian tissues almost 40 years ago (1Ewetz L. Sorbo B. Biochim. Biophys.

Since that time, however, progress in our understanding of the two enzymes has been markedly unequal.

The CDO gene has been cloned from a diverse array of species ranging from bacteria to mammals (3Hirschberger L.L. Daval S. Stover P.J. Stipanuk M.H.

Studies with purified recombinant protein have allowed the kinetic constants of the enzyme to be determined, have established that there is a strict substrate specificity for cysteine, and have also verified that CDO requires a ferrous iron cofactor for activity (6Dominy J.E.

In terms of the larger physiological role of CDO, it has become generally accepted that CDO plays an important part in the homeostatic regulation of steady-state free cysteine levels as well as in the provision of important oxidized metabolites of cysteine such as sulfate, hypotaurine, and taurine (9Stipanuk M.H.

These studies confirmed that CDO is a member of the cupin superfamily, a superfamily that encompasses many functionally diverse proteins including auxin-binding protein, mannose-6-phosphate isomerase, and hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase. Members of this family possess a β-sandwich central domain with a jelly roll topology and two primary consensus sequence motifs designated as cupin motif 1 (GX5HXHX3,4EX6G) and cupin motif 2 (GX5PXGX2HX3N) separated by an intermotif distance of 15–50 amino acids (16Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Many cupin proteins are capable of binding a transition metal, which often is a required cofactor in the biological activity of the protein, and do so using the residues highlighted in bold as ligands. CDO, however, is unusual among the cupins because it is missing the conserved glutamate of cupin motif 1 (Fig. 2A). CDO instead binds its iron co-factor using only the three histidine residues of its cupin motifs. This departure from other canonical cupin proteins, in conjunction with other variants in primary amino acid sequence such as the number of residues making up the intermotif distance and poor conservation of cupin motif 2, suggest that CDO may constitute a separate evolutionary clade within the cupin superfamily (16Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast to the panoply of research conducted on CDO, little is known about cysteamine dioxygenase. The substrate for this protein, cysteamine, is constitutively produced by all tissues as a consequence of the degradation of coenzyme A, an acyl carrier group required for many metabolic processes. The gene for cysteamine dioxygenase has never been identified, and efforts to purify the protein from various tissues have resulted in conflicting reports about its molecular weight, specific activity, and cofactor requirements (2Cavallini D. Scandurra R. Demarco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2999-3005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rotilio G. Federici G. Calabrese L. Costa M. Cavallini D. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, recent work has shown that many tissues are capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine, and cysteamine dioxygenase could, therefore, be a quantitatively important contributor to the synthesis of hypotaurine and taurine in vivo (19Coloso R.M. Hirschberger L.L. Dominy J.E. Lee J.I. Stipanuk M.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 583: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that cyst(e)amine could serve as an endogenous regulator of immune system activity (20Berruyer C. Martin F.M. Castellano R. Macone A. Malergue F. Garrido-Urbani S. Millet V.

For these reasons, understanding the pathways by which cysteamine is metabolized is a physiologically important endeavor. Given that both CDO and cysteamine dioxygenase use a thiol substrate and catalyze a similar reaction, one might reasonably hypothesize that they may share a phylogenetic connection. Although there have been no previous reports of a closely related homolog to CDO in mammals, a PSI-BLAST search (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar) using murine CDO as a query sequence revealed that there is a hypothetical murine cupin protein of unknown function encoded by the gene Gm237 (GI:88984114, protein accession number Q6PDY2, hereafter referred to as protein ADO for 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase) that shares a low yet significant degree of overall identity (14.2%; e-value = 7 × 10–5 after 3 PSI-BLAST iterations) to CDO (Fig. 2A). ADO, like other cupins, contains two conserved cupin motifs but, like CDO, is missing the highly conserved glutamate residue found in motif 1 of many other metal binding cupins. In this report we sought to test whether ADO is a thiol dioxygenase with specificity for cysteamine. The protein was cloned, heterologously expressed, purified, and tested for its ability to catalyze the dioxygenation of cysteamine and several of its structural analogs. These data in combination with overexpression and RNA-mediated interference studies in a mammalian cell culture system and Western blot analysis of murine tissues suggest that ADO is in fact a proficient cysteamine dioxygenase expressed in many mammalian tissues. Cloning of ADO and Construction of Expression Plasmids— cDNA for ADO was prepared from an I.M.A.G.E. Consortium mouse cDNA clone (designation 5721417) obtained from ATCC. The construct, which contained cDNA for the mature mRNA of ADO cloned into the NotI/NotI regions of the pYX-ASC vector, was digested with NotI and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the appropriate size of the predicted mRNA insert (3849 bp). The sequence of the 771-bp putative open reading frame (ORF) contained within the cDNA was verified before subsequent cloning work. For the purpose of producing recombinant protein in bacterial expression systems, the ORF of ADO was cloned into the pET SUMO expression vector (Invitrogen) and pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). Cloning into the pET SUMO construct was done using the Champion pET SUMO protein expression system kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for this procedure were 5′-ATGCCCCGCGACAACATGGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCAAGGTAGGACCTTGGGGC-3′ (reverse primer). A point mutation, hypothesized to ablate enzyme activity, was also prepared from the wild-type pET SUMO ADO construct in which His-95 was converted to an alanine. The mutation was introduced using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primer set 5′-CGTGCATCCCGCTGGCCGACCACCCGGGCA-3′ (forward)/5′-TGCCCGGGTGGTCGGCCAGCGGGATGCACG-3′ (reverse) with the mutated His-95 codon underlined. Both wild-type and H95A pET SUMO expression plasmids were sequence verified and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells (Novagen) for protein production. For insertion into the pQE30 vector, ADO ORF was first amplified via PCR using the following primers (introduced restriction sites are underlined, and the name is indicated in parentheses): 5′-GCGGATCCATGCCCCGCGACAACATGGC-3′ (BamHI) and 5′-CCAAGCTTTCAAGGTAGGACCTTGGGGCC-3′ (HindIII). The amplicon was then digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted by T4 DNA ligase into pQE30 linearized by BamHI/HindIII double digestion. Sequence verified plasmid was transformed into E. coli M15 competent cells (Qiagen) for protein expression. For the production of epitope-tagged protein in mammalian cell culture, ADO was subcloned into the pCMV-3 × FLAG vector (Sigma). The ORF was first amplified using the forward primer 5′-CCAAGCTTATGCCCCGCGACAACATGGCC-3′ to create a HindIII restriction site (underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CCGGATCCTCAAGGTAGGACCTTGGGGCC-3′ to introduce a BamHI restriction site. The amplicon was then digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted by T4 DNA ligase into pCMV-3 × FLAG plasmid that was linearized by BamHI/HindIII double digestion. An H95A mutant of the wild-type pCMV-3 × FLAG ADO construct was also generated by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit and the same primer set used to mutate the pET SUMO ADO construct. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification for Enzyme Activity Assays—Enzyme generated from the pET SUMO expression system was used for activity assays. With this expression system, ADO contained an N-terminal SUMO tag that substantially enhanced the solubility of the protein, which otherwise exhibited a tendency to aggregate and precipitate out of solution. A typical protein preparation was performed from 4 liters of bacterial culture. For protein expression, cells were grown in 2× Luria broth (LB) media at 37 °C containing 50 μgml–1 kanamycin. The cells were cultured to an A600 of ∼0.6 at which point expression of ADO was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Post-induction the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h and were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C until further processing was done. To lyse cells a total of 60 ml of lysis buffer (final pH 8.0) containing 20 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween, 250 mm NaCl, and one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was added to the frozen cell pellets, which were then incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min to thaw. After thawing, cells were resuspended and then lysed by sonication with an Ultrasonic Sonicator (Misonix). The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.2-μm syringe filter and applied onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. A stepwise gradient of increasing imidazole concentration was generated by using two buffers, 20 mm Tris (final pH 8.0), 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween and 250 mm NaCl (IMAC Buffer A) and 20 mm Tris (final pH 8.0), 500 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween, and 250 mm NaCl (IMAC Buffer B). The enzyme separated into 2 distinct peaks, one requiring 50 mm imidazole (10% IMAC Buffer A) for elution and the second eluting with 100 mm imidazole (20% IMAC Buffer B). Although initial tests showed similar cysteamine dioxygenase activities for the two peaks, only protein from the first peak was used in this study. The pooled fractions from peak 1 were concentrated to <2 ml and applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The elution volume of the peak fractions containing ADO from this step was consistent with a molecular weight for a single ADO monomer. The homogeneously purified ADO peak fractions were then pooled, concentrated, and analyzed for purity on a NuPAGE 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). Wild-type and H95A ADO proteins were purified in an identical fashion and exhibited similar chromatographic profiles. The relative purity for each construct after the 2-step purification was estimated to be >95% and is shown in (Fig. 3). A typical preparation of ADO yielded ∼2–3 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. Enzyme Activity Assays—In the standard assay conditions for cysteamine dioxygenase activity, 0–3 μm recombinant ADO was incubated in the presence of 50 mm Tris borate buffer and 8.0 mm cysteamine HCl (Sigma) in a total volume of 400 μl (final pH 8.0). Before the addition of enzyme, the reaction mixture was preheated to 37 °C in microcentrifuge tubes. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, and tubes were placed in an Eppendorf thermomixer (Brinkmann Instruments) for 3 min with shaking at 900 rpm. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 200 μl of 5% w/v sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Hypotaurine production was measured by derivatization of sample with o-phthaldialdehyde and detection of derivatized products by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection as previously described (19Coloso R.M. Hirschberger L.L. Dominy J.E. Lee J.I. Stipanuk M.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 583: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under our standard assay conditions we found that a small amount (<10%) of hypotaurine was spontaneously oxidized to taurine. For this reason taurine levels were also quantified and included in calculations of enzyme activity values. Deviations from the standard assay conditions, such as those used for the determination of pH optima and linearity of rate of product formation with time, are noted in the figure legends. Blanks were conducted for all of the experimental conditions tested and consisted of reactions wherein enzyme was left out. Mammalian Transfection Studies—HepG2/C3A hepatoma cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates 24 h before transfection. Cells at a confluency of ∼95% were transfected with empty pCMV-3 × FLAG vector (4 μg), vector with wild-type ADO insert (2, 3, or 4 μg), or vector with H95A mutant ADO insert (4 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). To some cultures cystamine was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm 6 h after transfection. Cystamine is a disulfide form of cysteamine that is efficiently taken up by cells and reduced to cysteamine intracellularly (23Qiu L. Zhang M. Sturm R.A. Gardiner B. Tonks I. Kay G. Parsons P.G. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection for Western blot analysis and measurement of intracellular hypotaurine/taurine content by HPLC. For Western blot analysis, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested into TNESV lysis solution, which consisted of 50 mm Tris (final pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The contents of each well were scraped into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at ∼14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was frozen and stored at –80 °C until Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was performed. For hypotaurine analysis cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 5% SSA. Acid extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g, and hypotaurine analysis of the acid supernatant was carried out using the same HPLC protocol used for activity assays. Pellets from the acid extracts were neutralized overnight by the addition of 1 n NaOH and then quantified for protein content via the bicinchonic acid assay kit (Pierce). Protein levels were used for the normalization of cellular hypotaurine content. Metal Analysis of Recombinant ADO Protein—The metal content of purified recombinant wild-type and H95A ADO proteins was assayed by plasma emission spectroscopy using Cornell University's United States Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory services and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry using Cornell University's Metabolic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory services. Small Interfering RNA Duplexes (siRNA) Studies—Three siRNAs designed to knock down the expression of C10orf22, the human ADO homolog expressed in HepG2/C3A cells, were obtained from Ambion. The sense sequences for these siRNAs (5′ → 3′), which target exon 1 of C10orf22, are as follows: GCUGAAUGUGUUAUGCUUC (siRNA #1), GGAACUUUAAUGUUCCCGA (siRNA #2), and GCAAAUACUUGGUGAGUGA (siRNA #3). A pre-designed siRNA (Silencer® Negative Control #1, Ambion) with limited sequence similarity with human genes was also used in this study as a negative control. Knockdown of C10orf22 expression required three iterative transfections, with each successive transfection separated by 24 h. For each round of transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 was used to deliver 40 pmol of the appropriate siRNA duplex to each well except for mock-transfected groups, which received vehicle only. HepG2/C3A cells were initially seeded into 6-well culture plates 24 h before the first round of transfection with siRNAs. At the time of the first transfection, cells were ∼30% confluent. Six hours after the last round of transfection, cystamine was added to each well at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cells were harvested 24 h later for Western blot and amino acid analysis as described above in the “Mammalian Transfection Studies” under “Experimental Procedures.” Antibody Generation and Western Blot Procedures—The pQE30-ADO construct, which produced ADO protein fused with a simple His6 N-terminal tag, was used for antibody production only. E. coli strain M15 (Qiagen) transformed with the pQE30-ADO construct were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until an A600 of ∼0.6 was reached. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37°Cand then harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm K2HPO4 (final pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture, and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and then lysed by sonication. Lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was clarified by filtration through a 0.45-μm membrane. Clarified supernatant was loaded onto a gravity column packed with a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and then washed with 14 column volumes of 50 mm K2HPO4 (final pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture followed by 4 column volumes of 50 mm K2HPO4 (final pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole. Protein was finally eluted in 50 mm K2HPO4 (final pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed at 4 °C in a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Pierce) overnight against a solution containing 50 mm K2HPO4 (final pH 7.6) and 250 mm NaCl. Dialyzed protein was concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff Centricon centrifugal filter unit (Millipore), and protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. With prolonged storage at 4 °C, pQE30-ADO protein had a tendency to aggregate and precipitate out of solution. Although this was not a problem for the production of antibody, it precluded the use of the fusion protein for enzyme activity assays. Purified protein was sent to Pacific Immunology, Inc. (Ramona, CA) for polyclonal antibody production in New Zealand White rabbits. Immune sera generated from the rabbits were screened against pre-immune sera to verify the generation of specific antibodies. After this screen, the IgG fraction from the immune sera was purified by column chromatography using Protein A-coupled agarose (Affi-Gel Protein A MAPS II system, Bio-Rad). To evaluate the expression of ADO protein in mouse, various tissues were harvested from adult male C57/Bl6 mice and homogenized (10–20% w/v) in ice-cold TNESV lysis buffer with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble debris. The supernatants from these centrifuged samples were collected and stored at –80 °C until Western blot analysis could be performed. Statistical Methods—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by comparison of means with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Differences were accepted as significant at p ≤ 0.05. Each value reported in graphs is presented as the mean ± S.D. Purified ADO Shows Cysteamine Dioxygenase Activity—Recombinant wild-type (WT) ADO was initially tested for cysteamine dioxygenase activity simply by adding it to a buffered solution containing cysteamine and then measuring the formation of hypotaurine at various pH values (Fig. 4). This procedure departed in two notable ways from that described in much of the earlier literature on the measurement of cysteamine dioxygenase activity in tissues or purified protein (2Cavallini D.

However, the molecular mechanism by which glucocorticoids shorten osteocyte life span has remained heretofore unknown. We report that apoptosis of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone is abolished by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, but not by inhibition of protein or RNA synthesis. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis is preceded by a decrease in the number of cytoplasmic processes, an indicator of cell detachment. In addition, the focal adhesion kinase FAK prevents dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, whereas the FAK-related kinase Pyk2 increases the basal levels of apoptosis. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis is also prevented in cells expressing kinase-deficient or phosphorylation-defective (Y402F) dominant negative mutants of Pyk2. Consistent with the requirement of tyrosine 402, dexamethasone induces rapid Pyk2 phosphorylation in this residue. Moreover, knocking down Pyk2 expression abolishes apoptosis and cell detachment induced by dexamethasone, and transfection with human Pyk2 rescues both responses. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis as well as cell detachment by dexamethasone is abolished by inhibiting the activity of JNK, a recognized downstream target of Pyk2 activation. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids promote osteocyte apoptosis via a receptor-mediated mechanism that does not require gene transcription and that is mediated by rapid activation of Pyk2 and JNK, followed by inside-out signaling that leads to cell detachment-induced apoptosis or anoikis.

Glucocorticoids, produced and released by the adrenal glands in response to stress, regulate numerous physiological processes in a wide range of tissues (1Necela B.M. Cidlowski J.A. Proc. Am. Thorac.

Among many other effects, these hormones exert profound immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions and induce apoptosis of many cell types, including T lymphocytes and monocytes. Because of these properties, glucocorticoids are extensively used for the treatment of immune and inflammatory conditions, the management of organ transplantation, and as components of chemotherapy regimens for hematological cancers. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with severe adverse side effects manifested in several organs. In particular, prolonged use of these drugs leads to a dramatic loss of bone mineral and strength, similar to endogenous elevation of glucocorticoids (3Newell-Price J. Bertagna X. Grossman A.B.

Evidence accumulated during the past few years has indicated that increased prevalence of apoptosis of osteocytes (and osteoblasts) is associated with the glucocorticoid-induced bone fragility syndrome (7Weinstein R.S.

Such actions include modulation of the activity of intracellular kinases like the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) (12Druilhe A.

Pyk2, also known as related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase, cellular adhesion kinase β, or calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (18Xiong W. Parsons J.T. J.

Although Pyk2 and FAK are highly homologous, these proteins exhibit opposite effects on cell fate. Thus, whereas FAK activation leads to cell spreading and survival (20Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), Pyk2 induces reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell detachment, and apoptosis (18Xiong W.

Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Consistent with these lines of evidence, we have recently demonstrated that mechanical stimulation promotes osteocyte survival by activating FAK (21Plotkin L.I. Mathov I. Aguirre J.I. Parfitt A.M. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289 (-C643): C633Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We now report that glucocorticoids promote osteocyte apoptosis by activating Pyk2 and JNK, hence opposing FAK-induced survival. These changes lead to cell detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis). This action of glucocorticoids is exerted via a receptor-mediated mechanism, but it is independent of new gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, etoposide, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, RU486, SB203580, wortmannin, EGTA, and gadolinium chloride were purchased from Sigma; SP600125 and nifedipine from EMD Biosciences, Inc.

Cells were transiently transfected with a total amount of DNA of 0.1 μg/cm2 using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as previously described (22Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A.

The efficiency of transfection was ∼60%.Cell Culture—Wild type MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells derived from murine long bones and MLO-Y4 cells stably transfected with nGFP were cultured as previously described (11Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30Kato Y. Windle J.J. Koop B.A. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Inhibition of RNA or Protein Synthesis—MLO-Y4 cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine or [3H]uridine for 2.5 h, followed by addition of 1 μm cycloheximide or 2 μm actinomycin D. After 7.5 h, cells were scraped off the plates, protein and RNA were precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was quantified. Protein concentration was determined using a detergent compatible Bio-Rad kit. [3H]Leucine or [3H]uridine incorporation was expressed as counts/min/μg of protein.Quantification of Apoptotic Cells—Apoptosis was induced in semi-confluent cultures (less than 75% confluence) by treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (1 μm) or with etoposide (50 μm) for the indicated times. Cells were incubated for 2.5 h with cycloheximide or actinomycin D, or for 30 min with inhibitors or Ca2+ modulators, before addition of the pro-apoptotic agents. Apoptosis was assessed by trypan blue uptake or by enumerating MLO-Y4 cells expressing nGFP or nRFP exhibiting chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation under a fluorescence microscope, as previously reported (11Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also quantified by measuring caspase 3 activation in cells transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding a caspase 3 sensor fusion protein along with nRFP, as previously reported (31Plotkin L.I. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. Bone. 2006; 39: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Almeida M. Han L. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. J. Biol.

Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The caspase 3 sensor consists of enhanced YFP fused to the amino acid sequence cleaved by caspase 3 (DEVD), and also contains a dominant N-terminal nuclear export signal and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. In living cells in which caspase 3 is inactive, the nuclear export sequence prevails and the fluorescent protein localizes in the cytoplasm. In apoptotic cells, the active caspase 3 cleaves off the protein at the DEVD sequence, removing the nuclear export sequence resulting in nuclear localization of the fluorescent caspase 3 sensor. The percentage of cells with increased caspase 3 activity was determined by analyzing under a fluorescence microscope the subcellular localization of the caspase 3 sensor. At least 250 cells from fields selected by systematic random sampling for each experimental condition were examined in all apoptosis assays.Quantification of Cell Detachment—The effect of dexamethasone or etoposide on cell detachment was quantified by enumerating the number of cytoplasmic processes of MLO-Y4 cells expressing GFP. Cells were classified in two groups: those having 3 or less (≤3) and those having more than 3 cytoplasmic processes. Data are expressed as percentage of cells with ≤3 cytoplasmic processes.H&E and Actin Staining—MLO-Y4 cells were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) following standard procedures. Cells then were dehydrated, mounted using Eukitt mounting medium (Electron Microscopy sciences, Washington, PA), and visualized by phase microscopy. For actin filament visualization, cells were fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to block unspecific staining. Actin filaments were stained with 5 units/ml phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 555 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min, as previously described (34Carter C.A. Bellido T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy.Small Interfering RNA—The expression of murine Pyk2 or the irrelevant protein lamin A/C was silenced by treating for 3 h MLO-Y4 cells with 280 nm of the corresponding small interfering RNA (Custom SMARTpool, Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO). Two days after silencing, Pyk2 expression was recovered by transfection with human Pyk2-GFP or with GFP as negative control. The pro-apoptotic agents were added 2 days after transfection and apoptosis and cell detachment were quantified after 6 h.Western Blot Analysis—Protein lysates from MLO-Y4 cells were prepared as previously reported (11Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblottings were performed using a rabbit anti-phosphorylated Pyk2 antibody (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) or rabbit anti-Pyk2 antibody that recognizes both the human and murine protein (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Human GFP-Pyk2 expression was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). β-Actin was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). After incubation with primary antibodies, blots were exposed to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and developed using a chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). The intensity of the bands was quantified using the Versadoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad).Real Time PCR—Total RNA was obtained using Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Reverse transcription was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit. Primers and probes for the housekeeping gene ChoB (probe, 5′-TCCAGAGCAGGATCC-3′, forward primer, CCCAGGATGGCGACGAT and reverse primer, CCGAATGCTGTAATGGCGTAT) (Assay-by-Design service) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assay for murine Pyk2 (Mm00552840_m1) were used. The PCR was performed using 20 μl of Gene Expression Assay Mix TaqMan Universal Master Mix containing 80 ng of each cDNA template in triplicates, using an ABI 7300 Real Time PCR system. The -fold change in expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt comparative threshold cycle method. All the reagents were from Applied Biosystems.Image Acquisition—Fluorescent images were collected on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope or an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy, Gottingen, Germany) with a LD A-Plan, ×32/0.40 lens and a low light camera (Polaroid DMC Ie, Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, MA), using filter sets for GFP, YFP, or RFP, and the Image-Pro Plus acquisition software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Confocal images were obtained with an Axiovert LSM410 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM410) using the 568-nm line of an Argon-Krypton laser and a 590-nm long pass emission filter.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the Student-Newman-Keuls method was used to estimate the level of significance of differences between means.RESULTSGlucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis Does Not Require New Gene Transcription and It Is Mediated by the GR—We and others have previously demonstrated that glucocorticoids induce apoptosis of osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells (11Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 29Plotkin L.I. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8648-8657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 35Kogianni G. Mann V. Ebetino F. Nuttall M. Nijweide P. Simpson H. Noble B. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 2879-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have used this cell model herein to gain insight into the mechanism of the pro-apoptotic effect of glucocorticoids. We found that dexamethasone induced apoptosis even in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 1A); even though [3H]leucine or [3H]uridine incorporation into proteins or RNA were effectively blocked (21.4 ± 0.8 and 9.6 ± 5.1% of control cultures, respectively). The pro-apoptotic effect of etoposide on osteocytic cells, used here for comparison, was similarly unaffected by the presence of the protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors (Fig. 1A).To determine whether the GR was required for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in osteocytic cells, we examined the effect of dexamethasone in the presence of RU486, a GR antagonist (36Agarwal M.K. Hainque B. Moustaid N. Lazer G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by 6 h treatment with dexamethasone was absent in cells pre-treated with RU486, whereas apoptosis induced by etoposide was not affected, demonstrating the specificity of the receptor antagonist on the glucocorticoid effect (Fig. 1B).Microscopic examination revealed a profound effect of dexamethasone on the shape of MLO-Y4 cells. Based on this observation, we set up experiments to quantify the phenomenon by evaluating the number of cytoplasmic processes, as an indicator of cell rounding and detachment. Six-h treatments with dexamethasone increased the percentage of cells with ≤3 cytoplasmic processes, and this effect was absent in cells pre-treated with RU486 (Fig. 1C), indicating that cell detachment is also mediated by the GR. Taken together, these results indicate that the pro-apoptotic effect of glucocorticoids does not require new gene transcription, is mediated by the GR, and it is associated with cell detachment.Cell Detachment Precedes Induction of Osteocyte Apoptosis by Glucocorticoids—To determine whether cell detachment preceded or followed dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, time course experiments were performed in which apoptosis and cell detachment were evaluated in the same cultures. Apoptosis induced by dexamethasone was first detected 3 h after the addition of the hormone (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting ≤3 cytoplasmic processes was detected as early as 1 h after addition of the glucocorticoid (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, etoposide-induced apoptosis was detected after 3–6 h, but cell detachment could not be seen until 24 h of treatment (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3A). Representative images of cultures treated for 6 h with the agents depicting apoptotic and morphologic changes are shown in Figs. 2 and 3A, respectively.FIGURE 2Time course of glucocorticoid-induced osteocyte apoptosis. Cells were incubated with vehicle (veh), dexamethasone (dex), or etoposide (etop) for the indicated times. Apoptosis was quantified by determining the percentage of MLO-GFP cells exhibiting nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation (A) or the percentage of MLO-Y4 cells in which the YFP-caspase 3 sensor (green) co-localized with nRFP (red), seen orange in the merged images (B). C, MLO-GFP cells were treated with vehicle or DEVD before addition of the pro-apoptotic agents. The percent of apoptotic cells was determined as in A.

A, cells were incubated with vehicle (veh), dexamethasone (dex), or etoposide (etop) for the indicated times. Cell detachment was quantified in MLO-GFP cells as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative images of MLO-GFP or MLO-Y4 cells stained with H&E show the morphologic changes observed after 6 h of treatment. B, actin filament reorganization was visualized in MLO-Y4 cells by confocal microcopy of cells stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 555. C, MLO-GFP cells were treated with vehicle or DEVD before addition of the pro-apoptotic agents. Cell detachment was quantified as in A. Bars represent mean ±S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Retraction of osteocyte cytoplasmic processes and cell rounding induced by dexamethasone was also revealed by actin reorganization visualized by confocal microscopy of cells stained with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated phalloidin (Fig. 3B). Indeed, the glucocorticoid-induced disruption of stress fibers and formation of peripheral actin rings as early as 1 h and these changes were maintained throughout the 24-h culture. In contrast, cells treated with etoposide only showed changes in actin filament organization after 24 h.Consistent with previous observations by us (11Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), apoptosis induced by either dexamethasone or etoposide (measured at 6 or 24 h) was inhibited by the cell permeable caspase 3 inhibitor DEVD (Fig. 2C). However, DEVD did not prevent dexamethasone-induced cell detachment at either 6 or 24 h (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, DEVD prevented etoposide-induced cell detachment at 24 h. These findings indicate that changes in cell shape precede glucocorticoid-induced cell detachment. In contrast, cell detachment induced by etoposide occurred subsequent to apoptosis induced by this agent.The Mechanism of Glucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis Involves Focal Adhesion Kinases—Cell attachment and survival depend on the formation of focal adhesions and activation of focal adhesion-associated proteins, such as FAK (37Hanks S.K. Ryzhova L. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8 (-D996): D982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4 (-D113): D102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that phosphorylation of FAK is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of mechanical stimulation on osteocytic cells; and that osteocytic cells overexpressing FAK are resistant to the pro-apoptotic effect of dexamethasone (21Plotkin L.I.

Based on this and on evidence indicating that FAK and Pyk2 have opposite effects on cell survival (17Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S. Teoh G. Raje N. Rosen S. Krett N. Husson H. Avraham S.

The BoNTs act by inhibiting neurotransmitter release from cholinergic synapses. Clostridium botulinum strains produce large BoNTs toxin complexes, which include auxiliary non-toxic proteins that appear not only to protect BoNTs from the hostile environment of the digestive tract but also to assist BoNT translocation across the intestinal mucosal layer. In this study, we visualize for the first time a series of botulinum serotype D toxin complexes using negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

This process causes muscular paralysis in humans and animals, leading to the disease botulism. botulinum neurotoxin hemagglutinin non-toxic non-hemagglutinin toxin complex transmission electron microscopy botulinum neurotoxin hemagglutinin non-toxic non-hemagglutinin toxin complex transmission electron microscopy Toxins with serotypes A–D and G are encoded by two gene clusters in close proximity to each other; cluster 1 contains the bont and ntnha genes, and cluster 2 contains three genes: ha-70, ha-33, and ha-17 (7Hauser D. Eklund M.W. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Minton N.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 161-194PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, botulinum TC consists of five components: BoNT, non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNHA) and three hemagglutinin subcomponents (HA-70, HA-33, and HA-17). All serotypes of BoNT associate non-covalently with auxiliary non-toxic proteins, thereby forming large toxin complexes (TCs). Serotype A–D strains produce the M-TC (BoNT·NTNHA complex) and L-TC (BoNT·NTNHA·HAs complex) in the culture medium, while serotype E and F strains produce only M-TC. The major biological function of the non-toxic components appears to be protection of the BoNT against the hostile environment of the digestive tract (9Sakaguchi G. Kozaki S. Ohishi I. Alouf J.E. Fehrenbach F.J. Freer J.H. Jelijaszewicz J. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press Inc., London1984: 435-443Google Scholar, 10Ohishi I. Sugii S. Sakaguchi G. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 107-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, several lines of evidence have shown that the non-toxic proteins play a role in the uptake and transcytosis of L-TC into the intestinal epithelium (11Nishikawa A. Uotsu N. Arimitsu H.

Nishikawa A. Oguma K. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, we have also demonstrated, using a cultured Caco-2 cell layer, that serotype D HA-33 plays a critical role in the permeation of TC species into the intestinal epithelium (16Niwa K. Koyama K. Inoue S. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ikeda T. Ohyama T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 49: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the non-toxic components play a role in the trans-epithelial transport of BoNT across the intestinal barrier. However, few studies have addressed the structure of the TC, because of the large sizes of the complexes consisting of multiple non-toxic components. These complexes vary from 300 kDa up to 900 kDa, depending upon the BoNT serotypes. C. botulinum serotype D strain 4947 (D-4947) produces TC species, which consist only of intact components, without any nicking. We previously proposed an assembly pathway, including the binding order of individual subunits, through in vitro reconstitution of the D-4947 L-TC (17Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Sunagawa H. Ohyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2650-2656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar): the M-TC is formed first by assembly of a single BoNT and a single NTNHA molecule, and is subsequently converted to the complete L-TC by forming complexes with HA-70 and HA-33·HA-17 molecules. Additionally, we found hemagglutination-negative TC species in which HA-33·HA-17 molecules were missing from the mature L-TC (18Mutoh S. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10991-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Mutoh S. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Nakazawa Y. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Niwa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3847-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These TC species are considered to be intermediates in the 650-kDa L-TC assembly pathway (20Kouguchi H. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Mutoh S. Watanabe T. Niwa K. Yoneyama T. Katoh Y. Ohyama T. J. Microbiol. Method. 2006; 67: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Regarding the subunit structure of the botulinum TC, historically there has been only one model, our schematic one that was constructed based on biochemical results (18Mutoh S. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10991-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki T. Watanabe T. Mutoh S. Hasegawa K. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we propose for the first time a more detailed structure of a botulinum serotype D TC, and we describe a potential assembly process that specifies the binding order of individual subunits. This novel and unusual 14-mer model may explain how non-toxic components comprise a delivery vehicle for BoNT in food-borne botulism, how BoNT is protected in the digestive environment, and how BoNT is internalized into the bloodstream. Production and Purification of Botulinum D-4947 TC Species—C. botulinum D-4947 was cultured using a dialysis method as previously described (22Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Sato H. Sagane Y. Mutoh S. Suzuki T. Yamano A. Kouguchi H. Takeshi K. Kamaguchi A. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. Protein J. 2004; 23: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The TC species were purified from the culture supernatants by SP-Toyopearl 650 S cation-exchange column chromatography as described previously (18Mutoh S. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10991-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Each TC species fraction was collected separately, and the molecular mass was estimated by gel filtration. The M-TC·HA-70 and 540-, 610-, and 650-kDa L-TC species were then purified to homogeneity, as determined by SDS- and native-PAGE. The TC species termed M-TC, M-TC·HA-70, 540-kDa, 610-kDa, and 650-kDa L-TC were thus isolated for TEM and other experiments. Isolation of the HA-33·HA-17 complex from 650-kDa L-TC—Isolation of the HA-33·HA-17 complex from a 250-mg pellet resulting from ammonium sulfate precipitation of the 650-kDa L-TC was performed as described (17Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Sunagawa H. Ohyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2650-2656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PAGE and Densitometric Analyses—PAGE under non-denaturing conditions (native-PAGE) was carried out at pH 8.8 using a 5–12.5% polyacrylamide linear gradient gel. SDS-PAGE was performed using a 13.6% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) staining intensities of the components were analyzed with ImageJ 1.30v. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, IL) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Hemagglutination Assay and Titration of TC Species with the HA-33·HA-17 Complex—A hemagglutination assay was performed by a microtitration method (18Mutoh S. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10991-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the binding capacities of the TC species, with isolated HA-33·HA-17 as titrant, the titration experiment was performed by adding HA-33·HA-17 to the TC species. The titration mixtures containing 0.7 μm TC species and several concentrations of HA-33·HA-17 were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a hemagglutination assay and native-PAGE. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The purified HA-33·HA-17 complex was dialyzed against 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl and adjusted to an appropriate protein concentration. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc.) with a 4-hole An60Ti rotor and two-channel charcoal-filled Epon cells at a rotor speed of 17,000 rpm. The data were analyzed using the software Ultrascan 6.01. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (nanoLC/ESI-TOF-MS) was carried out with a nanoLC system consisting of a Famos auto sampler and a Switchos automated switching valve (LC Packings), and a micrOTOF-focus orthogonal acceleration TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) interfaced with a nano-ESI source. HA-33·HA-17 solution was prepared in 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with a protein concentration of 462.8 μg/ml. 10 μl of sample was injected onto a C18 pre-column (0.3 mm inner diameter × 5 mm length). After connecting the pre-column to the nano-ESI source, the sample was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–50%). All experiments were carried out in positive mode. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was carried out with an Ultraflex II TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in positive linear mode at an acceleration voltage of 25 kV. As the matrix solution, sinapic acid (SA) and 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5-DHAP) were used to achieve acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. HA-33·HA-17 solution was prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) at a protein concentration of 764.2 μg/ml. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)—Appropriate aliquots of the TC specimens (10 μg/ml) in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) were distributed on carbon support film. The specimens were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were recorded with the JEM-1011 and the JEM-1230 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at a magnification of ×50,000 and an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Crystallization of HA-33·HA-17 Complex—For crystallization of the HA-33·HA-17 complex, the protein solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM10 membrane (Amicon, MA) and by centrifugation using Ultrafree-0.5 with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 10 K, followed by filtration through an Ultrafree-MC 0.2 μm filter unit (Millipore, MA). An expanded set of crystallization conditions was screened to obtain HA-33·HA-17 crystals suitable for x-ray analysis. Crystal Screen Kit and Crystal Screen Kit 2 (Hampton Research) were used as mother liquor for both hanging-drop, sitting-drop, and floating-drop (23Adachi H. Takano K. Morikawa M. Kanaya S. Yoshimura M. Mori Y. Sasaki T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) vapor-diffusion methods, at temperatures 4 and 20 °C. The protein concentrations ranged from 3.4 to 20 mg/ml. The ratios of sample to crystallization solution were 2:6, 4:4 and 6:2 (v/v, total volume 8 μl). X-ray Data Collection—Preliminary x-ray data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-AXIS VII imaging-plate system, using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku FR-E rotating-anode generator with Rigaku MaxScreen optics. The crystals used for this in-house experiment diffracted up to 2.60-Å resolution. To obtain a high resolution data set, x-ray diffraction data were collected from frozen crystals at 100 K using a Rigaku Jupiter 210 CCD detector installed on the RIKEN structural genomics beam line BL26B2 at the SPring-8 synchrotron facility (Harima, Hyogo, Japan). Diffraction data collected using the synchrotron radiation source were up to 1.85 Å resolution.

Subsequent data manipulation was carried out using the CCP4 program package (24Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). An initial phase set was calculated by molecular replacement using MOLREP (25Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The search model for molecular replacement was the structure of the HA1 from serotype C (PDB code 1QXM), which showed the highest sequence identity (95.8%) to the D-4947 HA-33 subcomponent. Noncrystallographic averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram modification were carried out to modify the density using the program DM (26Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar), prior to the calculation of SigmaA weighted maps (27Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), which were then used for manual rebuilding of the model. The electron-density map (2Fo – Fc) was calculated using FFT. Several cycles of manual model fitting were carried out using the programs XtalView 4.3 (28McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Acad. Press, San Diego1993: 271-328Google Scholar) and Refmac 5.0 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). The geometry of the model was greatly improved using CNS 1.1 for rigid body refinement and simulated annealing refinement. After the model reached a reasonable R factor, water was added to the structure using ARP/wARP (30Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The final model was analyzed by PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 326: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) to evaluate its stereochemical quality. The crude toxin fraction from the C. botulinum D-4947 culture supernatant was applied to an SP-Toyopearl 650 S column under acidic conditions (pH 4.0). After several consecutive chromatographic purification runs for each peak fraction, five highly purified TC species were obtained. They were tentatively termed 280-kDa M-TC (BoNT·NTNHA complex), 410-kDa M-TC·HA-70 complex, 540-kDa, 610-kDa, and 650-kDa L-TC, with the molecular weights determined by gel filtration, SDS-PAGE, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The 540-kDa and 610-kDa L-TCs showed a banding pattern on SDS-PAGE similar to that of the 650-kDa L-TC, but with lower staining intensities of the HA-33 and HA-17 bands than were seen for the 650-kDa L-TC (Fig. 1A), indicating that these bands corresponded to intermediates species in the pathway to 650-kDa L-TC assembly. The 650-kDa L-TC is apparently the complete L-TC complex, because no larger complex was purified from the culture supernatant. All samples produced two bands on native-PAGE under alkaline conditions, where the complexed forms of non-toxic components (just NTNHA for M-TC) dissociate from the BoNT, as shown in Fig. 1B. The electrophoretic mobility of the non-toxic complex bands derived from the M-TC·HA-70, 540-kDa, 610-kDa, and 650-kDa L-TC revealed a ladder, with bands migrating at equal intervals according to their molecular sizes. Because these TC species, except for the 650-kDa L-TC, lack hemagglutination activity, we deduced that the HA-33 and HA-17 molecules must have been missing in the subunit composition of TC species other than the complete L-TC. Negative Stain TEM—To further characterize the BoNT complex, the purified D-4947 TC species were visualized by negative stain TEM. Fig. 2A shows the representative shapes of TC species that were visualized after manual alignment of particles observed in the TEM images. Tracings showing the outlines of subunit components are presented in Fig. 2B. The M-TC, which is composed of BoNT and NTNHA, appears as an ∼13-nm spherical (or ellipsoidal) particle (Fig. 2, A-1). The M-TC·HA-70 complex is an acorn-like particle, with the HA-70 “cone” lying on the M-TC (Fig. 2, A-2), suggesting blocks building up sequentially to form a complex. It is noteworthy that the HA-70 molecule appears to have no rigid configuration. This may be supported by the observation during differential scanning calorimetry, that the isolated HA-70 molecules exhibited no distinct melting transition through the range 10 to 100 °C (data not shown). Interestingly, subsequent L-TC species revealed unique “arm” attachments that appeared to be rod-like particle. We concluded that these were HA-33·HA-17 complexes that adhered to the M-TC·HA-70 complex via the HA-70 molecule, as shown in Fig. 2, A-3–5. The number of “arm” attachments with ∼10 nm length increased with the size of the L-TC species; the average number of arms was: one (84.4%, n = 209), two (73.3%, n = 172), and three (55.6%, n = 135) for 540-kDa L-TC, 610-kDa L-TC, and 650-kDa L-TC, respectively. No TC image with four or more arms was observed in the field of view. This is therefore a novel observation regarding the structure of the botulinum TC. In an earlier study, based on negative stain electron microscopy of the serotype A BoNT and analysis of a separated non-toxic complex, Boroff et al. (32Boroff D.A. Nyberg S. Hoglund S. Infect. Immun. 1972; 6: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) designed a model for the complex that allowed the BoNT strand to fit within the coils of the HAs. Likewise, Burkard et al. (33Burkard F. Chen F. Kuziemko G.M. Stevens R.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) proposed a model for the serotype A 900-kDa LL-TC (dimer of L-TC) that was triangular in shape, with six lobes apparent in the electron crystallographic images that were obtained using a lipid-layer technique. However, both models provided neither the stoichiometry of the components nor their structural organization. To our surprise, the number of HA-33·HA-17 molecules observed in all TC species consisted of one molecule less than the number predicted by our initial schematic model (21Suzuki T. Watanabe T. Mutoh S. Hasegawa K. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was derived from titration-based experiments. These initial experiments led to estimates of four HA-33·HA-17 molecules in the 650-kDa L-TC, three in the 610-kDa L-TC and two in the 540-kDa L-TC, respectively. This discrepancy arose because Superdex 200 pg gel filtration provided an estimate of 50 kDa for the HA-33·HA-17 complex, implying that the complex is composed of one molecule each of HA-33 and HA-17. Our present results indicate that the L-TC species may have flexible characteristics, for instance the relative positions of the arms of the 650-kDa L-TC varied, and sometimes fewer arms were observed, probably because some HA-33·HA-17 molecules could adhere to the carbon-coated membrane and thus be hidden beneath the TC molecule itself. The HA-70 molecules also seemed to acquire a dramatically more rigid folded configuration upon binding of HA-33·HA-17 to form complexes. A black spot that is presumed to be a zinc atom or an active site cavity was observed in all TEM images of TC species; this could constitute a marker for the BoNT molecule. Such electron micrographic observations will undoubtedly result in a better understanding of the subunit structure of botulinum TC, which will be further clarified by x-ray crystallographic analysis of additional complexes in the near future. Molecular Composition of the HA-33·HA-17 Complex—Because both TEM observation and PAGE analyses suggested strongly that the arm section consists of HA-33 and HA-17, we attempted to characterize its molecular composition. The HA-33·HA-17 subcomponent complex, which could not be separated as a pure component during the isolation procedure, was isolated from L-TC using 4 m guanidine as a denaturant, as previously described (17Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Sagane Y. Sunagawa H. Ohyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2650-2656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugal analysis using sedimentation equilibrium yielded a calculated molecular weight of 77,400 ± 1,700 Da. On the other hand, nanoLC/ESI-TOF-MS of HA-33·HA-17 yielded a mass of 84,118 Da, while MALDI-TOF-MS analysis indicated a mass of 83,623 Da (using the SA matrix) and 83,743 Da (using the 2,5-DHAP matrix). These estimates were reasonably close to the calculated mass, 84,239 Da, obtained by adding the masses of two HA-33 molecules and one HA-17 molecule. X-ray Crystallography of the HA-33·HA-17 Complex—Crystals of the HA-33·HA-17 complex (∼0.1 mm in size) were obtained for x-ray analysis using the hanging-drop method. We determined the x-ray crystal structure of the isolated HA-33·HA-17 complex from D-4947 L-TC at 1.85 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the serotype C HA-33 structure (34Inoue K. Sobhany M. Transue T.R. Oguma K. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as the search model. The hexagonal unit cell parameters were a = b = 239.13 Å and c = 100.02 Å, and each cell contained one complex molecule in the asymmetric unit. The final model was refined to an R factor of 0.19, and included 713 amino acid residues (Ser2–Ile286 for HA-33 and Glu4–Leu146 for HA-17) (PDB code 2E4M). X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot showed that all residues were within allowed regions. Fig. 3 shows the crystal structure of the HA-33·HA-17 complex represented as ribbon (Fig. 3A) and surface (Fig. 3B) models. The final model includes two HA-33 molecules and one HA-17 molecule in the asymmetric unit. This model is fairly consistent with the molecular composition of HA-33·HA-17 (2:1) complex as determined by molecular mass. Each HA-33 molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain of 285 residues folded into a dumbbell-like shape made up of N-terminal (residues 2–143) and C-terminal (residues 144–286) domains. As observed in the crystal structures of serotypes A HA-33 (35Arndt J.W. Gu J. Jaroszewski L. Schwarzenbacher R. Hanson M.A. Lebeda F.J. Stevens R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and C HA-33 (34Inoue K. Sobhany M. Transue T.R. Oguma K. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), D-4947 HA-33 is also composed of two β-trefoil domains, which consist of a 12-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel capped by three β-hairpins and connected by a short α-helix. The two identical HA-33 molecules are related by 2-fold axial symmetry, showing both upswept C-terminal domains with putative carbohydrate-binding sites separated by a small angle (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the HA-17 molecule that comprises a single polypeptide chain of 143 residues (density was not seen for two amino acid residues at the N terminus) forms a base that supports two HA-33 molecules. A structural alignment with the secondary structure of HA-33 showed that the β-trefoil repeats were also found in the HA-17 structure, although one hairpin loop was not seen in the β-trefoil repeat, probably due to weak electron density. Additionally, no amino acid residues responsible for putative carbohydrate-binding were observed in the HA-17 molecule, suggesting that HA-17 may not bind carbohydrates. As shown in Fig. 4A, two HA-33 molecules form contacts with each other at their N-terminal domains, with extensive interactions between tyrosine residues (Tyr52, Tyr59, Tyr94, Tyr99, and Tyr109 in each molecule), in which the hydroxyl groups likely form hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, residues at the bottom ends of both HA-33 N-terminal domains, specifically residues, Pro76, Asn111, Asn113, and Thr128, make contacts with the HA-17 molecule, forming an interface with one β-sheet region of HA-17 (Asn106, Thr108, Asp123, Pro125, Leu127, Leu129, and Pro130), as shown in Fig. 4B. Although little is known about the function of HA-17, its most likely function is to fix two molecules of HA-33 and tether the HA-70 molecule, as if by nuts and bolts, to form the HA-70-HA-17-HA-33 conjunction. Number of HA-33·HA-17 Complexes in the L-TC—We performed in vitro reconstitution of the mature L-TC by adding increasing amounts of HA-33·HA-17 to form L-TC complexes. The hemagglutination activity of the 650-kDa L-TC was determined to be titer of 27, while no hemagglutination titer could be detected for the other TC species. This implies that the full number of HA-33·HA-17 complexes is required for hemagglutination activity. To define the molecular composition of incomplete TC species, therefore, we examined whether the hemagglutination activity of the M-TC·HA-70, 540-kDa L-TC, and 610-kDa L-TC arises by binding of HA-33·HA-17 to unoccupied sites. As the HA-33·HA-17 (with calculated mass 84,239 Da) was titrated, every TC species exhibited a similar titer to that of L-TC, as shown in Fig. 5. At the end points of the titration, the M-TC·HA-70, 540-kDa and 610-kDa TC species (0.7 μm each) required 2.1, 1.4, and 0.7 μm HA-33·HA-17, respectively, to exert full hemagglutination activity. Concomitantly, every TC species exhibited an electrophoretic pattern on native-PAGE similar to that of the 650-kDa L-TC, as seen in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Accordingly, the molar ratio of HA-33·HA-17 complexes was estimated as 3:2:1 against M-TC·HA-70, 540-kDa and 610-kDa TC. This leads to a model in which three HA-33·HA-17 complexes occupy surface positions in the subunit structure of L-TC. Such observations, including the TEM images, are consistent with the hemagglutination activity of the botulinum TC. Our model suggests that six HA-33 molecules can be exposed at the L-TC surface, where they play a role in anchoring the complex at the epithelial cell surface. Determination of the Number of HA-70 Subunits—Because the number of HA-70 subunits in the L-TC has been unclear, we tried to obtain the molar ratios of HA-70 subunits by densitometric analysis of CBB staining bands on SDS-PAGE gels. Based on several experiments, all of which were repeated, we conclude that the molar ratio of HA-70 was ∼3.0 (mean 2.92, S.E. = 0.17, n = 47), i.e. it consists of three subunits. This ratio was calculated by dividing the density of the BoNT bands by each molecular mass. In light of the number of HA-33·HA17 molecules in the complex, this value is quite reasonable. Model of the Arrangement of Botulinum L-TC—We now show that virtually all TC species from the culture medium appear to form oligomeric subunits, which predominantly comprise L-TC. The results described here were combined to construct images of the total botulinum serotype D TC, allowing us to draw conclusions as to the extent of oligomerization and the numbers of each component protein present in native botulinum D-4947 L-TC. Fig. 6 shows our proposed 14-mer model (based on the sum of calculated masses of subunits, 749.43 kDa), which proposes an arrangement of the individual subunits in the mature L-TC. The assembled complex includes a single BoNT, a single NHNHA, three HA-70, six HA-33, and three HA-17. This hypothetical model of the D-4947 BoNT structure was generated using the homology modeling server. We employed serotype A (36Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and B BoNTs (37Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) as templates (PDB codes 3BTA, 1EPW, 1S0B, and 1S0C). The shapes and relative sizes of NTNHA and HA-70 molecules were derived from the TEM images and their molecular masses. This model differs from our previous 12-mer subunit model (18Mutoh S. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Suzuki T. Hasegawa K. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10991-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki T. Watanabe T. Mutoh S. Hasegawa K. Kouguchi H. Sagane Y. Fujinaga Y. Oguma K. Ohyama T. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was based on biochemical results. The new experimental data described here allow us to propose a more realistic model having novel features. Further verification of this structure will require higher resolution x-ray crystallography and a three-dimensional reconstruction using the resulting models. The three-dimensional structures of NTNHA and HA-70 proteins have not yet been determined; therefore, our model must be subject to a few caveats. Nevertheless, we believe that this model can explain important features of botulinum TC as a “delivery vehicle”, in which HA subcomponents may increase the internalization of BoNT into the bloodstream via binding to intestinal membranes. In addition, the model explains how BoNT is protected from protease digestion. Our ultimate goal is to define the unique subunit structure of botulinum TC by combining TEM observations of the various assembly states of the botulinum TC with x-ray crystallographic analysis of the individual components. Thus, this model represents a first step toward elucidating the complete three-dimensional structure of the entire botulinum toxin complex. We thank M.

https://openalex.org/W2000324186,"The notion that eukaryotes evolved via a merger of cells from the other two domains — archaea and bacteria — overlooks known processes. It is generally agreed that the mitochondrion, powerhouse of the eukaryote cell, evolved from an engulfed bacterium. But what did the engulfing? Did an archaeon engulf a bacterium? Did an RNA cell engulf an archaeon and a mitochondrial ancestor? The permutations are seemingly endless. Anthony Poole and David Penny argue that in this field, speculation has run too rife. They say it's time to get back to basics — first, by taking a new look at the prematurely discarded protoeukaryote host theory."

We have previously identified fibronectin as a key molecule for incorporation of LTBP1 and TGF-β into the ECM of osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Here we provide evidence that heparan sulfate proteoglycans may mediate binding between LTBP1 and fibronectin. We have localized critical domains in the N terminus of LTBP1 that are required for co-localization with fibronectin in osteoblast cultures and have identified heparin binding sites in the N terminus of LTBP1 between residues 345 and 487. Solid-phase binding assays suggest that LTBP1 does not bind directly to fibronectin but that the binding is indirect. Heparin coupled to bovine serum albumin (heparin-BSA) was able to mediate binding between fibronectin and LTBP1. Treatment of primary osteoblast cultures with heparin or heparin-BSA but not with chondroitin sulfate impaired LTBP1 deposition onto fibronectin without inhibiting expression of LTBP1. Inhibition of LTBP1 incorporation was accompanied by reduced incorporation of latent TGF-β into the ECM, with increased amounts of soluble latent TGF-β. Inhibition of attachment of glycosaminoglycans to the core proteins of proteoglycans by β-d-xylosides also reduced incorporation of LTBP1 into the ECM.

TGF-βs are produced by virtually all cells as one or more latent complexes, which must be activated in order for TGF-β to exert its biological activities (reviewed in Refs. 5Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar and 8Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Ciba Found. Symp. 1991; 157: 81-89PubMed Google Scholar). The major secreted forms of latent TGF-β are known as the small and large latent TGF-β complexes (6Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The small latent complex consists of mature TGF-β, noncovalently bound to its latency-associated peptide. In the large latent TGF-β complexes, TGF-β and its latency-associated peptide are associated with a third protein from the family of LTBPs, of which four members (LTBPs 1–4) have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 4Hyytiainen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and 6Saharinen J. Hyytiainen M. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that LTBPs are major regulators of TGF-β. LTBP1 has been shown to facilitate secretion of latent TGF-β (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), to target latent TGF-β to ECM for storage (11Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J.

LTBPs may also be critical players in the activation of TGF-β by specific cell types (15Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K. Harpel J. Heldin C.H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Annes J.P. Chen Y. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LTBP3-null mice showed craniofacial malformations and developed osteosclerosis and osteoarthritis (17Dabovic B. Chen Y. Colarossi C. Obata H. Zambuto L. Perle M.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The LTBP4-null mice showed pulmonary emphysema, cardiomyopathy, and colorectal cancer (18Sterner-Kock A. Thorey I.S. Koli K.

In both cases, the phenotypes appear to be due to misregulation of TGF-β activity (17Dabovic B. Chen Y. Colarossi C. Obata H. Zambuto L. Perle M.A. Rifkin D.B. J.

LTBPs share homology with fibrillins, and it is now clear that the LTBPs 1–4 and fibrillins 1–3 constitute a superfamily of ECM proteins with overlapping and interacting functions (reviewed in Ref. 4Hyytiainen M. Penttinen C. Keski-Oja J. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Similar to the fibrillins, 60–70% of the structure of LTBPs consists mainly of two types of cysteine-rich repeats. These include epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like six-cysteine repeats, similar to motifs found in the EGF precursor, and eight-cysteine repeats that are unique to the LTBPs and fibrillins. The LTBPs contain 16–18 of the EGF-like repeats and 3–4 copies of the 8-cysteine repeats. The third 8-cysteine repeat of LTBP1 is critical for interaction with latent TGF-β (19Saharinen J. Taipale J.

A heparin binding consensus sequence (HRRRPIHHHVGK) is found in the “hinge” region of human LTBP1 at amino acids 414–425 (21Oklu R. Metcalfe J.C. Hesketh T.R. Kemp P.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At present, little is known concerning the mechanisms by which LTBP1 assembles into the ECM. Several studies suggest that the N terminus of LTBP1 contains a critical region for matrix binding (19Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J.

Bruckner-Tuderman L. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 187-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTBP1 and fibrillin-1 co-localize in the matrix of early and late osteoblast cell cultures (22Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner.

J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LTBP1 also shows a time-dependent co-localization with fibronectin in osteoblast culture models, where co-localization is seen in early postconfluent cultures (1–3 days) but not in late cultures (14–21 days) (27Dallas S.L.

Binding studies have demonstrated direct interactions between LTBP1 and fibrillins (28Isogai Z. Ono R.N. Ushiro S. Keene D.R. Chen Y. Mazzieri R. Charbonneau N.L. Reinhardt D.P. Rifkin D.B.

However, by overexpressing LTBP1 in UMR-106 cells that lack endogenous LTBP1 or fibrillin-1, we previously showed that fibrillin-1 was not required for LTBP1 deposition into the ECM in association with fibronectin (27Dallas S.L.

Fibronectin has been shown to be required for assembly of several matrix proteins, including type I collagen, thrombospondin, fibulin-1, and fibrinogen (29Sottile J. Hocking D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3546-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 30Godyna S. Mann D.M. Argraves W.S. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Pereira M.

Our recent studies have shown that fibronectin also plays a critical role for LTBP1 assembly into the ECM (27Dallas S.L. Sivakumar P. Jones C.J. Chen Q. Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. Humphries M.J.

However, the mechanism by which fibronectin regulates LTBP1 assembly is still unclear. In these studies, we sought to determine whether LTBP1 binds directly to fibronectin and to localize the critical domains in LTBP1 that are required for LTBP1 deposition in association with fibronectin. Solid-phase binding assays suggested that fibronectin interacted with LTBP1 through an indirect mechanism. Because fibronectin contains heparin binding sites (32Dalton B.A. McFarland C.D.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LTBP1 contains a consensus heparin binding site, and because fibrillins have been shown to be dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for their incorporation (33Tiedemann K.

A monoclonal antibody against human LTBP1 was also used (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Our laboratory has also recently developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab-K) against a recombinant human LTBP1 fragment (aa 526–1014) (Fig. 1A). This antibody recognizes LTBP1 in human, mouse, and rat cells. Antibodies for fibronectin included a commercially available mouse monoclonal against the ED-A domain (Sigma) that cross-reacts with human, mouse, and rat fibronectin and a rabbit polyclonal antibody that also recognizes human, mouse, and rat fibronectin (Sigma). For detection of His-tagged recombinant LTBP1 fragments, an anti-His monoclonal antibody was used (EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI). Human plasma fibronectin and N-terminal 70-kDa proteolytic fragment were obtained from commercial sources (Invitrogen or Sigma). The 160-kDa fibronectin fragment was prepared as described previously (35Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Rifkin (New York University, New York, NY) and were cultured as described previously (11Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant LTBP1 Peptides—For expression and purification of recombinant LTBP1 peptides, cDNA sequences corresponding to the desired recombinant LTBP1 fragments were generated by PCR amplification using Vent DNA polymerase, a high fidelity DNA polymerase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The template was a human LTBP1 cDNA in the vector pSV7d (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (kindly donated by Dr. K. Miyazono, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). A 6- or 10-histidine epitope tag was engineered into the primers at the C terminus of the recombinant LTBP1 fragments, followed by a stop codon and XhoI restriction site. An NheI restriction site was engineered at the N terminus. Schematic diagrams of the LTBP1 constructs generated are shown in Figs. 1A and 3A. The primer sets used for amplification of these specific fragments are presented in supplemental Table S1. The PCR products were digested with NheI and XhoI and ligated into the pCEP-Pu expression vector (a kind gift of E. Kohfeldt, Max Planck Institut of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) in-frame with the BM40 signal sequence (40Mayer U. Nischt R. Poschl E. Mann K. Fukuda K. Gerl M. Yamada Y. Timpl R.

The sequences of the inserts were confirmed by automated sequencing (MWG Co., High Point, NC). The constructs were then transfected into 293-EBNA cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in puromycin (1 μg/ml), and resistant cells were expanded into triple layer flasks. Recombinant fragments were purified from 2–3 liters of serum-free conditioned media using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Bound proteins were eluted either with low pH or with 100–300 mm imidazole. If further purification was required, a mono-Q ion exchange column was used in conjunction with a Bio Cad 700E protein purification system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Coomassie Blue staining was used to visualize the purity of the fragments, and mass spectrometry/peptide mass mapping was used to validate the recombinant LTBP1 fragments. Using this approach, we have obtained 1–2 mg of most of the recombinant LTBP1 fragments (see Figs. 1C and 3B, Coomassie Blue staining). 2T3/293-EBNA Co-culture System and Transfection of LTBP1 Constructs—A 2T3/293-EBNA co-culture system was used for transient in vitro expression of human LTBP1 constructs to determine their ability to deposit into the ECM in association with fibronectin. This co-culture system combines the advantages of the 293-EBNA cells, which express high amounts of recombinant proteins but do not produce an extensive extracellular matrix, with the 2T3 calvarial osteoblast cell line, which has a low transfection efficiency but produces an extensive ECM. 2T3 cells at 4 × 104 cells/ml and 293-EBNA cells at 4 × 103 cells/ml were plated together into eight-chamber Lab-Tek chamber slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above (0.5 ml per well). 24 h later, the LTBP1 constructs were transfected into the co-culture system using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured for 3 more days, and then fixed in 95% ethanol. Double immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (22Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recombinant LTBP1 expression was detected with anti-His monoclonal antibody. Fibronectin expression was detected using the rabbit anti-fibronectin antibody (Sigma). Appropriate combinations of Cy3-conjugated detection antibodies or biotinylated antibodies followed by streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used for detection as described previously (22Dallas S.L. Keene D.R. Bruder S.P. Saharinen J. Sakai L.Y. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The slides were viewed and photographed digitally using a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope with cooled charge-coupled device camera driven by the AnalySIS software (Soft Imaging Systems Corp., Lakewood, CO). Incubation of 2T3 Cultures with Recombinant LTBP1 Fragments—In parallel to the co-culture transfection experiments above, 2T3 cells were also incubated with purified recombinant LTBP1 fragments (10 μg/ml) for 3 days. Cells were then fixed in 95% ethanol. Incorporation of LTBP1 fragments and co-localization of LTBP1 and fibronectin were determined by double immunofluorescence staining as described above. Heparin Sepharose Affinity Chromatography—Affinity chromatography was performed using heparin-Sepharose columns (HiTrap Heparin HP, 1 ml, Amersham Biosciences). The columns were equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Purified recombinant LTBP1 fragments (20–40 μg) were applied manually to the columns in equilibration buffer at an approximate flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing the columns with equilibration buffer, bound material was eluted with 1 m NaCl. The eluted volumes were fractionated into 0.5-ml aliquots. The amounts of recombinant LTBP1 fragments in each fraction were determined by ELISA, and the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and/or Coomassie Blue staining. Solid-phase Binding Assays—Solid-phase binding assays to measure binding of LTBP1 fragments to fibronectin or fibronectin fragments were performed on 96-well ELISA high binding plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA). Plasma fibronectin, superfibronectin, or fibronectin fragments (100 nm) (see Fig. 4C), diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm calcium, were immobilized on high binding ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS-T washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Blocking of nonspecific binding sites was performed by incubating for 1–2 h with 200 μl of binding buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, plus 5% nonfat dry milk and either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA). The wells were incubated for 2 h with recombinant LTBP1 fragments at a starting concentration of 100 or 150 nm, then diluted serially 1:2 in binding buffer (100 μl per well). The plates were then washed three times with washing buffer, and the wells were incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (1:1000, diluted in binding buffer). After washing three times, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of donkey anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 diluted in binding buffer, Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing, the plates were reacted with O-phenylenediamine using 4-mg substrate tablets, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The plates were read on an ELX800 plate reader (Biotek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) at 490 nm after treatment with 25 μl of 3 m HCl. Background subtraction was performed using a blank control that was coated with 100 nm bovine serum albumin (BSA) in place of the fibronectin or fibronectin fragments. For solid-phase binding assays to examine binding of LTBP1 fragments to heparin, heparin coupled to BSA was used (Sigma). 100 nm heparin-BSA in PBS, pH 7.4, was coated onto plates overnight at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature as described above. Effects of Heparin and β-d-Xylosides on LTBP1 Deposition in the ECM—FRC cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells per cm2 of growth area in 8-chamber Lab-Tek slides or 6-well plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) in the presence of heparin (0.1–0.5 mg/ml), chondroitin 6-sulfate (CS, 0.1–0.5 mg/ml), heparin-BSA (0.01–0.1 mg/ml), 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (0.1 mm), or p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (0.2 mm). After overnight adherence, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with culture medium containing treatments for 3–6 days. Media was changed every 3 days. Cells in Lab-Tek slides were immunostained for LTBP1 and fibronectin as described above. To determine the relative amounts of secreted LTBP1 in the conditioned media, the cultures were changed to serum-free culture media (plus treatments) on day 5. After a further 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and concentrated 10- to 20-fold using a Centricon membrane (30-kDa cut-off). To test the LTBP1 levels in the ECM, plasmin digestions of detergent-insoluble matrix pellets were performed as described previously (11Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J.

Both the conditioned media and plasmin-digested matrix samples were normalized to cell number, counted from triplicate wells, prior to loading on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (11Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J.

TGF-β Assays—A commercial ELISA (TGF-β1 Emax, Promega, Madison, WI) was used for measurement of TGF-β1 in serum-free conditioned media samples collected over 48 h or in guanidine-HCl extracts of the ECM, prepared as described elsewhere (42Pfeilschifter J.

https://openalex.org/W1970225644,"Most patients with acute lung injury (ALI) have reduced alveolar fluid clearance that has been associated with higher mortality. Several mechanisms may contribute to the decrease in alveolar fluid clearance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pulmonary edema fluid from patients with ALI might reduce the expression of ion transport genes responsible for vectorial fluid transport in primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial type II cells. Following exposure to ALI pulmonary edema fluid, the gene copy number for the major sodium and chloride transport genes decreased. By Western blot analyses, protein levels of αENaC, α1Na,K-ATPase, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator decreased as well. In contrast, the gene copy number for several inflammatory cytokines increased markedly. Functional studies demonstrated that net vectorial fluid transport was reduced for human alveolar type II cells exposed to ALI pulmonary edema fluid compared with plasma (0.02 ± 0.05 versus 1.31 ± 0.56 μl/cm2/h, p < 0.02). An inhibitor of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (SB202190) partially reversed the effects of the edema fluid on net fluid transport as well as gene and protein expression of the main ion transporters. In summary, alveolar edema fluid from patients with ALI induced a significant reduction in sodium and chloride transport genes and proteins in human alveolar epithelial type II cells, effects that were associated with a decrease in net vectorial fluid transport across human alveolar type II cell monolayers.

The level of AFC impairment has significant prognostic value in determining morbidity and mortality (1Matthay M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Multiple clinically relevant experimental studies have tried to uncover the underlying mechanisms that reduce AFC in ALI, and several pathways have been implicated (3Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G.

Biol. 2006; 35: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the alveolar environment, basal AFC is determined predominately by amiloride-sensitive (epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)) and -insensitive sodium channels and the activity of the Na,K-ATPase (3Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Clerici C. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 5Matalon S. O'Brodovich H. Annu. Rev.

Jain L. Eaton D.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several stimuli can up-regulate AFC including β-adrenergic agonists via cAMP-dependent mechanisms (3Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. Clerici C. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 569-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 4Folkesson H.G. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 35: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the mouse and human lung, cAMP-dependent alveolar epithelial fluid transport is dependent on CFTR activity, especially in mediating β-adrenergic receptor-driven alveolar epithelial fluid transport (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Brochiero E.

We and others have reported that, in the early phase of ALI, pulmonary edema fluid contains high levels of several proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-8, TNFα, and TGFβ1 (12Pugin J. Verghese G. Widmer M.C. Matthay M.A. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13Olman M.A. White K.E. Ware L.B. Simmons W.L. Benveniste E.N. Zhu S. Pugin J.

Several of these proinflammatory cytokines have been studied in experimental fluid transport experiments. For example, during short in vitro exposures, TNFα increases AFC, which is mediated predominantly by both TNFα receptor-dependent and -independent effects (15Fukuda N. Jayr C. Lazrak A. Wang Y. Lucas R. Matalon S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280 (-L1265): L1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Elia N. Tapponnier M. Matthay M.A. Hamacher J. Pache J.C. Brundler M.A. Totsch M.

In contrast, for exposures up to 24 h, TNFα decreases the expression of ENaC (α, β, and γ subunits) mRNA and protein levels as well as the amiloride-sensitive current and ouabain-sensitive Rb+ uptake in rat alveolar epithelial cells (17Dagenais A. Frechette R. Yamagata Y. Yamagata T. Carmel J.F. Clermont M.E. Brochiero E. Masse C. Berthiaume Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286 (-L311): L301Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly we found that IL-1β decreases dexamethasone-induced αENaC mRNA and protein levels and the amiloride-sensitive fraction of the transepithelial current and sodium transport across rat type II cell monolayers (18Roux J. Kawakatsu H. Gartland B. Pespeni M. Sheppard D. Matthay M.A. Canessa C.M. Pittet J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18579-18589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of IL-1β on αENaC expression is mediated through p38 MAPK phosphorylation. More recently, we reported that TGFβ1 decreases the amiloride-sensitive fraction of Na+ uptake and fluid transport across monolayers of rat and human type II cells as well as αENaC mRNA and protein expression (19Frank J. Roux J. Kawakatsu H. Su G. Dagenais A. Berthiaume Y. Howard M. Canessa C.M. Fang X. Sheppard D. Matthay M.A. Pittet J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43939-43950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect is mediated by ERK1/2 MAPKs phosphorylation. In chronic inflammation associated with nasal polyposis, TGFβ1 down-regulates CFTR mRNA and protein expression as well as the cAMP-dependent current in human nasal epithelial cells (20Pruliere-Escabasse V. Fanen P. Dazy A.C. Lechapt-Zalcman E. Rideau D. Edelman A. Escudier E. Coste A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288 (-L83): L77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite these results with individual cytokines, the effect of pulmonary edema fluid itself from patients with ALI on human alveolar epithelial type II cell transport has not yet been studied. Therefore, we used our recently developed in vitro model of polarized human alveolar epithelial type II cells with a high transepithelial resistance, which makes it possible to measure apical to basal net fluid transport (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The objective was to determine the effect of undiluted pulmonary edema fluid from patients with ALI on AFC across polarized human alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers. ALI pulmonary edema fluid caused a marked decrease in net transepithelial fluid transport compared with simultaneously collected plasma. To understand the mechanisms by which ALI edema fluid decreased AFC, we first studied the effect of the ALI pulmonary edema fluid on the gene and protein expression of the major inflammatory cytokines and the critical sodium and chloride transport proteins involved in AFC. ALI pulmonary edema had a differential effect, inducing a marked increase in cytokine/chemokine gene expression and, at the same time, a decrease in all of the major sodium and chloride transport gene and protein levels. To further understand which soluble factors were critical, we pretreated human alveolar epithelial type II cells with inhibitors of the major cytokines or two signaling pathways, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs, mechanisms that can down-regulate vectorial fluid transport. Our results demonstrate that ALI pulmonary edema fluid contains soluble factors that are capable of adversely affecting the resolution of pulmonary edema in patients who developed ALI from sepsis. Isolation of Human Alveolar Type II Pneumocytes—Type II epithelial cells were isolated from human donor lungs (preserved at 4 °C for 4–8 h) that were declined for transplantation by the California Transplant Donor Network using established methods (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For isolation, a lobe was selected that was free of obvious consolidation or hemorrhage by gross inspection. The pulmonary artery was perfused 10 times with PBS, and the distal airspaces were then lavaged 10 times with Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm EDTA. Elastase, 13 units/ml in Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution, was instilled into the distal airspaces through segmental bronchial intubation, and the lobe was incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 45 min. Following digestion, the lobe was minced finely in the presence of fetal bovine serum and DNase at 500 μg/ml. The cell-free fraction was filtered sequentially through one layer of sterile gauze, two layers of gauze, and 150- and 30-μm nylon meshes. The filtrate was then layered onto a Percoll density gradient (1.04–1.09 g/ml) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 min. The top layer containing both type II pneumocytes and macrophages was collected and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS solution containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 antibodies at 4 °C for 40 min. Macrophages were then selectively depleted with a Dynal magnet (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) and further incubated on Petri dishes coated with human IgG antibodies against macrophages. The remaining alveolar epithelial type II cells were then plated on collagen I-coated 24-well plates (Biocoat, BD Biosciences) at 5% CO2 at 37 °C at a concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells/well. The cells were exposed to media, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-H21 and Ham’s F-12 (1:1), with antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and amphotericin) and 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h and without fetal bovine serum for 24 h. 72 h after the isolation, the type II cells were washed once with PBS and then exposed to 1 ml of ALI pulmonary edema fluid with and without inhibitors or the corresponding plasma for 24 h. In a separate set of experiments, human alveolar epithelial type II cells were exposed to cytomix, a mixture of the major biologically active cytokines found in ALI pulmonary edema fluid (IL-1β, TNFα, and interferon γ), at a concentration of 50 ng/ml with and without inhibitors or the corresponding control medium for up to 24 h as a surrogate for the inflammatory edema fluid (21Pittet J.F.

Acute Lung Injury Pulmonary Edema Fluid—Patients were categorized as having ALI by clinical criteria (bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, partial pressure of O2/fractional concentration of inspired O2 <300, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension with a pulmonary wedge pressure ≤18 mm Hg if measured) (22Bernard G.R. Artigas A. Brigham K.L. Carlet J. Falke K. Hudson L. Lamy M. Legall J.R. Morris A. Spragg R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (5221) Google Scholar) and an edema fluid/plasma protein ratio >0.65 (Biuret method, (2Ware L.B. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1376-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar)). The degree of lung injury was quantified by the lung injury score (23Murray J.F. Matthay M.A. Luce J.M. Flick M.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). To have a more uniform etiology of ALI for this study, we collected and combined samples only from patients with ALI due to sepsis. All human ALI pulmonary edema and plasma samples were collected from 1993 to 2005 at the University of California, San Francisco and Vanderbilt University Medical Centers (12Pugin J. Verghese G. Widmer M.C. Matthay M.A. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 13Olman M.A. White K.E. Ware L.B. Simmons W.L. Benveniste E.N. Zhu S. Pugin J. Matthay M.A. J.

Briefly pulmonary edema fluid was obtained from patients meeting ALI criteria within 4 h of intubation through gentle luminal suction applied to a 14 French catheter passed into the distal airways. All ALI pulmonary edema fluid samples were centrifuged immediately at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to remove cells and debris, and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. Plasma samples were drawn simultaneously and centrifuged (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until further use. To have a sufficient quantity of edema fluid for all of the necessary experiments, the aliquots of ALI pulmonary edema fluid from all of the patients were combined as done previously (13Olman M.A. White K.E.

The Committee for Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco and Vanderbilt Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved all human protocols. Detection of Alveolar Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Necrosis—Human alveolar epithelial type II cells were plated onto collagen I-coated 24-well plates and exposed to ALI pulmonary edema fluid or plasma for 24 h. Following the incubation, the cells were detached from the plate with trypsin (0.25%) and combined with the floating and detached cells in the supernatant. Total alveolar epithelial cells were double stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (25Geiser T. Ishigaki M. van Leer C. Matthay M.A. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (-L453): L448Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using the TACS annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified by flow cytometry using FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 6.4.3; Tree Star Inc.). Cytokine Levels in ALI Pulmonary Edema Fluid—Total TNFα and IL-1β levels were measured in the ALI pulmonary edema fluid or simultaneously collected plasma prior to exposure to the human alveolar epithelial type II cells using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Quantikine kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction and incubated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega Corp.) and Superase RNA inhibitor (Ambion). Gene expression in human alveolar epithelial type II cells was measured using a two-step multiplex quantitative RT-PCR method described previously (26Dolganov G.M. Woodruff P.G. Novikov A.A. Zhang Y. Ferrando R.E. Szubin R. Fahy J.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primer and probe sets for genes of interest were designed using “Primer Express” software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on sequencing data from National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) databases and purchased from Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA). The primer and probe sequences used are available upon request. Total RNA (10–20 ng) was first reverse transcribed using random hexamers, and the resulting cDNA product was amplified using a mixture of gene-specific primers and hot start PCR for 25 cycles. Transcript quantifications were run along with -RT cDNA controls in a 384-well format on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Data were collected as PCR cycle threshold values for each gene and then converted to relative gene copy number (GCN) based on linear regression (26Dolganov G.M. Woodruff P.G. Novikov A.A. Zhang Y. Ferrando R.E. Szubin R. Fahy J.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transcript copy was normalized using 10 housekeeping genes. The geometric mean value of the housekeeping genes most stably expressed across the samples was used for normalization (GeNorm software). Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—Total cellular protein was extracted from the cells using 0.15 ml of lysis buffer/well containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris base (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm vanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Pefabloc and homogenized. Protein content was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Each sample was first reduced and denatured with sample buffer and run on a 4–12% gradient bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), 10–20 μg of proteins per lane, using a MOPS-SDS buffer (Invitrogen) at 100 V for roughly 2 h. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 1 h. The nitrocellulose membrane was then exposed to the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were: αENaC (Calbiochem), α1- and β1Na,K-ATPase (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA), and CFTR (R&D Systems). The protein bands were then visualized with a chemiluminescence agent, ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences), and quantitated with NIH ImageJ software. Fluid Transport across Human Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells—Net fluid transport was measured across human type II cells on Transwell plates (0.4-μm pore size and collagen I-coated, CoStar, Corning) in a humidified tent within a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator with 100% humidity. Measurement of fluid transport from the apical to basolateral membrane of the type II cell monolayers was done at 120 h following the initial isolation and 48 h after the air-liquid interface was achieved; previously the transmembrane electrical resistance peaked (1530 ohms × cm2) at 96 h with morphological evidence of tight junctions (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Fang X. Song Y. Zemans R. Hirsch J. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (-L110): L104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells were first exposed to 150 μl of ALI pulmonary edema fluid, plasma, or cytomix at 50 ng/ml (containing 0.3 μCi/ml 131I-albumin) in the apical chamber of the Transwell. For cAMP agonist studies, 10 μm forskolin and IBMX were added to the ALI pulmonary edema fluid prior to placement on the apical layer. After 5 min, 20 μl of the media was then aspirated as the initial sample. After 24 h, another 20 μl was aspirated from the upper compartment of the Transwell as the final sample. Each sample was weighed, and radioactivity was counted in a γ counter (Packard MINAXI 5000 series). Net fluid transport (μl/cm2/h) was calculated as described previously (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar): =[1 - (radioactivity in the initial sample/weight of the initial sample)/(radioactivity in the final sample/weight of the final sample)] × 100. At the end of the experiments, all the fluid in the lower compartment was also collected to determine the protein permeability by measuring the unidirectional flux of labeled 131I-albumin from the apical (upper compartment) to the basolateral side (lower compartment) (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Fang X. Song Y. Zemans R. Hirsch J. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (-L110): L104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy with Immunofluorescence Labeling—Confocal microscopy was performed with immunofluorescence labeling of tight junction proteins to correlate the changes in protein levels with any redistribution of the protein around the tight junction. Briefly human type II cells, seeded on Transwell plates for 5 days, were exposed to plasma or pulmonary edema fluid with and without SB202190 from patients with ALI for 24 h and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then exposed to the primary antibody for ZO-1 (1:250; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After extensive washing with PBS, the cells were exposed to the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse or rhodamine red X-goat anti-rabbit and Texas Red-phalloidin, Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 45 min. The slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and images were obtained using the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope. Transmission Electron Microscopy—To examine the ultrastructure of the human alveolar epithelial type II cells exposed to ALI pulmonary edema fluid or plasma, treated human type II cell monolayers grown on Transwell membranes were fixed with 3% (w/v) Karnovsky fixative for 1 h at 0 °C, and the membranes were removed. The monolayers were postfixed for 1 h in 1% veronal-buffered osmic acid and then dehydrated in graded ethanols and/or propylene oxide. The cell preparations were then embedded in Epon or Araldite resins cured at 60 °C. Thin sections were contrasted with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. The sections were then imaged with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Inhibitor Studies—To test the mechanisms through which ALI edema fluid decreased gene and protein expression, human type II cells were exposed to five inhibitors individually 30 min prior to exposure to ALI pulmonary edema fluid or corresponding plasma: 1) anti-human TNFα/TNFSF1A antibody, 1 μg/ml (R&D Systems); IL-1RA, 5 μg/ml (R&D Systems); or anti-TGFβ1, -β2, -β3, 10 μg/ml (R&D Systems) and 2) MAPK inhibitors 10 μm PD98059, a MEK1 inhibitor (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA), or 10 μm SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor (Calbiochem). Total RNA and protein were collected and analyzed as described above. Total Nitric Oxide Level—The total nitric oxide level was measured using the Griess reaction (AssayDesigns, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistics—Each condition was run in triplicate and reported as the mean ± S.D. To determine significance, two-tailed Student’s t test and analysis of variance with posthoc Tukey test or Bonferroni correction were used when appropriate. p values less than or equal to 0.05 were determined to be significant. Demographic and Hemodynamic Characteristics of the Patients with ALI from Sepsis—Undiluted pulmonary edema fluid from 19 patients with ALI due to sepsis was collected and pooled from the University of California, San Francisco and Vanderbilt Medical Centers. Base-line demographic and hemodynamic data for all the patients are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Clinical characteristics of the patients with acute pulmonary edema and acute lung injury from sepsisClinical characteristicsResultsAge (years)39 ± 15aData as mean ± S.D.Male79%Caucasian79%Shock74%Lung injury scorebOut of four points3.1 ± 0.8aData as mean ± S.D.SAPSIIcSimplified acute physiology score II60 ± 16aData as mean ± S.D.Mortality74%a Data as mean ± S.D.b Out of four pointsc Simplified acute physiology score II Open table in a new tab Effect of ALI Pulmonary Edema Fluid on Net Fluid Transport—Net fluid transport was essentially zero for human alveolar type II cells exposed to ALI pulmonary edema fluid compared with simultaneously collected plasma (0.02 ± 0.05 versus 1.31 ± 0.56 μl/cm2/h, mean ± S.D., p < 0.02). The significant decrease in net fluid transport caused by ALI pulmonary edema fluid was not altered by the addition of forskolin and IBMX (Fig. 1). The rate of net fluid transport for cells exposed to plasma derived from patients with ALI was equivalent to previously reported rates for human alveolar type II cells stimulated with forskolin and IBMX (1.35 ± 0.24 μl/cm2/h) over 24 h (9Fang X. Song Y. Hirsch J. Galietta L.J. Pedemonte N. Zemans R.L. Dolganov G. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-L249): L242Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The initial controls for the functional studies as well as the initial quantitative RT-PCR experiments included normal media, normal human plasma, and simultaneously collected plasma from the ALI patients. There was no significant difference in protein permeability, net fluid clearance, or gene expression between the controls (data not shown). ALI plasma was used as the control for all subsequent studies. Effect of ALI Pulmonary Edema Fluid on Cell Death—There was no gross morphologic effect of ALI pulmonary edema fluid or plasma on the appearance of human alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers.

Observation of the spatiotemporal response of G protein subunits in a living cell to receptor activation showed that 6 of the 12 members of the G protein γ subunit family translocate specifically from the PM to endomembranes. The γ subunits translocate as βγ complexes, whereas the α subunit is retained on the PM. Depending on the γ subunit, translocation occurs predominantly to the Golgi complex or the endoplasmic reticulum. The rate of translocation also varies with the γ subunit type. Different γ subunits, thus, confer distinct spatiotemporal properties to translocation. A striking relationship exists between the amino acid sequences of various γ subunits and their translocation properties. γ subunits with similar translocation properties are more closely related to each other. Consistent with this relationship, introducing residues conserved in translocating subunits into a non-translocating subunit results in a gain of function. Inhibitors of vesicle-mediated trafficking and palmitoylation suggest that translocation is diffusion-mediated and controlled by acylation similar to the shuttling of G protein subunits (Chisari, M., Saini, D. K., Kalyanaraman, V., and Gautam, N. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 24092–24098). These results suggest that the continual testing of cytosolic surfaces of cell membranes by G protein subunits facilitates an activated cell surface receptor to direct potentially active G protein βγ subunits to intracellular membranes.

The classic model of GPCR action, thus, restricts the activation of G proteins and consequently their effectors to the two-dimensional plane of the PM (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

Intracellular effects have been thought to occur through second messengers released through the activation of effector molecules such adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, and ion-conducting channels. Direct communication of a GPCR with intracellular membranes through the G protein subunits has not been anticipated. We have used live cell imaging methods to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the localization of components of a GPCR-mediated signaling pathway when the pathway is activated and deactivated. In mammalian cells similar to GPCRs the G protein subunits are also families of proteins. Based on the presence of distinct genes, there are 16 α subunits, 5 β subunit, and 12 γ subunit types. The α subunit types appear to possess distinctly different properties (3Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 4Cabrera-Vera T.M.

Although evidence exists for the differential activity of βγ subunit types in terms of their role in receptor activation of a G protein and modulation of effector function, these differences have been subtle and quantitative (5Kisselev O.

One potential reason for a lack of evidence for qualitative differences in the properties of these diverse proteins is that most assays used so far to measure G protein function have used techniques that lead to disruption of cells. The possibility that these proteins are involved in spatially distinct functions has, thus, remained unexplored. Here we examined the entire family of γ subunit types complexed with different β subunit types for potential translocation in response to GPCR activation in various cell lines. There have been previous indications from our laboratory that the β1γ11 and β1γ5 subunit complexes translocate away from the PM on receptor activation (13Akgoz M. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51541-51544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify the mechanistic basis, the translocation properties were examined in the presence of inhibitors of vesicle-mediated trafficking, an acylation inhibitor, and after introducing mutations into the γ subunit C-terminal domain previously shown to interact with receptors (14Gautam N. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 359-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We identified potential βγ complexes capable of translocation in a live cell by examining fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent protein-tagged subunits. We examined the impact of cell lines of different origins and various α subunit types and receptors on the translocation of βγ complexes. Although it has been known that a large and diverse family of γ subunits with highly conserved structures exists (12Yang W. Hildebrandt J.D. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Downes G.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gautam N.

Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), striking differences in their signaling properties have not been found. Results here show that the γ subunits control the spatiotemporally distinct translocation of a large variety of βγ complexes from the PM to endomembranes, thus making it possible for GPCRs on the cell surface to direct an active component of a G protein to intracellular membranes. Chemicals and Expression Constructs—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. αo-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-β1 and CFP- or YFP-tagged γ5 and γ11 constructs have been described previously (13Akgoz M. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51541-51544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The citrine mutant of YFP and the non-oligomerizing forms of both CFP and YFP (17Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar) were engineered by mutagenesis and used in all experiments. The γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, γ7, γ8 (γolf), γ9 (γcone), γ10, γ12, γ13, β1, β2, β3, and β4 cDNAs were introduced downstream of YFP or mCherry (18Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N.

All constructs were checked by determining the nucleotide sequence. Red fluorescent protein DsRed2-KDEL marker and DsRed monomer galactosyl transferase (Clontech). Transferrin-Texas Red was from Molecular Probes. Cells and Transfection—Native CHO cells and those stably expressing the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2-CHO) (19Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the M3 muscarinic receptor (M3-CHO) (20Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3036-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have been described previously. CHO cells were grown in CHO IIIa medium (Invitrogen) containing dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), methotrexate (for M2-CHO, M3-CHO), penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and Fungizone. HeLa and J774.1 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in specific media recommended by the ATCC. All the transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). M2-CHO cells stably expressing αo-CFP, β1, and YFP-γ11 were generated using standard procedures, screened with flow cytometry, and cultured in CHO-IIIa medium containing methotrexate and Geneticin (G418). Treatment of Cells—To disrupt Golgi in the cells, 10 μm brefeldin A was used in the culture medium 6–10 h before cell imaging. For treatment with nocodazole, transfected or stable cells were cooled on ice for 5 min, then nocodazole (5 μg/ml) was added, and cells were further incubated for 15 min on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. As a control, 5 μg/ml transferrin-Texas Red conjugate was then added to the cells for 15 min at 37 °C after which the cells were visualized to monitor vesicular trafficking. The imaging was done in the presence of nocodazole. For monensin treatment the cells were treated with 50 μm monensin for 1 h at 37 °C before imaging. For cycloheximide treatment the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 6–8 h at 37 °C before imaging. For treatment with 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), the media was removed from the cells, and fresh Hanks’ buffer saline solution containing 50 μm 2BP (stock prepared in Me2SO (21Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2006; 40: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) was added to the cells, and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C before imaging. Imaging of Live Cells—Cells were cultured on acid-washed glass coverslips and transiently transfected with appropriate combinations of different G protein subunits and GPCRs as described in the text and figure legends. After 16–24 h post-transfection the cells were processed for imaging as follows. The coverslips were washed with Hanks’ buffer saline solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and mounted on an imaging chamber with an internal volume of 25 μl (RC-30 chamber, Warner Instruments). For live cell imaging, a fluid delivery system including a programmable valve controller and Teflon valves (10-ms open/closure time) (Automate Scientific) was used to deliver the buffer with or without agonist or antagonist through the chamber at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with a regulated flow controller. The cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective (1.4 NA) and 100-watt mercury lamp with a Hamamatsu CCD Orca-ER camera. The shutter and emission and excitation filter wheels were controlled by a Sutter Lambda 10–2 optical filter changer (Sutter Instrument Co.) run by MetaMorph 6.3.7 (Molecular Devices) software. The filter and beam splitter combinations (Chroma Technology) were as follows; for CFP, D436/10 excitation, D470/30 emission; for YFP, D500/20 excitation, D535/30 emission; for mCherry or DsRed D580/20 excitation, D630/60 emission, a polychroic beam splitter (Chroma 86002BS) and 25 or 10% neutral density filters. In those cases where both CFP and YFP fusions were co-expressed in cells, the cells expressing relatively similar levels of the two fusions were selected based on emission intensities. Images were acquired at 20- or 10-s intervals, and the exposure times were between 0.1 and 1.0 s. Details of the FRET analysis are described in Chisari et al. (66Chisari M. Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24092-24098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). FRET analysis was performed not only with YFP- and CFP-tagged proteins but also mCherry (mCh) and YFP combinations as described. Details of the experiments performed with confocal microscopy are provided in Chisari et al. (66Chisari M. Saini D.K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol.

Receptor Induced βγ Subunit Translocation—G protein signaling has been thought to be exclusively localized to the PM with heterotrimers being activated by transmembrane receptors and the activated subunits acting on PM-associated effectors. We used CHO cells stably expressing M2 receptors (M2-CHO) transiently transfected with αo, β1, and different γ subunits tagged with YFP to evaluate the effect of receptor activation on various G protein γ subunits. We have previously demonstrated that β and γ subunits with an N-terminal fluorescent protein fusion localize normally on the PM and support normal activation of the G protein by a receptor (22Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Images of the cells were captured at defined intervals of time, whereas they were sequentially exposed first to a muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, and then to an antagonist, atropine. Emission intensities from the intracellular membranes were plotted as a function of time to quantitate potential translocation of the fluorescent protein-tagged γ subunit. The γ subunits which translocated were initially clearly localized to the PM (Fig. 1). When various members of the γ subunit family were examined, it was observed that six different γ subunit types translocated to specific intracellular membranes in a receptor-mediated manner. On antagonist addition they translocated back to the PM. The γ1, γ5, γ9, and γ10 translocated to a focused intracellular region, which was similar to the cellular localization of the translocated γ11 subunit previously reported (13Akgoz M. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51541-51544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, top panel, Fig. 1B, and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). In striking contrast, the γ13 subunit translocated to endomembranes with a more diffuse spatial distribution (Fig. 1C, top panel). Corresponding to the changes in endomembrane fluorescence intensity in response to the agonist and antagonist, corresponding changes in the opposing direction were observed in the PM (supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, a plot of the intensity of the Golgi marker, galactosyl transferase-DsRed, after exposure to agonist and antagonist did not show significant changes like the intensity plot for YFP-γ9 (supplemental Fig. 4). These results confirmed that the increase in endomembrane fluorescence intensity is not due to a change in Golgi size or shape. The G protein γ subunits are modified with a prenyl moiety. γ1, γ9, and γ11 are farnesylated, whereas all other γ subunits are geranylgeranylated (23Escriba P.V. Wedegaertner P.B. Goni F.M. Vogler O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The translocation process by itself is not dependent on the type of prenyl moiety attached to a γ subunit type because γ5, γ10, and γ13 are capable of translocation, although they are geranylgeranylated. Endomembranes as Target Membranes for Translocating βγ Complexes—To identify the membranes to which the γ9 and γ13 subunits translocate, markers tagged with fluorescent proteins specific to the Golgi and the ER were used. A trans-Golgi marker, galactosyl transferase-tagged with monomeric DsRed (24Storrie B. White J. Rottger S. Stelzer E.H. Suganuma T. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1505-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson Jr., R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and YFP-γ9 were coexpressed in M2-CHO cells and imaged in a confocal microscope after M2 activation. Overlaying the images of galactosyl transferase-DsRed monomer and YFP-γ9 showed that YFP-γ9 localized specifically to the endomembranes (predominantly Golgi complex) after translocation (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To further confirm this localization, we treated the transfected M2-CHO cells with brefeldin A, which is known to disrupt the Golgi complex (26Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). When these cells were examined after agonist treatment, translocation of YFP-γ9 to the Golgi region could no longer be detected (not shown). These results indicated that γ9 translocates primarily to the Golgi region. To identify the membranes to which the G protein β1 γ13 complex translocated, we coexpressed the ER retention KDEL sequence of calreticulin, a specific marker for the ER tagged with DsRed (27Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 28Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.

J. 2005; 89: 1482-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with YFP-γ13 in M2-CHO cells and imaged the cells after M2 activation. To examine whether γ13 translocates to the Golgi also apart from the ER, we treated the transfected M2-CHO cells with brefeldin A. On agonist addition γ13 translocated to endomembranes. Overlaying the images of KDEL-DsRed and translocated YFP-γ13 showed that YFP-γ13 was localized to the ER (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). When antagonist was added, γ13 reverse-translocated back to the PM. The γ13 subunit was initially localized to the PM and ER (Fig. 1C, top panel). When cells expressing γ10 were similarly examined with a Golgi marker, the target of the translocation was predominantly the Golgi complex (not shown). We examined whether reverse translocation on the addition of an antagonist subsequent to agonist addition was due to an effect independent of the receptor. Instead of antagonist addition, agonist was withdrawn by introducing buffer. The γ9, γ11, and γ13 subunits reverse-translocated in these cells, similar to the cells treated with antagonist, although the t½ for reversal was comparatively slower (not shown). The slower kinetics would be anticipated because the antagonist would be able to shift the receptor to its inactive state more rapidly by displacing agonist binding directly. This experiment indicated that reverse translocation is the outcome of switching the activated state of the receptor to its inactive state. Subfamilies of γ Subunits with Distinct Kinetics of Translocation—We measured the rate of translocation of the various γ subunits by measuring the proportion of the fluorescent protein-tagged γ subunit that translocated from PM to intracellular membranes at various time points. When the rate of translocation of the different γ subunits was compared, distinct differences were seen. γ10 and γ5 translocated relatively slowly (t½ ∼ 39–85 s) (Fig. 1B, plot, and supplemental Fig. 2), whereas the other subunits, γ1, γ9, γ11, and γ13, translocated rapidly (t½ ∼ 6–13 s) (Fig. 1, A and C, supplemental Fig. 1). To examine the relationship between the translocating and non-translocating γ subunits, the human γ subunit amino acid sequences were aligned and analyzed for their evolutionary relationship. The resulting phylogenetic tree shows that the γ subunits that translocate in a receptor induced fashion, γ1, γ5, γ9, γ10, γ11, and γ13, show a strikingly closer relationship to each other compared with other γ subunits (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2A). The two classes of γ subunit types based on the rate of translocation, relatively slow and rapid, also show a closer relationship within a subfamily (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, γ13 is distinct compared with the other rapidly translocating γ subunits. These results suggest that translocation is dependent on the amino acid sequences of the γ subunits. This is an inference that is consistent with the nature of the prenyl moiety not having any discernible effect on translocation (below). The differential translocations of the βγ complexes are, thus, both qualitative and quantitative. Such differences in the properties of G protein βγ subunits have not been noted before. The G Protein γ Subunit Mediates Translocation of a βγ Complex—The α subunit types, αo, αi, or αq, coexpressed with a translocating γ subunit did not translocate (supplemental Fig. 5A). This result suggested that translocation is restricted to the βγ complex because the γ subunit is known to be tightly bound to the β subunit (12Yang W. Hildebrandt J.D. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Downes G.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Gautam N.

To confirm that the γ subunits translocate as βγ complexes, untagged γ subunits were expressed with the β1 subunit tagged with YFP or mCh (18Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar) in M2-CHO cells. In the presence of agonist, translocation of the YFP-β1 or mCh protein was observed (supplemental Fig. 5B). This result confirmed (i) γ subunit translocation occurs as a βγ complex, (ii) that the translocation process is directly influenced only by the type of γ subunit, and (iii) the γ subunit fluorescent protein tag does not have an effect on the translocation. To rule out the possibility that β subunit translocation is a result of interaction with a cellular protein other than the γ subunit, which is capable of translocation, we evaluated receptor-mediated translocation in M2-CHO cells transfected with the fluorescent protein-tagged β1 subunit without a translocating γ subunit. In such cells significant translocation of the β1 subunit was not detected on receptor activation (data not shown). This result indicated that the γ subunits directly mediate translocation of the βγ complex. Furthermore, YFP or mCh-β1 not only cotranslocated with CFP- or YFP-tagged translocation-competent γ subunits, but more important, acceptor (YFP or mCh) photobleaching indicated measurable FRET between YFP or mCh-β1 and CFP or YFP-γ subunits as described below. These results confirm that translocation occurs as a βγ complex. Mutation of Residues at the C-terminal Domain of a Non-translocating Subunit Results in the Gain of Translocating Ability—The ability of the G protein γ subunit to influence receptor-mediated translocation was reminiscent of the role of the γ subunit in receptor interaction of a G protein that we first showed in the rhodopsin-transducin system and later with ligand binding receptors (5Kisselev O.

Previous evidence from the rhodopsin and muscarinic receptor systems has suggested that an 11 amino acid domain at the C terminus of the processed γ subunit contacts receptors (19Azpiazu I.

Two-dimensional NMR has shown that a peptide encompassing this domain directly interacts with activated but not inactive rhodopsin (14Gautam N.

Downs M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility we compared the amino acid sequences of the human γ subunits. Fig. 2A shows an alignment of the γ subunit primary structures. In Fig. 2A residues in this C-terminal domain conserved within the subfamily of subunits that translocate rapidly and the subfamily of subunits that do not translocate are highlighted. The conservation of these residues within the subfamilies with distinct translocation properties suggested that they may play a role in regulating translocation. We examined a hypothesis that the affinity of this C-terminal domain of a γ subunit for a receptor determines whether it will translocate. To examine whether conserved residues that are strikingly different between the non-translocating and translocating subunits played a role in the translocation, we mutated five residues in the γ3 subunit that does not translocate (Fig. 2B). The γ3 mutant was expressed in M2-CHO cells, and receptor-induced translocation was examined. Results in Fig. 2B show that the γ3 mutant has gained the ability to translocate due to the alterations in the C-terminal domain. This result shows that C-terminal residues of the γ subunit are critical for translocation, consistent with a model that non-translocating γ subunits have a high affinity for the activated receptor, whereas translocating γ subunits have distinctly lower affinity (32Akgoz M. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1758-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Translocation to Different Endomembranes Is Not Dependent on the C-terminal Domain of the γ Subunit or the Type of Prenyl Moiety—γ13 is targeted predominantly to the ER, unlike γ1, γ9, and γ11, which are targeted to the Golgi, although they also transl"
https://openalex.org/W2072858840,"Defects in the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of mammalian mitochondria are linked to neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanism leading to cell death elicited by complex I deficiency remains elusive. We have shown that expression of a rotenone-insensitive yeast NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) can rescue mammalian cells from complex I dysfunction. By using the Ndi1 enzyme, we have investigated the key events in the process of cell death using a rat dopaminergic cell line, PC12. We found that complex I inhibition provokes the following events: 1) activation of specific kinase pathways; 2) release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors, apoptosis inducing factor, and endonuclease G. AS601245, a kinase inhibitor, exhibited significant protection against these apoptotic events. The traditional caspase pathway does not seems to be involved because caspase 3 activation was not observed. Our data suggest that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by complex I inhibition is responsible for triggering the kinase activation, for the release of the proapoptotic factors, and then for cell death. Nearly perfect prevention of apoptotic cell death by Ndi1 agrees with our earlier observation that the presence of Ndi1 diminishes rotenone-induced ROS generation from complex I. In fact, this study demonstrated that Ndi1 keeps the redox potential high even in the presence of rotenone. Under these conditions, ROS formation by complex I is known to be minimal. Possible use of our cellular model is discussed with regard to development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by complex I defects.

A dysfunction in complex I is known to be involved in a large number of human diseases such as myopathies (1DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Zeviani M. Nakagawa M. DeVivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), stroke-like syndrome (2DiMauro S. Schon E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (3Wallace D.C. Singh G. Lott M.T. Hodge J.A. Schurr T.G. Lezza A.M.S. Elsas L.J. Nikoskelainen E.K. Science. 1988; 242: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). More recent developments revealed that diminution of the complex I activity is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Parkinson disease (PD). In PD, a systemic reduction of complex I activity was found in the brain of patients (4Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for complex I impairment in PD comes from the finding that 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion, the active metabolite of the Parkinsonism toxin MPTP, acts as a complex I inhibitor (5Ramsay R.R. Salach J.I. Dadgar J. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In fact, animal models developed for PD involve administration of complex I inhibitor, MPTP, or rotenone (6Hirsch E.C. Hoglinger G. Rousselet E. Breidert T. Parain K. Feger J. Ruberg M. Prigent A. Cohen-Salmon C. Launay J.M. J. Neural Transm. 2003; 65 (-S100): S89Google Scholar). In the rotenone rat PD model, many characteristics of PD were demonstrated, including selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, formation of Lewy bodies, and motor deficits (7Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 8Alam M. Schmidt W.J. Behav. Brain Res. 2002; 136: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Since the doses of rotenone used did not alter mitochondrial oxygen consumption in isolated brain mitochondria (9Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Testa C.M. Seo B.B. Richardson J.R. Kim J.H. Miller G.W. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10756-10764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it did not appear that a bioenergetic defect could account for rotenone-induced neurodegeneration. Instead, it was suggested that rotenone toxicity resulted from oxidative stress (10Betarbet R. Canet-Aviles R.M. Sherer T.B. Mastroberardino P.G. McLendon C. Kim J.H. Lund S. Na H.M. Taylor G. Bence N.F. Kopito R. Seo B.B. Yagi T. Yagi A. Klinefelter G. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 404-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the case of MPTP mouse PD models, it has been reported that apoptosis is involved in the neurodegeneration. For example, ablation of proapoptotic protein Bax was shown to prevent dopaminergic neurodegeneration (11Vila M. Jackson-Lewis V. Vukosavic S. Djaldetti R. Liberatore G. Offen D. Korsmeyer S.J. Przedborski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Also, neuronal apoptosis in the substantia nigra was observed in the early stage of chronic degeneration (12Novikova L. Garris B.L. Garris D.R. Lau Y.S. Neuroscience. 2006; 140: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because complex I inhibitors trigger characteristic features of PD, their use would allow us to understand the mechanisms of cell death during the development of the disease. The role of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and particularly of complex I in the process of cell death is still elusive. It is known that complex I is involved in formation of ROS (13Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Stout A.K. Lund S. Baptista M. Panov A.V. Cookson M.R. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7006-7015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that compounds stimulating ROS formation can trigger apoptosis (14Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4588-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Complex I is known to generate ROS in at least two modes as follows: one is through inhibition of forward electron transfer, and the other is associated with reverse electron transfer (15Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 16Adam-Vizi V. Chinopoulos C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The ROS production in the latter mode is suppressed by rotenone. Recently, Kussmaul and Hirst (15Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) reported that ROS production caused by complex I inhibition involves FMN and occurs only when the NADH/NAD+ ratio is significantly high. We recently demonstrated that the yeast Ndi1 enzyme, when introduced in mammalian respiratory chain, is capable of diminishing ROS formation caused by complex I inhibition (17Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can utilize the Ndi1 enzyme as a versatile tool with which to investigate participation of complex I in cellular events relating to ROS (for reviews see Refs. 18Yagi T. Seo B.B.

Yamashita T. Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Rejuvenation Res. 2006; 9: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We sought to clarify the mechanism of cell death in a dopaminergic cell line PC12 caused by complex I inhibitors and the mechanism of protective effects of Ndi1 expression on ROS generation by complex I defects. Here we showed that complex I inhibitors induce apoptosis not by the traditional caspase pathway but mainly by the release of AIF and EndoG. We also demonstrated that the Ndi1 enzyme could prevent the activation of all apoptotic cellular pathways triggered by the production of ROS following complex I inhibition. This event occurs when the Ndi1 expression suppressed NADH/NAD+ ratios in the matrix to the level where complex I cannot produce ROS. This suggests that the very first step in complex I defect cell death is the elevation of ROS production.

Cells were grown in humidified chamber at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell Viability Assay—PC12 and PC12-NDI1 (5 × 104 cells) were seeded in 96-well plates. Eighteen hours before the start of the experiment, cells were placed in DMEM with 1% serum. Then rotenone was added at a final concentration of 1 μm. At the end of incubation with rotenone, cells were washed with warm DMEM with 10% serum. Cell viability was performed with the CellTiter 96® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) by following the manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, 80 μl of warm culture medium was mixed with 20 μl of reagent and incubated for 1 h. Then the absorbance was monitored at 490 nm on a plate reader (SpectraMax M2, Molecular Devices) every 15 min for 4 h. DNA Laddering Assay—PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were grown in 6-well plates in DMEM with 1% serum. Cells were incubated with 1 μm rotenone for 24 h, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate (600 μl) was incubated with RNase A (200 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and with proteinase K (150 μg/ml) for 4 h at 54 °C. The incubation was then continued at 65 °C for 1 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation, DNA samples were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for 2 h at 100 V in a cold room. Subcellular Fractionation—PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were cultivated in 100-mm culture dishes. To evaluate the AIF/EndoG relocalization, cells were incubated in DMEM with 1% serum with or without 1 μm rotenone for 48 h and were harvested in 750 μl of isotonic mitochondria buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with a complete mixture of protease inhibitors. Cells were placed to a microcentrifuge tube with 50 μl of prewashed glass beads (250 μm size; Sigma). The tubes were vortexed at maximum speed for 1 min and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet obtained was enriched in heavy membrane organelles and used as the mitochondrial fraction. The resulting supernatant was stored as the cytoplasmic fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the micro-Bradford assay at 595 nm. The cytoplasmic fraction was treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice, and the precipitated protein was dissolved in sample buffer (65 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, containing 5% SDS, 3% urea, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue) by sonication, heated at 65 °C for 15 min, and loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were cultivated in 384-well plates (black well, clear bottom, 1 × 104 cells/well) (Greiner bio-one, Monroe, NC) for 24 h in DMEM with 10% serum. Medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 1% serum and 1 g/liter glucose 15 h before the start of the experiment. After addition of an inhibitor to test, cells were incubated for a designated period of time and washed two times with warm PBS. JC-1 (2 μm in DMEM with 1% serum) was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After washing with warm PBS, the plate was immediately loaded without medium on a plate reader (SpectraMax M2 Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The fluorescence was measured with excitation wavelength at 485 nm, dual emission filters at 529 and 590 nm, and cutoff at 515 nm. Each experiment was done in triplicate with two readings. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by the ratio of the relative fluorescence between 590 and 529 nm. Immunoblotting—Caspase activation was measured by Western blotting. Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% serum and then in DMEM with 1% serum 18 h before the start of the experiment. Rotenone was added at a final concentration of 1 μm. After incubation, cells were lysed for 10 min on ice with 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Protein was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of methanol. Samples (80 μg of total protein) were loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Activated forms of caspases 9, 3, and 7 were visualized, respectively, with anti-caspase 9 (1/1000), anti-caspase 3 (1/1000), and anti-caspase 7 (1/1000) antibodies after transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The incubation was carried out in TBST (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. For kinase phosphorylation analysis, PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were grown in 12-well plates, and the medium was replaced with DMEM with 1% serum for 18 h before the start of the experiment. Cells were incubated with 1 μm rotenone in Krebs medium (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 15 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm NaF, and a complete mixture of protease inhibitors. Forty μg of total protein were loaded per lane on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm). The membrane was incubated with appropriate antibodies (1/1000) overnight at 4 °C in TBST with 5% milk. Blots were revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) and exposed on blue X-rays film. To ensure equal loading of proteins in each lane, the same blot was reprobed with the anti-total kinase antibody. Immunoblotting analysis for AIF and EndoG relocalization was performed by loading the mitochondrial fraction (2 μg of protein) and the cytoplasmic fractions (60 μg of protein) (see “Subcellular Fractionation”). After blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane AIF and EndoG were revealed by anti-AIF antibody (1/1000) and anti-EndoG antibody (1/500). Fluorescence Microscopy Analysis—Ndi1 staining was performed on PC12-NDI1 cells as described previously (22Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 12-mm coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice. After washing with TBS the cells were blocked for 45 min with image-iT FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen). Antibody against Ndi1 (1/250) was applied on the coverslips for 18 h at 4 °C in TBS with 10% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100. Ndi1 staining was revealed by incubation with a rabbit secondary antibody labeled with FITC for 5 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS (three times for 5 min), cells were mounted with Mowiol and observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). AIF relocalization was monitored on PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells after 48 h of rotenone (1 μm) exposure. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation of coverslips with TBS containing 10% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 45 min at ambient temperature. Antibodies against AIF (1/300) and COX (1/300) were applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies, anti-mouse FITC (1/100), and anti-rabbit rhodamine red-X (1/500) were used to show AIF and COX staining, respectively. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol and examined under a fluorescence microscope. For assessment of cyt c relocalization, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against F0F1-ATPase (1/300) and cyt c (1/200) in TBS with 10% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Staining of the α-subunit of F0F1-ATPase and cyt c was done with the anti-mouse rhodamine red-X and anti-rabbit FITC, respectively. 8-Oxo-dG staining was performed on the cells grown on glass coverslips. After rotenone incubation, cells were washed for 10 min with TBS and fixed with 70% ethanol pre-cooled at -20 °C for 10 min on ice. The coverslips were washed with a large amount of TBS and were soaked in 37 °C using TBS supplemented with 100 μg/ml of DNase-free RNase A for 1 h. To increase the 8-oxo-dG recognition, cells were incubated with 4 n HCl for 7 min. The pH was raised by two 2-min washes with 500 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Cells were blocked with TBS containing 5% FBS, 5% horse serum, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 2 h. Primary mouse antibody anti-8-oxo-dG (1/300) was added to the cells in TBS with 2.5% FBS, 2.5% horse serum, and 0.05% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Anti-mouse FITC (1/100) was used in the same incubation medium for 5 h at room temperature. The mitochondrial network was counterstained using 50 nm of red Mito-Tracker CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) on live cells for 30 min immediately before the fixation step. ROS formation in PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells was visualized as follows. Cells were incubated with 1 μm rotenone in DMEM with 1% serum for up to 6 h and then washed twice with warm medium. MitoSOX (Invitrogen) was diluted at a final concentration of 1.5 μm in warm DMEM with 1% serum and added to cells. After incubation with MitoSOX for 10 min, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, mounted onto glass slides with Mowiol, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. All images were taken under identical exposure conditions in order to evaluate the intensity of the MitoSOX fluorescence accurately (23Robinson K.M. Janes M.S. Pehar M. Monette J.S. Ross M.F. Hagen T.M. Murphy M.P. Beckman J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The NADH concentration in mitochondria was measured by using mitochondria isolated from PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells as before (17Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mitochondria (16.4 μg) were suspended in 220 μl of the isotonic mitochondria buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the fluorescence was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 351 and 466 nm, respectively, by using a 455 nm cutoff filter. Other Analytical Procedures—Protein concentration was determined by a Coomassie protein assay kit from Pierce. SDS-PAGE was performed by a modified method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends. Expression of the Ndi1 Enzyme in PC12 Cells and Its Protection against Toxic Effects Caused by Complex I Inhibitors—In order to evaluate the protection of PC12 cells provided by expression of the Ndi1 enzyme, we compared the effects of complex I inhibition on cell survival and morphological changes between control PC12 cells and the PC12 cells infected with recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the NDI1 gene (PC12-NDI1) (21Seo B.B. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 336-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expressed Ndi1 enzyme was predominantly located to mitochondria as evidenced by its colocalization with cytochrome c oxidase in the immunostaining images of the cells (supplemental Fig. 1). PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of rotenone for 4 days, and the extent of cell death was assessed by staining the cells with trypan blue (Fig. 1). The control cells exhibited 25% of cell death at 0.25 μm rotenone. Under the same conditions, no cell death was observed in the PC12-NDI1 cells. At the highest rotenone concentration used (1 μm), 75% of the control cells died, whereas the PC12-NDI1 cells retained a survival rate of 75%. It should be noted that rotenone tends to bind to serum in the incubation medium; therefore, the serum concentration was reduced to 1%. In fact, the inhibition efficiency of rotenone was varied with the amount of serum present in the medium (data not shown). One of the characteristic features of apoptosis in cells is condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus. These features could be seen on cells treated with rotenone. In Fig. 2A, PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were exposed to 1 μm rotenone for 24 h, after which nuclei were stained with DAPI. The apoptotic nuclei, marked with arrowheads in Fig. 2A, are clearly visible in the rotenone-treated PC12 cells. Fragmentation of nuclei was significantly less with the PC12-NDI1 cells. Another typical feature of apoptosis is DNA fragmentation. As seen in Fig. 2B, PC12 cells incubated with rotenone for 24 h exhibited the characteristic pattern of DNA laddering. Again, the cells expressing the Ndi1 enzyme did not show discernible DNA fragmentation. We have reported earlier that inhibition of complex I causes ROS formation which oxidatively damage mtDNA to a significantly greater extent than nDNA and that the Ndi1 enzyme exerts protective effect against this DNA modification (17Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These experiments were done with a relatively short (6 h) incubation of the cells. When PC12 cells were exposed to rotenone for 24 h, nDNA was also extensively oxidized as seen in immunostaining of cells for 8-oxo-dG, an indicator of damaged DNA (Fig. 3A). Even under these severe conditions, PC12-NDI1 cells showed little or no oxidative damage in either mtDNA or nDNA, which is in good agreement with the nDNA fragmentation data presented above. To examine the ROS production more directly, we used MitoSOX which is reported to work as a probe for mitochondrial formation of (O2ċ¯ (23Robinson K.M. Janes M.S. Pehar M. Monette J.S. Ross M.F.

Sci. 2005; 88: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PC12 and PC12-NDI1 cells were incubated with rotenone for 4 h and then loaded with MitoSOX for 10 min. Positive staining with MitoSOX was observed with the control cells but not with the PC12-NDI1 cells (Fig. 3B). We then tested other complex I inhibitors, fenpyroximate and pyridaben, as well as a complex III inhibitor antimycin A. They all caused O2ċ¯ generation in control cells. As expected, the presence of the Ndi1 enzyme suppressed O2ċ¯ formation by complex I inhibitors but not by complex III inhibitor. MitoSOX staining was seen as early as 2 h of incubation with the inhibitors (data not shown). An image at a higher magnification clearly showed that MitoSOX mainly stained the mitochondrial network (Fig. 3B). Activation of Caspase 9 but Not Caspase 3 by Complex I Inhibitors—Knowing that the Ndi1 enzyme can be used to prevent ROS generation and apoptosis induced by complex I inhibitors, we investigated apoptotic events in more detail by comparing the control PC12 cells and the PC12-NDI1 cells. First, among many caspases known to date, we focused on caspase 9 and caspase 3 because they both act as a key factor in mitochondria-driven apoptosis (26Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Caspase activation occurs through a cleavage of the pro-form of the protein that can be assessed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. The cells were grown to 80% confluence and then incubated with 1 μm rotenone for 0–6 h (Fig. 4A). In control cells, the cleaved active form of caspase 9 began to appear within 1 h of rotenone exposure. The activation was also observed with the other complex I inhibitors, fenpyroximate and pyridaben (Fig. 4B). On the contrary the PC12-NDI1 cells did not show any cleaved form of caspase 9 within 6 h of incubation. Antimycin A, which is reported to exert apoptotic effects on mammalian cells (27King M.A. Radicchi-Mastroianni M.A. Cytometry. 2002; 49: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), induced activation of caspase 9 in both control and PC12-NDI1 cells (Fig. 4B). It is generally believed that caspase 9 activation is mainly elicited by cyt c released from the mitochondria. Therefore, we examined relocalization of cyt c into the cytoplasm in the presence and absence of rotenone by analyzing fluorescence images obtained by immunostaining of the cells with anti-cyt c antibody (supplemental Fig. 2). Fig. 4D summarizes the result of such analysis. The release of cyt c becomes apparent at 4 h of rotenone incubation in PC12 cells, whereas no cyt c was detected in the cytoplasm of PC12-NDI1 cells. In a typical caspase pathway, caspase 3 activation follows caspase 9 activation. We assayed for pro-caspase 3 activation by immunoblotting analysis. Surprisingly, we could not detect the active form of caspase 3 in the PC12 or PC12-NDI1 cells after 6 h of rotenone exposure (Fig. 4C). Similarly, no activation of caspase 7 was observed even after 18 h of incubation with rotenone (Fig. 4E). To ensure that activation of these caspases could occur in PC12 or PC12-NDI1 cells, we incubated the cells with staurosporine, a well known chemical that promotes apoptosis in cells (28Kabir J. Lobo M. Zachary I. Bio"
https://openalex.org/W2124187618,"Short-term synaptic plasticity influences how presynaptic spike patterns control the firing of postsynaptic targets. Here we investigated whether specific mechanisms of short-term plasticity are regulated in a target-dependent manner by comparing synapses made by cerebellar granule cell parallel fibers onto Golgi cells (PF-->GC synapse) and Purkinje cells (PF-->PC synapse). Both synapses exhibited similar facilitation, suggesting that any differential short-term plasticity does not reflect differences in the initial release probability. PF-->PC synapses were highly sensitive to stimulus bursts, which could result in either depression of subsequent responses, mediated by endocannabinoid-dependent retrograde signaling, or enhancement of responses through posttetanic potentiation (PTP). In contrast, stimulus bursts had remarkably little effect on the strength of PF-->GC synapses. Unlike PCs, GCs were unable to regulate their PF synapses by releasing endocannabinoids. Moreover, PTP was reduced at the PF-->GC synapse compared to the PF-->PC synapse. Thus, the target-dependence of PF synapses arises from the differential expression of both retrograde signaling and PTP."

Although named after their role in regulation of NHE3, these proteins affect many classes of proteins. Among them, transport proteins are the most frequently identified, and the most intensely studied function of the NHERF proteins is in regulation of these transport proteins (7Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Cunningham R. Weinman E.J. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of actions involved are multiple in the regulation of transport proteins. These include directing delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane from the synthetic pathway and/or recycling system, affecting plasma membrane retention, and more directly affecting turnover number (7Shenolikar S.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zachos N.C. Li Hodson C. Chen Y. Milgram S. Donowitz M. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 177Google Scholar). Knockdown studies of each NHERF family member have the potential to determine the role of each individual family member, although few studies have been reported using this approach (21Takahashi Y. Morales F.C. Kreimann E.L. Georgescu M.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J.

Nonetheless, these models do not reproduce the complexity of intact tissue, in which NHERF family proteins may be present in adjacent cells of different types that interact. Knocking out individual and multiple NHERF family members in mouse intestine and proximal tubule is a promising approach, and NHERF1 and NHERF3/PDZK1 knock-out mice have been partially characterized (1Weinman E.J.

It has been assumed that regulation of NHE3 by common agonists acts by similar mechanisms in these two epithelia. However, suggestions have also been made that regulation of NHE3 by trafficking is very different between these two tissues, with the possibility that NHE3 trafficking only occurs between the microvilli and intervillus clefts in proximal tubule, whereas NHE3 traffics in the intestine by the more conventional plasma membrane → intervillus clefts (clathrin-coated pits and lipid rafts) → common and recycling endosomes → return to surface and some entry to degradative pathway of late endosomes → microvesicular bodies → lysosomes (28Li X.

Hypertens. 2003; 12: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Comparisons of regulation of NHE3 between small intestine and proximal tubule by the same agonist has the potential to provide further insights into how NHE3 is regulated differently in these two epithelia. A role for NHERF1 in cAMP inhibition in the mouse proximal tubule has been suggested based on comparison of wild type and NHERF1-/- mouse NHE3 activity in BB membrane vesicle preparations and in primary cultures of these cells (26Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, studies of the effect of cAMP on NHE3 activity in intact renal proximal tubule or ileal Na+ absorptive cells from wild type compared with NHERF-/- mice have not been reported. This study describes development of a method using multi-photon microscopy to quantitate apical membrane NHE3 activity in intact mouse small intestine and proximal tubule and demonstrates important differences between cAMP inhibition of NHE3 in these two epithelial tissues and in the dependence of NHE3 regulation on NHERF1. Materials—SNARF-4F acetoxymethyl ester was from Invitrogen; HOE694 was from Sonafi-Aventis; 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was from BioLog; salts and other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher at the highest grade available. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to NHE3 (Ab1381 and Univ. of Arizona), NHERF1 (Ab5199), and NHERF2 (Ab2570) were previously characterized (31Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.

A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Anti-ezrin and anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma; anti-EPAC1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Animals—Male NHERF1-/- mice bred into a C57Bl/6 background (Charles River) for at least six generations were produced from heterozygotes as initially reported (26Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). NHERF1-/- mice and wild type male C57Bl/6 mice were studied between 10 and 14 weeks of age. The mice were maintained under standard light and climate conditions in the animal facility of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine with ad libitum access to water and chow. Experiments with animals were carried out using protocols approved by the Animal Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University. Isolation of Jejunum, Ileum, and Kidney Cortex for Na+/H+ Exchange Activity Assays—Mice were briefly anesthetized with ether and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The abdomen was immediately opened by midline incision and proximal jejunum (∼2 cm in length starting ∼1 cm distal to ligament of Treitz), and distal ileum (∼3 cm in length ending 1 cm proximal to the ileo-cecal junction) were excised and placed immediately in cold “Na+ buffer” (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm probenecid, pH 7.4) and opened along the antimesenteric border. 6–8-mm pieces were mounted with Krazy Glue (Elmer's Products Inc., Columbus, OH) onto a glass coverslip with the mucosal surface facing up. The kidney was cut in half with a razor blade, the capsule was removed, and the cortex was excised using a razor blade. 1–1.5-mm-thick slices were glued onto coverslips. All preparations were performed on ice. The glue used for mounting had no autofluorescent signal and did not affect viability of cells since the percent of cells taking up propidium iodide at the end of the experiment was similar to non-glued tissue maintained in Na+ buffer (data not shown). cAMP Treatment before Study for Electron Microscopy or Immunochemistry—Ileum or kidney segments were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Ringer-HCO3, 10 mm glucose, gassed at 95% O2, 5% CO2, and then exposed at 37 °C to 100 μm 8-Br-cAMP or an equal volume of H2O (as vehicle control) for 30 min and then examined for electron microscopy or immunohistochemistry. Measurement of Mouse Jejunum, Ileal, and Renal Cortical NHE3 Activity by Multi-photon Microscopy—The wavelength for excitation of SNARF-4F for conventional confocal microscopy is between 488 and 530 nm with emission 580 and 640 nm. The emission wavelengths are the same for the two-photon microscope, whereas the wavelength for dye excitation was determined empirically. Wavelengths between 740 and 800 nm produced the largest emission fluorescence without visible tissue damage with average power from the Ti: Sa laser ∼800–860 milliwatts and pulse bandwidth ∼16–18 nm, corresponding to <50 fs pulse duration at 80 MHz repetition rate. This excitation was attenuated by the optical system and by a combination of neutral density filters such that the average intensity at the focal plane was <10 milliwatts. SNARF-4F Loading and Imaging—The protocol for imaging intracellular pH of intact mouse jejunum, ileum, or kidney cortex using multi-photon microscopy is described under “Results.” By using a 60×/1.00 water immersion objective (Nikon), the images of the jejunal and ileal villus or renal cortical proximal tubule cells loaded with the “dual emission” pH-sensitive dye, SNARF-4F in Na+ buffer, pH 7.4, were visualized using a multi-photon laser scanning microscope (MRC-1024MP, Bio-Rad) powered by a wide band, infrared (780 nm) combined photo-diode pump laser and mode-locked titaniumsapphire laser (Tsunami Ti: Sa laser, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA). The 8-bit images were recorded and stored, after which fluorescence intensity was calculated off-line using MetaMorph 5.0 rl software (Molecular Devices Corp.) as described below. Jejunum, ileum, and renal cortical slices were loaded with 20 μm SNARF-4F in Na+ buffer at 37 °C for 35 min with 95% O2, 5% CO2 gassing. The coverslip with the glued tissue was then placed in a perfusion chamber (RC-21BDW, Warner Instrument), mounted onto a heated microscope stage at 25 °C (PH series, Warner Instrument), and perfused using a peristaltic pump (Imatec; Reglo, Switzerland) at 1 ml/min with Na+ buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Tissue was then acidified using a prepulse, which consisted of perfusing with 60 mm NH4Cl for 30 min followed by N-methyl-d-glucamine (“NMDA”) buffer (same as Na+ buffer with NMDA replacing Na+) for 20–25 min. To monitor Na+/H+ exchange activity as the initial rate of pH recovery, the NMDA buffer was switched to Na+ buffer. Both buffers contained 50 μm HOE694 to eliminate the contributions of NHE1 and NHE2. As described under Results, reagents of interest (100 μm 8-Br-cAMP, 100 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 50 or 1 μm H-89) were added to all perfusion buffers. 1 mm probenecid was in all perfusates to prevent SNARF-4F leakage (33Steinberg T.H. Newman A.S. Swanson J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 34Di Virgilio F. Steinberg T.H. Swanson J.A. Silverstein S.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 915-920PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chu S. Montrose M.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 783-793Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The leakage of dye was greater in small intestine than in kidney. In all tissues the leakage of dye was increased when specimens were perfused with Na+-free buffer (NMDA buffer). This suggested that extracellular Na+ retained the SNARF-4F inside the cells. Because SNARF-4F leakage in kidney was much less than in small intestine, one slice of kidney cortex was used for both control and treated conditions sequentially (time control studied in parallel), whereas in experiments in small intestine, two separate pieces of tissues obtained from two animals were used for the control/treated conditions. SNARF-4F Emission—For images for each optical section (small intestine and kidney cortex), 0–50 μm from villus tip and cut surface, both at 10 μm steps (Fig. 1, A and B), were taken at 580 and 640 nm and stored. These conditions allowed quantifiable signals to be studied at depths up to 40–50 μm from the villus tip or cortical surface. Below that, the signal became too dim to obtain quantitative ratiometric data. Analysis of Collected Images—Optical images for analysis were taken typically starting at 20 and 30 μm from the tip of villus or 10 μm below the cut surface of the kidney cortex to avoid villus cells potentially close to shedding into the small intestinal lumen and damaged cortical cells from the slice preparation. Regions of interest (ROI) including regions for measurement of background were randomly chosen in 2–3 individual villi (Fig. 1C) or proximal tubules. Fluorescence intensity in gray levels that correspond to relative amounts of SNARF-4F for each ROI (16–21 ROIs per time point) for both 640- and 580-nm emissions was calculated using MetaMorph. The intensity of background was subtracted from each chosen ROI. The 640/580 ratio for each ROI was calculated, average value of ROIs were determined for each time point, and 640/580 ratios over time were determined followed by conversion to pH values with internal pH standards using Microsoft Excel. The Na+/H+ exchange activity of NHE3 was determined as the initial rate in pHi change by calculating the initial steep pHi slope after the addition of Na+ buffer using linear curve fit analysis (Origin 6.0) and presented as ΔpH/min. Immunofluorescence Staining of Ileum for NHE3, NHERF1, and NHERF2—Tissue samples exposed to cAMP or control solutions were obtained as described above and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C and paraffin-embedded. Histological sections (4 μm thick) were mounted onto Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher) and heat-fixed. Slides were microwaved for antigen recovery in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6 (Sigma) at power level setting 9 (Panasonic model NN-C980B Conventional Microwave Oven, Secaucus, NJ) for 2–5 min. After cooling for 30 min, sections were washed in PBS and preblocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then for 48 h (4 °C) with polyclonal NHERF1, NHERF2, or NHE3 antibodies, diluted 1:500 in 5% normal goat serum-PBS. In parallel studies using the same animals, kidney cortex slices also were immediately fixed in fresh PLP (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.875 m l-lysine-HCl, 0.1 m sodium-metaperiodate) for 2 h at room temperature. Tissues were rinsed twice in 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 m sodium phosphate for 10 min before leaving tissues in rinsing solution overnight at 4 °C. Cortical kidney slices were placed in plastic embedding molds and filled with OCT embedding medium (Tissue-Tek). Molds were then immediately submerged in isopentane and placed on dry ice. After excess solvent had evaporated, molds were stored at −80 °C until sectioned. 8-μm kidney sections were fixed in ice-cold 95% methanol for 10 min. Sections were rinsed three times in 1× PBS and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.02% sodium azide for 30 min at room temperature. Kidney sections were incubated with a polyclonal primary antibody to NHE3 (Ab1381) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature With both methods of fixation, ileal and kidney sections were then washed twice in PBS for 10 min and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa-fluor secondary antibodies, each diluted 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed twice with PBS, autofluorescence-quenched with 1% Sudan Black (Sigma) in 70% methanol for 10 min at room temperature, counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen), and mounted with Gel Mount (Sigma). Ileal and kidney sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal fluorescence microscope (63× objective, oil immersion) for fluorescence and Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC). Electron Microscopy of Ileum from Wild Type and NHERF1-/- Mice—Tissue samples exposed to cAMP or control solutions in vitro were obtained as described above and fixed by immersion in ice-cold 1.6–2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, for 60 min. During that time tissue was cut into smaller segments (∼3 mm on a side). After rinsing in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 3.5% sucrose, the tissue was incubated in reduced osmium (1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, 1% OsO4 in the same buffer) for 60 min on ice, rinsed several times in water, dehydrated through a series of graded EtOH, and embedded in EPON 812. Ultrathin sections were prepared, stained with uranyl acetate and then lead citrate, and viewed with a Hitachi 7600 microscope. Microvillar lengths were determined at a magnification of ×25000 at the microscope using the “measurement” tool. Three independent experiments were performed, and the microvilli of 5–13 cells were measured for each treatment. Ileal and Proximal Tubule Total Membrane Preparation/Immunoblot from Wild Type and NHERF1-/- Mice—Ileum (distal half of small intestine) and kidney cortex were excised from animals. Ilea were rinsed with ice-cold 0.9% saline and opened along the anti-mesenteric borders. Kidney cortices were rinsed in 0.9% saline and then transferred into homogenization buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF). Ileal villus cells were scraped with a glass slide and placed into homogenization buffer B (60 mm mannitol, 2.4 mm Tris, pH 7.1, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylalanine). Protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) 1:100 was added to buffers A and B, and phosphoramidon (1:1000) was added only to buffer B. Scraped ileal villus cells in buffer B and kidney cortex in buffer A were homogenized at 4 °C with a Polytron (10 times for 10 s at speed 5 with a 20 s interval between each burst) followed by homogenization of samples in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and nuclei. Supernatants were then centrifuged at 40000 rpm for 60 min, and total membrane pellets were collected. The resulting total membranes were resuspended in buffer A for kidney preparations and in buffer B for ileal mucosa. The protein concentrations in total membrane were measured with BCA (Sigma). Samples were analyzed with SDS-PAGE Western blotting using primary antibodies for EPAC1, ezrin, actin, or NHERF1 with fluorescently labeled secondary goat anti-mouse IRDye TM800 antibodies (Rockland). The fluorescence intensity of detected protein bands was quantified by the Odyssey system (LI-COR). Statistics—Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's unpaired and paired t-tests. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Calibration of the Fluorescence Response of SNARF-4F in Kidney Cortex and Small Intestine at Different pH Values—Multi-photon technology rather than conventional confocal microscopy was selected to measure intracellular pH because it caused minimal bleaching in the bulk of the sample and induced less phototoxicity, which made longer study periods possible. These studies typically lasted on single pieces of tissue for a total of 2.5 h in jejunum and ileum and 3.5 h in the kidney cortex. The pKa for small intestine and kidney cortex for SNARF-4F acetoxymethyl ester was experimentally determined. Because the fluorescence response of SNARF-4F in solution and intracellularly is often different (pKa of free SNARF-4F is 6.4 (Invitrogen “Molecular Probes” manual), the SNARF-4F response in kidney cortex and in ileum was calculated by the K+ ionophore/nigericin (10 μm) method (36Levine S.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13716-13725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in the presence of 150 mm K+ extracellularly to equilibrate the intracellular pH with the pH-controlled extracellular media. Fig. 2 shows the calibration of the pH response as the ratio of fluorescence intensities of SNARF-4F measured at two different emission wavelengths 640 and 580 nm for kidney cortex (panels A) and ileum (panels C). The calculation of the fluorescence response of the dye to different pH values for kidney cortex (panel B) and ileum (panel D) yields apparent pKa values ∼6.8 and ∼7.4, respectively. Basal NHE3 Activity—The experimental protocol is shown in Fig. 3, A and D. Typically, before acidification, fluorescence was analyzed at 3 time points 1 min apart, and similar numbers of time points and timing were analyzed after prepulse with NH4Cl and during incubation in NMDA buffer to determine basal Na+/H+ exchange activity under acidified conditions. Then 12–15 readings were obtained at 1-min intervals during pH recovery in Na+ buffer. Calibration of 640/580 ratio was performed using the K+/nigericin method for external pH using pH standards of 6.1–6.3, 6.7–6.8, and 7.3–7.4 (36Levine S.A. Nath S.K. Yun C.H. Yip J.W. Montrose M.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common and important human pathogens, which causes serious life-threatening diseases such as acute otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Pneumococcal infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially among children, the elderly, and the immune-depressed patients. The widespread emergence of antibiotic resistance and the lack of highly effective pneumococcal vaccines against all serotypes of this organism give urgency to elucidation of the molecular processes involved in its pathogenicity (1Kristinsson K.G.

All known pneumococcal bacteriophages encode an amidase or a lysozyme, which hydrolyzes the PG at the final stage of the phage reproductive cycle, leading to bacterial cell lysis. These enzymes, known collectively as endolysins, have been shown to be highly efficient in killing pneumococci in vitro and can eradicate this organism from the upper respiratory tract or from the bloodstream of mice (3Loeffler J.M.

Immun. 2000; 68: 5690-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Only crystal structures of two complete CBPs, those of Cpl-1 (10Hermoso J.A. Monterroso B. Albert A. Galán B. Ahrazem O.

Cpl-1 belongs to the GH25 family of glycosyl hydrolases and cleaves the β1-4 glycosidic bond between the MurNAc and the GlcNAc residues of the pneumococcal PG. Structural knowledge of how this process takes place in Cpl-1 and in all other members of the GH25 family of glycosyl hydrolases is presently lacking. Here we report the crystal structures of the native Cpl-1 lysozyme and of a catalytically inactive mutant variant, referred to as Cpl-1E94Q, in complex with cell wall PG analogues. The combination of crystallographic and computational studies has allowed us to gain unprecedented insights into the recognition events that lead to the catalytic turnover processes. This knowledge is central in understanding how pneumococcal envelope is degraded by Cpl-1, but it also sheds light on the important question of how enzybiotics function against pneumococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. PG Analogues Synthesis—The PG analogues 2S5P and (2S5P)2 were synthesized as described earlier (12Hesek D. Lee M. Morio K. Mobashery S. J. Org.

Expression and Purification of Cpl-1 Endolysin—The native Cpl-1 lysozyme and its Cpl-1E94Q mutant variant were expressed in Escherichia coli DH1 (pCIP100) and E. coli DH1 (pCOB7) cells, respectively, and purified from the crude extracts as described (14Sánchez-Puelles J.M. Sanz J.M. García J.L. García E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Native crystals of Cpl-1 and Cpl-1E94Q were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, as reported previously (15Monterroso B. Albert A. Martínez-Ripoll M. García P. García J.L. Menéndez M. Hermoso J.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1487-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Complexes of the wild-type and mutant lysozymes with disaccharide dipeptide GlcNAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-isoGln) (2S2P), the disaccharide pentapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) (2S5P), and the tetrasaccharide dipentapeptide GlcNAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala))2 (2S5P)2 (Fig. 1) were obtained by soaking the crystals of both proteins in solutions containing the PG analogues. Soaking time was 30 min in all cases except for the 2S5P where the time was 18 h; the concentrations for the ligands were 100 mm for the 2S2P and 25 mm for the 2S5P and the (2S5P)2. GlcNAc and MurNAc monosaccharides, (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)6 oligosaccharides, and the PG analogues MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-isoGln) MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-isoGln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) were also tested without success. The x-ray data sets of the wild-type and Cpl-1E94Q mutant in complex with 2S2P were collected up to 2.3 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively, using the graphite monochromatic CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation generated by an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode generator and a MAR345 image plate detector. The x-ray data sets of the Cpl-1E94Q in complex with 2S5P and (2S5P)2 were measured at the ID29 beamline of the ESRF up to resolutions of 1.8 and 1.7 Å, respectively. Crystals of the four complexes belong to the orthorhombic C2221 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The x-ray diffraction data sets were processed and scaled using the programs MOSFLM (16Leslie A.G.W. Machin J.R. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1987: 39-50Google Scholar) and SCALA from the CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structures of lysozyme complexes with 2S2P were solved using the program AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar), whereas those of the Cpl-1E94Q in complex with 2S5P and (2S5P)2 were solved using the program MOLREP (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the native Cpl-1 (10Hermoso J.A. Monterroso B. Albert A. Galán B. Ahrazem O. García P.

The models were subjected to successive refinement cycles with the CNS program (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). After this initial round of refinement, the model was further refined by iterative maximum likelihood positional and TLS refinement in REFMAC5 from the CCP4 package (17Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Electron density maps of excellent quality were obtained for all ligands. In the complexes with 2S2P, the complete ligand molecule was observed. In the Cpl-1E94Q-2S5P complex, two ligand molecules were seen in the crystallographic structure. Overall, the resulting electron density was of excellent quality except for two amino acid side chains of the linker region between modules (residues 191-200).

A PG model was constructed on the basis of the crystallographic complexes, the hexasaccharide tri-pentapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala))3 (hereafter (2S5P)3). The structure of Cpl-1 obtained from x-ray was edited and prepared. The (2S5P)3 model was constructed from the crystallographic complex Cpl-1E94Q-(2S5P)2 by adding the GlcNAc-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) fragment at positions −1 and −2.

Modelling of Biomolecular Structures and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, Netherlands1995: 425-444Google Scholar) and charges were applied with the use of distance-dependent dielectric constants and conjugate gradient method until the gradient reached 0.005 kcal mol-1·Å-1. Enzyme-ligand complexes were built on the basis of the crystallographic complex and refined using FlexiDock with a genetic algorithm (25Judson O.P. Haydon D. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to determine the optimum ligand geometry. For docking procedure, the protein was considered rigid except the residues involved in the binding site (sphere of 7 Å), whereas the ligands were considered flexible. Several runs of flexidock were performed to obtain a series of model complexes. These complexes were analyzed and clustered in families based on the following: (i) score energy from flexidock results; (ii) agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical model (the interactions were examined with the LPC program (26Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J.E. Abola E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar)); and (iii) free energy of binding (ΔGbind) calculated with Structural Thermodynamics Calculations version 4.3 (27Lavigne P. Bagu J.R. Boyko R. Willard L. Holmes C.F.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The representative conformer from each group was reoptimized. Crystal Structures of Cpl-1 in Complex with PG Analogues—The Cpl-1 structure is folded in two well defined modules connected by a linker (Fig. 2). The catalytic module consists of an irregular (β/α)5β3 barrel where the PG is hydrolyzed. The CBM presents six choline-binding repeats (p1-p6) forming a β-hairpin each and a C-terminal tail of 16 amino acids. The first four repeats (p1-p4) are folded in a super-helical arrangement (CI domain, Fig. 2), whereas the other two repeats (p5-p6) and the C-terminal tail fold as an antiparallel-like six-stranded β-sheet (CII domain) that mediates interaction between modules (Fig. 2). The first four repeats provide two canonical choline-binding sites in Cpl-1, analogous to the same architecture displayed in other CBPs, such as Pce (11Hermoso J.A. Lagartera L. González L. Stelter M. García P. Martínez-Ripoll M. García J.L. Menéndez M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and C-LytA (28Fernández-Tornero C. López R. García E. Giménez-Gallego G. Romero A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An additional choline-binding site, located at the top of the CBM, is formed by three aromatic residues (Trp-210, Phe-218, and Tyr-238). Structural studies were performed with PG analogues shown in Fig. 1. Superimposition of the structures of the crystallized complexes with that of the native Cpl-1 gave r.m.s.d. values ranging from 0.48 to 0.64 Å. The substrate-binding cleft of lysozymes and other glycosyl hydrolases can usually accommodate several saccharide units designated as positions -i (the nonreducing end) through +j. The saccharide units flanking the scissile glycosidic bond are assigned as positions −1 and +1. In all Cpl-1 complexes crystallized, the PG analogues were clearly identified in the electron density maps located along a groove leading to the Cpl-1 active site (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). This groove, hereafter referred to as the peptidoglycan-binding site 1 (PGBS1), is built by a short loop (residues 125-129) after β5 and by the big loop (residues 151-173) placed between β6 and β7. The muropeptide analogues 2S2P (Fig. 3A) and 2S5P (Fig. 3B) interact through their GlcNAc and MurNAc rings with Cpl-1 at positions +1 and +2, respectively, whereas the tetrasaccharide analogue (2S5P)2 binds through the three GlcNAc, MurNAc and GlcNAc rings at positions +1, +2, and +3, respectively (Fig. 3C). The fourth saccharide ring in (2S5P)2 is not seen in the density. A smaller electron density was also found near the active site and was modeled as a formate ion from the precipitant solution (supplemental Fig. 1). The formate ion binding is made possible by interactions with Ser-13, Lys-34, and Tyr-41. Remarkably, no substrate atoms were found at positions −1 and −2, despite extensive crystallization trials with a wide variety of smaller sized analogues (data not shown). The absence of ligand atoms at positions −1 and −2 can be explained by the steric restrictions imposed by the Cpl-1 crystal packing at these positions (Trp-210 of a symmetry-related molecule is ensconced at the putative −2 position). Considering the similarity of structural results among all three complexes, we discuss here the complex of the protein with the largest PG analogue (Cpl-1-(2S5P)2). The substrate analogue binds to the enzyme via two GlcNAc and one MurNAc residues, along with its associated peptide stem. No electron density was observed for either the terminal MurNAc saccharide ring or its stem peptide, but the remainder of the structure of the (2S5P)2 molecule is well defined in the electron density map sequestered in the PGBS1 (Fig. 3C and Fig. 4A). The GlcNAc ring at position +1 is primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-125 and the carboxylic group of the catalytic Glu-94 (Gln in the inactive mutant), as well as by hydrophobic interactions with Ala-151 and Tyr-153 side chains (Fig. 4B). The MurNAc ring in position +2 makes a stacking interaction with Tyr-127. In addition, a polar interaction exists between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-127 and that at C-6 of the MurNAc. The peptide stem is tightly packed with a Cpl-1 loop (residues 151-154). No electron density was observed for the last two amino acids (d-Ala-d-Ala) of the ligand. We add that the solution NMR structure of (2S5P)2 had revealed the l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala portion of the stem peptide totally devoid of structure, consistent with it being a mobile element (29Meroueh S.-O. Bencze K.Z. Hesek D. Lee M. Fisher J.F. Stemmler T.L. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4404-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This mobility would appear to be true also for the d-Ala-d-Ala portion of the ligand in complex with Cpl-1 and hence its lack of observation in the electron density map. A Model of Cpl-1 in Complex with a Larger Peptidoglycan Segment—Crystallization trials failed to provide information on peptidoglycan binding at positions −1 and −2. Meroueh et al. (29Meroueh S.-O. Bencze K.Z. Hesek D. Lee M. Fisher J.F. Stemmler T.L. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4404-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) recently reported the NMR solution structure for (2S5P)2, which revealed that the saccharide backbone of the structure produced dihedral angles for the three consecutive glycosidic bonds that repeated themselves, producing a highly regular right-handed helix for the sugar backbone. Interestingly, this same right-handed helix is also observed in the three saccharide rings of the Cpl-1-(2S5P)2, superimposable to the conformation determined in solution. Edified by this knowledge, we attempted to model a larger structure for the peptidoglycan into the active site of our crystal structure with occupancy at positions −2 to +4. The model revealed contacts of the MurNAc at position −1 and the GlcNAc at −2, a region (hereafter referred to as the peptidoglycan-binding site 2 (PGBS2)) formed by the active site and the β-hairpin region (residues 34 - 45), where the formate ion was found in the crystallographic complexes (Fig. 4A). A network of hydrogen bonds between the N-acetyl group of sugar at position −1 and residues Tyr-59, Tyr-125, and Asp-92 was also seen (Fig. 4C). The stem peptide of the MurNAc at position −1 experiences a network of hydrophobic and polar interactions (detailed in supplemental Tables 2 and 3). These interactions force the −1 sugar to acquire a boat conformation that introduces a kink in the PG right-handed helix. Interactions with GlcNAc at −2 are predicted to take place mainly through a stacking interaction with His-14. Implications for the Catalytic Mechanism of Cpl-1—Hydrolytic action of lysozymes takes place via a general acid/base mechanism that requires two acidic amino acids, one behaves as the proton donor/acid and the other behaves as the nucleophile/base that promotes the hydrolytic attack by a water molecule. The previously proposed (10Hermoso J.A. Monterroso B. Albert A. Galán B. Ahrazem O. García P. Martínez-Ripoll M. García J.L. Menéndez M. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1239-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) electrophilic and nucleophilic residues are Glu-94 and Asp-10, respectively, and are fully conserved within the GH-25 family. As seen by the short distances, Asp-182 and Asp-92 make low barrier hydrogen bonds (30Cleland W.W. Frey P.A. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25529-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) with the catalytic residues (2.42 Å for Asp-10 to Asp-182, and 2.59 Å for Asp-92 to Glu-94), with potential implications for the enzymatic reaction. Furthermore, the distortion of the conformation of the substrate at position −1 to a higher energy species (boat versus chair conformers) generates the kink in the substrate, which is likely to be a high energy species en route to the transition state for the reaction, as has been also described for other glycosyl hydrolases (31David L.Z. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distance of 9.5 Å between the two catalytic residues (Asp-10 and Glu-94) in the Cpl-1 structure is consistent with that expected for an inverting enzyme (9.0 and 9.5 Å for inverting α- and β-glycosidases, respectively, and 4.8 and 5.3 Å for retaining α- and β-glycosidases, respectively) (32Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure (Camb.). 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 33McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The distance of 7.2 Å between Asp-10 and the anomeric carbon of the −1 sugar in the model of Cpl-1-(2S5P)3 complex could accommodate a water molecule between them. Asp-10 would activate the water molecule for attack at the glycosidic bond. The side chain of Glu-94 is at H-bond distance of the oxygen of the β1-4 bond; hence, it is poised for the transfer of a proton to the leaving group oxygen, making the hydrolytic process possible. Peptidoglycan-binding Mechanism—No significant structural differences were found between the complexes with the native Cpl-1 or with the catalytically inactive mutant Cpl-1E94Q upon substrate binding as deduced by their low r.m.s.d. values. However, the structure of the complex with the ligands reveals a profound conformational change of the side chain of Tyr-127 (Fig. 5). This movement involves a change in the values of the two side-chain torsion angles (χ1 and χ2) of Tyr-127, which experience displacements of Δχ1 = 101° and Δχ2 = 25° from the native to the complexed state. In the absence of substrate, the side chain of Tyr-127 is placed in the center of the substrate-binding cleft, making polar interactions with Tyr-125 and Tyr-153, via their hydroxyl groups, and a few water molecules (Fig. 5A). In this conformation, Tyr-127 completely blocks access of the substrate to the active site at position +1. Interaction of the active site with the PG chain facilitates repositioning of the tyrosine side chain to a hydrophobic pocket created by Phe-130 and Pro-129 and places it in a suitable conformation for interacting with the MurNAc at position +2 (Fig. 5B). The displacement of Tyr-127 from the central position in the active site and its subsequent new interaction with MurNAc at position +2 must be pivotal to catalysis. It is not merely that the repositioning of Tyr-127 makes room for binding of PG, but it also would lower the energy barrier for the hydrolytic reaction by its interaction with the substrate, even though this electrostatic interaction is one saccharide downstream from the seat of the reaction. Other observations of note are that substrate analogues lacking the GlcNAc at +1 position or the peptide moiety (of at least two amino acids) on MurNAc at position +2 fail to bind to Cpl-1. These specific interactions at positions +1 and +2 might be crucial in triggering the Tyr-127 movement as a gatekeeper to the active site and to the onset of catalysis. The crystallographic complexes showed that Cpl-1 interacts well with the first two amino acids of MurNAc at position +2 and to a lesser extent with the third (l-Lys). The expanded computational model reveals that the peptide moiety of the MurNAc at position −1 should be nicely anchored within PGBS2 region (Fig. 4, A and C). This interaction network can explain why mutation of Glu-37 (a residue within the PGBS2 site) to alanine or lysine results in a drastic loss of the catalytic activity, whereas the E37Q mutant variant still retained 67% of activity (34Sanz J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2114004825,"Smooth-pursuit eye velocity to a moving target is more accurate after an initial catch-up saccade than before, an enhancement that is poorly understood. We present an individual-differences-based method for identifying mechanisms underlying a physiological response and use it to test whether visual motion signals driving pursuit differ pre- and postsaccade. Correlating moment-to-moment measurements of pursuit over time with two psychophysical measures of speed estimation during fixation, we find two independent associations across individuals. Presaccadic pursuit acceleration is predicted by the precision of low-level (motion-energy-based) speed estimation, and postsaccadic pursuit precision is predicted by the precision of high-level (position-tracking) speed estimation. These results provide evidence that a low-level motion signal influences presaccadic acceleration and an independent high-level motion signal influences postsaccadic precision, thus presenting a plausible mechanism for postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit."
https://openalex.org/W1965751405,"Activated protein C (APC) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma serine protease which down-regulates the clotting cascade by inactivating procoagulant factors Va and VIIIa by limited proteolysis. In addition to its anticoagulant effect, APC also exhibits cytoprotective and antiinflammatory activity through the endothelial protein C receptor-dependent cleavage of protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) on endothelial cells. Recent mutagenesis data have indicated that the basic residues of two surface loops including those on 39 and the Ca2+-binding 70–80 loops constitute interactive sites for both factors Va and VIIIa, thereby mediating the interaction of APC specifically with these procoagulant cofactors. The basic residues of both loops have been discovered to be dispensable for the interaction of APC with PAR-1. It is not known if a similar exosite-dependent interaction contributes to the specificity of APC recognition of PAR-1 on endothelial cells. In this study, we have identified two acidic residues on helix-162 (Glu-167 and Glu-170) on the protease domain of APC which are required for the protease interaction with PAR-1, but not for its interaction with the procoagulant cofactors. Thus, the substitution of either Glu-167 or Glu-170 with Ala eliminated the cytoprotective signaling properties of APC without affecting its anticoagulant activity. These mutants provide useful tools for initiating in vivo studies to understand the extent to which the anticoagulant versus antiinflammatory activity of APC contributes to its beneficial effect in treating severe sepsis.

In this study, we have identified two acidic residues on helix-162 (Glu-167 and Glu-170) on the protease domain of APC which are required for the protease interaction with PAR-1, but not for its interaction with the procoagulant cofactors. Thus, the substitution of either Glu-167 or Glu-170 with Ala eliminated the cytoprotective signaling properties of APC without affecting its anticoagulant activity. These mutants provide useful tools for initiating in vivo studies to understand the extent to which the anticoagulant versus antiinflammatory activity of APC contributes to its beneficial effect in treating severe sepsis. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent plasma serine protease zymogen that upon activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin (TM) 3The abbreviations used are:TMthrombomodulinAPCactivated protein CEPCRendothelial protein C receptorGlaγ-carboxyglutamic acidTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingPCIprotein C inhibitorPAR-1protease-activated receptor 1PC/PSphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine. 3The abbreviations used are:TMthrombomodulinAPCactivated protein CEPCRendothelial protein C receptorGlaγ-carboxyglutamic acidTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelingPCIprotein C inhibitorPAR-1protease-activated receptor 1PC/PSphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine. complex at the endothelial cell surface down-regulates the clotting cascade by a feedback loop mechanism (1Esmon C.T.

The catalytic activity of the thrombin-TM complex toward protein C is markedly improved if the substrate is also bound to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) at the surface of vascular cells (4Stearns-Kurosawa D.J.

The γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of protein C is responsible for its high affinity (Kd ∼ 30 nm) interaction with EPCR, and thus both protein C and APC exhibit identical affinity for the cell surface receptor (5Regan L.M.

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that in addition to its anticoagulant activity, activated protein C (APC) also exhibits potent cytoprotective and antiinflammatory activity when the protease remains associated with EPCR, thereby acquiring the capacity to cleave protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) at the surface of endothelial cells (6Riewald M.

Neuron. 2004; 41: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Because the catalytic efficiency of APC toward PAR-1 is much lower than that of thrombin (10Ludeman M.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is not well understood how APC can signal endothelial cells through the cleavage of the same receptor when thrombin is present. The recent findings that all three receptors TM, EPCR, and PAR-1 are co-localized in the lipid rafts of endothelial cells (11Bae J-S. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The molecular mechanism through which APC interacts specifically with its target substrates factors Va (fVa) and VIIIa (fVIIIa) in the anticoagulant pathway has been extensively studied (13Friedrich U.

The high specificity of APC interaction with both procoagulant cofactors is determined by several basic residues that are clustered on two exposed surface loops on the protease domain referred to as 39 loop and 70–80 loop (17Rezaie A.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the chymotrypsin numbering system (18Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of the basic residues of either one of these loops in APC (Fig. 1) has resulted in mutant proteases with dramatically impaired anticoagulant activity but normal cytoprotective signaling property (19Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that the determinants of specificity of substrate recognition by APC in the two alternative pathways are different. With the exception of the Gla domain-dependent interaction of APC with EPCR (20Oganesyan V. Oganesyan N. Terzyan S. Qu D. Dauter Z. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Blood. 2004; 104: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), no other data are available as to how APC recognizes its physiological receptor substrate in the protective signaling pathway. The x-ray crystal structure of a Gla-domainless derivative of APC has been resolved (21Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The basic residues of the two surface loops that determine the specificity of APC interaction with the procoagulant cofactors are spatially located at the right side of the active site in the structure of the protease in the standard orientation shown in Fig. 1. There are two acidic residues (Glu-167 and Glu-170) at the left side of the active site toward the back of the APC protease domain on a helical structure (helix 162–170, hereafter called 162-helix) that are not conserved in the homologous region of other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteases. By contrast, the 162-helix residues in both factors IXa (22Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and Xa (fXa) (23Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol.

Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and prothrombinase (25Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), respectively. These previous results with the procoagulant proteases provided the rational for investigating the role of the two non-conserved acidic residues of 162-helix in the catalytic activity of APC both in the anticoagulant and antiinflammatory pathways. Hence, in this study, we substituted both Glu-167 and Glu-170 of APC with Ala in separate constructs and evaluated their role in determining the specificity of APC interaction with its physiological substrates in both the anticoagulant and cytoprotective signaling pathways. Our results suggest that both residues play a critical role in the specific APC recognition of PAR-1 in the latter pathway. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Construction and expression of wild-type protein C in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells have been described previously (26Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein C mutants containing Ala substitutions in place of Glu-167 (E167A) and Glu-170 (E170A) (chymotrypsinogen numbering (18Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar)) were constructed by PCR mutagenesis methods in the same expression system as described (26Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant zymogens were purified to homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described (27Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zymogens (0.5–1 mg) were converted to activated protein C by thrombin (25 μg) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) containing 5 mm EDTA for 2 h at 37 °C as described (27Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The APC derivatives were separated from thrombin by an FPLC Mono Q column developed with a 40-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m NaCl. The concentrations of APC derivatives were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm assuming a molecular mass of ∼56 kDa and extinction coefficient (E1%1 cm) of 14.5, by an amidolytic activity assay and by stoichiometric titration of enzymes with known concentrations of recombinant protein C inhibitor (PCI) as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PCI was expressed in HEK-293 cells as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive Ser-195 → Ala (S195A) mutant of APC was expressed and purified as described (28Bae J-S. Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9251-9259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The homogeneity and quality of all recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Human plasma proteins, antithrombin (AT), prothrombin, fXa, and fVa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human protein S was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN) Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (29Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PT (Thrombomax with Ca2+) and aPTT (Alexin) reagents were purchased from Trinity Biotech (St. Louis, MO). Normal pooled plasma was purchased from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). The chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) and S2238 was purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was purchased from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies blocking (H-111) and non-blocking (S-19) the activation of PAR-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biologics (Santa Cruz, CA), and function-blocking EPCR antibody (clone RCR-252) was purchased from Cell Sciences (Canton, MA). Cleavage of Chromogenic Substrates—The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of SpPCa (15–2000 μm) by APC derivatives (4 nm) was measured in TBS containing 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (TBS/Ca2+) at 405 nm at room temperature in a Vmax kinetic microplate reader. The Km and kcat values for the substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anticoagulant Activity—The anticoagulant activity of APC derivatives was evaluated both in purified and plasma based assay systems as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, fVa (2.5 nm) was incubated with increasing concentration of wild-type or mutant APC (0–5 nm) on 25 μm PC/PS vesicles in TBS/Ca2+. Following 6 min incubation at room temperature, the remaining fVa activity was determined in a prothrombinase assay from the fVa-catalyzed prothrombin activation by fXa as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The prothrombinase assay was carried out for 30 s with excess prothrombin (1 μm) and a saturating fXa (10 nm). The remaining activity of fVa was determined from the decrease of the fVa-dependent rate of thrombin generation as monitored by an amidolytic activity assay using 200 μm S2238. The inactivation of fVa by increasing concentrations of APC was also monitored in the presence of protein S (220 nm) as described above with the exception that the time of incubation was decreased to 1 min. The fVa inactivation assay was also carried out with a fixed concentration of APC (1 nm) in the presence of varying concentrations of protein S (0–220 nm) using the same methods. The same fVa inactivation assay was employed to evaluate the apparent affinity of the APC derivatives for interaction with PC/PS vesicles. In this case, the rate of fVa (2.5 nm) inactivation by each APC derivative (2.5 nm) was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of PC/PS vesicles (0–5 μm) for 6 min using the same methods described above. The anticoagulant activities in plasma were evaluated in an aPTT assay using a STart 4 fibrinometer (Diagnostica/Stago, Asnieres, France). Briefly, 0.050 ml TBS lacking or containing 0–20 nm final concentrations of APC derivatives were incubated with a mixture of 0.05 ml of normal pooled plasma plus 0.05 ml of aPTT reagent (Alexin) for 5 min before the initiation of clotting by the addition of 0.05 ml of 35 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C as described (15Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assay—EA.hy926 cells (0.5 × 106) (kindly provided by Dr. C. Edgell from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC) were seeded onto coverslips coated with gelatin as described (11Bae J-S. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9251-9259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 24 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of APC (0–50 nm) for another 24 h. Then, the cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 4 h. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and incubated for 1 h in the dark with a TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) for in situ detection of cell death. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 15 min. The number of apoptotic cells was expressed as the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells of the total number of nuclei determined by Hoechst staining. For the function-blocking antibody treatments of the monolayers, medium was removed, and antibodies were added for 30 min in serum-free medium at a concentration of 25 μg/ml as described (28Bae J-S.

Permeability Assay—EA.hy926 cell permeability in response to TNF-α (10 ng/ml for 18 h) following treatment with increasing concentrations of APC (0–50 nm for 3 h) was quantitated by spectrophotometric measurement of the flux of Evans bluebound albumin across functional EA.hy926 cell monolayers using a modified 2-compartment chamber model as described (28Bae J-S.

Adhesion Assay—Neutrophil adherence to confluent monolayers of TNF-α (10 ng/ml for 4 h) treated EA.hy926 cells in 96-well plates, which were treated with APC derivatives (10 nm for 24 h) was evaluated by fluorescent labeling of neutrophils with 5 μm Vybrant DiD (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C in phenol red-free RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine serum as previously described (28Bae J-S.

The fluorescence of labeled cells was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Device). The percentage of adherent neutrophils was calculated by the formula: % adherence = (adherent signal/total signal) × 100. Interaction with EPCR—The affinity of APC derivatives for interaction with EPCR was evaluated by an ELISA-based binding assay using HPC4-tagged recombinant soluble EPCR (sEPCR) (kindly provided by Dr. Esmon from Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) as described (28Bae J-S. Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9251-9259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The affinity of APC derivatives for interaction with EPCR was also evaluated at the endothelial cell surface employing the permeability assay described above. In this case, the competitive effect of APC derivatives (E167A, E170A, and S195A) and wild-type protein C zymogen (0–100 nm for all competitors) on the barrier protective effect wild-type APC (10 nm) was studied as described above. PAR-1 Cleavage Assay—A recently described alkaline phosphatase-PAR-1 (ALP-PAR-1) cleavage reporter construct was transiently transfected to EA.hy926 cells at 90% confluence in 24-well plates in antibiotic-free Opti-MEM medium using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described (28Bae J-S. Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9251-9259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On the following day, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 5 h. Cells were then incubated for an additional 1 h with varying concentrations of thrombin or APC plus hirudin (4 units/ml). Conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Supernatant was collected and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using EnzoLyte™ pNPP Alkaline Phosphatase Assay Kit (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and Student's t tests (paired or independent) were used to assess data. Differences were considered statistically significant at p values of <0.05. Statistics were performed using the software package SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). All experiments were repeated at least three times. The steady state kinetics of hydrolysis of the tripeptidyl chromogenic substrate, SpPCa, by wild-type and mutant APCs is presented in Table 1. All APC derivatives cleaved the chromogenic substrate with a similar catalytic efficiency, suggesting that the mutagenesis of either Glu-167 or Glu-170 did not adversely affect the folding and/or the reactivity of either the catalytic residues or the extended P1-P3 binding sites of the active site groove. These results were expected, because both Glu-167 and Glu-170 are located on a solvent-exposed helical structure in human APC (Fig. 1). Further support for the lack of a mutagenesis-mediated global effect on the conformation of APC derivatives was provided by the observation that both mutants reacted with the target serpin, PCI, with similar second-order association rate constants (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic constants for the cleavage of Spectrozyme PCa and second-order rate constants for the PCI inhibition of wild-type and mutant enzymes The kinetic constants were calculated from the cleavage rate of increasing concentrations of SpPCa (15–2000 μm) by wild-type and mutant APC (4 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetic values are averages of three measurements ± S.E. The second-order rate constants (k2) for the inhibition of enzymes (2 nm) by PCI (100 nm) were measured from the decrease in initial rates of SpPCa hydrolysis following their incubation with the inhibitor in TBS/Ca2+ for 60 min at room temperature as described (15Yang L.

As presented in Fig. 2, the APC concentration dependence of fVa inactivation both in the absence (panel A) and presence of protein S (panel B) indicated that both E167A and E170A mutants have a normal anticoagulant activity. Further fVa inactivation studies in the presence of increasing concentrations of protein S suggested that both mutants interact with protein S with a similar apparent affinity as evidenced by essentially identical specific activity for both wild-type and mutants at all concentrations of protein S (Fig. 3A). Moreover, both APC mutants exhibited normal apparent affinity for interaction with PC/PS vesicles, as evidenced by their wild-type-like specific activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of PC/PS vesicles (Fig. 3B). Consistent with results in the purified system, both APC mutants exhibited normal activity in the aPTT assay, thus prolonging the clotting time of normal plasma with an efficiency that was essentially identical to that observed with wild-type APC (Fig. 4). These results clearly suggest that neither Glu-167 nor Glu-170 provides a recognition site for APC interaction with the procoagulant cofactors either in the absence or presence of protein S. The results further indicate that the effect of mutagenesis is localized to 162-helix of APC without affecting the conformation of the fVa and fVIIIa binding exosite of the protease.FIGURE 3Protein S and PC/PS concentration dependence of fVa inactivation by wild-type and APC mutants. A, the inactivation of fVa (2.5 nm) by wild-type (○), E167A (•), and E170A (□) APCs (1 nm each) was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of protein S (x-axis) on PC/PS vesicles (25 μm) at room temperature for 1 min in TBS/Ca2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the inactivation of fVa (2.5 nm) by wild-type (○), E167A (•), and E170A (□) APCs (2.5 nm each) was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of PC/PS vesicles for 6 min. The plots are representative experiments out of 2–3 independent and reproducible measurements. An identical half-maximal cofactor activity of ∼3 nm was obtained for protein S with all APC derivatives.

To elucidate the structural origin of the diverse PI specificity of PX domains, we determined the crystal structure of the PX domain from Bem1p that has been reported to bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). We also measured the membrane binding properties of the PX domain and its mutants by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer techniques and calculated the electrostatic potentials for the PX domain in the absence and presence of bound PtdIns(4)P. The Bem1p PX domain contains a signature PI-binding site optimized for PtdIns(4)P binding and also harbors basic and hydrophobic residues on the membrane-binding surface. The membrane binding of the Bem1p PX domain is initiated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the cationic membrane-binding surface of the domain and anionic membrane surfaces, followed by the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues. Unlike other PX domains, the Bem1p PX domain has high intrinsic membrane penetrating activity in the absence of PtdIns(4)P, suggesting that the partial membrane penetration may occur before specific PtdIns(4)P binding and last after the removal of PtdIns(4)P under certain conditions. This structural and functional study of the PtdIns(4)P-binding Bem1p PX domain provides new insight into the diverse PI specificities and membrane-binding mechanisms of PX domains."
https://openalex.org/W2079525730,"Receptor internalization is recognized as an important mechanism for rapidly regulating cell surface numbers of receptors. However, there are conflicting results on the existence of rapid endocytosis of gamma-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABAB) receptors. Therefore, we analyzed internalization of GABAB receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells qualitatively and quantitatively using immunocytochemical, cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and biotinylation methods. The data indicate the existence of rapid constitutive receptor internalization, with the first endocytosed receptors being observed in proximity of the plasma membrane after 10 min. After 120 min, a loss of about 40-50% of cell surface receptors was detected. Stimulation of GABAB receptors with GABA or baclofen did not enhance endocytosis of receptors, indicating the lack of agonist-induced internalization. The data suggest that GABAB receptors were endocytosed via the classical dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway and accumulated in an endosomal sorting compartment before being targeted to lysosomes for degradation. No evidence for recycling of receptors back to the cell surface was found. In conclusion, the results indicate the presence of constitutive internalization of GABAB receptors via clathrin-coated pits, which resulted in lysosomal degradation of the receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2022317389,"The ubiquitin-proteasome and macroautophagy-lysosome pathways are major routes for intracytosolic protein degradation. In many systems, proteasome inhibition is toxic. A Nature article by Pandey et al. shows that this toxicity can be modulated by altering autophagic activity. Their tantalizing results suggest that overexpression of HDAC6 may increase flux through the autophagy pathway, thereby attenuating the toxicity resulting from proteasome inhibition. The ubiquitin-proteasome and macroautophagy-lysosome pathways are major routes for intracytosolic protein degradation. In many systems, proteasome inhibition is toxic. A Nature article by Pandey et al. shows that this toxicity can be modulated by altering autophagic activity. Their tantalizing results suggest that overexpression of HDAC6 may increase flux through the autophagy pathway, thereby attenuating the toxicity resulting from proteasome inhibition. Intracytosolic proteins can be degraded either by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or by a range of lysosome-related pathways (reviewed in Rubinsztein, 2006Rubinsztein D.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway typically regulates levels of short-lived proteins. These are usually initially tagged for degradation by linkage of a ladder of ubiquitin molecules to lysine residues. The ubiquitin chain constitutes a recognition sequence that allows them to be transported to the proteasome, a barrel-shaped, multiprotein, proteolytic complex. The proteasome degrades the proteins into peptides, which are further degraded to amino acids by cytosolic and nuclear peptidases. The proteasome has a narrow pore, which precludes entrance of organelles, multiprotein complexes, and oligomers or aggregated precursors of the intracellular inclusions that characterize many neurodegenerative diseases (like polyglutamine expansion diseases, including Huntington's disease and Kennedy's disease). Such structures can be degraded by macroautophagy (which I will call autophagy). In this pathway, cells form double-layered vesicles around a portion of cytosol. These autophagosomes, which are believed to engulf cytosolic contents in a largely unselective manner, then eventually fuse with lysosomes, where their contents are degraded. In addition to this form of autophagy, there are two other autophagic pathways that can deliver substrates to the lysosome. The first, called microautophagy, involves direct sequestration of cytosolic contents via lysosomal membrane invagination or septation and has only been studied in any depth in yeast. The second pathway, called chaperone-mediated autophagy, involves recognition of certain cytosolic proteins that contain a KFERQ (or similar) pentapeptide motif by hsc70. This then interacts with the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2a, allowing direct translocation across the lysosomal membrane. Pandey and colleagues have recently shown that proteasome inhibition is toxic to Drosophila eyes (Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This initial result was not unexpected—proteasome inhibition is toxic in many settings (e.g., Chen et al., 2005Chen Q. Ding Q. Thorpe J. Dohmen R.J. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as it leads to the accumulation of many key molecules that need to be tightly regulated to prevent toxicity, like p53. Furthermore, global proteasome inhibition may lead to intracellular aggregate formation (Rideout et al., 2001Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The striking result that these authors reported was that the toxicity resulting from the proteasome inhibition mediated by a dominant-negative proteasome subunit was largely rescued by overexpression of HDAC6 (and was enhanced by HDAC6 knockdown). HDAC6 is a member of the histone deacetylase family. Unlike many of its relatives, which have nuclear functions regulating gene expression, HDAC6 is mainly found in the cytosol and has a range of possible functions (reviewed by Boyault et al., 2006Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klauke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). HDAC6 is a microtubule- and dynein-associated protein, and microtubule- and dynein-mediated transport of autophagosomes are required for delivery to lysosomes (Rubinsztein, 2006Rubinsztein D.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Kopito and colleagues previously showed that HDAC6 was required for degradation of mutant huntingtin, an autophagy substrate (Iwata et al., 2005Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40282-40292Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that HDAC6 may be acting to enhance autophagy. Indeed, induction of autophagy with rapamycin also attenuated the toxicity induced by proteasome inhibition (Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Pandey et al. went on to show in Drosophila that overexpression of the mutant polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor (modeling Kennedy's disease) in the presence of its ligand also resulted in toxicity associated with proteasome inhibition and that this toxicity could also be attenuated by overexpression of HDAC6 (Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This effect of HDAC6 overexpression was associated with enhanced turnover of the mutant androgen receptor. This effect was likely due to autophagy, confirming previous studies that have shown that autophagy induction via rapamycin enhances clearance of a range of aggregate-prone, disease-associated intracytosolic proteins in cells, Drosophila and mice, thereby attenuating their toxicities (Ravikumar et al., 2002Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, Ravikumar et al., 2004Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G.

We previously showed that these effects were autophagy dependent in Drosophila, as no effects of rapamycin were observed in flies with hemizygous mutations in the autophagy gene Atg1 (Berger et al., 2006Berger Z. Ravikumar B. Menzies F.M. Oroz L.G. Underwood B.R. Pangalos M.N. Schmitt I. Wullner U. Evert B.O. O'Kane C.J. et al.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar study raises a number of tantalizing possibilities. The first is that there is genuine crosstalk between the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways, as autophagy induction rescued toxicity caused by proteasome inhibition. It is tempting to speculate that autophagy upregulation rescued toxicity mediated by proteasome impairment by simply providing another route for the clearance of the substrates that ordinarily would have been removed by the proteasome. The simplistic expectation is that the proteasome substrates that would be most toxic in the presence of proteasome inhibition would be those with the shortest half-lives—the ubiquitin-proteasome system is characterized by its selectivity and the capacity to clear certain proteins rapidly. By contrast, the autophagy-lysosome pathway typically clears long half-life proteins. Does this mean that autophagy upregulation can provide enough flux to normalize the clearance of short-half-life proteins that would otherwise accumulate rapidly when the proteasome was impaired? This would be surprising given the classical literature suggesting (at least in liver) that the clearance of short-half-life proteins is not influenced by lysosomal inhibitors or by physiological perturbations like starvation that induce autophagy (Mortimore and Poso, 1987Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 539-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While autophagy upregulation may partially compensate short-lived protein degradation in the presence of proteasomal impairment, it is possible that the predominant protective effect of autophagy upregulation may be not at the level of protein clearance, but at the level of cell death. Autophagy inhibition has been shown to sensitize cells to apoptotic insults, while autophagy induction reduces cellular susceptibility to subsequent apoptotic stimuli mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, probably because autophagy reduces the mitochondrial load by removing mitochondria (Boya et al., 2005Boya P. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Casares N. Perfettini J.L. Dessen P. Larochette N. Metivier D. Meley D. Souquere S. Yoshimori T. et al.Mol. Cell.

Genet. 2006; 15: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, autophagy induction protects Drosophila from paraquat toxicity, possibly by the same mechanism (Ravikumar et al., 2006Ravikumar B. Berger Z. Vacher C. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar addressed this possibility in their proteasome toxicity scenario by showing that HDAC6 overexpression did not rescue the rough eye phenotype mediated by the Drosophila cell death protein reaper. However, it is difficult to make conclusive inferences from this experiment, as reaper mediates much of its toxicity in the cytosol by antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (Kornbluth and White, 2005Kornbluth S. White K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and recent data do implicate a role for mitochondrial permeabilization in Drosophila cell death pathways (Abdelwahid et al., 2007Abdelwahid E. Yokokura T. Krieser R.J. Balasundaram S. Fowle W.H. White K. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 793-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). So, autophagy induction may still be protecting against proteasome inhibition-mediated toxicity by removing some of the mitochondria—cells can tolerate a significant reduction in mitochondrial load before showing effects on respiration. Another intriguing possibility suggested by the paper is that proteasome induction leads to a compensatory increase in autophagy. This was suggested by data reporting an increased number of autophagosomes in flies with proteasome inhibition. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing similar phenomena in cell culture and in C. elegans (Chen et al., 2005Chen Q. Ding Q. Thorpe J. Dohmen R.J. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Iwata et al., 2005Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40282-40292Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). While the idea that cells may induce autophagy to protect themselves in situations where the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is inhibited is appealing, there are again other possibilities that could be considered. Autophagosomes accumulate if there is increased autophagosome synthesis (where there is generally an increase in autophagic protein clearance), but also if there is decreased autophagosome removal due to impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion (which would result in decreased protein clearance from a block in the autophagic pathway). It will be important in future studies to discriminate between these possibilities. This study also suggests that HDAC6 overexpression enhances clearance of various substrates via autophagy. It is likely that this is how HDAC6 is working, as it enhanced the clearance of ligand-bound mutant androgen receptor. Also, its overexpression protected against toxicity mediated by proteasome inhibition. In the future, it will be important to directly test whether HDAC6 enhances autophagic protein clearance under both normal conditions and in the presence of proteasome inhibition. It will also be interesting to know how HDAC6 modulates autophagy and at what stage of the process. While the results reported by Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar are intriguing, HDAC6 overexpression/hyperactivity may not be a straightforward therapeutic target for polyglutamine diseases or for autophagy upregulation. Recently, Boyault and colleagues showed that HDAC6 negatively regulates proteasomal turnover of ubiquitinated proteins (Boyault et al., 2006Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klauke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggests that HDAC6 overexpression may be beneficial if the proteasome is significantly impaired, but may slow turnover of at least a subset of proteins in normal conditions. Although Pandey et al., 2007Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiPropsero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar show that the proteasome is inhibited in Drosophila by ligand-bound polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor, this phenomenon has not been observed in mouse models of a number of other polyglutamine diseases (reviewed in Rubinsztein, 2006Rubinsztein D.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). HDAC6 also regulates other processes relevant to at least some polyglutamine diseases. Saudou and colleagues reported that the Huntington's disease mutant protein impairs the intracellular microtubule-dependent transport of BDNF-containing vesicles, resulting in decreased trophic support to neurons and increased susceptibility to cell death. In contast to the autophagy scenario, HDAC6 inhibition appears to be beneficial in this context by increasing tubulin acetylation, thereby increasing the flux of BDNF-containing vesicles, with consequent greater release of this neurotrophin (Dompierre et al., 2007Dompierre J.P.

Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar study raises a number of important questions in the context of intracellular protein degradation. First, to what extent can autophagy upregulation normalize turnover of short-lived proteins in cells with compromised proteasome function? Second, is there an increased production of autophagosomes (as opposed to decreased clearance) in cells with proteasome impairment? Third, while their data suggest that HDAC6 accelerates clearance of autophagy substrates, what is/are the underlying mechanisms involved in this process? Finding answers to these questions may have relevance for a range of neurodegenerative diseases caused by aggregate-prone intracytosolic proteins that are autophagy substrates."

The activation of the AKT signaling pathway is one of the most frequent molecular alterations in a wide variety of human cancers. Dickson and coworkers recently observed that Ca2+·calmodulin (Ca2+·CaM) may be a common regulator of AKT1 activation (Deb, T. B., Coticchia, C. M., and Dickson, R. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 38903–38911). In our efforts to scan the mRNA-displayed proteome libraries for Ca2+·CaM-binding proteins, we found that both human and Caenorhabditis elegans AKT1 kinases bound to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Shen, X., Valencia, C. A., Szostak, J., Dong, B., and Liu, R. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 5969–5974 and Shen, X., Valencia, C. A., Gao, W., Cotten, S. W., Dong, B., Chen, M., and Liu, R. (2007) submitted for publication). Here we demonstrate that Ca2+·CaM and human AKT1 were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated, and their interaction was direct rather than mediated by other proteins. The binding is in part attributed to the first 42 residues of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a region that is critical for the recognition of its lipid ligands. The PH domain of human AKT1 can disrupt the complex of the full-length AKT1 with Ca2+·CaM. In addition, Ca2+·CaM competes with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphophate for interaction with the PH domain of human AKT1. Our findings suggest that Ca2+·CaM is directly involved in regulating the functions of AKT1, presumably by releasing the activated AKT1 from the plasma membrane and/or prohibiting it from re-association with phosphoinositides on plasma membrane.

AKT1 is predominant in most tissues; AKT2 is highly expressed in insulin-responsive tissues; whereas AKT3 is abundant in brain tissues. AKT kinases consist of three conserved domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N terminus, a kinase catalytic domain at the center, and a regulatory hydrophobic motif containing domain at the C terminus (8Kumar C.C.

The central catalytic domain is ∼90% identical among the AKT isoforms and is closely related to protein kinase A, protein kinase C, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and S6 subfamilies of the AGC kinase family.

The C-terminal extension is ∼70% identical among the three AKT isoforms and is most closely related to the protein kinase C family. It appears that this extension domain wraps around the front of the ATP binding pocket and interacts through a regulatory hydrophobic motif with a pocket at the back of the kinase domain. protein kinase B pleckstrin homology calmodulin Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase or calcineurin A Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase glutathione S-transferase IκB kinase mouse double minute 2 protein myosin light chain kinase phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa coupled in vitro transcription and translation phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate protein kinase B pleckstrin homology calmodulin Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase or calcineurin A Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase glutathione S-transferase IκB kinase mouse double minute 2 protein myosin light chain kinase phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa coupled in vitro transcription and translation phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate The signaling pathway of AKT starts from the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through binding of a growth factor to a receptor tyrosine kinase (23Scheid M.P.

The PH domain of AKT then interacts with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which results in anchoring the AKT kinase to the plasma membrane, where it undergoes phosphorylation and activation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, the rictor-mammalian target of rapamycin complex, and probably other kinases (27Chan T.O.

Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5223) Google Scholar). AKT is fully activated following its phosphorylation at two regulatory residues, which are structurally and functionally conserved within the AGC kinase family. These residues include a threonine residue on the kinase catalytic domain (Thr-308, Thr-309, and Thr-305 for AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, respectively) and a serine residue on the hydrophobic motif (Ser-473, Ser-474, and Ser-472 for AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, respectively). Such activation permits a conformational change that results in substrate binding and a significant increase of the rate of catalysis. AKT family members regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including apoptosis, cellular proliferation, differentiation, intermediary metabolism, genome stability, and neo-vascularization (25Bellacosa A. Kumar C.C. Di Cristofano A. Testa J.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 2005; 94: 29-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 27Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The regulation mechanism of AKT is by deactivation or activation of its downstream substrates through phosphorylation. For instance, AKT kinase facilitates growth factor-mediated cell survival and blocks apoptotic cell death by phosphorylating and deactivating pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad, caspase-9, and Forkhead transcription factors (9Downward J.

AKT also phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3, which allows the activation of glycogen synthase (13Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4364) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AKT phosphorylates and activates IKKα, which phosphorylates IκB followed by its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (20Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr.

AKT regulates many cellular processes that, upon deregulation, may contribute to the development or progression of cancer. It is now evident that the activation of the AKT signaling pathway is one of the most frequent molecular alterations in a wide variety of human cancers (30Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C.

Despite its importance in numerous signaling pathways, our understanding of the activation and regulation of AKT kinases is still incomplete. The lipid-binding PH domain of AKT plays an important role in promoting the translocation of AKT to the plasma membrane for activation. Recent results suggest that the PH domain is also important for the interaction with a number of other proteins (35Du K. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7401-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In our recent effort to scan the mRNA-displayed proteome libraries for Ca2+·CaM-binding proteins, we found that both human and Caenorhabditis elegans AKT1 bound to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (2Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J. Dong B. Liu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 4X. Shen, C. A. Valencia, W. Gao, S. W. Cotten, B. Dong, M. Chen, and R. Liu, submitted for publication. 4X. Shen, C. A. Valencia, W. Gao, S. W. Cotten, B. Dong, M. Chen, and R. Liu, submitted for publication. Here we extend Dickson's work and report that AKT1 interacts with Ca2+·CaM through two binding motifs, one at the first half of the N-terminal PH domain and another at the N terminus of the kinase catalytic domain. Our results indicate that Ca2+·CaM and AKT1 can be co-immunoprecipitated and the Ca2+·CaM binding appears to be general in all three AKT isoforms. The Ca2+·CaM binding to the N-terminal PH domain of AKT1 could regulate its interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Construction of Recombinant Genes and Expression of AKT1 Fragments—The cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame of human AKT1 was reversibly transcribed from a human poly(A)+ mRNA library (Ambion, Austin, TX). The full-length AKT1 was amplified using a high fidelity Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following primers: forward primer, 5′-CACCATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCCGTGCCGCTGGC-3′. The PCR product of full-length AKT1 was gel-purified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting AKT1-containing plasmid was confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. This construct was used as the template to PCR-amplify various AKT1 fragments. The synthesis of AKT1 fragments using coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TnT) was performed as previously described (2Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J. Dong B. Liu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The primers for the generation of the PCR products of these AKT1 fragments were as follows. For the fragment F43–115, BD-HS43-5 (5′-CAATTACTATTTACAATTACAATGGGACAGGATGTGGACCAAC-3′) and BD-HS115-3 (5′-TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGCTCCTCCTGCTTCTTGAGGC-3′); for F116–149, BD-HS116-5 (5′-CAATTACTATTTACAATTACAATGGGAGAGGAGATGGACTTCC-3′) and BD-HS149-3 (5′-TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGCTCGTTCATGGTCACGCGG-3′); for F150–197, BD-HS150-5 (5′-CAATTACTATTTACAATTACAATGGGATTTGAGTACCTGAAGCTG-3′) and BD-HS197-3 (5′-TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGGGTGAGTGTGTGGGCCAC-3′); for F198–408, BD-HS198-5 (5′-CAATTACTATTTACAATTACAATGGGAGAGAACCGCGTCC-3′) and BD-HS408-3 (5′-TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGAAAGAAGCGATGCTGCATGATCTC-3′); for F409–480, BD-HS409-5 (5′-CAATTACTATTTACAATTACAATGGGAGCCGGTATCGTGTG-3′) and BD-HS480-3 (5′-TTAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGGGCCGTGCCGCTGGC-3′); for F1–115, BD-HS1-5 (5′-CAATTACTTTTACAATTACAATGGGAAGCACGTGGCTATTG-3′) and BD-HS115-3; for F1–149, BD-HS1-5 and BD-HS149-3; for F1–408, BD-HS1-5 and BD-HS408-3; for F1–480, BD-HS1-5 and BD-HS480-3; for F150–408, BD-HS150-5 and BD-HS408-3; for F150–480, BD-HS150-5 and BD-HS480-3; and for F116–480, BD-HS116-5 and BD-HS480-3. Some fragments were also overexpressed and purified as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The primers are: for F1–42, HS-3-F (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTGA-3′) and HS-3-R (5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTTACGGCCGCTCCTGTAGC-3′); for F1–115, HS-3-F and HS-1-R (5′-AGGAGAAGCCCGGTTTACTCCTCCTGCTTCTTGAGG-3′); for F92–115, HS-1-F (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGACTCCTGAGGAGCGGG-3′) and HS-1-R; for F116–197, HS-2-F (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGAGGAGATGGACTTCCGG-3′) and HS-2-R. The sequences corresponding to these fragments were cloned into an expression vector pET-41 EK/LIC containing an N-terminal GST tag (Novagen, Madison, WI). After confirmation of sequences, the insert-containing plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)-competent cells for expression of various AKT1 fragments. Soluble protein fragments were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified PH domain (residues 1–149), PH domain-deleted AKT1 (residues 118–480, active), full-length human AKT1 (residues 1–480, both active and inactive), full-length AKT2, and full-length AKT3 were purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). The PH domain-deleted AKT1 (residues 140–480) from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) was also used. Cell Culture and Lysate Preparation—HeLa S3 cells were grown to stationary phase in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested and lysed as reported (36McCullar J.S. Larsen S.A. Millimaki R.A. Filtz T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33708-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After centrifugation to remove intact cells, the supernatants were cleared at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates prepared were used for pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. CaM Binding and Pulldown Assays—To investigate the interaction between Ca2+·CaM and fragment/full length AKT, CaM binding assays were performed using both radiolabeled AKT protein fragments generated by TnT and GST-tagged fragments overexpressed in E. coli. For the TnT approach, radiolabeled AKT fragments were synthesized in the presence of 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 25 μl for 90 min at 30 °C as previously described (2Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J. Dong B. Liu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To perform the CaM binding assays, an aliquot of the TnT product was mixed with an appropriate amount of biotinylated CaM for 90 min at 4 °C in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm CaCl2) or buffer B (same as buffer A except 1 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 2 mm EGTA). After binding, 30 μl of the 50% slurry of streptavidin beads (Pierce Biotech, Rockford, IL) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation in an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter tube (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the beads were washed three times with 150 μl of buffer A. Proteins captured were then released from the column by chelating Ca2+ with 150 μl of buffer B. Each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and images were obtained through a Storm 860 PhosphorImager. When GST-tagged, overexpressed AKT fragments or cell lysates were used for the binding reaction, CaM-Sepharose pulldown assays were performed. To do that, 100 μl of preequilibrated CaM-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added to an appropriate amount of purified AKT protein (1–10 μg), or HeLa S3 cell lysates (∼1 mg of total protein), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2–3 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix, with 1 mm Ca2+ (buffer C) or 2 mm EGTA (buffer D). The beads were washed three times with buffer C or buffer D. Proteins bound to CaM were eluted from the beads with buffer D. Proteins from each fraction (L, purified AKT protein or lysate; FT, flow-through; W, last wash before elution; and E, elution) were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with either anti-AKT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-His tag (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-AKT (for all AKT isoforms, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or anti-Calcineurin A2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Competitive Binding and Elution Assay—For competitive binding experiments, 2 μm GST-tagged PH domain of AKT1 (Upstate) was added to a binding mixture with the full-length AKT1 pre-complexed with Ca2+·CaM immobilized on Sepharose beads. The elution was performed with buffer B. For competitive elution experiments, 2–50 μm PH domain of AKT1 or a CaM-binding peptide from MLCK (Ac-RRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRL-NH2) (Calbiochem) in buffer A was used to elute the full-length AKT1 pre-complexed with Ca2+·CaM on agarose beads. CaM Binding Affinity Measurement—To measure the binding affinity of AKT fragments with Ca2+·CaM, the [35S]methionine-labeled PH domain F1–149, F150–408, and full-length AKT1 were generated by TnT and mixed with biotinylated CaM, whose concentration was varied in the range of 10 nm and 2.5 μm. Biotin-CaM·protein complex was captured by streptavidin beads, and the extent of binding was determined by scintillation counting of each fraction, followed by fitting the data to a binding curve using SIGMAPLOT 8.0 software (Systat, Richmond, VA). Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 1 mg of HeLa S3 lysate with anti-CaM, anti-AKT1, or an irrelevant IgG, respectively. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with different antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, equal amounts of pre-cleared HeLa S3 whole cell lysate (∼1 mg of total protein) were incubated with 2–5 μg of primary antibody (anti-CaM) for 4 h at 4 °C, in the presence of either buffer C or buffer D. 20 μl of pre-equilibrated protein A/G-agarose conjugate was added, and the mixture was further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with mixing. The pellets were collected and washed three times with buffer C or D. After the final wash, pellets were eluted with buffer D. Different fractions were loaded onto SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and probing using anti-AKT1. Conversely, anti-AKT1 was used for co-immunoprecipitation and blots were probed with anti-CaM. As a positive control, blots were probed with anti-Calcineurin A2, for the detection of calcineurin, a well known CaM-binding protein. As a negative control, blots were also probed with an irrelevant anti-TFII antibody. Protein Lipid Overlay Assay—PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and phosphatidylcholine were obtained from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). 100 pmol of each PIP were dotted on a Hybond-C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and protein lipid overlay assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Different amounts of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were also used to examine its concentration dependence. The membrane was first blocked for 1 h in a TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. It was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 0.5 μg/ml His-tagged full-length AKT1 (Upstate), GST-tagged PH domain of AKT1 (Upstate), or His-tagged AKT1 without PH domain (Upstate) in the blocking buffer containing 0.24 μm CaM and 100 μm Ca2+ or EGTA. After washing three times, the membrane was incubated with anti-His tag or anti-GST for 3 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed again and incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), followed by development using ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To address the difficulty of identifying the numerous conditional interactions that are dependent on the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, we developed an mRNA-display protein selection platform that allows us to scan a proteome of interest for Ca2+-dependent protein-protein interactions (2Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J. Dong B. Liu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).4 By employing this novel approach, we have scanned both the human and the C. elegans proteomes for Ca2+·CaM-binding proteins (2Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J. Dong B. Liu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5969-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).4 A large number of both known and previously uncharacterized Ca2+·CaM-binding proteins were identified, including many protein kinases. These CaM-binding kinases include CaM-dependent protein kinase, CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase, elongation factor kinase, and protein kinase C family member UNC-13 that have been previously characterized to interact with Ca2+·CaM (37Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Several protein kinases that have not been previously reported to interact with Ca2+·CaM were also identified, and AKT1 is among them. The discovery that both human and C. elegans AKT1 kinases interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner strongly suggests that Ca2+·CaM play an important role in regulating the functions of AKT. We first characterized the interaction of Ca2+·CaM with AKT1 by sequence analysis of the selected fragments. Only one fragment originating from human AKT1 was isolated in the Ca2+·CaM-binding selection using an mRNA-displayed human proteome library. Sequence analysis showed that this was a fragment that covered the entire PH domain of human AKT1. However, four fragments originating from C. elegans AKT1 were isolated, namely, F1–144, F54–138, F105–138, and F103–172 (Fig. 1). All these fragments are located within or close to the PH domain of C. elegans AKT1. F1–144 contains the whole PH domain (the arrowed region), whereas F54–138 contains its second half. The shortest overlapping region is between residues 105 and 138 (105VRQRWIHAIESISKKYKGTNANPQEELMETNQQP138). This region covers the C-terminal part of the PH domain and part o"

Utilizing a mini-gene consisting of part of the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1), we show that TIA-1 interacts with a conserved AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 intron 2 and modulates alternative splicing of exon 2. This unique, highly conserved cis element containing stem-loop secondary structure was previously identified in our laboratory as an essential motif that controls the developmentally regulated exon 2 splicing switch during chondrogenesis (McAlinden, A., Havlioglu, N., Liang, L., Davies, S. R., and Sandell, L. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 32700-32711). In vivo binding of endogenous TIA-1 to the AU-rich cis element in COL2A1 pre-mRNA was confirmed by the ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay. Importantly, we also show that TIA-1 interacts with the equivalent DNA sequence with a preference for single-stranded rather than double-stranded DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (including an additional RNase step) confirmed this interaction in vivo. Competition assays showed that TIA-1 apparently binds with higher affinity to DNA than to RNA. Finally, we show that this strong DNA-TIA-1 interaction can be disrupted by an RNA polymerase during active transcription. This suggests a potentially novel, dual role for TIA-1 in shuttling between DNA and RNA ligands to co-regulate COL2A1 expression at the level of transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing.

Gene expression is regulated on many levels from transcriptional activation and repression of genomic DNA to post-transcriptional mechanisms that control precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) 3The abbreviations used are: pre-mRNA, precursor messenger RNA; TIA-1, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1; COL2A1, type II procollagen gene; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RRM, RNA recognition motif; ARE, AU-rich element; UTR, untranslated region; TIAR, TIA-1-related protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IP, immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription. splicing and maturation as well as mRNA transport, turnover, and translation. In general, these mechanisms are regulated by interactions of DNA/RNA cis elements with specific trans-acting proteins, and numerous studies suggest that many processes of transcription and post-transcription are co-regulated in the nucleus (1Kornblihtt A.R. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). With respect to pre-mRNA regulation, RNA-binding proteins are known to assemble on the message at the time of transcription, thus determining the fate of the transcript from the very beginning of gene activation (2Derrigo M. Cestelli A. Savettieri G. Di Liegro I Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 111-123PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Of these RNA-binding proteins, TIA-1 (T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1) is a well described regulator of mRNA metabolism in the cell. TIA-1 belongs to the RNA recognition motif (RRM)/ribonucleoprotein family of RNA-binding proteins (4Kawakami A. Tian Q. Streuli M. Poe M. Edelhoff S. Disteche C.M. Anderson P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4937-4945PubMed Google Scholar, 5Beck A.R. Medley Q.G. O'Brien S. Anderson P. Streuli M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interactions of TIA-1 with RNA are mediated by the second of its three RRM domains (6Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas RRM2 and RRM3 are both required for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (7Zhang T. Delestienne N. Huez G. Kruys V. Gueydan C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5453-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, microarray and computational analyses revealed that common TIA-1 binding motifs in mRNA consist of U-rich stretches that have the potential to form stem-loop secondary structures (8Lopez de Silanes I. Galban S. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Indig F.E. Falco G. Zhan M. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9520-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, TIA-1 has been shown to regulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing of genes such as those encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR-2), Fas receptor, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR), and even TIA-1 itself (9Del Gatto-Konczak F.

Pagani F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16980-16988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In these genes, the alternatively spliced exons contain weak 5′ splice site sequences that do not conform to the bona fide consensus sequence (13Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 1999: 525-560Google Scholar). Consequently, TIA-1 functions to strengthen these weak splice sites by interacting with U-rich sequences downstream of the alternative exon. In doing so, TIA-1 can then facilitate recruitment of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex to the spliceosome to promote inclusion (splicing) of the alternative exon in the final mRNA transcript (14Forch P. Puig O Martinez C. Seraphin B. Valcarcel J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Based on these observations of TIA-1 binding sites and function, we hypothesized that TIA-1 may also regulate pre-mRNA splicing of the type II procollagen gene (COL2A1). COL2A1 encodes the major collagenous protein present in cartilage tissue (15Ala-Kokko L. Kvist A.P. Metsaranta M. Kivirikko K.I. de Crombrugghe B. Prockop D.J. Vuorio E. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and its synthesis is developmentally regulated during chondrogenesis (16Ng L.J. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Chondro-progenitor cells synthesize the type IIA procollagen mRNA isoform containing alternative exon 2, whereas differentiated chondrocytes synthesize the type IIB mRNA isoform, devoid of exon 2 (18Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is one of the most important splicing events identified in connective tissue development and is likely a key mechanism for the production and maintenance of healthy cartilage. Recently, we showed that (i) COL2A1 exon 2 contains a weak 5′ splice site sequence, (ii) an AU-rich cis element is present directly adjacent to the 5′ splice site of exon 2 and is required for correct alternative splicing of COL2A1 exon 2, (iii) this RNA cis element contains secondary structure in the form of a stem-loop, and (iv) the AU-rich sequence within the double-stranded stem region is 100% conserved between species (19McAlinden A. Havlioglu N. Liang L. Davies S.R. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32700-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, this cis element contains repeats of the pentameric sequence AUUUA; these AU-rich elements (AREs) are commonly found in 3′-UTRs of mRNA transcripts thereby regulating their stability and translation efficiency (20Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In this respect, a cytosolic function has also been reported for TIA-1 through its interaction with AUUUA-containing cis elements in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, and cytochrome c and, in doing so, suppresses their translation (22Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Phillips K. Kedersha N.

Biol. 2006; 26: 3295-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that TIA-1 enhances splicing of COL2A1 exon 2 and that this function is dependent on interaction with the conserved AU-rich cis element in intron 2. Of particular interest is our finding that TIA-1 can also bind to the equivalent AT-rich element in COL2A1 genomic DNA. We also show that the strong DNA-TIA-1 interaction can be disrupted by an RNA polymerase during active transcription. We therefore propose a dual role for TIA-1 in co-regulating processes of transcription and pre-mRNA alternative splicing to control expression patterns of COL2A1 by potentially shuttling between DNA and RNA ligands. Construction of Wild-type and Mutant COL2A1 Mini-genes—A wild-type human COL2A1 mini-gene was constructed as previously described (19McAlinden A. Havlioglu N. Liang L. Davies S.R. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32700-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This mini-gene (∼5.9kb) consists of exons 1-3 and full-length introns 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). Mutant mini-genes were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Here, complementary primer pairs were designed to either delete all or a portion of the conserved stem-loop cis element previously identified in our laboratory (19McAlinden A. Havlioglu N. Liang L. Davies S.R. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32700-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), whereas other mutant mini-genes were synthesized containing point mutations within the U-rich region of the stem-loop (Fig. 2). PCR mutagenesis was carried out over 18 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; and 68 °C, 6 min) and resulting PCR products were treated with DpnI (1 μl) for 1 h at 37 °C to digest parental, methylated DNA. An aliquot (1 μl) of digested DNA was transformed into XL-1 Blue Super-competent Cells (Stratagene), and resulting colonies were screened for the presence of the correct mutation. For use in transfection assays, wild-type and all mutant mini-genes were cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter.FIGURE 2Effect of TIA-1 on alternative splicing of COL2A1 exon 2. TC28 chondrocytes were co-transfected with constructs expressing the human wild-type (WT) or mutant COL2A1 mini-genes and human TIA-1 protein or empty pcDNA3 vector (mini-gene: TIA-1/pcDNA3 ratio of 1:5). Boxed gel picture (top left) is a Western blot showing increased levels of TIA-1 protein in the nuclei of TC28 cells co-transfected with a TIA-1 cDNA construct (TIA-1) compared with non-transfected (NT) or mock-transfected (pcDNA3 only) cells. Polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used to detect TIA-1 protein. Mutant mini-genes with deletions in the stem-loop cis element (SL-Del 1 and SL-Del 2) or containing point mutations in the U-rich stem-loop region (CCC-1, CCC-2, and CCC-3) were also co-transfected with a TIA-1-expressing construct (+) or empty pcDNA3 vector (-). Levels of IIA (+exon 2) and IIB (-exon 2) mRNA derived from either WT or mutant COL2A1 mini-genes were monitored by phosphorimaging and radioactive bands were quantified by ImageQuaNT™ software. All co-transfections were carried out a minimum of three times. The phosphorimaging results shown are representative of all experiments (minimum of three replicates).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transient Co-transfection of COL2A1 Mini-genes with TIA-1 and Analysis of Mini-gene Spliced Isoforms—In all studies, TC28/I2 chondrocytes from human juvenile costal cartilage were used (a gift from Dr. Mary Goldring, Cornell University). Constructs encoding either wild-type or mutant COL2A1 mini-genes were co-transfected with a TIA-1-expressing construct (from Dr. Jane Wu, Northwestern University) into these TC28 cells. Each mini-gene construct (1 μg) together with the TIA-1 construct (5 μg) were co-transfected using FuGENE™6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first5hof transfection was carried out in serum-free medium, and, thereafter, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% serum for a further 48 h until RNA isolation. Total RNA was harvested and purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and an aliquot (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using random primers and SuperScript™ II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Resulting cDNA was used for quantitative PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The primers pcDNA3-COL2A1-Ex1 (5′-CAAGCTTACATGATTCGGC-3′) and sp6 were used to amplify cDNA derived only from the exogenously transfected COL2A1 mini-gene. The linear range for these primers was established, and PCR was carried out for 20 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s). 10 μl of 6× loading dye (30% glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) Cyanol Blue) was added to each reaction, and 7 μl was electrophoresed at 200 V through 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 1 h and then scanned on a STORM™ 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Bands corresponding to the type IIA (386 bp) and type IIB (179 bp) mRNA isoforms were quantified whenever necessary using ImageQuant™ software. Detection of Endogenous TIA-1 mRNA and Protein—Total RNA was extracted and purified from TC28 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out on reverse-transcribed cDNA using primer pairs specific for human (NM_022173) TIA-1. Sense, forward primer corresponding to a sequence in exon 1 was: 5′-ATGGAGGACGAGATGCCCAA-3′. Reverse primer designed in exon 6 was: 5′-TGTGGGCTGAGATCACCA-3′. PCR was carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). TIA-1 or β-actin was amplified in the linear range established for each primer pair (27× cycles for TIA-1 or 20× cycles for β-actin) using the same PCR parameters (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s). Radioactive cDNA bands were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging as described above. Nuclear proteins from ∼2-4 × 107 TC28 cells were extracted using the CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma). Approximately 60-100 μg of nuclear extract was electrophoresed through 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting onto a Hybond™-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). TIA-1 was localized by a monoclonal antibody (ML-29, gift from the Dr. Paul Anderson laboratory, Harvard University) or polyclonal antibody (SC-1751, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies bound to localized TIA-1 antibodies was carried out using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of GST/TIA-1 Fusion Protein—Full-length human TIA-1 cDNA (“variant 2” containing alternative exon 5; NM_022173) was amplified from TC28 human chondrocytes using the primers: H-TIA-1-F-BamHI (5′-TAAGGATCCATGGAGGACGAGATGCCCAAG-3′) and H-TIA-1-R-EcoRI (5′-TAAGAATTCTCACTGGGTTTCATACC-3′). TIA-1 cDNA was cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing cDNA encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) upstream of the multiple cloning site. Resulting GST/TIA-1-pGEX4T-1 fusion construct was transformed into BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences). Overnight cultures of transformed cells were diluted 1:400 in LB media and grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6 was reached. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and growth was continued until reaching an A600 of 1.4. Cells were collected, resuspended in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 m EDTA, and sonicated 5× for 30 s. Soluble protein in the supernatant was collected by centrifugation, mixed with pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B (50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed 3× with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The protein was eluted with GEB (10 mm glutathione reductase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). GST/TIA-1 protein was electrophoresed through a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to Hybond™-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for Western blotting. Membranes were then probed with either a TIA-1 antibody (monoclonal antibody ML29 from Dr. Paul Anderson’s laboratory or a polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-GST antibody to confirm the molecular weight and purity of the fusion protein. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To construct full-length “stem-loop” 38-nucleotide sense RNA radiolabeled probes, antisense DNA oligonucleotides were first synthesized (Invitrogen) containing a 3′ T7 leader sequence. The following DNA oligonucleotide was designed to synthesize the wild-type sense RNA probe: 5′-GTAATTTATTTATGTTGAACAGGAAATAAATAAATTACCCTGTCTC-3′. To synthesize the CCC-3 mutant RNA probe, the following DNA oligonucleotide was made: 5′-GTAATTTATTTATGTTGAACAGGGGGTGGGTGGGTTACCCTGTCTC-3′. In each oligonucleotide, the T7 leader sequence is shown in bold, underlined font. A control RNA probe was also synthesized, which corresponds to a 68-nucleotide probe previously shown to bind to TIA-1 (RNA sequence “1-6” from Dember et al.) (6Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The mirVana microRNA probe construction kit (Ambion) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to synthesize sense RNA radiolabeled probes. Briefly, DNA oligonucleotide template (200 μm) was hybridized with the T7 promoter primer by incubation at 70 °C for 5 min followed by 5-min incubation at room temperature in DNA hybridization buffer. A double-stranded DNA template was generated by addition of Klenow DNA polymerase for 30 min at 37 °C. Transcription was carried out in the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C, and template DNA was removed by addition of DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C. GST or GST/TIA-1 recombinant protein was added to 5 × 104 cpm of radiolabeled RNA probe in RNA binding buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 7.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 25 °C. The protein/probe binding mixture was then incubated with 1 μl of 1/100 diluted RNase mixture (0.5 unit/μl of RNase A and 20 units/μl RNase T1; Ambion) for a further 10 min at 37 °C. RNA·protein complexes were electrophoresed through 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and visualized by autoradiography. For competition assays, the recombinant protein was added to a mixture of RNA radiolabeled probe and either DNA or RNA cold competitor probe and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min before gel electrophoresis. UV Cross-linking—RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described in the previous subsection. Following the RNase digestion step, RNA·protein complexes were placed on ice until UV irradiation in a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP) for 10 min. Samples were then heated for 5 min in SDS protein gel sample buffer and separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then dried, and cross-linked complexes were viewed by autoradiography. Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation Assay—Analysis of endogenous TIA-1 interaction with the COL2A1 pre-mRNA region of interest (Fig. 6) was done according to previously described protocols (8Lopez de Silanes I. Galban S. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Indig F.E. Falco G. Zhan M. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9520-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J.

Briefly, protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were pre-swollen in NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin. Beads (100 μl) were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C overnight with either TIA-1 antibody (20 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG (20 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody-coated beads (50 μl) were then added to 100-μl cell lysates (extracted from 14 × 106 cultured TC28 cells) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. After extensive washes, DNA and protein in the immunoprecipitation (IP) reaction was digested with DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C and then proteinase K for 30 min at 55 °C. RNA was eluted from the beads and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. Reverse transcription-PCR was then carried out using the primer pair to amplify the region of interest in intron 2 of COL2A1 (Fig. 5): sense primer, 5′-CTGGACCTCGCCACTGCCAGTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGATCTCCATAGTGGCTCTAG-3′. Reverse-transcribed RNA was extracted and immunoprecipitated from TC28 cells that had been transfected with the COL2A1 mini-gene for 48 h. This was done to provide enough COL2A1 pre-mRNA substrate as the normal rate of active COL2A1 transcription in these cells is very low. 4M. Goldring, personal communication. PCR was then carried out (95 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s) for 30 cycles, and cDNA products were visualized after electrophoresis through ethidium bromide-containing 1% agarose gels. PCR without a prior reverse transcription step was done to ensure there was no DNA in the immunoprecipitated sample.FIGURE 5In vivo interaction of endogenous TIA-1 with COL2A1 pre-mRNA. TC28 human chondrocytes were transfected with the COL2A1 mini-gene and the ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay was carried out using an anti TIA-1 antibody or IgG antibody as a control. DNase I-treated RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR (30× cycles) using primers to specifically amplify the 355-bp region of COL2A1 pre-mRNA containing the AU-rich cis element of interest. A PCR control reaction in the absence of a prior reverse transcription step was also carried out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Sense and complementary DNA oligonucleotides, corresponding to the wild-type 38-nucleotide RNA stem-loop cis element, were synthesized by Invitrogen. For double-stranded probes, sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed in TSE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) by heating to 95 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature. All double-stranded or single-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Radiolabeled single-stranded or double-stranded DNA probes (∼1 × 104 cpm) were incubated with various concentrations of purified GST or GST/TIA-1 fusion protein in the presence of 3 μl of 5× binding buffer (25% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 15 μl. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and protein/probes were electrophoresed through 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and scanned on a STORM™ 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For DNA competitor binding assays, known quantities of unlabeled competitor probe was mixed with recombinant protein on ice for 30 min followed by addition of the radiolabeled DNA probe for 30 min at room temperature. For RNA competitor assays, specific amounts of unlabeled RNA probe were added to labeled DNA probe followed by addition of recombinant protein for 30 min at room temperature. ChIP Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out using the EZ ChIP™ assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TC28 cells were used because they contain abundant endogenous TIA-1 protein, and overexpression of TIA-1 in these cells altered the splicing pattern of COL2A1 (Fig. 2). One 15-cm dish of TC28 cells (∼4 × 106) in 15-cm culture dishes was used for one IP reaction. Cross-linking of DNA·proteins was induced by addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration) directly to the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and DNA in the supernatant was sheared by sonication. An aliquot of the sonicated chromatin sample (“input”) was removed for PCR analysis, and the remainder was used for IPs. Prior to addition of antibody, some samples were treated with RNase A/T1 mixture (final concentration of 7.5 units of RNase A, 300 units of RNase T1) (Ambion) or an equivalent volume of RNase storage buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol, v/v) for 30 min at room temperature to digest any native RNA transcripts present in the chromatin complex. To each RNase with or without supernatant sample was added either 5 μg of TIA-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that had been pre-coated onto Protein G-Sepharose beads, and reactions were incubated overnight with constant mixing at 4 °C. Protein G beads were collected by centrifugation and protein·DNA complexes were eluted from the beads followed by a cross-link reversal step by addition of 5 m NaCl (8 μl) to the eluted sample (200 μl) for 4 h at 65 °C.DNA from each IP reaction (2 μl) was used for PCR with a primer pair to amplify the 355-bp region of interest in COL2A1 intron 2 (Fig. 7): sense primer, 5′-CTGGACCTCGCCACTGCCAGTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGATCTCCATAGTGGCTCTAG-3′. A second set of primers were designed to amplify a 222-bp region further downstream in COL2A1 intron 2 that we predicted would not contain a TIA-1 binding site (Primers 3 and 4; Fig. 7): sense primer, 5′-CCTCTCTGAAATCATCTCTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CTACCACCAATGTTCCATAAC-3′. Input or immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR (94 °C, 20 s; 59 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 2 min) for 29 cycles. Transcription Displacement Assay—The RNA transcription assay was carried out as described previously (27Suswam E.A. Li Y.Y. Mahtani H. King P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The following two oligonucleotides were synthesized (Invitrogen): T7, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and T7-COL2A1-T/A, 5′-CATTAAATAAATACAACTTGTTCCTTTATTTATTTAATGCACTGGAATTCACCATACTATCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′. The latter sequence consists of the 38-nucleotide AT-rich cis element of COL2A1 (in bold font), 21 nucleotides of random sequence, and a complementary T7 sequence. The T7 and T7-COL2A1-T/A oligonucleotides were mixed in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), boiled, and cooled to room temperature to form a duplex oligonucleotide in the T7 recognition sequence.

The present study examined the possible function of these enzymes in metabolism of isobutyryl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, intermediates in the metabolism of valine and of odd-chain and branched-chain fatty acids. Using 13C NMR, accumulation of β-hydroxypropionate from [2-13C]propionate was observed in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana and a range of other plants, including both monocots and dicots. Examination of coding sequences and subcellular targeting elements indicated that the completed genome of A. thaliana likely codes for all the enzymes necessary to convert valine to propionyl-CoA in mitochondria. However, Arabidopsis mitochondria may lack some of the key enzymes for metabolism of propionyl-CoA. Known peroxisomal enzymes may convert propionyl-CoA to β-hydroxypropionate by a modified β-oxidation pathway. The chy1–3 mutation, creating a defect in a peroxisomal hydroxyacyl-CoA hydrolase, abolished the accumulation of β-hydroxyisobutyrate from exogenous isobutyrate, but not the accumulation of β-hydroxypropionate from exogenous propionate. The chy1–3 mutant also displayed a dramatically increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of excess propionate and isobutyrate but not of valine. 13C NMR analysis of Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to [U-13C]valine did not show an accumulation of β-hydroxypropionate. No evidence was observed for a modified β-oxidation of valine. 13C NMR analysis showed that valine was converted to leucine through the production of α-ketoisovalerate and isopropylmalate. These data suggest that peroxisomal enzymes for a modified β-oxidation of isobutyryl-CoA and propionyl-CoA could function for metabolism of substrates other than valine."

Transport depends on signal peptides that are characterized by a twin pair of arginine residues. The signal peptides are generally removed after transport by specific processing peptidases, namely the leader peptidase and the thylakoidal processing peptidase. To gain insight into the prerequisites for such signal peptide removal, we mutagenized the vicinity of thylakoidal processing peptidase cleavage sites in several thylakoidal Tat substrates. Analysis of these mutants in thylakoid transport experiments showed that the amino acid composition of both the C-terminal segment of the signal peptide and the N-terminal part of the mature protein plays an important role in the maturation process. Efficient removal of the signal peptide requires the presence of charged or polar residues within at least one of those regions, whereas increased hydrophobicity impairs the process. The relative extent of this effect varies to some degree depending on the nature of the precursor protein. Unprocessed transport intermediates with fully translocated passenger proteins are found in membrane complexes of high molecular mass, which presumably represent Tat complexes, as well as free in the lipid bilayer. This seems to indicate that the Tat substrates can be laterally released from the complexes prior to processing and that membrane transport and terminal processing of Tat substrates are independent processes.

This seems to indicate that the Tat substrates can be laterally released from the complexes prior to processing and that membrane transport and terminal processing of Tat substrates are independent processes. The biogenesis of many proteins involves their transport across membranes. Such transport is mediated by specific targeting signals present in the primary translation products that are generally removed after transport by specific processing peptidases. Targeting signals operating at the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and at the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts mostly belong to a group of structurally conserved signal peptides that are characterized by an N-terminal basic region, a hydrophobic central core, and a polar C-terminal region ending with the consensus Ala-X-Ala motif at the terminal processing site (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). These signal peptides are removed after transport by membrane-bound peptidases termed leader peptidase or thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP), 2The abbreviations used are: TPP, thylakoidal processing peptidase; Tat, twin arginine translocation; Ti-1/Ti-2, translocation intermediate 1/2. respectively (2Dalbey R.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The final step in the translocation process is the removal of the signal peptide. In thylakoids, such processing is performed by the thylakoidal processing peptidase TPP (20Halpin C. Elderfield P.D. James H.E. Zimmermann R. Dunbar B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3917-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The analysis of a chimeric substrate showing both slower transport kinetics and delayed processing by TPP suggested an influence of this processing step on the kinetics of membrane transport (17Berghoöfer J. Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, removal of the transport signal is not obligatory for Tat-dependent thylakoid transport, as indicated by the Rieske Fe/S protein, which carries an uncleaved Tat-specific membrane anchor signal at the N terminus of the mature polypeptide chain (21Molik S. Karnauchov I. Weidlich C. Herrmann R.G. Kloösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42761-42766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the processing step following Tat-dependent protein transport in more detail, we have analyzed mutant derivatives of both authentic and chimeric Tat substrates with thylakoid transport experiments. It was our goal to identify structural features within precursor proteins that are responsible for the efficiency and velocity of the maturation of thylakoidal Tat substrates.

The 16 kDa precursor was furthermore modified by replacing a poorly conserved valine residue in the mature part of the 16 kDa protein (Val137) by methionine in order to permit labeling of the protein with [35S]methionine. This mutation did not show any influence on the entire transport process.

Terminal Processing of the 16/23 Precursor Is Inhibited at Low Temperature—The analysis of the chimeric Tat substrate 16/23, which is composed of the transit peptide of the 16 kDa subunit and the mature part of the 23 kDa subunit, both of the oxygen-evolving system associated with Photosystem II, has led to the identification of distinct transport steps during Tat-dependent protein transport across the thylakoid membrane (14Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Kloösgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Berghoöfer J. Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This was facilitated by the retarded translocation of the chimeric precursor protein that led to the detection of two consecutive translocation intermediates that were termed Ti-1 and Ti-2, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The degradation products indicative for Ti-1 and Ti-2 cannot be detected upon protease treatment in the absence of thylakoid vesicles, demonstrating that they indeed represent translocation intermediates and not merely protease-resistant domains of the precursor protein (Fig. 1C). The accumulation of Ti-2 that assumes a bitopic transmembrane topology with fully translocated passenger protein (Fig. 1B) indicates that for the 16/23 protein not only the actual membrane translocation process but also the terminal maturation step, i.e. the removal of the signal peptide, is affected. This finding was unexpected, because the amino acid sequences of both the signal peptide and the mature part of the chimera match perfectly to their counterparts in the respective authentic Tat substrates, notably the precursors of the 16 and 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving system of spinach (Fig. 2) that are quantitatively processed to the mature proteins in the course of thylakoid transport experiments (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Amino acid sequence of TPP cleavage sites.

Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, if thylakoid transport is carried out at 4 °C, only minute amounts of mature 23 kDa protein can be detected (Fig. 1A). One reason is that the membrane translocation process is affected at such temperatures, leading to reduced amounts of Ti-2 and higher levels of Ti-1 in these assays. Yet the decrease in Ti-2 accumulation is not sufficiently pronounced that it alone could fully account for the almost complete lack of mature protein, demonstrating that also the terminal processing step is significantly inhibited under these conditions. To distinguish whether the observed inhibition of processing at 4 °C is due to reduced TPP activity at low temperature or is instead a consequence of altered substrate properties caused by the chimeric cleavage site in the 16/23 precursor, the authentic precursors of the 16 and 23 kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving system were analogously analyzed. As expected, membrane translocation of the two proteins is significantly affected at 4 °C, leading to reduced levels of mature protein in both instances (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates reduced translocase activity at low temperature that might be due to a specific demand for lipid fluidity of protein transport by the Tat pathway, in line with recent results concerning protein transport across thylakoid membranes with reduced levels of unsaturated lipids (30Ma X. Browse J. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Yet, terminal processing of the two authentic precursor proteins is not impaired at low temperatures, because bitopic translocation intermediates corresponding to Ti-2 cannot be detected for either of them. Instead, both proteins are quantitatively cleaved by the processing enzyme even if thylakoid transport is performed at 4 °C, which strongly suggests that TPP activity is not rate-limiting at such temperatures. The delayed maturation of the 16/23 chimera is hence presumably a consequence of the chimeric processing site. The 16/23 Precursor Lacks Polar Residues in the Vicinity of the TPP Cleavage Site—To get a first hint on the possible reason for the impaired maturation of the 16/23 chimera, the amino acid sequences in the vicinity of the TPP cleavage sites of known thylakoidal Tat substrates were compared. Remarkably, from 22 independent thylakoidal Tat substrates analyzed, 21 possess either charged (15Shanmugham A. Wong Fong Sang H.W. Bollen Y.J. Lill H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or at least polar (6Muöller M. Kloösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) residues within the region from -3to +3 of the terminal processing site (data not shown), suggesting that the level of polarity in this region plays a role in the cleavage process. The charged or polar residues can be provided either by the C-terminal region of the signal peptide, as in the precursor of the 23 kDa protein, or by the N-terminal segment of the mature polypeptide, as found for example in the 16 kDa protein (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the corresponding segment of the 16/23 chimera lacks any such residue due to the combination of the 16 kDa signal peptide comprising a non-polar C terminus and the mature 23 kDa protein, which possesses an uncharged N terminus (Fig. 2A). Consequently, the TPP cleavage site of the 16/23 chimera is more hydrophobic than those of the corresponding authentic precursor proteins (Fig. 2B). Removal of Polar Residues from the Terminal Processing Sites Affects Maturation of Authentic Tat Substrates—To examine whether a polar cleavage region is required for the terminal processing step, the charged residues flanking the TPP cleavage sites of the authentic 16 and 23 kDa precursor proteins were removed by site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of the resulting polypeptides (16 E84M and 23 D80L, respectively, Fig. 2) in time course experiments showed that indeed one of them, notably 16 E84M, exhibits transport characteristics resembling those of the 16/23 chimera. It binds efficiently as the precursor protein to the thylakoid vesicles but it is only slowly converted to the mature 16 kDa protein, as indicated by the transient accumulation of a proteolytic fragment of ∼22 kDa upon thermolysin treatment of the thylakoid vesicles after import (Fig. 3, A and C). Both the size and the kinetic features of this proteolytic fragment suggest that it corresponds to the bitopic translocation intermediate Ti-2 described for the 16/23 chimera (Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Berghoöfer J. Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a second degradation product of ∼8 kDa can be detected in protease-treated thylakoids at early time points of the transport process (Fig. 3A). It might represent a translocation intermediate corresponding to Ti-1 that is inserted into the membrane in a loop conformation but not yet translocated (Fig. 1B). As with the 16/23 chimera, these degradation products are not observed in the absence of thylakoid membranes (Fig. 1C). In the case of the 23 kDa precursor protein, the negative charge in the vicinity of the TPP cleavage site is apparently not of similar importance for maturation. The mutant derivative 23 D80L in which the negatively charged aspartic acid residue within the Ala-X-Ala motif of the signal peptide was replaced by leucine (Fig. 2A) shows no significant differences from the authentic precursor protein when analyzed in time course thylakoid transport experiments (Fig. 3, B and C). Binding of the mutant protein to the thylakoid vesicles appears slightly stronger at early time points, but there is no indication for the accumulation of translocation intermediates like Ti-1 or Ti-2. Remarkably though, the vicinity of the TPP cleavage site within the 23 D80L mutant is still significantly more hydrophilic than the corresponding regions of the 16/23 or 16 E84M proteins (Figs. 2B and 3D). Considering the possible impact of polarity in this region on the maturation process, this degree of polarity might well be sufficient to facilitate efficient processing by TPP. Therefore, polarity in this region was further reduced by an additional mutagenesis in which a polar serine residue at position -5 from the processing site was replaced by phenylalanine. When analyzed with time course thylakoid transport experiments, the resulting precursor protein (Fig. 2A, 23 S77F,D80L) shows membrane transport and processing characteristics similar to those observed for 16 E84M (Fig. 3, B and C). It binds significantly better to the thylakoid membrane than the corresponding authentic precursor protein, but it is converted to the mature polypeptide only slowly. This leads to the transient accumulation of a proteolytic fragment of ∼28 kDa upon thermolysin treatment of the thylakoid vesicles after import (Fig. 3B) that presumably represents the bitopic translocation intermediate Ti-2. However, when compared with the results with the 16/23 and 16 E84M proteins, the level of Ti-2 accumulation is relatively low, indicating that maturation is still only mildly affected in the double mutant, and a degradation product corresponding to Ti-1 is not detected at all. Charged Residues in the Vicinity of the Processing Site Improve Maturation of the Chimeric 16/23 Protein—Thus far, the results obtained with the mutants are in close agreement with the assumption that a polar TPP cleavage region is required for efficient processing. To examine this further with a reciprocal approach, a negatively charged aspartic acid residue was introduced into the Ala-X-Ala motif of the chimeric 16/23 protein, in analogy to the situation found in the authentic 23 kDa precursor protein (Fig. 2A). According to our assumption, the resulting increase in polarity within this region (Fig. 4C) should lead to more efficient processing of the chimeric precursor and, possibly, even to higher translocation rates. Analysis of the mutant derivative 16/23 L82D in time course thylakoid transport experiments shows that the precursor is indeed converted to the mature 23 kDa protein with significantly higher efficiency than the original 16/23 chimera. Consequently, the transient accumulation of Ti-2 is shifted toward earlier time points of the transport experiment (Fig. 4, A and B), yet the mutant derivative 16/23 L82D is still not as efficiently processed as either of the two corresponding authentic precursor proteins, because the accumulation of Ti-2 is diminished but not prevented. The insertion of an additional charged residue at the N terminus of the mature part of the 16/23 chimera could not further improve maturation (data not shown), indicating that besides polarity of the cleavage region other features of the substrate, e.g. secondary structure (31Pratap J. Dikshit K.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), may additionally influence this process. In contrast to precursor processing, the membrane translocation step is apparently not affected by the polarity of the TPP cleavage region. The 16/23 and 16/23 L82D precursors show largely similar membrane transport rates if both Ti-2 and mature polypeptide are considered as the protein fraction that was translocated across the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Instead, the two proteins show significantly different thylakoid insertion properties, because accumulation of Ti-1 is hardly detectable for the 16/23 L82D chimera. Translocation Intermediates Can Occur Free in the Lipid Bilayer—The observation that removal of polar or charged residues from the TPP cleavage site of authentic precursor proteins leads to a delay of the terminal processing step and thus to the accumulation of bitopic translocation intermediates raises the question whether these proteins are still associated with the protein translocase in the membrane or whether they have been released into the lipid phase of the membrane bilayer. In the case of the 16/23 chimera, accumulation of translocation intermediates correlates with prolonged association of the precursor protein to two membrane complexes of ∼560 and 620 kDa, respectively, (17Berghoöfer J. Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that presumably represent thylakoidal TatB/C complexes (16Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Time course experiments show that complex association of the 16/23 precursor protein takes place only transiently (Fig. 5A), which is indicative for an active translocation process. Similar results were obtained when the authentic 16 and 23 kDa precursors as well as their mutant derivatives 16 E84M and 23 S77F,D80L, respectively, were analyzed in parallel by SDS-PAGE and Blue Native-PAGE. In all these instances, the accumulation of translocation intermediates is accompanied by their association to two membrane complexes of high molecular mass (Fig. 5, B and C). These membrane complexes show mobilities upon native electrophoresis that are similar to those observed in transport experiments analyzing the 16/23 chimera. Remarkably, even for the authentic 23 kDa precursor protein binding to such membrane complexes was detected in some experiments (Fig. 5C and data not shown), demonstrating that binding to these membrane complexes is not restricted to chimeric or mutagenized proteins. However, because of technical constraints it is not possible to determine whether all or only a fraction of the bitopic translocation intermediates accumulating in the membrane are actually bound to the membrane complexes. In fact, the mutant derivative of the 16/23 chimera with increased polarity in the TPP cleavage region (16/23 L82D) is not at all found associated with either of the two presumed Tat complexes during thylakoid transport (Fig. 5C), despite the fact that the delayed maturation of this polypeptide leads to the accumulation of significant amounts of the bitopic translocation intermediate within the membrane (Fig. 5B). This observation strongly suggests that the bitopic translocation intermediates do not necessarily remain associated with the translocase until cleavage by the thylakoidal processing peptidase takes place but that they might instead be released from the membrane complex prior to terminal processing. In the present work, we have aimed to characterize the structural requirements for efficient maturation of thylakoidal precursor proteins after Tat-dependent membrane transport. Charged or Polar Residues Flanking the TPP Site Are Required for Efficient Maturation—Thylakoid transport experiments performed with mutant derivatives of authentic and chimeric precursor proteins demonstrate that the efficiency of maturation depends on the composition of the amino acids flanking the TPP cleavage site. In addition to the well known dependence of processing on small and non-polar residues at positions -3 and -1 (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 32Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12152-12156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), polar or even charged residues within this region are required for efficient processing. Unexpectedly, these residues may not only be supplied by the C-terminal part of the signal peptide but can also be provided by the N-terminal segment of the mature polypeptide. Lack of polar residues in either position that results in increased hydrophobicity within this region significantly reduces the efficiency of the maturation process (Figs. 3 and 4). This in turn leads to the accumulation of bitopic transport intermediates in which the translocated passenger protein remains anchored to the membrane from the lumenal side by its signal peptide (Fig. 1B). Thus, depending on the signal peptide in a given precursor protein, the passenger polypeptide can take an active role in the transport process by influencing the efficiency of terminal processing by TPP. Need of Polarity or Problems with Hydrophobicity?—What is the reason for the requirement of polarity within the TPP cleavage region? It appears unlikely that the charged or polar residues are needed for direct interaction of the substrate with the processing enzyme, because the amino acid sequence flanking the cleavage site is not significantly conserved except for the Ala-X-Ala motif (Fig. 2 and data not shown) and neither the exact position of the charged residues nor the degree of polarity seems strictly fixed. Reduced polarity in this region might instead prevent the exposure of the cleavage site to the lumenal face of the thylakoid membrane, which in turn presumably affects its accessibility by the thylakoidal processing peptidase exerting its activity on the lumenal side of the membrane (3Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16386-16390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion has previously been drawn from the analysis of mutant derivatives of spontaneously inserting thylakoid proteins that likewise show reduced processing rates if polar residues in the vicinity of the TPP cleavage site are replaced by non-polar amino acids (33Tissier C. Woolhead C.A. Robinson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3131-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). What Comes First, Cleavage by TPP or Release from the Translocase?—However, in view of the results obtained with the 16/23 L82D protein, an alternative or complementing scenario appears suitable. Considering the possibility that processing of the substrate by TPP may not take place at the translocase complex but instead within the lipid bilayer, charges and/or polarity in the region connecting the signal peptide with the passenger protein might be required to facilitate the lateral release of the translocated protein from the translocase into the lipid bilayer. The mutant 16/23 L82D accumulates as bitopic translocation intermediate Ti-2 already at early time points in kinetic thylakoid transport experiments (Fig. 4A). At later time points, this intermediate is almost quantitatively processed to the mature 23 kDa protein, demonstrating that essentially all of the protein accumulating in the Ti-2 conformation is recognized as substrate by the processing enzyme. However, native gel electrophoresis shows that this translocation intermediate is not associated with either of the presumed Tat membrane complexes (Fig. 5C). Instead, it seems to accumulate freely in the lipid bilayer, which strongly suggests that processing by TPP takes place in this instance after release of the protein into the membrane. It remains yet unsolved whether such release of a translocated protein from the Tat translocase is a prerequisite for processing. Considering, however, spontaneously inserting thylakoid proteins, like CFo-II or PsbW that likewise carry cleavable signal peptides but do not depend on either Sec or Tat translocase for membrane transport (34Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Kloösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a thylakoidal processing peptidase not associated with protein transport machinery but floating freely within the membrane bilayer is even more likely. The signal for lateral opening of the translocase after membrane transport is presumably based on conformational changes in the Tat substrate upon transition from Ti-1 to Ti-2 (Fig. 1). However, a further signal might be provided by the polarity of the TPP cleavage region. Considering the accumulation of the uncharged 16/23 protein at the translocase (Fig. 5, A and C), any raise in hydrophobicity within this region seems to affect its lateral release into the membrane and thus result in stronger binding to the Tat complex. This assumption is in line also with a recent study demonstrating that increased hydrophobicity results in stronger Tat complex association (36Gérard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5263-5272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for this model can be obtained from the analysis of the Rieske protein that is targeted by the Tat pathway across the membrane. Transport is mediated by an N-terminal Tat-targeting signal that is not removed after transport but instead anchors the protein from the lumenal side to the thylakoid membrane (21Molik S. Karnauchov I. Weidlich C. Herrmann R.G. Kloösgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42761-42766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Kloösgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The topology of the mature Rieske protein thus corresponds to that of the bitopic translocation intermediates described here. It is obvious that at some point of the translocation process the protein has to be released laterally from the translocase into the lipid bilayer, but it is yet unknown which signal triggers this process. According to our hypothesis, an explicit release signal for membrane anchor proteins would not be required, because release of the bitopic translocation intermediates could well be the “default pathway” for all proteins targeted by the Tat translocase. In the case of the Rieske protein, no further processing would take place, whereas in the other cases TPP activity would be needed. Further support comes from a recent study analyzing the maize homolog of the 16 kDa precursor protein presented here (38Gérard F. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6130-6135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that study, the mature part of the precursor is efficiently translocated across the thylakoid membrane despite the fact that its signal peptide was covalently cross-linked to the TatC protein prior to transport, i.e. the precursor assumes the bitopic Ti-2 conformation with a stroma-exposed N terminus and the C terminus exposed to the lumen. Remarkably, processing of this protein to the mature polypeptide is not observed, demonstrating that TPP does not have access to its processing site. Although it cannot be excluded that the cross-link leads to reduced flexibility of the protein, preventing its accessibility by TPP, it might as well be a consequence of the inability of the protein to dissociate from the Tat complex due to the cross-link to TatC. This scenario would be in line with a model in which release from the Tat complex into the lipid bilayer is even a prerequisite for terminal processing, although it should be emphasized that TPP activity associated with the Tat complex cannot be excluded at this point.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible isoform responsible for high levels of prostaglandin production during inflammation and immune responses, mediates a variety of biological actions involved in vascular pathophysiology. We have previously shown that COX-2 gene expression is dramatically induced by a lipid-derived endogenous electrophile, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) (Kumagai, T., Matsukawa, N., Kaneko, Y., Kusumi, Y., Mitsumata, M., and Uchida, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 48389-48396). In the present study, based on the finding that HNE induced COX-2 expression only in the serum-containing media, we characterized a serum component essential for the HNE-induced COX-2 induction and found that low density lipoprotein (LDL) that had been denatured by freeze-thawing or oxidized LDL might be involved in the COX-2 induction. Moreover, we characterized the cellular events triggered by the combined stimulus of HNE and oxidized LDL and established that COX-2 induction is regulated by two sets of signaling mechanisms, one for the up-regulation of the scavenger receptor CD36 by HNE and one for the CD36-mediated COX induction by oxidized LDL. These findings represent a demonstration of a link between lipoprotein modification and activation of the inflammatory potential of macrophages."

Pantothenol (provitamin B5) inhibits parasite growth by competing with pantothenate for pantothenate kinase, the first enzyme in the coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway. In this study we investigated pantothenol uptake by P. falciparum and in doing so gained insights into the regulation of the parasite's coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway. Pantothenol was shown to enter P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes via two routes, the furosemide-inhibited “new permeation pathways” induced by the parasite in the infected erythrocyte membrane (the sole access route for pantothenate) and a second, furosemide-insensitive pathway. Having entered the erythrocyte, pantothenol is taken up by the intracellular parasite via a mechanism showing functional characteristics distinct from those of the parasite's pantothenate uptake mechanism. On reaching the parasite cytosol, pantothenol is phosphorylated and thereby trapped by pantothenate kinase, shown here to be under feedback inhibition control by coenzyme A.

Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is a precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), an obligate enzyme cofactor required in numerous metabolic processes. The five-step conversion of pantothenate to CoA is common to prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although the amino acid sequences of the enzymes involved vary considerably (1Leonardi R. Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 125-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The first step in this pathway is the conversion of pantothenate to 4′-phosphopantothenate by pantothenate kinase (PanK). 2The abbreviations used are:PanKpantothenate kinasePfPanKP. falciparum PanKBCECF2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluoresceinNPPnew permeation pathwaysESIelectrospray ionizationMSmass spectrometrypCMBSp-chloromercuribenzene sulfonateNEMN-ethylmaleimide.

The membranes of uninfected human erythrocytes are largely impermeant to pantothenate (4Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol.

Upon entering the host erythrocyte, pantothenate is taken up by the parasite via a low affinity H+-coupled transporter then, once in the parasite cytosol, is phosphorylated by the parasite's pantothenate kinase (PfPanK) as the first step in its conversion to CoA (4Saliba K.J.

Similarly, recent evidence indicates that malaria parasite proteins required for pantothenate transport and metabolism hold promise as much-needed chemotherapeutic targets (15Kirk K. Saliba K.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum pantothenate transporter and PfPanK (neither of which have been characterized at a molecular level) differ from studied mammalian counterparts in their biochemical characteristics (e.g. substrate affinity) (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The value of this pathway as an antimalarial target was validated by the discovery that the widely used provitamin pantothenol (which differs from pantothenate only in the replacement of the terminal carboxyl group with a hydroxyl group) as well as a range of other pantothenate analogs (16Saliba K.J. Kirk K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 141: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Spry C. Chai C.L.L. Kirk K. Saliba K.J. Antimicrob.

Ferru I. Kirk K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the mechanism of pantothenol uptake by P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes and by parasites functionally isolated from their host cells by a saponin permeabilization technique. The results demonstrate that, like pantothenate, pantothenol gains access into infected erythrocytes via the NPP, although an additional pathway accounts for a minor component of its uptake. Once inside the erythrocyte, pantothenol is taken up across the parasite plasma membrane via a mechanism(s) that is functionally distinct from that which mediates the uptake of pantothenate. On entering the parasite, pantothenol is, like pantothenate, phosphorylated by PfPanK, which we show here to be inhibited by CoA. Furosemide was found to alleviate this CoA-mediated negative feedback inhibition of PfPanK and thereby increases the uptake of pantothenol by the parasite despite reducing its initial rate of uptake into P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes by inhibiting the NPP. Reagents—[14C]Pantothenol (50 mCi/mmol) and [14C]pantothenate (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [14C]Choline (55 mCi/mmol) and [3H]hypoxanthine (14.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Parasite Culture and Isolation—Experiments were performed using the 3D7 or FAF6 strains of P. falciparum. The parasites were cultured in Group O, Rh+ erythrocytes and synchronized with sorbitol as described elsewhere (18Allen R.J.W. Kirk K. J. Biol.

[14C]Pantothenol and [14C]Pantothenate Uptake across the Erythrocyte Membrane—The uptake of [14C]pantothenol or [14C]pantothenate into intact trophozoite-infected and uninfected erythrocytes was measured essentially as described previously for [14C]pantothenate (4Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Uptake was commenced by adding [14C]pantothenol (2 μm, 0.10 μCi/ml in final reaction) or [14C]pantothenate (2 μm, 0.11 μCi/ml) to the cell suspension and terminated by centrifuging (15,800 × g, 2 min) 200-μl aliquots of the cell suspension (∼7 × 107 cells/ml for infected erythrocytes and between 7 × 107 and 3 × 109 cells/ml for uninfected erythrocytes) through 300 μl of dibutyl phthalate, thus separating the cells from the supernatant solution containing the radiolabeled compound. Trophozoite-infected erythrocytes were separated from uninfected cells using the Miltenyi Biotec VarioMACS magnet (21Paul F. Roath S. Melville D. Warhurst D.C. Osisanya J.O.

Saliba K.J. Allen R.J.W. Kirk K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In experiments with ATP-depleted parasites, glucose was omitted from the saline (and the NaCl concentration was increased to 135 mm so as to maintain the osmolarity of the saline), and parasites were preincubated in this solution for 15–30 min at 37 °C. In the experiments giving rise to Fig. 5C, an inwardly negative membrane potential was imposed on ATP-depleted parasites as described previously (23Lehane A.M. Saliba K.J. Allen R.J.W. Kirk K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In all experiments the concentration of the extracellular radiolabeled compound was 2 μm, and the cells were suspended at a density of ∼108 cells/ml. An isolated parasite volume of 28 fl was assumed (4Saliba K.J. Horner H.A. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furosemide, phloretin, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and valinomycin were added to the parasites (at the same time as the addition of radiolabel) as stock solutions in Me2SO, and an equal volume of Me2SO was added to the relevant controls (the maximum Me2SO concentration in the reaction solution was 0.4%, v/v). p-Chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) was dissolved in water. [14C]Pantothenol and [14C]Pantothenate Phosphorylation— The amount of [14C]pantothenol and [14C]pantothenate phosphorylated by PfPanK in parasite lysate (prepared from ∼7 × 108 cells/ml) was measured under different conditions at predetermined time points by precipitating phosphorylated compounds from solution using the Somogyi reagent (ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2), as described previously (4Saliba K.J.

The results of key experiments were confirmed with an alternate assay that relies on the separation of the phosphorylated from the unphosphorylated [14C]substrate by binding the phosphorylated [14C]substrate to DE81 filter disks followed by scintillation counting, as described previously (14Virga K.G.

In those experiments in which CoA and furosemide were added to the parasite lysate, they were added at the same time as the radiolabeled compound, and the relevant solvent (water and Me2SO) controls were included in each case. Biosynthesis, Purification, and Analysis of 4′-Phosphopantothenol—A mixture of pantothenol, ATP, MgCl2, and furosemide in 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, was at time 0 combined with lysate prepared aseptically from ∼3 × 108 P. falciparum parasites, yielding a final volume of 1.8 ml and final concentrations as follows: pantothenol (1 mm), ATP (15 mm), MgCl2 (15 mm), and furosemide (100 μm). Furosemide was included in the reaction to alleviate feedback inhibition of PanK by CoA or CoA thioesters that may have been present in the parasite lysate (see “Results”). The mixture was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by transferring the mixture to 95 °C for 5 min. Precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A reaction mixture identical to the one described above but also containing 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]pantothenol was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and processed in the same manner. The supernatant from this reaction was spotted on a plastic-backed 0.2-mm-thick silica gel 60 plate (Merck), and the plate was developed to 14 cm from the base line in a solvent of ethanol, 28% NH4OH (6:4, v/v). Horizontal strips of the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate (0.5 cm in width) were transferred to scintillation vials, to which 100 μl of water followed by 3 ml of scintillation fluid was added. The vials were vortexed, and the radioactivity on each section of the plate was determined by scintillation counting. Scintillation counting revealed the production of a 14C-labeled pantothenol metabolite with an Rf (0.61) distinct from that of pantothenol (Rf = 0.88). The product of the unlabeled reaction could thereby be purified from unreacted pantothenol and other components in the supernatant by TLC. The reaction supernatant was applied in a band to a TLC plate, and the plate was developed to 14 cm from the base line in ethanol, 28% NH4OH (6:4, v/v). The region bracketing the product (Rf = 0.61) was scraped from the plate, and the product was extracted from the silica gel by suspending the silica in water (5 times) and each time centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The water-soluble extracts were combined, concentrated in vacuo, and subjected to 1H NMR and ESI-MS analysis. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 800 NMR spectrometer operating at 800.13 MHz. The chemical shifts (δ) are reported as the shift in ppm from trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid (0.00 ppm). ESI-MS analysis was performed by the Research School of Chemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility, The Australian National University. Low resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass-Waters LC-ZMD single quadrupole liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer, and high resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Apex III 4.7T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer using negative ion detection. The product of the reaction was confirmed as 4′-phosphopantothenol by both 1H NMR and ESI-MS. 1H NMR (800 MHz, D2O): δ 4.11 (s, 1H), 3.77 (dd, 1H), 3.65 (t, 2H), 3.47 (dd, 1H), 3.32 (t, 2H), 1.79 (m, 2H), 1.01 (s, 3H), 0.89 (s, 3H). MS (ESI) m/z: 284.2 ([M-H]–). High resolution mass spectrometry: calculated, 284.0899 for C9H19NO7P; found, 284.0912. Measurement of Cytosolic pH— The pH of the parasite cytosol was monitored using 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) as described elsewhere (20Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Statistics—Statistical comparisons were made using Student's two-tailed t tests for paired or unpaired samples, as appropriate. Pantothenol Is Taken Up by Infected and Uninfected Erythrocytes—[14C]Pantothenol entry into human erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum trophozoites was initially rapid, reaching a distribution ratio ([pantothenol]i/[pantothenol]o) of 1 within 1 min, but slowing thereafter, reaching a distribution ratio of 2.2 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.E.) by 20 min (Fig. 1A, open circles). Furosemide (100 μm), an effective inhibitor of the NPP, reduced the initial rate of [14C]pantothenol uptake from a value ≥19 ± 3 μmol/(1012 cells·h) to 2.7 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells·h) (p = 0.027), consistent with the NPP being the major but not the sole route for the uptake of pantothenol. However, furosemide significantly increased (approximately doubled; p = 0.036) the total accumulation seen over the 20-min time course (Fig. 1A, filled circles). To determine whether the component of [14C]pantothenol uptake that was not inhibited by furosemide could be attributed to an endogenous erythrocyte pathway, we investigated [14C]pantothenol uptake by uninfected erythrocytes. Compared with [14C]pantothenate, which enters uninfected erythrocytes very slowly (Fig. 1B, open squares), [14C]pantothenol crossed the uninfected erythrocyte membrane rapidly (Fig. 1B, open circles), with an initial rate of 4.2 ± 0.4 μmol/(1012 cells·h). Furosemide did not significantly affect this initial rate (4.2 ± 0.8 μmol/(1012 cells·h)) or [14C]pantothenol accumulation after 20 min (p = 0.9 and 0.5, respectively; Fig. 1B, filled circles). Similarly, the addition of 10 mm pantothenol to the external medium had no significant effect on [14C]pantothenol uptake (not shown), consistent with pantothenol crossing the uninfected erythrocyte membrane either by simple diffusion through the membrane bilayer or through a low affinity transport system. An Arrhenius plot of the transport of pantothenol across the uninfected erythrocyte membrane (Fig. 1B, inset) was nonlinear and gave activation energies of 64 ± 11 kJ/mol at temperatures >25 °C and 106 ± 4 kJ/mol at temperatures <25 °C. Both the nonlinearity of the Arrhenius plot and the relatively high activation energies are consistent with a carrier-mediated process (25De Smedt H. Kinne R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 648: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Ellory J.C. Hall A.C. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1987; 41: 53-66PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hori R. Takano M. Okano T. Kitazawa S.

Acta. 1984; 773: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The pantothenol uptake rate observed in infected erythrocytes in the presence of furosemide is similar to the rate seen in uninfected erythrocytes, consistent with a fraction (≤14%; i.e. the rate of pantothenol transport into infected erythrocytes in the presence of furosemide as a percentage of the transport rate in the absence of furosemide) of the pantothenol entering infected erythrocytes via an endogenous pathway, with the remainder (≥86%) entering via the NPP. Pantothenol Is Taken up by Isolated Parasites and Phosphorylated—The uptake of [14C]pantothenol by the intracellular parasite was investigated using parasites isolated by saponin permeabilization of the erythrocyte (and parasitophorous vacuole) membranes. The accumulation of [14C]pantothenol by isolated parasites reached a distribution ratio of 7.9 ± 1.5 after 20 min (Fig. 2), with an initial rate (estimated from the first time point) ≥11 ± 2 mmol/(1012 cells·h). The fact that the distribution ratio reached a value significantly >1 might be explained either by an active transport process or by the metabolism of pantothenol within the parasite. Because pantothenol has been shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of the phosphorylation of pantothenate (3Saliba K.J. Ferru I. Kirk K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we investigated whether pantothenol is itself phosphorylated by PfPanK using lysate prepared from isolated parasites. 1H NMR and ESI-MS analyses revealed that incubation of pantothenol with parasite lysate resulted in the generation of 4′-phosphopantothenol (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). We then compared the rate of pantothenol phosphorylation to that of pantothenate phosphorylation by parasite lysates. In paired experiments 62 ± 2% of [14C]pantothenol was phosphorylated after 40 min (Fig. 3, open circles) compared with 84 ± 1% of the same concentration of [14C]pantothenate (Fig. 3, open squares). The initial phosphorylation rates were 6.1 ± 0.1 mmol/ (1012 cells·h) and 10 ± 2 mmol/(1012 cells·h) for pantothenol and pantothenate, respectively. Similar results were obtained with an alternate assay for measuring pantothenate/pantothenol phosphorylation (Fig. 3, inset). Thus, pantothenol is phosphorylated by PfPanK but at a slower rate than pantothenate. Pantothenol uptake by the parasite, therefore, reflects a combination of transport and metabolism.FIGURE 3[14C]Pantothenol and [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation by PfPanK. Time courses for the phosphorylation of [14C]pantothenol (0.35 μm; open circles) and [14C]pantothenate (0.35 μm; open squares) by PfPanK in parasite lysate, as determined using the Somogyi reagent. The data are from a single experiment (which included duplicates, shown ± range/2) and are representative of those obtained in two separate experiments. Inset, the same experiment as in main figure, but the amount of [14C]pantothenol and [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation was determined by binding the phosphorylated substrate to DE81 filter disks followed by scintillation counting. The data are averaged from three separate experiments and shown ± S.E. In both experiments, where not shown, error bars fall within the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furosemide Increases Pantothenol Uptake by Isolated Parasites—The observation that furosemide increased pantothenol uptake by infected erythrocytes (Fig. 1A) but not by uninfected erythrocytes (Fig. 1B) is consistent with furosemide increasing pantothenol uptake by infected erythrocytes by acting on the sequestration of pantothenol within the parasite. This was tested directly. Furosemide greatly increased [14C]pantothenol uptake by isolated parasites (Fig. 4A), increasing the distribution ratio after 5 min from 3.6 ± 0.3 to 13 ± 2(p = 0.01) and after 20 min from 7.9 ± 1.5 to 25 ± 4(p = 0.048). By contrast, furosemide did not significantly increase the uptake of [14C]pantothenate after 5 min (p = 0.9; Fig. 4A, inset). The effect of furosemide on the transport of pantothenol and pantothenate across the parasite plasma membrane was investigated in parasites in which the contribution of the phosphorylation reaction to the measured uptake was inhibited by the inclusion of 500 μm unlabeled pantothenate in the solution. This concentration of pantothenate is sufficient to saturate PfPanK (which has a Km of 0.3 μm) (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but should have little effect on the pantothenate transport mechanism (which has a Km of 23 mm) (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Under these conditions both compounds equilibrated across the parasite plasma membrane, with pantothenol entering the parasite more rapidly than pantothenate (p = 0.03). The initial rates of pantothenate and pantothenol uptake were 4.2 ± 0.1 μmol/(1012 cells·h) and ≥16 ± 2 μmol/(1012 cells·h), respectively (Fig. 4B, open bars and filled bars, respectively). Furosemide did not significantly affect the transport rates of either compound (p > 0.06; Fig. 4B). Furthermore, ATP depletion did not affect the transport of pantothenol (p = 0.07; Fig. 4B) but caused a slight slowing of the initial rate of pantothenate transport to 2.5 ± 0.1 μmol/(1012 cells·h) (p = 0.01; Fig. 4B). Pantothenol Uptake by Isolated Parasites Is pH-dependent— The transport of pantothenate across the parasite plasma membrane is H+-dependent (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of [14C]pantothenol uptake by isolated parasites was investigated over the extracellular pH (pHo) range 6.1 to 8.1. The corresponding intracellular pH (pHi) range is 7.07–7.72 (23Lehane A.M. Saliba K.J. Allen R.J.W. Kirk K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). [14C]Pantothenol uptake showed a marked pH dependence, increasing with increasing pHo (Fig. 5A). There was a significant difference (p = 0.01) between the initial rates at pH 6.1 (0.7 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells·h)) and 8.1 (5.0 ± 1.0 μmol/(1012 cells·h)). This is the opposite pH dependence from that seen with pantothenate (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), consistent with a fundamentally different uptake mechanism being involved. The effect of pH on pantothenol uptake may reflect a pH dependence of the transport step or of the subsequent phosphorylation of the compound within the parasite. To determine whether pantothenol transport was associated with the movement of H+ equivalents, pHi was measured using the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF. The addition of 40 mm pantothenol to suspensions of BCECF-loaded isolated parasites did not affect pHi (Fig. 5B), consistent with pantothenol transport not being H+-coupled. By contrast, the addition of 40 mm pantothenate caused a decrease in pHi (Fig. 5B), as reported previously (5Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18115-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is also possible that changes in pH alter the conformation of pantothenol, affecting its ability to diffuse (or be transported) across the lipid bilayer. To investigate this possibility we used the Pallas for Windows software to predict the LogD (octanol/water distribution coefficient) over a wide pH range. The software predicted a LogD of –0.93 over the pH range of 0–11, only increasing when the pH was increased further. pH is, therefore, unlikely to alter the membrane permeability properties of pantothenol. A decrease in pHo results in a depolarization of the parasite plasma membrane from its normal value of approximately –95 mV (18Allen R.J.W. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11264-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An increase in the uptake of choline by the parasite at higher pHo values h"
