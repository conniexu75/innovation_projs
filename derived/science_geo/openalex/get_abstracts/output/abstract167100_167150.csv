https://openalex.org/W1590987349,"Arterial conduits are increasingly preferred for surgical bypass because of inherent functional properties conferred by arterial endothelial cells, especially nitric oxide production in response to physiologic stimuli. Here we tested whether endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can replace arterial endothelial cells and promote patency in tissue-engineered small-diameter blood vessels (4 mm). We isolated EPCs from peripheral blood of sheep, expanded them ex vivo and then seeded them on decellularized porcine iliac vessels. EPC-seeded grafts remained patent for 130 days as a carotid interposition graft in sheep, whereas non-seeded grafts occluded within 15 days. The EPC-explanted grafts exhibited contractile activity and nitric-oxide-mediated vascular relaxation that were similar to native carotid arteries. These results indicate that EPCs can function similarly to arterial endothelial cells and thereby confer longer vascular-graft survival. Due to their unique properties, EPCs might have other general applications for tissue-engineered structures and in treating vascular diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1514189093,"Arachidonic acid is metabolized to prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) by cyclooxygenase (COX). COX-2, the inducible COX isozyme, has a key role in intestinal polyposis. Among the metabolites of PGH(2), PGE(2) is implicated in tumorigenesis because its level is markedly elevated in tissues of intestinal adenoma and colon cancer. Here we show that homozygous deletion of the gene encoding a cell-surface receptor of PGE(2), EP2, causes decreases in number and size of intestinal polyps in Apc(Delta 716) mice (a mouse model for human familial adenomatous polyposis). This effect is similar to that of COX-2 gene disruption. We also show that COX-2 expression is boosted by PGE(2) through the EP2 receptor via a positive feedback loop. Homozygous gene knockout for other PGE(2) receptors, EP1 or EP3, did not affect intestinal polyp formation in Apc(Delta 716) mice. We conclude that EP2 is the major receptor mediating the PGE2 signal generated by COX-2 upregulation in intestinal polyposis, and that increased cellular cAMP stimulates expression of more COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor in the polyp stroma."

The enzymes that synthesize l-Ara4N and transfer it to lipid A have not been identified. We now report an inner membrane enzyme, expressed in polymyxin-resistant mutants, that adds one or twol-Ara4N moieties to lipid A or its immediate precursors. No soluble factors are required. A gene located near minute 51 on theS. typhimurium and E. coli chromosomes (previously termed orf5, pmrK, oryfbI) encodes the l-Ara4N transferase. The enzyme, renamed ArnT, consists of 548 amino acid residues in S. typhimurium with 12 possible membrane-spanning regions. ArnT displays distant similarity to yeast protein mannosyltransferases. ArnT adds two l-Ara4N units to lipid A precursors containing a Kdo disaccharide. However, as shown by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, it transfers only a single l-Ara4N residue to the 1-phosphate moiety of lipid IVA, a precursor lacking Kdo. Proteins with full-length sequence similarity to ArnT are present in genomes of other bacteria thought to synthesizel-Ara4N-modified lipid A, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pestis. As shown in the following article (Trent, M. S., Ribeiro, A. A., Doerrler, W. T., Lin, S., Cotter, R. J., and Raetz, C. R. H. (2001) J. Biol.

An important component of the host response to infection is the production of amphipathic, cationic peptides that possess anti-microbial activity (19Ohl M.E. Miller S.I. Annu. Rev.

Bacteria may acquire resistance to such peptides by addingl-Ara4N units to the phosphate groups of their lipid A, reducing its net negative charge, and lowering its affinity for these peptides (21Vaara M.

Addition of the l-Ara4N moiety to lipid A reduces the affinity of lipid A for polymyxin and other cationic anti-microbial peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We now report a novel enzyme, present in inner membranes of polymyxin-resistant mutants of S. typhimurium, that can transfer one or two l-Ara4N moieties to lipid A and certain lipid A precursors. Transferase activity is dependent upon activation of the pmrA gene, either directly by mutation or secondarily by growth under appropriate conditions. The enzyme adds a singlel-Ara4N unit to the 1-phosphate moiety of the tetra-acylated lipid A precursor, lipid IVA, which lacks Kdo (Fig. 3). However, lipid A molecules containing a Kdo disaccharide are modified with two l-Ara4N units, indicating that the addition of l-Ara4N to the 4′-position is Kdo-dependent. Transferase activity is greatly elevated when the orf5(pmrK) gene ofS. typhimurium (6Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Infect.

Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 17: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but its biosynthesis and function have remained elusive until recently. Increased substitution of lipid A with l-Ara4N moieties occurs in polymyxin-resistant mutants (22Helander I.M. Kilpeläinen I. Vaara M. Mol.

Polymyxin resistance is caused by mutations in the transcription factor PmrA, which is rendered constitutively active in resistant strains (26Roland K.L. Martin L.E. Esther C.R. Spitznagel J.K. J.

Sequence analysis of the protein products of this operon with the PSI-BLAST tool suggested a plausible hypothesis for the enzymatic synthesis of l-Ara4N from UDP-glucuronic acid, as shown in Fig. 2 (10Zhou Z.

Both the transferase (ArnT) and its l-Ara4N donor substrate are associated with the inner membrane of S. typhimurium (Figs.5 and 6). This is consistent with the hydropathy profile of the transferase, which contains 12 membrane-spanning regions and with the proposed role of undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N as the donor (Fig. 2). Robust l-Ara4N transferase activity is seen only in membranes of cells in which PmrA is activated and is completely absent in membranes of pmrA − mutants (Fig.4).Overexpression of S. typhimurium arnT behind the T7lac promoter in E. coli BLR/DE3 results in a further 200-fold elevation of l-Ara4N transferase-specific activity, when compared with membranes of pmrA C S. typhimurium, supporting the assignment of arnTas the structural gene for the transferase (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, however, the T7 expression strain BLR(DE3) is itself polymyxin-resistant and contains l-Ara4N-modified lipid A (Fig. 9), whereas no l-Ara4N-modified lipid A is made in the polymyxin-sensitive E. coli K-12 expression host, NovaBlue(DE3) (Fig. 9). No l-Ara4N transferase activity is seen in membranes of NovaBlue(DE3) cells that overexpress S. typhimurium arnT (Fig. 10), because the l-Ara4N donor substrate is absent. Addition of purified undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N to such membranes reconstitutes full transferase activity (32Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

E. coli K-12 furthermore contains all the other genes of the S. typhimurium operon required for polymyxin resistance (24Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol.

The regulation of these genes in E. coli is probably similar to that reported for the better characterized S. typhimurium system, but there are some differences. Unlike S. typhimurium, lipid A of E. coli K-12 does not contain the l-Ara4N moiety when grown in LB broth at pH 6.8 (10Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The utilization of this substrate by ArnT suggests that the transferase active site faces the periplasm, given that peptidoglycan (54Park J.T. Neidhardt F.

Modification of the lipid A 4′-phosphate moiety with l-Ara4N on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane would avoid any possibility of interference with the Kdo transferase. The latter is located on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane and requires an unsubstituted 4′-phosphate moiety for activity (10Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

However, ArnT appears to modify both the 1- and the 4′-phosphate groups of Kdo2[4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig.11) and Kdo2-[32P]lipid A (not shown), as judged by TLC analysis, suggesting that l-Ara4N transfer to the 4′-position is Kdo-dependent. These findings provide an explanation for the peculiar observation that lipid A precursors isolated from Kdo-deficient strains are modified withl-Ara4N exclusively at the 1-position (9Strain S.M.

However, lipid A of wild-type S. typhimurium does in fact contain a minor component in which l-Ara4N is attached both to the 1- and to the 4′-phosphate groups (11Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S.

It may be that ArnT functions not only as a glycosyltransferase but also as a flippase for undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N. However, other membrane-associated proteins of unknown function present in the polymyxin resistance operon, such as Orf6 and Orf7 (6Gunn J.S. Ryan S.S. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I.

Isolation of mutants that are able to make undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N, but are unable to transfer it to lipid A when extra copies of wild-typearnT are provided in trans, might lead to the identification of genes required for undecaprenyl phosphate-l-Ara4N transport. Very little is known about dolichyl phosphate-sugar transport in eucaryotic systems (59Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol.

Deletion analysis of CYP8B1/luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells revealed that the sequences from −57 to +300 were important for basal and liver-specific promoter activities. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) strongly activated human CYP8B1 promoter activities, whereas cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase promoter factor (CPF), an NR5A2 family of nuclear receptors, had much less effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified an overlapping HNF4α- and CPF-binding site in the +198/+227 region. The human CYP8B1 promoter activities were strongly repressed by bile acids, and the bile acid response element was localized between +137 and +220. Site-directed mutagenesis of the HNF4α-binding site markedly reduced promoter activity and its response to bile acid repression. On the other hand, mutation of the CPF-binding site had little effect on promoter activity and bile acid inhibition. A negative nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner markedly inhibited transactivation of CYP8B1 by HNF4α. Mammalian two-hybrid assay confirmed that HNF4α interacted with small heterodimer partner. Furthermore, bile acids and farnesoid X receptor reduced the expression of nuclear HNF4α in HepG2 cells and rat livers and its binding to DNA. Bile acids and farnesoid X receptor also inhibited mouse HNF4α gene transcription. In summary, our data revealed the critical roles HNF4α play on CYP8B1transcription and its repression by bile acids.

We hypothesize a general mechanism that SHP interacts either with HNF4α or CPF and inhibits the genes regulated by bile acids. HNF4α (NR2A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that binds to the direct repeat with one base spacing (DR1) motif as a homodimer and regulates the liver-specific expression of many genes in lipoproteins and glucose metabolism. HNF4α has constitutive activity and is able to transactivate genes without ligand binding. HNF4 has been shown to activate CYP7A1 transcription (32Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this research was to investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the human CYP8B1 promoter by bile acids. In the present study, we characterized the promoter of the human CYP8B1. Site-directed mutagenesis, reporter gene assay, and EMSA were used to study effects of CPF, HNF4α, and SHP. Since CPF was used in this study, the term CPF will be used in this work unless specified otherwise. It should be mentioned that FTF is the recommended name by Genomic Data Base Nomenclature Committee (accession number 9837397) (26Pare J.F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Belanger L. J. Biol.

Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 269-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that HNF4α played a major role in regulating human CYP8B1 transcription and mediating bile acid repression by interacting with SHP. In addition, bile acids also inhibited CYP8B1 transcription by inhibiting HNF4α transcription. Based on the available human CYP8B1 sequence, the sequence from nucleotide −514 to +300 relative to the transcription initiation site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human liver genomic DNA as a template. One genomic clone, H8B5, was isolated from the λFIX II genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the end-labeled genomic fragment as a hybridization probe. Southern blot and PCR analyses confirmed that this clone (15 kb) contained the entire coding sequence of the human CYP8B1 and about 8 kb of the 5′-flanking sequences. A PstI/SacI restriction fragment containing 3.2 kb of the 5′-flanking sequences was subcloned into the pBluescript II SK+ vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and designated as pBSK/h8B1/3.5K. Nucleotide sequencing revealed 3389 base pairs of the 5′-upstream sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF226627). The −514/+300 fragment obtained by PCR was cloned into the SacI and SmaI sites of the luciferase reporter, pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc obtained was then digested with KpnI and SpeI to release a fragment covering the sequence from −514 to +172 and replaced it with a KpnI and SpeI fragment (−3064 to +172) released from pBSK/h8B1/3.5K. The resulting constructs were designated as phCYP8B1−3064/+300Luc. The phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc was digested with HinfI at −111, respectively. The sticky ends produced by HinfI were blunted with the Klenow polymerase. The linearized plasmid was subjected to XhoI digestion and subsequently cloned into the pGL3 vector digested with SmaI and XhoI. The phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc was also used as a template for construction of deletion mutants by PCR to generate phCYP8B1−434/+300Luc, phCYP8B1−164/+300Luc, and phCYP8B1−57/+300Luc. All of these constructs had MluI site built in at the 5′-end and XhoI site at the 3′-end and cloned into MluI- and XhoI-digested pGL3 vector. To construct the 3′-deletion mutants, the phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc was digested with BglII and SpeI or StuI to release fragments from +180 to +300 and +248 to +300, respectively. The sticky ends were then blunted with the Klenow polymerase, and the linearized plasmids were religated to generate phCYP8B1−514/+180Luc and phCYP8B1−514/+248Luc. The phCYP8B1−514/+76Luc was constructed by digestion phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc with HindIII to release the fragment from +76 to +300 and religate the linearized plasmid. Other 3′-deletion mutants were obtained by PCR to construct phCYP8B1−514/+220Luc, phCYP8B1−514/+200Luc, and phCYP8B1−514/+137Luc. These three constructs had SacI at the 5′-end and SmaI sites at the 3′-end. Mutations were introduced into reporter constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Two complementary oligonucleotide sets were designed as PCR primers; primer M4 (+194 to +234) was used to mutate the HNF4α site and introduce a CPF site in the reverse strand209tttaccttga218; primer M5 (+200 to +245) was used to introduce a consensus 3′-HRE215aGgtCA220. Reaction mixtures were set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction using 50 ng of template DNA and 125 ng of primers. Cycling parameter: denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min. The reaction was subjected to DpnI digestion for 2 h. The plasmids were then transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Gal4/HNF4α fusion construct (provided by M. Crestani (33De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol.

CheckMateTMmammalian two-hybrid assay kit was obtained from Promega. The pBIND vector contains the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain, and the pACT vector contains the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain. Gal4/Id and VP16/MyoD provided in the kit were used as a positive control. The reporter plasmid pG5 luc contains five copies of Gal4-binding sites fused upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (luc). The human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2, HB8065), Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO, CCL-61), and human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (HEK293, CRL-1573) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. The cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and F-12, (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Celox Corp., Hopkins, MN) and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Confluent cultures of HepG2 cells grown in 24-well tissue culture plates were transfected with plasmids by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The reporter construct, receptor expression plasmid, and pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA, one-tenth of reporter plasmid, as internal control for transfection efficiency) were transfected in each well. The pcDNA3 vector was added to normalize the amounts of DNA transfected in each assay. Cells were overlaid with serum-free media containing indicated concentrations of bile acids. Cells were lysed 40 h after transfection. Each data point is the average of triplicate assays. Each experiment was repeated three times. Luciferase activity was assayed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and luminescence was determined using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiencies by dividing the relative light units by β-galactosidase activity expressed from cotransfected pCMV plasmid. A human CYP7A1 reporter gene phCYP7A1−372/+25Luc was constructed previously. Mouse HNF4α/Luc reporter (pDGT43) containing 744 base pairs 5′-upstream sequence was provided by Dr. T. Leff (Werner Lambert/Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). Confluent HepG2 cells were lysed by trypsin and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer and swelled for 10 min on ice. The cells were broken using a Dounce homogenizer with a tightly fit pestle. One-tenth volume of 75% sucrose buffer was added and homogenized. The homogenate was spun for 30 s at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Then the viscous nuclear pellet was lysed in nuclear resuspension buffer containing 0.4 m ammonium sulfate and centrifuged at 2 °C for 90 min at 150,000 ×g to pellet nuclear debris and chromatin. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to precipitate the nuclear protein from the supernatant. The pellet was dissolved in nuclear dialysis buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentration was quantitated using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce), and the nuclear extracts were stored at −70 °C in aliquots. Nuclear extracts also were isolated from the livers of rats treated with a diet supplemented with CA (1%), CDCA (1%), deoxycholic acid (DCA) (0.25%), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (1%), cholestyramine (5%), or cholesterol (1%) for 2 weeks. Animals were housed in a room with reversed dark/light cycle (3 a.m. to 3 p.m. dark, 3 p.m. to 3 a.m. light) and sacrificed at 9 am. CPF, PPARα, RXRα, RARα, and HNF4α receptor proteins were synthesized in vitro by using Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) programmed with receptor expression plasmids according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Expression plasmids for CPF, PPARα, RXRα/RARα, and HNF4α were obtained from Drs. B. Shan, E. Johnson, R. Evans, and W. Chen, respectively. Double-stranded synthetic probes for EMSA were prepared by heating equal molar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides to 95 °C in 2× SSC (0.5m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and cooled to room temperature. The resulting double-stranded fragments were labeled by filling in the overhang incorporated in the synthetic oligonucleotides with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mol) with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Oligonucleotides filled-in with non-labeled dNTPs were used as cold competitors. Labeled fragments were purified through two G-50 spin columns. Binding reactions were initiated with the addition of 3 μg of nuclear extracts to 100,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotide probe dissolved in 20 μl of the buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCI, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Four percent polyacrylamide gels were prepared and pre-run for 30 min at 200 V. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature at constant 200 V for 1.5–2 h. The gel was dried and autoradiographed using PhosphorImager 445Si (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The images were analyzed using IP Lab Gel software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). Antibody supershift was carried out by adding the antibody (1–2 μl) to the nuclear extract and incubated for 15 min before mixing with labeled probe. Oligonucleotides used for competition assays were HNF4 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), SP-1 from Promega (Madison, WI), and CPF synthesized according to Gilbert et al. (30Gilbert S. Galarneau L. Lamontagne A. Roy S. Belanger L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5032-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To measure HNF4α protein in the nuclei, 3 μg of nuclear extracts were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellular membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in Tween PBS (T-PBS) overnight at 4 °C and incubated with the antibody against HNF4α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5000 in T-PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with T-PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG) at a dilution of 1:3000 at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunodetection was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were imaged using a Kodak Imaging Station 440. To determine the contribution of the 5′-flanking sequences to human CYP8B1 promoter activity, we performed transient transfection assays of CYP8B1/luciferase reporters in HepG2 cells and CHO cells. Fig. 1 Ashows that sequential deletion of the nucleotide sequence from the 5′-direction did not alter reporter activity much in HepG2 cells. In contrast, deletion of sequences from the 3′-direction markedly reduced reporter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 B). The sequence from +248 to +300 apparently was very important for promoter activity, because deletion of this region reduced the activity by 75%, relative to the promoter activity of phCYP8B1−514/+300Luc. Deletion of the sequence from +180 to +248 further reduced the promoter activities to 10%. Transfection assays of these deletion mutants were also done in CHO cells. Deletion of the sequence from 5′-end did not change the promoter activities as observed in the HepG2 cells (data not shown). The loss of promoter activity was much less in CHO cells than in HepG2 cells when the regions between +180 and +300 were deleted (Fig.1 B). It appeared that the sequence between +180 and +300 was important for the liver-specific transcription of the human CYP8B1. Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide sequence and putative transcription factor-binding sites of the proximal promoter of the human CYP8B1. The transcription start site is located at 325 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon (9Gafvels M. Olin M. Chowdhary B.P. Raudsepp T. Andersson U. Persson B. Jansson M. Bjorkhem I. Eggertsen G. Genomics. 1999; 56: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The TATA box is located at -56/-51. Sequences downstream of the transcription start site contain consensus binding sites for both ubiquitous and liver-specific transcription factors. The region from +248 to +300, which is critical for basal promoter activity, contains several NF-1-binding sites. The region upstream to +180 contains a cluster of putative binding sequences for liver-specific factors, HNF3, CEBP, and DBP. HNF3- and CEBP-binding sites are similar to the insulin response sequence, T(G/A)TTTTG, found in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 that has been implicated in mediating the repression by insulin (34O'Brien R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1996901586,"Abstract Lipid A of Salmonella typhimurium can be resolved into multiple molecular species. Many of these substances are more polar than the predominant hexa-acylated lipid A 1,4′-bisphosphate of Escherichia coli K-12. By using new isolation methods, we have purified six lipid A subtypes (St1 to St6) from wild type S. typhimurium. We demonstrate that these lipid A variants are covalently modified with one or two 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) moieties. Each lipid A species with a defined set of polar modifications can be further derivatized with a palmitoyl moiety and/or a 2-hydroxymyristoyl residue in place of the secondary myristoyl chain at position 3′. The unexpected finding that St5 and St6 contain two l-Ara4N residues accounts for the anomalous structures of lipid A precursors seen in S. typhimurium mutants defective in 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid biosynthesis in which only the 1-phosphate group is modified with thel-Ara4N moiety (Strain, S. M., Armitage, I. M., Anderson, L., Takayama, K., Quershi, N., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16089–16098). Phosphoethanolamine (pEtN)-modified lipid A species are much less abundant than l-Ara4N containing forms in wild typeS. typhimurium grown in broth but accumulate to high levels when l-Ara4N synthesis is blocked inpmrA C pmrE− andpmrA C pmrF− mutants. Purification and analysis of selected compounds demonstrate that one or two pEtN moieties may be present. Our findings show that S. typhimurium contains versatile enzymes capable of modifying both the 1- and 4′-phosphates of lipid A with l-Ara4N and/or pEtN groups. PmrA null mutants of S. typhimurium produce lipid A species without any pEtN or l-Ara4N substituents. However, PmrA is not needed for the incorporation of 2-hydroxymyristate or palmitate."

Microorganisms produce a variety of inhibitors of PP1, which include the microcystin class of inhibitors and okadaic acid, the latter being the major cause of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning and a powerful tumor promoter. We have determined the crystal structure of the molecular complex of okadaic acid bound to PP1 to a resolution of 1.9 Å. This structure reveals that the acid binds in a hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site of the protein and interacts with basic residues within the active site. Okadaic acid exhibits a cyclic structure, which is maintained via an intramolecular hydrogen bond. This is reminiscent of other macrocyclic protein phosphatase inhibitors. The inhibitor-bound enzyme shows very little conformational change when compared with two other PP1 structures, except in the inhibitor-sensitive β12-β13 loop region. The selectivity of okadaic acid for protein phosphatases-1 and -2A but not PP-2B (calcineurin) may be reassessed in light of this study.

Two classes of enzymes in the cell that catalyze cellular dephosphorylation activity are tyrosine phosphatases and serine/threonine phosphatases (1Dawson J.F. Holmes C.F.B. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 646-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Classification of serine/threonine phosphatases can be subdivided into four categories: protein phosphatase-1 (PP1),1 -2A (PP2A), -2B(PP2B) and -2C (PP2C) (2Sheppeck J.E. Gauss C. Chamberlain R.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The first three of these categories comprise what is known as the PPP family of protein phosphatases since they contain extensive sequence similarity in their catalytic domains and little or no sequence homology to PP2C or to tyrosine phosphatases. There are several natural toxin inhibitors of the PPP family of enzymes. These include microcystins, calyculins, tautomycin and okadaic acid (OA) (Fig. 1) (1Dawson J.F. Holmes C.F.B. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 646-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OA is a tumor-promoting C38 polyether fatty acid produced by marine dinoflagellates (1Dawson J.F. Holmes C.F.B. Front.

Here we describe the crystal structure of OA bound to the recombinant catalytic subunit of PP1 (γ isoform). The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 γ isoform was purified as described previously (9Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F.B. Biochem.

The enzyme and inhibitor were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio with the concentration of protein being ∼0.4 mm. The PP1·OA complex was then mixed with an equivalent volume of mother liquor, which consisted of 2 m lithium sulfate, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2% polyethylene glycol 400, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The complex crystallized in the space group P42212 with cell dimensions a = b = 99.18 Å, c = 62.17 Å, with one complex per asymmetric unit. A first data set to 2.9 Å was collected at 100 K on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator equipped with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. The data were processed with the HKL suite of programs (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). This initial structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe, using the PP1-MCLR structure (with MCLR removed) as a search model (Protein Data Bank accession code 1FJM) (12Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Electron density for both the protein and the inhibitor were clear from the initial map generated from the molecular replacement solution. Another data set to 1.9 Å was then collected on the same instrumentation as above. The first structure was used as a search model for another round of molecular replacement as above. OA was fit to the difference density using the crystal structure of the free inhibitor as the starting model (6Tachibana K. Scheuer P.J. Tsukitani Y. Kikuchi H. Van Enden D. Clardy J. Gopichand Y.

Open table in a new tab The catalytic subunit of PP1 is composed of an α-helical domain (9 α-helices) and a β-sheet domain (14 β-strands comprising 3 β-sheets) (Fig.1). The active site lies at one of the interfaces between the two domains. Residues within the active site are almost exclusively found on segments of random coil joining regular secondary structural elements, rather than within the regular secondary structural elements themselves. There have been two previously published structures of each of phosphatases PP1 and PP2B (8Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J.

Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The overall structure obtained here with OA-bound is very similar to both the tungstate-inhibited structure of PP1 (Cαr.m.s.d. 0.555 Å (residues 6–288) averaged over the two tungstate·PP1 complex molecules in the asymmetric unit) and the structure of PP1 with the inhibitor MCLR-bound (Cαr.m.s.d. 0.518 Å (residues 6–285) averaged over the two PP1·MCLR complexes in the asymmetric unit) (Fig. 3). The presence of three grooves (hydrophobic, C-terminal, and acidic) on the surface of PP1 has been reported previously (Fig. 1) (8Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The double ring spiroketal moiety of OA is hydrophobic and binds into the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the protein. In the PP1·OA complex, Trp-206 and Ile-130 in the hydrophobic groove appear to be the two most important residues in this interaction due to their proximity to the hydrophobic segment of OA (Fig. 2). Other hydrophobic interactions occur between the C-4 to C-16 region of OA (which includes two six-membered rings) and the PP1 residues Phe-276 and Val-250. The remaining sites of interaction between PP1 and OA involve hydrogen bonding. A conserved acidic motif is present in many PP1 inhibitors, either as a carboxylic acid (C-1 in OA) or as a phosphate (calyculin A) (Fig. 2). In our structure, the acid motif in OA accepts a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of Tyr-272 (20Nishiwaki S. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Furuya-Suguri H. Matsushima R. Iida Y. Ojika M. Yamada K. Uemura D. Yasumoto T. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Other hydrogen bonding interactions occur between Arg-96 and the C-2 hydroxyl of the inhibitor and between Arg-221 and the C-24 hydroxyl group of OA. A comparison of OA-bound to PP1 and the crystal structure of OA alone reveals that the two structures have a very similar overall conformation (0.397 Å r.m.s.d. over all 56 atoms). In the structure of unbound OA, a hydrogen bond between the C-24 hydroxyl and the C-1 acid keeps the inhibitor in a cyclic structure. This hydrogen bond is present in the PP1·OA complex as well. The recent proposal that, based on modeling considerations, OA binds to PP1 in an extended conformation is clearly unfounded (21Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of a hydrophobic moiety in many PPP family inhibitors suggests that the hydrophobic groove may play a key role in inhibitor binding. This was seen in the crystal structure of MCLR bound to PP1 where the hydrophobic β-(2S, 3S, 8S, 9S)-3-amino-9-methoxy-2, 6, 8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid (Adda) group of MCLR contacts residues in the hydrophobic groove of PP1 and is repeated in our structure where the hydrophobic tail of OA contacts similar residues in the hydrophobic groove. The other hydrophobic interactions that occur are between the C-4 to C-16 region of OA and PP1 residues Phe-276 and Val-250. These interactions may actually be an impediment to OA inhibition since mutation of Phe-276 to a smaller and less hydrophobic cysteine reduces the Ki for the acid 40-fold (22Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic ring of Phe-276 may inhibit entry of OA into the active site, overshadowing other favorable hydrophobic interactions. A cysteine (Cys-269) is present at the equivalent position in PP2A and may be the reason that PP2A has a higher affinity for OA than does PP1. Interestingly this cysteine in PP2A has recently been implicated as a key residue in the interaction of the PP2A/PP4-specific inhibitor fostriecin (23Evans D.R.H. Simon J.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). While the hydrophobic interactions between OA and PP1 are predominant, structure-function studies show that the hydrogen bonding interactions are important as well. The importance of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-272 and the acid group of OA is exemplified by the observation that esterification or removal of the acidic moiety in OA results in elimination of its inhibitory activity and by the fact that mutation of Tyr-272 to Phe results in a 50-fold increase in the Ki value (20Nishiwaki S. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Furuya-Suguri H. Matsushima R. Iida Y. Ojika M. Yamada K. Uemura D. Yasumoto T. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite the intimate interaction of the C-2 hydroxyl group of OA with the Arg-96 side chain, removal of the hydroxyl group results in only a 7-fold increase in the Ki value (24Takai A. Murata M. Torigoe K. Isobe M. Mieskes G. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of Arg-221 to Ser confers resistance to inhibition by OA, underlining the importance of the interaction between the Arg and the C-24 hydroxyl of OA (25Huang H. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As mentioned, the structure of PP1 obtained here is remarkably similar to the two structures of each of PP1 and PP2B determined previously. Even with only the phosphate-mimic tungstate present, the architecture of the active site of the tungstate-bound PP1 structure is virtually identical to our structure with OA-bound (Fig. 3). This suggests that either tungstate does not accurately mimic the phosphate product or that the binding of OA is enthalpically favorable and does not cause significant changes to the structure of the protein. In contrast, the MCLR-bound structure reveals large changes in the conformation of the active site relative to the tungstate- and OA-bound PP1 structures (Fig. 3). These changes are mainly restricted to the β12-β13 loop, which has been previously implicated in inhibitor specificity (26Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Lee E.Y. Zhang L. Zhao S. Wei Q. Zhang J. Qi Z.Q. Belmonte E.R. Front. Biosci. 1999; 15: D270-D285Google Scholar). The loop in the MCLR structure folds back on itself, causing significant shifting of residues 273–278 relative to our structure and to the tungstate-bound structure of PP1. One critical difference between MCLR and OA is the presence of a dehydroalanine residue in MCLR that covalently alkylates the Sγ of Cys-273 in a time-dependent reaction (1Dawson J.F. Holmes C.F.B. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 646-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This covalent linkage is not the primary cause of inhibition of PP1 by MCLR (8Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether inhibition by MCLR requires the movement of the β12-β13 loop or whether this movement occurs along with covalent bond formation. Given the strong similarity of the PP1-interacting domains of OA and MCLR, it is likely that the primary mode of inhibition of PP1 by MCLR is similar to that of OA and that the movement of the β12-β13 loop in the MCLR complex is a secondary event accompanying the covalent bonding reaction. An important interaction between PP1 and MCLR that is not present in the PP1·OA complex is the hydrogen bond that occurs between Arg-96 (PP1) and the acid of the methyl-aspartate residue (MCLR). This interaction may account for the 100-fold greater inhibition of PP1 by MCLR over OA (28Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The structure of PP1-OA is strikingly similar to the structure of PP2B (Fig. 3) despite the fact that OA does not strongly inhibit PP2B. In the catalytic domain of PP2B, the protein backbone around the active site is virtually identical to that in PP1, including the β12-β13 loop. However, the overall Cα r.m.s.d. is 1.04 Å (residues 6–272), indicating some significant differences in other parts of the protein, namely in the less structured N and C termini regions. Several attempts to model the PP1-OA structure based on the other PPP family structures have been made (29Gauss C. Sheppeck J.E. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Bagu J.R. Sykes B.D. Craig M.M. Holmes C.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Quinn R. Taylor C. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1029-1034Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These models have largely been based on the MCLR-bound structure in which the conformation of the β12-β13 loop differs from PP1 with tungstate-bound and our structure with OA-bound. The OA-PP1 structure presented here will greatly facilitate models based on PP1 inhibitors structurally related to OA (e.g. tautomycin). OA exhibits different inhibitory potential on the structurally similar PPP family members. Okadaic acid inhibits PP2A most strongly (IC50≈0.1 nm), PP1 less well (IC50 ≈10 nm), and PP2B weakly (IC50 ≈1–2 μm) (28Holmes C.F.B. Boland M.P. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 1993; 3: 934-943Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The primary difference in the active site region between PP1 and PP2A is in the β12-β13 loop where PP1 contains the residues GEFD (residues 274–277) but PP2A has YRCG (residues 267–270) in the equivalent positions (Fig. 2). While mutation of Phe-276 to Cys (in PP2A) clearly facilitates inhibition by OA, there are likely additional reasons for the enhanced inhibition of PP2A by OA. The side chain of Tyr-267 in PP2A should point into solvent, away from the active site, if it is in the same position as the equivalent Gly-274 in PP1, so this change should not be expected to be very significant. However, the allowed torsion angles of a tyrosine would constrain the β12-β13 loop to a larger degree (Gly-274 is in the third position of a type II β-turn and is currently in a region of the Ramachandran plot that is disallowed for Tyr residues), and perhaps the loop is brought into a position to allow for a hydrogen bond to occur between the tyrosine and a hydroxyl group on OA (C-7–OH). The tyrosine could also produce a favorable hydrophobic interaction with the C-10 methyl group of OA. Further interactions in PP2A may result from substitution of Glu-275 in PP1 with Arg-268 in PP2A. Hydrogen bonding interactions may occur between this arginine and the C-7–OH group or hydrophobic interactions with the C-10 methyl group. The enhanced inhibitory potency of OA with PP2A is likely a combination of these effects. The decreased inhibition of PP2B with OA is more difficult to interpret. Major active site differences between the two proteins are the replacement of Ile-133 in PP1 with Tyr-159 in PP2B, Tyr-134 in PP1 with Phe-160 in PP2B, Cys-273 in PP1 with Leu-312 in PP2B, and Phe-276 in PP1 with Tyr-315 in PP2B. Of these, changing Phe-276 in PP1 to a tyrosine in PP2B may make the greatest impact on OA inhibition. The portion of the inhibitor that resides in this part of the active site is quite hydrophobic, interacting with Phe-276, the methylene carbon of Cys-273, the side chain of Val-250, and the aromatic ring of Tyr-272. The ring of Phe-276 points almost directly at one of the double ring systems of OA (carbons 4–12) (Fig. 2), and the introduction of a hydroxyl group in PP2B may be enough to disrupt the interaction between OA and the protein, thus reducing the inhibitory potency of OA for PP2B. The resistance of PP2B to OA may therefore arise from the combination of this residue change and subtle structural changes in key OA contact residues in the potential OA binding site. Determination of the PP1-OA structure presented here will now facilitate rational mutagenesis of the PP2B catalytic subunit to test this hypothesis. We would like to thank Dr. David Barford for providing the coordinates of the tungstate-bound structure of PP1."

Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a polyisoprene-linked intermediate is required for the transfer of the l-Ara4N moiety to lipid A. Here we have presented the identification, purification, and biophysical characterization of this novel substance, which is now properly described as undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N or undecaprenyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-α-l-arabinopyranosyl phosphate. This material was first detected as a minor phospholipid that accumulates in a polymyxin-resistant mutant of E. coli(Fig. 2). In S. typhimurium, the lipid is also present in wild-type cells, but its level is increased in pmrA C and PhoPC mutants. It is absent inpmrA− strains (Fig. 3).The purification to near-homogeneity of the donor lipid required as a first step the construction of a special pmrA C mutant of E. coli lacking phosphatidylethanolamine to simplify all subsequent procedures (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry and high resolution NMR spectroscopy were then used for the actual structure determination. As noted in previous NMR studies of lipid A, the mixture CDCl3/CDOD/D2O (2:3:1, v/v) is ideal for NMR analyses of small lipid samples (51Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Res.

The data (shown in Figs. Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Tables II and III, and see Figs. 1–3 in the Supplemental Material) confirm unequivocally that the l-Ara4N donor substrate has the structure undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N. The proposed structure and conformation of the sugar is supported by its coupling constants and chemical shifts, summarized in Table II, which are in accord with a synthetic standard of l-Ara4N (57Naleway J.J. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson L. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The attachment of the nitrogen atom to position 4 of the sugar is established by the HMQC experiment (Fig. 9 A). The size and configuration of the polyisoprene chain are confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 7) and by the HMQC/HMBC analyses (Figs. 9 and 10).Reconstitution of the purified lipid donor with the cloned E. coli or S. typhimurium l-Ara4N transferase (ArnT) resulted in robust in vitro conversion of the precursor lipid-IVA to lipid-IIA (Fig. 11), a compound that contains a single l-Ara4N moiety on its 1-phosphate residue (50Raetz C.R.H.

However, prior to the present work, identification of undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N and in vitro systems for detecting the transfer of l-Ara4N to lipid A or lipid A precursors had not been reported.Many interesting questions regarding the possible translocation of the donor lipid across the inner membrane for utilization by ArnT in the periplasm remain unanswered. The relevant transporter has not been identified. It is unlikely that Wzx (RfbX), the putativeO-antigen flippase (5Reeves P.R. Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is responsible for the translocation of undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N into the periplasm, because Wzx proteins are thought to transport undecaprenyl diphosphate oligosaccharides (70Feldman M.F.

Nevertheless,wzx-deficient mutants should be tested for their sensitivity to polymyxin. Most importantly, perhaps, in vitro systems for measuring flip-flop of undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N across lipid bilayers need to be developed, but first, efficient enzymatic, radiochemical, and chemical methods for making undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N must be devised. A new enzymatic system for the conversion of UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-l-Ara4N has recently been identified in extracts of polymyxin-resistant mutants of E. coli, 3S. Breazeale, A. A. Ribeiro, and C. R. H. Raetz, manuscript in preparation. and should facilitate the preparation of undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N. Polyisoprene-linked sugars function as donor substrates for many types of glycosyltransferases (1Bugg T.D. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol.

Here we have presented the identification, purification, and biophysical characterization of this novel substance, which is now properly described as undecaprenyl phosphate-α-l-Ara4N or undecaprenyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-α-l-arabinopyranosyl phosphate. This material was first detected as a minor phospholipid that accumulates in a polymyxin-resistant mutant of E. coli(Fig. 2). In S. typhimurium, the lipid is also present in wild-type cells, but its level is increased in pmrA C and PhoPC mutants. It is absent inpmrA− strains (Fig. 3).The purification to near-homogeneity of the donor lipid required as a first step the construction of a special pmrA C mutant of E. coli lacking phosphatidylethanolamine to simplify all subsequent procedures (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry and high resolution NMR spectroscopy were then used for the actual structure determination. As noted in previous NMR studies of lipid A, the mixture CDCl3/CDOD/D2O (2:3:1, v/v) is ideal for NMR analyses of small lipid samples (51Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Res.

The proposed structure and conformation of the sugar is supported by its coupling constants and chemical shifts, summarized in Table II, which are in accord with a synthetic standard of l-Ara4N (57Naleway J.J.

The size and configuration of the polyisoprene chain are confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 7) and by the HMQC/HMBC analyses (Figs. 9 and 10).Reconstitution of the purified lipid donor with the cloned E. coli or S. typhimurium l-Ara4N transferase (ArnT) resulted in robust in vitro conversion of the precursor lipid-IVA to lipid-IIA (Fig. 11), a compound that contains a single l-Ara4N moiety on its 1-phosphate residue (50Raetz C.R.H.

Although dimerization between the two molecules is well established, very little is known concerning the trafficking of this heterodimer upon receptor activation. Also, the subcellular localization and biochemical state of this ubiquitously expressed protein, in the absence of CRLR, remains poorly characterized. Here we report that when expressed alone RAMP1 is retained inside the cells where it is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi predominantly as a disulfide-linked homodimer. In contrast, when expressed with CRLR, it is targeted to the cell surface as a 1:1 heterodimer with the 7TM protein. Although heterodimer formation does not involve intermolecular disulfide bonds, RAMP-CRLR association promotes the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds within RAMP1. CGRP binding and receptor activation lead to the phosphorylation of CRLR and the internalization of the receptor as a stable complex. The internalization was found to be both dynamin- and β-arrestin-dependent, indicating that the formation of a ternary complex between CRLR, RAMP1, and β-arrestin leads to clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis. These results therefore indicate that although atypical by its heterodimeric composition and its targeting to the plasma membrane, the CGRP receptor shares endocytotic mechanisms that are common to most classical 7TM receptors.

CRLR shares 55% amino acid sequence identity with the calcitonin receptor. Both belong to the family B of seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) receptor. The family also includes the receptors for parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone-related protein, secretin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (6Njuki F.

These small intrinsic membrane proteins share less than 30% of sequence identity and possess a large extracellular N terminus (∼100 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain, and a very short intracellular domain (10 amino acids) (5McLatchie L.M.

For instance, many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to undergo agonist-promoted internalization through classical dynamin-dependent endocytosis. In these cases, agonist-promoted phosphorylation of the receptor by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase has been shown to promote association with β-arrestin leading to endocytosis through its interaction with clathrin and the adaptor protein AP-2 (16Goodman Jr., O.B.

Some receptors, such as the V2-vasopressin receptor, internalize as a stable complex with β-arrestin while others, like the β2-adrenergic receptor, rapidly dissociate from the receptor upon internalization (20Zhang J.

Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). C-terminal β-arrestin2 (β-arrestin2)(319–418)) and the dominant-negative dynamin K44A subcloned in pcDNA3 were a generous gift from Dr. J. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Stable HEK293T cells expressing myc-RAMP1, HA-CRLR, myc-V2 vasopressin receptor or HA-β2-adrenergic receptor, were generated by neomycin selection (450 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) imposed on cells transfected with plasmids encoding each protein and the selection marker. Individual cell lines were cloned by limiting dilution and expression assessed by radioligand binding or Western blot.Transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (26Mellon P.L. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cells in 6-well plates or in 100-mm Petri dishes were grown to 70% confluency and transfected with the indicated plasmids. Experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection.Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Flow CytometryLabeling in Permeabilized CellsHEK293T cells stably expressing HA-CRLR or myc-RAMP1 were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.25% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% BSA). The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h. The following antibodies were used at 1:100: rabbit or mouse anti-myc, mouse anti-p58K, rat anti-HA, and rabbit anti-calnexin. The coverslips were then washed in blocking buffer and incubated in the same buffer with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies for visualization of myc-RAMP1 or HA-CRLR and Oregon Green-conjugated secondary antibodies for visualization of p58K or calnexin) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted onto slides using Airvol mounting media. Double labeling was viewed on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 Na oil immersion lens.Cell-surface LabelingHA-CRLR or empty vector were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells stably expressing myc-RAMP1. To determine cell-surface expression of both proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM/Hepes blocking buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA in DMEM) for 30 min on ice and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-myc and/or rat monoclonal anti-HA) diluted in DMEM/Hepes blocking buffer. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then prepared as described in the previous section using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies for visualization of myc-RAMP1 or Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rat antibodies for the detection of HA-CRLR.InternalizationHEK293T cells stably expressing HA-CRLR or myc-RAMP1 were transfected with RAMP1 and β-arrestin2-YFP or CRLR and β-arrestin2-YFP, respectively, whereas β-arrestin2-YFP alone was transiently transfected in cells stably expressing HA-β2-adrenergic or myc-V2 vasopressin receptors. After washes with PBS, cells were incubated in DMEM/Hepes blocking buffer for 30 min before adding rabbit anti-HA or mouse anti-myc antibodies in the same buffer for 1 h. The cells were then washed and treated with the appropriate agonist (100 nm CGRP, 100 nmarginine vasopressin, or 1 μm isoproterenol) for different times at 37 °C. The internalization process was stopped on ice and the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then prepared as before using the appropriate Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies for visualization of the receptors and RAMP1. The fluorescent antibodies and the β-arrestin2-YFP were visualized by confocal microscopy as above.Flow CytometryFollowing anti-myc antibody incubation as described above, HEK293T cells transfected with CRLR and myc-RAMP1 or myc-CRLR and RAMP1 were washed with PBS containing 0.2% BSA and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed again in PBS/BSA, detached using PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on a FACSTM calibur Becton-Dickson flow cytometer. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion and 10,000 cells were sorted in each experiment.ImmunoprecipitationTotal Extracts—Cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm Pefabloc, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin (lysis buffer) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was then initiated by adding mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody (clone 9E10) or rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10) to the supernatant. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G-Sepharose was added for an additional 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose·antibody·antigen complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with cold lysis buffer containing 150, 250, 350 and finally 150 mm NaCl. The final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4.5 m urea with or without 100 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) and prepared for Western blot analyses.Cell SurfaceCells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed three times in PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% BSA) for 1 h on ice. Whole cells were then incubated with anti-myc (9E10) or anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies (1:150 dilution) in blocking buffer on ice for 1 h, washed twice in blocking buffer and twice in PBS. After removing the free antibodies, the cells were lysed and prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above.Western Blot AnalysisProtein samples were resolved by 10 or 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibodies (1:8000 dilution), or rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (1:3000 dilution). Renaissance chemiluminescence kit was used for Western blot development.Covalent Cross-linking AnalysisCells expressing myc-CRLR, myc-RAMP1, or both were grown in 6-well plates, washed three times in cold PBS and incubated on ice for 1 h in PBS containing 1 mm BS3. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by incubation in PBS containing 25 mm glycine. Cells were then lysed and prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above using mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10).Whole Cell PhosphorylationFollowing an incubation of 1 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1% FCS, cells expressing myc-RAMP1 or myc-RAMP1 and myc-CRLR were incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free medium containing [32P]Pi (1.7 mCi/106cells) and treated with 100 nm CGRP for the indicated times. They were then solubilized in lysis buffer (see above) containing 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium phosphate and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was then performed as described above using monoclonal anti-myc antibody (9E10). Protein samples were resolved by 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They were transferred to nitrocellulose and [32P]Pi was detected with BioMax MR Kodak films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).CRLR-RAMP1 Complex InternalizationCells stably expressing myc-RAMP1 were transfected with myc-CRLR in combination with β-arrestin2, β-arrestin2(319–418), K44A dynamin I, or an empty vector. Following a 1 h incubation in serum-free media, cells were pretreated (or not) for 30 min with internalization inhibitor (0.5 m sucrose) and exposed to 100 nmCGRP for the indicated periods at 37 °C. The cells were then quickly chilled, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 1 mm BS3 for 1 h. For other experiments, crude membrane preparations were prepared as previously described (5McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar) and incubated in 1 mm DSG for 1 h. The reaction was stopped in PBS containing 25 mm glycine and the cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation and prepared for Western blot analyses as described above. Immunoreactivity was quantified by densitometry using chemiluminescence radiography and the results analyzed using the NIH Image 1.62 program. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)1 is a member of the calcitonin family of regulatory peptides (1Poyner D.R. Biochem. Soc.

Although a cDNA encoding the calcitonin receptor was cloned over 10 years ago (4Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R.

CRLR shares 55% amino acid sequence identity with the calcitonin receptor. Both belong to the family B of seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) receptor. The family also includes the receptors for parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone-related protein, secretin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (6Njuki F.

These small intrinsic membrane proteins share less than 30% of sequence identity and possess a large extracellular N terminus (∼100 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain, and a very short intracellular domain (10 amino acids) (5McLatchie L.M.

One of the roles proposed for these proteins is that of chaperone/escort promoting the cell surface targeting of CRLR (5McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R.

Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A characteristic feature of the recoverin family is the sequence CPXG that prevents the binding of Ca2+to the first EF-hand. Recently, a new member of the recoverin family variously named calsenilin (8Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), DREAM1 (9Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R.

Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) has been identified in the human brain and reported to have several biological functions. Calsenilin was first identified by the yeast two-hybrid system to interact with the C-terminal 40 residues of presenilin 2, a membrane protein genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease (8Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Calsenilin consists of 256 amino acids, and the C-terminal 190 residues are about 40% identical in amino acid sequence to frequenin, a representative protein of the recoverin family (Fig. 1). Recently, it has been reported that calsenilin reverses the presenilin-mediated enhancement of Ca2+ signaling (11Leissring M.A. Yamasaki T.R. Wasco W. Buxbaum J.D. Parker I. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8590-8593Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and that calsenilin is a substrate for caspase-3 that also interacts with the C-terminal region of presenilin 2 (12Choi E.K. Zaidi N.F. Miller J.S. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.M. Lilliehook C. Buxbaum J.D. Wasco W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19197-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein named DREAM was reported as the first Ca2+-regulated transcriptional repressor (9Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). DREAM represses the transcription of human prodynorphin and c-fosgenes in the brain by binding to the DRE only in the absence of calcium and derepresses the transcription at high Ca2+ levels. DREAM also binds to a silencer sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the apoptotic gene hrk and represses the expression of downstream reporter genes (13Sanz C. Mellstrom B. Link W.A. Naranjo J.R. Fernandez-Luna J.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2286-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The human DREAM protein was originally reported to consist of 284 residues (9Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), in which the C-terminal 256 residues are identical to calsenilin. A more recent study has revealed that the C-terminal 256 residues of DREAM are sufficient for the calcium-regulated transcriptional repression (14Ledo F. Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Ledo F. Link W.A. Carrion A.M. Echeverria V. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the precise length of the endogenous DREAM protein (284 versus256 residues) is still not known, and it is still unclear how DREAM recognizes the different DRE sequences of prodynorphin and c-fos. The potassium channel-interacting proteins KChIP1 and KChIP2 were identified by the yeast two-hybrid system to interact with the N-terminal 180 residues of A-type voltage-gated potassium (Kv4.2) channels (10An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). KChIP1 and KChIP2 also bind to intact Kv4.2 channels and activate channel kinetics only at high Ca2+ levels. Notably, the N-terminal 70 residues of KChIP1 and KChIP2 do not contribute significantly to the modulation of Kv4.2 channels. Interestingly, KChIP1 and KChIP2 are more than 70% identical in sequence to calsenilin (Fig. 1), and calsenilin was also shown to interact with Kv4.2 channels. Hence, calsenilin is also referred to as KChIP3. The single protein variously named calsenilin, DREAM, and KChIP3 appears to possess multiple functions in different compartments of the cell by regulating completely different target molecules. Calsenilin binds and regulates presenilin proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, calcium-free DREAM binds to DRE sequences of DNA in the cell nucleus, and calcium-bound KChIP3 may bind and activate Kv4.2 channels on the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is of particular interest to learn how this one protein can bind and recognize several different target molecules. Here we report the physicochemical characterization of the multifunctional protein calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 (referred to hereafter as DREAM) as an important step toward understanding its various mechanisms of target recognition. Furthermore, we have characterized the novel DNA binding properties of this protein, and we suggest a possible mechanism for Ca2+-regulated gene expression. The coding sequence of human calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1) containing calsenilin/DREAM cDNA using the primers 5′-CTAGGCCTCATATGCAGCCGGCTAAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGCCTCTCGAGGATGACATTCTCAAAC-3′. The resulting product was ligated into pET-22b(+) (Novagen) using the sites for NdeI andXhoI. The sequence was verified by sequencing. After the transformation of the construct into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene), the calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 protein with a 6×His tag at the C terminus was overexpressed as inclusion bodies. Strains were grown in 2 liters of LB media with 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm had reached 0.8, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.7 mm, and the culture was further incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted by French press at 900 p.s.i. Disruption by French press was repeated once. Cell debris and inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was suspended in wash buffer (1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer), homogenized, and sonicated, and the insoluble material was collected by centrifugation. This wash was repeated three times. The pellet from the last wash was suspended in guanidine buffer (6m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), homogenized, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the supernatant was applied onto a Talon (CLONTECH) column previously equilibrated in the guanidine buffer. After washing the column with the guanidine buffer, the protein was eluted with imidazole buffer (0.1 m imidazole in the guanidine buffer). The eluted solution was dialyzed versus refolding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) for 24 h. Then, 10 mm lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) was added to the sample, which was dialyzed versus LDAO buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm LDAO, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The sample was applied onto a DEAE column previously equilibrated in the LDAO buffer, and then it was eluted with NaCl gradient (0–0.3 m NaCl over 3 h at 2 ml/min). Further purification of DREAM was achieved using a size exclusion column (S-300 HR) with the LDAO buffer. Genes encoding mouse DREAM and its deletion mutants (residues 1–70, mut1–70; residues 1–96, mut1–96; residues 65–256, mut65–256) were inserted into pET15b (Novagen) expression vectors. These constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) cells and grown in 2 liters of LB media with 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. After the induction with 0.7 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cultures were incubated for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Tween 20, 20 µg/ml DNase I, 5 mm MgCl2, and 30 mg of lysozyme. Cell suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 1.5 h and then sonicated (Branson's Sonifier 450) on ice twice for 3 min at setting 10 with 10% duty cycle. Soluble protein fractions were recovered by centrifugation and loaded onto Talon (CLONTECH) beads previously equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A containing 15 mm imidazole, proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 0.15 m imidazole. The mut1–96 and mut65–256 samples were further purified for ITC experiments with DEAE column in the same way as human DREAM. Oligonucleotides used in this study represent DRE of human prodynorphin (DynDRE) and c-fos (c-fos DRE): DynDRE-1, 5′-GAAGCCGGAGTCAAGGAGGCCCCTG-3′; DynDRE-2, 5′-CAGGGGCCTCCTTGACTCCGGCTTC-3′; c-fos DRE-1, 5′-CTGCAGCGAGCAACTGAGAATCCAAGAC-3′; and c-fos DRE-2, 5′-GTCTTGGATTCTCAGTTGCTCGCTGCAG-3′. For ITC and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments, 10 µmol of each oligonucleotide was synthesized on a DNA synthesizer by the solid phase phosphoramidate method and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Zorbax oligonucleotide column (DuPont) using the volatile buffer containing 32 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.0) and 20% (v/v) acetonitrile with an NaCl gradient. After lyophilization of the eluted fractions, the sample was dissolved with 2 ml of H2O and desalted using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Desalted DNA was precipitated using EtOH/sodium acetate followed by evaporation of the solvent. Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 5′-labeled oligonucleotides used for fluorescent EMSA were purchased from ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Canada). The same sequences of DynDRE-1 and DynDRE-2 mentioned above were used. For competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides of DynDRE, the canonical AP-1 from the collagenase gene (cAP-1), 5′-AAGCTTGCATGACTCAGACAG-3′, and mutated unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides of human DynDRE (DREmut5, 5′-GAAGCCGGAATCAAGGAGGCCCCTG-3′; DREmut4, 5′-GAAGCCGGAAACAAGGAGGCCCCTG-3′; mutation shown in bold) were used as unlabeled competitors (16Carrion A.M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6921-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Complementary strands were dissolved in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), completely denatured at 95 °C, and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Formation of double-stranded DNA was checked on a 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide/0.25× Tris-borate EDTA/1% (v/v) glycerol gel before binding reactions. The concentrations were determined via UV spectrometry. The binding of45Ca2+ to DREAM was measured as the protein-bound radioactivity retained after ultrafiltration using a procedure described previously (17Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, DREAM (20 µm) in 1.6 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm LDAO, and 1 mm DTT was placed in the sample compartment of a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore), and 20 µl of 0.25 mm45CaCl2 (1 µCi) was added as a radioactive tracer. The sample was subjected to centrifugation (at 2000 rpm) in a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman model TJ-6) at room temperature for 30 s, forming 20 µl of filtrate. The radioactivity in the filtrate (free Ca2+) and the radioactivity in an equal volume of the protein sample (total Ca2+) were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Successive additions of nonradioactive Ca2+ were made to the protein sample, and the above-mentioned procedure was repeated. After each addition of nonradioactive ligand, the free Ca2+ concentration was calculated from the measured radioactivity as follows: Cafree2+=rarbCatotal2+Equation 1 where ra is the measured radioactivity of the filtrate, rb is radioactivity of protein sample, and Ca total2+ is the total Ca2+ concentration. The concentration of Ca2+ bound to protein is therefore Cabound2+=Catotal2+−Cafree2+Equation 2 Structural differences between the apo- and Ca2+-loaded form of DREAM and mut65–256 were investigated by CD spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The protein concentration was 5–10 µm dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA for apo-DREAM. After the measurement for the apo-protein, the small amount of 1 m CaCl2solution was injected to the sample, giving a final Ca2+concentration of 5 mm for the Ca2+-loaded form. CD spectra were measured on a J-720 CD spectropolarimeter (JASCO) at 25 °C. A cell path length of 1 mm was used. Each spectrum was collected with eight scans spanning wavelengths from 195 to 250 nm. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer (Instruments S.A., Inc.). Excitation and emission were at 295 and 310–440 nm, respectively. The molecular mass of DREAM was examined by DLS using DynaPro-MS (Protein Solutions) at 25 °C. First, screening for a good condition to give a monomodal distribution was carried out using 30–50 µm DREAM in various buffers. 0.1 ml of each sample was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and passed through a filtering assembly containing a 0.1 µm filter into a 12-µl chamber quartz cuvette. At least 15 measurements were repeated. The data were analyzed using Dynamics 4.0 and DynaLS software as described by Moradian-Oldaket al. (18Moradian-Oldak J. Leung W. Fincham A.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The samples for the experiments examining concentration dependence of the molecular mass were prepared by dilution of the protein stock solutions previously dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm LDAO, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA or 5 mmCaCl2 for apo- and Ca2+-DREAM, respectively. The samples diluted with the dialysis buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C before the DLS experiments. Determination of the molecular mass of the purified DREAM and mut65–256 in the Ca2+-bound and unbound form in solution was carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C in the buffers containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm LDAO, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mmCaCl2 for Ca2+-DREAM or 1 mm EDTA for apo-DREAM. Separate aliquots (0.1 ml) of DREAM (8.7 and 87 µm) and mut65–256 (87 µm) were loaded onto the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Apparent molecular masses were calculated using a standard curve ofVe/V0versus the log of the molecular masses of standard proteins (β-amylase, 200 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; transferrin, 81 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; and myoglobin, 17 kDa). V0 is a void volume obtained using blue dextran (2000 kDa), andVe is a volume of elution. Binding of DREAM to DynDRE and c-fos DRE was measured by ITC (19Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar) using a MicroCal VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The protein and DNA samples were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm LDAO, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA for the Ca2+-bound and unbound form, respectively. Experiments were performed at 35 °C. A stock solution of DREAM (525–560 µm) was titrated by injection of a total of 290 µl of 15–25 µm DNA in 29 aliquots. Heats of dilution were determined by titrating DREAM into the dialysis buffer and subtracted from the raw titration data before data analysis using MicroCal Origin version 5.0 provided by the manufacturer. Because the observed binding isotherm appeared multiphasic, the data were analyzed using a two-site binding model, resulting in the best fit of thermodynamic parameters to the titration. Binding of mut1–96 and mut65–256 to DynDRE was also measured in the same way. Proteins were exchanged firstly to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA using PD-10 columns and concentrated to 115 µm(mut1–70), 330 µm (mut65–256), and 80 µm(full length) by Centricon 3 or 10 (Millipore) at 4 °C. Proteins were then incubated with 5 nm Cy5-labeled DNA for 5 h at room temperature in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.005 unit/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without 10 mm CaCl2. Protein·DNA complexes were resolved in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide/0.25× Tris-borate EDTA/1% (v/v) glycerol gels at 200 V for 30 min in 0.25× Tris-borate EDTA and 0.5 mmMgCl2 running buffer. Wet fluorescent gels were scanned using red fluorescence mode of a Storm 860 system (Molecular Dynamics) with a voltage setting of 1000 V and a scanning resolution of 200 µm. For DNA competition experiments, a 15-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded competitive oligonucleotides was added to competition assays of wild type or mut65–256, and a 65-fold excess of unlabeled DNA was added to the competition assays of mut1–70 1 h before further incubation with the labeled oligonucleotides. DREAM contains an N-terminal basic region (residues 1–65) and a C-terminal Ca2+-binding region (residues 70–256) containing four EF-hand motifs that are similar in sequence to the Ca2+-binding sites found in calmodulin, troponin C, and recoverin. Like other members of the recoverin family (Fig. 1), the first EF-hand from the N terminus (EF-1) of DREAM contains substitutions (Cys-104 and Pro-105) that are expected to disrupt the structure of this binding loop and prevent Ca2+ binding to EF-1, as seen in the crystal structures of recoverin (20Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), neurocalcin (21Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and frequenin (22Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V.V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine whether this structural prediction is correct and to assess how many Ca2+ ions bind to DREAM, direct measurements of Ca2+ binding were performed. Equilibrium measurements of 45Ca2+ binding were conducted on DREAM (Fig. 2). At saturation, three Ca2+ ions bind to the protein, consistent with the view that EF-1 is disabled, whereas EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4 are functional. These three functional binding sites are also consistent with previous mutagenesis studies (9Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Ledo F. Link W.A. Carrion A.M. Echeverria V. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fractional saturation (Y), which can be obtained from the data, can be represented by the Hill equation: Y=Ca2+aCa2+a+KdaEquation 3 where (Ca2+) is the free Ca2+concentration, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, and a denotes the Hill coefficient. From the analysis of the Ca2+ binding data (Fig. 2), DREAM binds three Ca2+ ions with a dissociation constant of 14 µm and a Hill coefficient value of 0.7. The Hill slope (<1.0) and multiphasic Scatchard plot (data not shown) suggest heterogeneous binding of Ca2+ and that the three binding sites may have markedly different intrinsic affinities. If the three sites are independent, then the fractional saturation expression simplifies to Y=Ca2+Ca2++KEF2+Ca2+Ca2++KEF3+Ca2+Ca2++KEF4Equation 4 where KEF2 represents the dissociation constant for EF-2, and so forth. The binding data for DREAM are well fit by this equation if KEF3 =KEF4 = 5 µm andKEF2 = 50 µm, assuming that EF-2 represents the site with weaker affinity. EF-2 contains an aspartate residue (Asp-150) instead of the required glutamate at the 12 position of the calcium-binding loop. The substitution of aspartate for glutamate at residue 150 should dramatically weaken the calcium binding affinity of this site (Fig. 1). Likewise, in recoverin and yeast frequenin, EF-2 was shown to bind Ca2+ with much lower affinity than EF-3 and EF-4 (17Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ to the EF-hand motifs promotes global structural changes throughout the DREAM protein. As a means to demonstrate the Ca2+-induced structural transitions, we examined the effect of Ca2+ on the circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence properties of the protein. The far UV CD spectrum of DREAM indicates a typical pattern of α-helical EF-hand proteins containing negative peaks at 222 and 208 nm (data not shown). The negative peaks in the CD spectrum become more pronounced upon the addition of Ca2+, suggesting that Ca2+ binding causes a slight increase in the helical content of DREAM and rearrangement of preexisting EF-hand helices relative to each other, similar to that found in other known EF-hand proteins (24Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of full-length DREAM and an N-terminal deletion mutant of mouse DREAM (residues 65–256, mut65–256) are presented in Fig. 3. The full-length DREAM protein contains three tryptophan residues (Trp-32, Trp-50, and Trp-169), whereas mut65–256 has only Trp-169. The fluorescence emission of tryptophan in these spectra is very sensitive to its surrounding chemical environment and hence provides an effective probe of structural changes in the protein (25Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry: Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, CA1982: 537-572Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectrum of mut65–256 in the absence of Ca2+ exhibits an emission maximum at 345 nm, which is shifted to 340 nm upon the addition of saturating amounts of Ca2+. This blue shift in the spectrum indicates a Ca2+-induced structural change in the protein that causes Trp-169 to reside in a more hydrophobic environment in the Ca2+-bound protein. The fluorescence spectrum of the full-length protein exhibits an emission intensity maximum at 347 nm in the absence of Ca2+, whereas the emission maximum is shifted less than 2 nm upon Ca2+ binding to DREAM. These spectra represent the average emission from three tryptophan residues (Trp-32, Trp-50, and Trp-169). Taking into account the Ca2+-induced blue shift of Trp-169 (Fig. 3), the emission from Trp-32 and/or Trp-50 must therefore undergo a Ca2+-induced red shift, suggesting that Trp-32 and/or Trp-50 may occupy a more polar environment in the Ca2+-bound state. Thus, Ca2+ binding may promote an allosteric structural change in the N-terminal region that may increase the solvent accessibility of Trp-32 and/or Trp-50. This change in solvent accessibility may be explained in part by the Ca2+-induced change in oligomerization state of DREAM as described below. Initial DLS studies performed on DREAM (in the absence of detergent) indicated a very broad distribution of hydrodynamic radii, suggesting that the protein solution was polydisperse due to the formation of heterogeneously aggregated species. An extensive screening of various solvent conditions (pH, ionic strength, and detergent) was performed using 50–100 µm DREAM. The addition of detergent (10 mmLDAO) with low salt concentration (<20 mm KCl) at pH 7–8 resulted in a protein solution with a monomodal distribution of the molecular mass of DREAM without any aggregation. These conditions were subsequently used throughout this study. DLS experiments performed at a variety of protein concentrations were carried out on both apo-DREAM and Ca2+-DREAM. Because the DLS data included light scattering contributions from both protein and the LDAO micelles, a multidispersive model was applied in DynaLS software to fit the observed DLS data at a resolution of 1.0. This analysis enabled the light scattering contribution from the DREAM protein (hydrodynamic radius of 4–5 nm) to be completely resolved from the scattering that corresponded to the LDAO micelle size (hydrodynamic radius of 2.0 nm). Hence, the multidispersive analysis enabled us to accurately extract the size of the"
https://openalex.org/W2077528796,"The sex-determining factor SRY is a DNA-binding protein that diverts primordial gonads from the ovarian pathway toward male differentiation to form testes. It gains access to the nucleus through two distinct nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that flank the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain, but the mechanisms through which these NLSs operate have not been studied. In this study, we reconstitute the nuclear import of SRY in vitro, demonstrating a lack of requirement for exogenous factors for nuclear accumulation and a significant reduction in nuclear transport in the presence of antibodies to importin β but not importin α. Using a range of quantitative binding assays including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence polarization, and native gel mobility electrophoresis, we assess the binding of importins to SRY, demonstrating a high affinity recognition (in the low nmrange) by Impβ independent of Impα. In assessing the contribution of each NLS, we found that the N-terminal NLS was recognized poorly by importins, whereas the C-terminal NLS was bound by importin β with similar affinity to SRY. We also found that RanGTP, but not RanGDP, could dissociate the SRY-importin β complex in solution using FP. We describe a novel double-fluorescent label DNA binding assay to demonstrate mutual exclusivity between importin β recognition and DNA binding on the part of SRY, which may represent an alternative release mechanism upon nuclear entry. This study represents the first characterization of the nuclear import pathway for a HMG domain-containing protein. Importantly, it demonstrates for the first time that recognition of SRY by Impβ is of comparable affinity to that with which Impα/β recognizes conventional NLS-containing substrates. The sex-determining factor SRY is a DNA-binding protein that diverts primordial gonads from the ovarian pathway toward male differentiation to form testes. It gains access to the nucleus through two distinct nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that flank the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain, but the mechanisms through which these NLSs operate have not been studied.

Although the autosomal and X chromosomes carry genes required for basic structural and functional development in both sexes, the Y chromosome carries the specific genes for male sexual development. SRY1 (sex-determining region Y) is a DNA-binding protein encoded on the Y chromosome and acts as a genetic switch that diverts primordial gonads from the ovarian pathway toward male differentiation to form testes (1Goodfellow P.N.

The DNA binding domain of SRY consists of a single high mobility group (HMG) box located centrally within the protein (6Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1990; 346: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). The HMG box, conserved across the HMG-1/HMG-2 family, consists of around 80 residues and binds within the minor groove of DNA (7Wagner C.R. Hamana K. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell.

Although HMG-1 and HMG-2 bind DNA with little or no sequence specificity, SRY has been reported to bind specifically to an eight-base pair recognition sequence within the MIS promoter (5Haqq C.M.

By binding the minor groove of DNA, SRY induces a large conformational change through helix unwinding, minor groove expansion, and DNA bending (12Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11998-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is believed to be the molecular switch that allows distantly bound proteins of the transcription machinery to attain close proximity, thereby permitting interaction in a way that can influence transcription (12Werner M.H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11998-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SRY nuclear import is believed to be mediated by two distinct nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that flank the HMG box, the N-terminal bipartite NLS (KRPMNAFIVWSRdqRRK77) and the monopartite C-terminal NLS (RPRRKAK136), both of which are able to act independently to target β-galactosidase to the nucleus (14Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Protein targeting to the nucleus is mediated by a family of transporters or cytosolic receptor proteins known as importins (karyopherins) (15Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Imamoto N. Kamei Y. Yoneda Y. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 9-20PubMed Google Scholar, 17Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar), which work in concert with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ran and other regulatory proteins. In conventional NLS-dependent nuclear protein import, importin α (Impα) recognizes the NLS and acts as an adapter to mediate binding of importin β1 (Impβ) (17Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar). The latter then mediates docking of the Impα-NLS-containing protein complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) followed by energy-dependent translocation through the NPC (18Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). RanGTP dissociates the complex in the nucleus by binding to Impβ, and the individual importins are recycled back to the cytoplasm (19Dasso M. Pu R.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that transcription factors (TFs) may localize in the nucleus through this NLS-dependent importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport pathway, however, is essentially restricted to inducible TFs such as those of the nuclear factor NF-κB and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) families (21Nadler S.G.

Several proteins have recently been shown to be imported into the nucleus through pathways independent of Impα that are mediated by a range of different Impβ homologs. In these pathways, the Impβ homolog recognizes the targeting signal of the transport substrate directly (24Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H.

In contrast, Impβ2 (transportin) appears to be largely responsible for the transport of hnRNPs (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) into and out of the nucleus (25Pollard V.W. Michael W.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), where Impβ1 itself, independent of Impα, binds the nuclear import substrates directly. In the case of PTHrP, the ability of Impβ1 to function in nuclear import independently of Impα has been shown directly by reconstituting nuclear transport in vitro using purified, bacterially expressed components (40Lam M.H.

In this study, we characterize the nuclear import properties of SRY for the first time, demonstrating a requirement for Impβ but not Impα. Using a range of binding assays including ELISA, fluorescence polarization (FP), and native gel electrophoresis, we report high affinity binding of Impβ to SRY(HMG) but only weak association of the conventional NLS receptor Impα. We show that nm affinity interaction of SRY with Impβ is mediated by the C-terminal NLS and that the association can be disrupted by RanGTPγS but not by RanGDP. We also use a novel double-fluorescent label gel mobility shift assay to demonstrate mutual exclusivity of DNA-binding and Impβ recognition. This study thus represents the first characterization of the nuclear import pathway of an HMG domain-containing TF with the mutual exclusivity of DNA and Impβ binding suggesting a possible role for the former in dissociating the transport complex within the nucleus. DNA encoding the HMG domain of SRY (residues 57–136) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to include terminalNheI restriction sites and cloned into the uniqueNheI site of pTRCAgfp (41Lixin R. Efthymiadis A. Henderson B. Jans D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to encode a 35-kDa SRY(HMG)-GFP fusion protein. The directionality and fidelity of the insert was verified by sequencing. Host strain BL21 was grown at 28 °C until mid-log phase, whereupon SRY(HMG)-GFP was over-expressed by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 8 h at 28 °C. The bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in His buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant incubated with 2 ml of pre-washed nickel-nitrilotetraacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific proteins were removed by washing the matrix with His buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, after which the SRY(HMG)-GFP was eluted from the column by incubation with His buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. SRY(HMG)-GFP was then exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. Nuclear import was analyzed at the single cell level using mechanically perforated rat HTC hepatoma tissue culture cells in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy (40Lam M.H. Briggs L.J.

Experiments were performed in a 5-μl volume containing transport substrate (1 μm SRY(HMG)-GFP), a control 70-kDa Texas Red-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes) to assess nuclear integrity, bovine serum albumin (45 mg/ml), and intracellular buffer (final concentration 30 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EGTA, 0.03 mm CaCl2, 24 mm HEPES).

In inhibition experiments, antibodies (40 μg/ml) specific to mImpα or mImpβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), wheat germ agglutinin (10 mg/ml), or CHAPS (0.025%) were also included. The plasmid vector pT7-7 encoding the SRY(HMG) domain was transformed into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3), and expression was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1× HED buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm DDT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mmAEBSF), sonicated, and NaCl added to a final concentration of 0.45m. A 50% slurry of DEAE-Sephadex was added, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. The supernatant was filtered through an 0.8-mm polyvinylidene difluoride/non-protein-binding filter prior to fast protein liquid chromatography and diluted 2.25-fold, and the sample was purified using an SP-Sepharose column. SRY(HMG) was eluted using a salt gradient at 800 mm NaCl and subsequently stored at −70 °C.

The latter were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of importins, and detection of bound importin-GST was performed using a goat anti-GST primary antibody, an alkaline phosphatase-coupled rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody, and the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance measurements were performed over a period of 90 min using a plate reader (Molecular Devices), with values corrected by subtracting absorbance both at 0 min and in wells incubated without importin. Data were fitted to the function B/B max = [K d + x + p − √{(−K d − x −p)2 − 4px}]/2p(51Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal.

Probes containing specific DNA-binding recognition sequences (underlined) for SRY were prepared by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides SRY Top, 5′-GAT CGC GTC GAC GAA ACA ATG ATC GAT C-3′, and SRY Bottom, 5′-GAT CGA TCG ATC ATT GTT TCG TCG ACG C-3′. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were then purified by electrophoresis, and the concentration estimated from absorbance measurements. Probes were end-labeled using the Texas Red dCTP-Texas Red labeling kit (Bio-Rad), and unincorporated dye was removed by ethanol precipitation. SRY binding interactions with the probe were assessed by incubating 1 μm SRY(HMG)-GFP with 0.1 μm labeled probe in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.8 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol, 1.5% sucrose) at room temperature for 15 min before electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was visualized on a Fuji-Film FLA3000 gel imaging system, and results were quantified using ImageGauge software. Where appropriate, 3 μm of importins were pre-incubated with SRY(HMG)-GFP at room temperature for 15 min before the addition of the DNA probe, or a 10-fold excess of unlabeled DNA was included. For mobility shift assays involving protein-protein interactions, 1 μm SRY(HMG)-GFP was incubated with 3000–25 nm importins for 20 min prior to electrophoresis as described above.

The NLS residues of SRY comprised residues 57–80 (N-NLS) and 120–138 (C-NLS); the PTHrP NLS peptide spanned residues 67–94 of PTHrP and the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T-ag) NLS peptide residues 110–132: SRY(N-NLS),57QDRVKRPMNAFIVWSRDQRRKMAL; SRY(C-NLS),120HREKYPNYKYRPRRKAKMLGC; PTHrP NLS,67LTQETNKVETYKEQPLKTPGKKKKGKPG; T-ag NLS,110PGSDDEAAADAQHAAPPKKKRKV.

When plane polarized light is used to excite a fluorophore, molecules in which the absorption oscillators are orientated parallel to the direction of polarization will be excited preferentially. The polarized components of the emission can be used to calculate an anisotropy value, A = (I∥ − I⊥)/ (I∥ + 2I⊥), which is dependent on the rotational mobility of the fluorophore, which in turn relates directly to its size; therefore, larger fluorophores (with lower rotational mobility) exhibit higher anisotropy values under constant buffer conditions. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements (52Weber G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1953; 8: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 53Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol.

Excitation was at 490 nm, and light emitted from the fluorophore was collected after passage through a 533 nm cut-off filter. For each assay, SRY(HMG)-GFP or CREB-GFP was diluted to a final concentration of 30 nm in phosphate-buffered saline, and anisotropy changes were monitored as aliquots of importin (1–1000 nm), Ran (133 nm), or peptides (1 μm) were added successively. Results for changes in anisotropy were fitted to the equation A = [K d + x + p − √{(−K d −x − p)2 − 4px}]/2p (51Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), where x is the total concentration of probe (free and bound importins),p is the total concentration of protein, andK d (the apparent dissociation constant) is the concentration of importin resulting in half-maximal binding. For SRY to perform its role as a remodeling factor, it must first gain access to the nucleus. SRY possesses two NLSs at the proximal ends of the HMG-DNA binding domain (14Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), both of which have been shown to be sufficient for targeting a carrier protein to the nucleus. The import pathways, however, through which these NLSs target SRY to the nucleus have not been characterized. We set out to determine the mechanism by which SRY is targeted to the nucleus. To examine the nuclear import properties for SRY, we fused the coding sequence of the HMG-DNA binding domain of SRY containing both C- and N-terminal NLSs to that of GFP (see “Material and Methods”). The encoded SRY(HMG)-GFP protein was expressed in bacteria, purified, and confirmed for DNA binding activity in gel mobility shift assays (see also Fig. 7). Nuclear import was assessed using an in vitro nuclear transport assay in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy (42Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J.

We found that SRY(HMG)-GFP accumulated in the nucleus in the absence or presence of exogenously added cytosol, indicating a lack of a requirement for the latter (Fig. 1,top panels). To test the possibility that SRY(HMG)-GFP accumulated in the nucleus simply through its ability to diffuse through the NPC and bind to nuclear components, we performed the nuclear transport assay in the presence of the nuclear envelope-permeabilizing agent, CHAPS (43Efthymiadis A.

Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 2Sanders J. Oda Y. Roberts S.A. Maruyama M. Furmaniak J. Smith B.R.

North Am. 2000; 29: 267-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also suggests that the TSHR may be present on several nonthyroidal tissues, suggesting additional signaling roles. Whereas similar in sequence to other glycoprotein hormone receptors, such as those for luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, the TSHR also has unique features. These include two “inserts” of 8 and 50 residues within the large ectodomain (4Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and proteolysis (cleavage) of the TSH holoreceptor into two disulfide-linked subunits: TSHR-α, comprising most of the ectodomain, and TSHR-β, comprising the seven-transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic tail of this G protein-coupled receptor (5Rees S.B. McLachlan S.M. Furmaniak J. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 6Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). While the majority of TSHRs isolated from thyroid tissue are cleaved, there is less cleavage in nonthyroidal cells expressing TSHR cDNA, due to an apparently lower processing efficiency (7Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An additional source of diversity was suggested by our detection of dimeric and multimeric, disulfide-linked receptor isoforms in detergent-solubilized thyroid membranes (8Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Graves P. Pristker A. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1999; 84: 2177-2181Google Scholar), a finding which prompted the present investigation. These observations pointed to the dynamic nature of the TSHR and suggested that, despite the paucity of TSHRs on thyrocytes (∼5000/cell) (5Rees S.B. McLachlan S.M. Furmaniak J. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), the fluidity of the plasma membrane may allow coalescence and interaction of individual receptors, as seen in many other G protein-coupled receptor systems (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Horvat R.D. Nelson S. Clay C.M. Barisas B.G. Roess D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further explore TSHR dynamics in real time, we chose to express the receptor as a fusion protein linked at its carboxyl terminus with green fluorescent protein (TSHR-GFP). When expressed in CHO cells, the fusion protein was translocated to the plasma membrane and retained TSHR function, allowing us to use this as a model system for tracking movements of the receptor within the membrane. A further application involved tagging with color variants of GFP to examine receptor proximity,i.e. whether individual receptors were close enough for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). This proved to be the case, suggesting molecular interaction of juxtaposed TSHRs in the membrane. Direct evidence for such interaction was obtained by co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged and Myc-tagged TSHRs from co-transfected CHO cell membranes by Myc antibody. The mobility and molecular interactions of TSHRs in this model system were, therefore, consistent with detection of covalently linked TSHR complexes in thyroid-derived extracts. A sequence-verified human TSHR cDNA cloned into pSVL (courtesy Dr G.Vassart, Brussels) was used as the parent plasmid. A 500-base pair fragment encoding the TSHR carboxyl end and lacking the stop codon was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using forward (5′-GTGAAGATCTACATCACAGT-3; BglII site underlined) and reverse (5′-CTAGGGATCCAAAACCGTTTGCATATACTC3; BamHI site underlined) oligonucleotides. This fragment was then ligated into pSVL-hTSHR from which the BglII/BamHI fragment (containing the stop codon) had been excised to make pSVL-hTSHR lacking the stop codon. The hTSHR insert lacking the stop codon was then released using 5′ XhoI/3′ BamHI digestion from amplified plasmid and ligated in-frame into the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to give TSHR-GFP, encoding the fusion protein with GFP on the carboxyl end. TSHR-YFP and TSHR-RFP constructs were made in a similar way for FRET studies. Likewise for TSHR tagged at the carboxyl end with c-myc epitope in pCDNA 3.1/Myc-His(−)B vector (Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 per well in 24-well plates. Transfections were performed the following day using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). All transfections were split after 48 h and selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (neomycin sulfate). Stable clones obtained from the above transfection were further purified by cell sorting; high expressing clones were selected and maintained in the above medium. In brief, 0.3 × 106 cells/well TSHR-GFP were seeded into 4-well pretreated chamber slides (Labtek) and incubated overnight in 1 ml of Ham's F-12 complete medium. Adherent cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C with different amounts of bovine TSH. Then each well was treated with 10 mm sodium azide in PBS for 3 min at room temperature and the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. To quantify capping efficiency, five microscopic fields containing 200–300 cells were scored in each well. A cell was scored as “capped” only if the cross-linked receptor was present on less than half of the cell surface. The “capping percentage” was calculated by dividing the number of capped cells by total number of cells in all five fields multiplied by 100. Capping in samples exposed to inhibitor was expressed as a percentage of capping in the control cells. Digitized images were acquired using an Olympus Provis AX70 microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software was used to enhance image contrasts. To determine whether TSHR-GFP receptors were functional, production of cAMP in response to bovine TSH was evaluated using the Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, 30,000 cells/well were seeded in microtiter plates and after 48 h of growth the cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of TSH for 1 h at 37 °C and then lysed. Intracellular cAMP was measured in the lysate as per the manufacturer. To evaluate the binding efficiency of TSH to the GFP-tagged receptors, 5 × 104 of TSHR-GFP cells were plated per well in microtiter plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The confluent cells were washed three times with ice-cold modified Hank's solution. To the wells, 50 μl of Hank's solution was added followed by 50 μl of TSH of increasing concentration. This was followed immediately by the addition of 100 μl of 125I-TSH (mean cpm of 13,625) per well. The cells were incubated for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with Hank's solution, and lysed using 1 m NaOH (200 μl/well). Released radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter. A stock solution (1 mg/ml) of the lipophilic tracer carbocyanine (CM-DiI, Molecular Probes, Orlando, FL) was prepared in dimethylformamide. Immediately before labeling, a working dilution of 1 μg/ml was prepared in Dulbecco's balanced salt solution. This was then added to cells grown on slides, incubated for 2–3 min at 37 °C, and immediately shifted to 4 °C for an additional 10 min. To stop the reaction the cells were treated with 10 mm sodium azide and fixed as described above. TSHR-GFP cells were grown on chamber slides as described previously. The cells were then washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated with 105 microunits/ml TSH and 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by treating the cells with 10 mmsodium azide followed by fixation. FRET was performed on fused cells. Stable clones of TSHR-YFP and TSHR-RFP cells were harvested by treatment with 1 mm EDTA/EGTA for 10 min at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4. Then 1.2 × 106 cells from each of the above clones were mixed and pelleted by low speed centrifugation (1200 rpm, 5 min at room temperature). The pellet was then treated with 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG molecular weight 1300–1600; Sigma) added dropwise and cells allowed to fuse for 1 min at room temperature (12Martin A. Platzer M. Davies T.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 60: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The fused cells were then washed extensively and seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells in DeltaTC3 controlled culture dishes for live cell imaging (Bioptech) using confocal microscopy. Since the excitation wavelengths of YFP (513 nm) and RFP (558 nm) are close, optimization of the confocal settings was performed to prevent cross-talk between YFP and RFP during FRET image collection. This was achieved by exciting the YFP using 488 nm and setting the window at 5% of the excitation wavelength. RFP was excited using 556 nm and setting the excitation window at 80%. Membranes were prepared from test and control cells as described previously (13Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, a stable double-transfected CHO (TSHR-GFP:TSHR-myc) clone (tested previously for expression of GFP by fluorescence and c-Myc by flow cytometry) was expanded and cells were detached using 1 mm EDTA/EGTA and collected by centrifugation. PBS-washed cell pellets were incubated on ice for 20 min with 0.2% digitonin in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN.) Following centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min, cell pellets were treated with lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% digitonin, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then centrifuged in a refrigerated Microfuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing solubilized receptors were used either directly for immunoprecipitation or stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation 200 μg of protein in PBS containing 0.5% digitonin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors was first reacted overnight with 1 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C followed by 3 h incubation with Protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% digitonin, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (see below). SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were eluted from Protein A-agarose using a 2-fold concentrated sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 4% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% dried skimmed milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) and then probed with 1 μg/ml primary antibody (anti-GFP peptide (CLONTECH) or anti-Myc) for 1 h at room temperature in 5% milk, PBST. Washed membranes were then incubated with 1:3000 of secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h at room temperature. After final washing bound secondary antibodies were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal ECL Kit-Pierce, IL). The hTSHR fragment lacking its stop codon was ligated to the 5′ end of GFP fromAequorea victoria to generate TSHR-GFP (Fig.1 A). CHO cells transfected with TSHR-GFP, or with control GFP vector lacking TSHR, were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). Anti-GFP peptide antibody recognized a 27-kDa protein band from control cells (lanes 1) corresponding to the size of GFP. By contrast, detection of band close to 130-kDa band and a higher band in TSHR-GFP cells (lane 2) corresponded to the TSH holoreceptor fused to GFP. Bands of 60–90 kDa seen in the same lane may have resulted from partial proteolysis. Untransfected cells showed only nonspecific bands (not shown). Representative confocal microscopic images of TSHR-GFP cells are shown in Fig. 2. A highly localized peripheral fluorescence (Fig. 2 A) indicated surface membrane localization. This was shown to include specific staining of surface membranes using a red carbocyanine lipophilic dye CM-DiI. Co-localization of the red dye with the green GFP fluorescence at the surface membrane gave a yellow color (Fig. 2 B, upper right). The total absence of such yellow membrane staining in the control cells (Fig. 2 B, lower right) indicated cytoplasmic localization of GFP when not paired with the TSHR. Plasma membrane fluorescence was generally uniform, although some cells showed a more punctate fluorescence. No fluorescence was detected in the nucleus. In contrast, the fluorescence distribution in control cells was diffuse in both the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 2 B). This was consistent with GFP protein not localized to any particular intracellular compartment (15John S.A. Monck J.R. Weiss J.N. Ribalet B. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Autofluorescence was not detected in untransfected cells observed under the same experimental conditions (not shown). The level of cell surface expression of TSHR-GFP was determined by flow cytometry using either direct GFP fluorescence or indirectly using a monoclonal TSHR antibody. Fig.3 A shows the expression of COOH-terminal labeled fusion protein using GFP fluorescence in unsorted cells, and panel B shows the same cells stained with a TSHR- α subunit antibody. The difference in positivity of ∼20% by the antibody staining in contrast to the GFP fluorescence (panel A) showed the ability of the antibody to stain more TSHR-α subunits on the cell surface in a heterogenous population of GFP expressing cells. To determine whether the TSHR in TSHR-GFP was functional, TSH-dependent intracellular cAMP release was investigated using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. Responses were measured in the presence and absence of bovine TSH on TSHR-GFP cells and controls lacking TSHR. An untagged full-length TSHR construct served as the positive control. TSHR-GFP cells stimulated with 105microunits/ml of TSH showed a 10-fold increase of cAMP release as compared with the baseline levels in the control cells (Fig.4). The sensitivity of the response of TSHR-GFP cells to TSH was approximately one log less than that in the positive (TSHR without GFP) controls (Fig. 4, inset). To ascertain if this difference in cAMP responses of TSHR-GFP was due to its ability to bind TSH, the inhibition of TSH binding was performed. TSH-GFP cells and the untagged receptor cells had very similar binding characteristics. The calculated Kd values were 10−9.6m for TSHR-GFP cells and 10−11m for the untagged receptor. Taken together these data demonstrated the integrity of folding, trafficking, and signaling of the receptor in TSHR-GFP cells. It has previously been shown that fluorescently labeled TSH, when incubated with thyroidal cells in culture, formed visible patches on the cell surfaces which were internalized and subsequently degraded (16Avivi A. Tramontano D. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 25: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data suggested clustering of ligand-receptor complexes. Clustering of receptors, or “capping,” has been reported for many receptors, and was sometimes induced by ligand binding (17Hoover R.L. Dawidowicz E.A. Robinson J.M. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Podesta E.J. Solano A.R. Attar R. Sanchez M.L. Vedia L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, trafficking of TSH receptors has been shown by using radiolabeled TSH and gold-conjugated anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies in thyroid and nonthyroidal cells (19Baratti-Elbaz C. Ghinea N. Lahuna O. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1751-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study direct examination of receptor dynamics on the surface of living cells was possible using TSHR-GFP cells. Incubation of these cells for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of TSH aggregated the receptors into concentrated patches (Fig. 5 panels B and C). TSH-induced receptor clustering was time and dose-dependent. It was first apparent at 3 min, peaked at 15 min, and returned to near normal levels 45 min post-stimulation (not shown). The minimum dose of TSH required to induce capping was 100 microunits/ml (Fig. 5, panel A). Capping at different concentrations of TSH correlated well with the cAMP response. A one-to-one linear correlation was seen between cAMP production and capping in the range between 103 and 105microunits/ml of TSH, and 103 microunits/ml of TSH induced maximum capping and maximum cAMP response in these cells. To ensure that the observed clustering of TSHR-GFP cells was not due to endocytosis of receptors from the cell surface, TSHR-GFP cells stimulated with 10 × 103 microunits/ml of TSH were simultaneously treated with labeled transferrin (Alexa-595; Molecular Probes, Orlando) as a marker for endocytosis. A paraformaldehyde-fixed preparation of cells, incubated 15 min at 37 °C with both agents, is shown in Fig. 6. The absence of co-localization (Fig. 6 B) of Alexa-labeled transferrin (red) with the GFP (green) in the capped cells, when observed under dual filter sets, clearly indicated that the capping seen in these cells was not associated with endocytosis of surface receptors.Figure 6Capping versusendocytosis. TSHR-GFP cells grown on slides were subjected to TSH (10,000 microunits/ml), labeled transferrin (1 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, and fixed with 2% paraformladehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde. Panel A shows several capped cells observed using the GFP excitation wavelength only. Panel B shows the same cells viewed under both GFP and rhodamine excitation wavelengths (dual filter set). The absence of any yellow color clearly distinguished capped receptors from endosomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Studies have shown that there are two distinct stages in the capping phenomenon. In patching, the receptors are cross-linked by the ligand which leads to the clustering of the receptor. The receptor patches thus formed become anchored to the submembranous actin-based cytoskeleton. Subsequently, the patches are translocated toward the cap region in an actomyosin-dependent process (20Haverstick D.M. Sakai H. Gray L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C916-C926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the capping of TSHR-GFP cells was due to the movement of capped receptors in an actomyosin-dependent manner, we inhibited actin filament movement with cytochalasin D, which binds to actin filaments and destroys the cytoskeletal architecture. Inhibition of capping by cytochalasin D was dose-dependent and 40% of the cells were inhibited from capping at 5 μg/ml. These observations implied that cap formation in TSHR-GFP cells was due to the movement of receptors by actomyosin filaments. There was no inhibition of capping by vehicle alone. It is known that stimulating antibodies to the TSHR (TSA), purified from the sera of patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease, when added to TSHR-expressing cells, induced activation of these cells, as measured by cAMP production (1Rapoport B. Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 673-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 2Sanders J. Oda Y. Roberts S.A. Maruyama M. Furmaniak J. Smith B.R.

Because the TSHR-GFP cells showed a capping response to the ligand, we wanted to see if TSHR antibodies would also induce such a response. As shown in Table I, sera from a mouse model of hyperthyroid Graves' disease (22Kita M. Ahmad L. Marians R.C. Vlase H. Unger P. Graves P.N. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) induced capping similarly to TSH. Control (preimmune) serum did not cause capping. The capping induced by TSAb was microscopically indistinguishable from that induced by TSH.Table ITSAB induced capping of TSHR-GFP cellsSampleCapped cellsExperiment 1Experiment 2%TSH −0.70.5TSH + (100 microunits/ml)16.513Normal serum0.70.3TSHR-Ab + serum (1:20)1512TSHR-GFP cells grown on slides were subjected to TSH (100 microunits/ml) or a 1:20 dilution of hyperthyroid mouse serum containing TSHR antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab TSHR-GFP cells grown on slides were subjected to TSH (100 microunits/ml) or a 1:20 dilution of hyperthyroid mouse serum containing TSHR antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. To determine if capping might be associated with direct molecular interaction of TSH receptors, CHO cells were co-transfected with two different TSHR constructs, TSHR-GFP and TSHR-myc, the latter expressing the receptor tagged at the carboxyl terminus with a nine residue c-Myc epitope. Solubilized membranes were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody and assessed for the presence of TSHR-GFP via Western blotting with GFP antibody. Fig.7 shows that TSHR-GFP was co-immunoprecipitated by the Myc antibody (lane 1) and that the Myc antibody was not reactive with TSHR-GFP (lane 2control). However, not all TSHR-GFP species (see Fig. 1, lane 2) were present. The estimated molecular size (∼85 kDa) of the immunoprecipitated fusion was much less than full-length, glycosylated TSH holoreceptor (∼120 kDa) fused to GFP (∼27 kDa). This indicated that only cleaved TSHR-GFP had interacted with TSHR-myc. If the ∼85-kDa fragment contained an intact GFP terminus of ∼27 kDa, the deduced size of the adjoining TSHR fragment is ∼58 kDa, the estimated size of TSHR-β subunit after cleavage at the primary cleavage site (9Graves P. Pristker A. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1999; 84: 2177-2181Google Scholar, 23de Bernard S. Misrahi M. Huet J.C. Beau I. Desroches A. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Pernollet J.C. Milgrom E. J. Biol.

Thyroid. 2000; 10: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our conclusion is that, in this system, TSHR cleavage is required for association of individual TSHRs into molecular complexes. To study the effect of the ligand on oligomerization, solubilized membrane preparations of CHO cells co-transfected with TSHR-GFP and TSHR-myc and treated with varying doses of TSH were immunoprecipitated with Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of oligomers by Western blot with GFP antibody (Fig. 8,panel A). The 85-kDa fusion protein indicating the oligomeric product was seen in the untreated (lane 2) and 10 microunits/ml TSH-treated (lane 2) samples but not in higher doses of TSH (lanes 3–5). This suggested that higher doses of TSH inhibited cleavage and resultant oligomeric complexes.Panel B of Fig. 8 is the same blot probed with anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The mouse heavy and light immunoglobulin chains showed equivalent protein loading in all lanes. To determine whether the intermolecular interaction detected in vitro also occurred in living cells, light emission spectra were recorded in fused cells expressing both TSHR-YFP (donor) and TSHR-RFP (acceptor). The parent cells, expressing these constructs individually, were used as positive controls for optimization of the excitation of YFP so that there was no crossover of the excitation to the RFP protein. Filter settings for the optimum excitation of the donor molecule and detector settings for collecting the emissions of RFP were used to obtain a FRET image in the fused cells. Fig. 9 (panel A) shows the excitation of YFP alone and collection of the YFP image, with no crossover to the RFP channel. Similarly, RFP was excited without crossover to YFP (panel B). At the optimum FRET setting, excitation of TSHR-YFP produced a diffuse image of RFP indicating a transfer of energy from TSHR-YFP to TSHR-RFP (panel c). Based on the Forster equation (25Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4985) Google Scholar) and literature available for GFP variant (26Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), this suggested a maximum distance of 10–50 Å between donor and acceptor. This close physical proximity between TSHR-YFP and TSHR-RFP was in accord with the earlier data demonstrating the presence of TSHR dimers and higher order complexes in solubilized thyroid membranes on immunoblots (8Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The expression of fluorescent TSH receptors in CHO cells was chosen as a model system to investigate the movement and proximity of these receptors in the plasma membrane. The tagged receptors were visualized on the plasma membrane and were functional for TSH binding and signal transduction, as assessed by TSH-induced cAMP synthesis. Both TSH and autoimmune serum containing TSHR stimulating antibodies induced time- and dose-dependent capping of the receptor in this system. A close proximity of individual TSHR molecules to each other was demonstrated by positive FRET imaging and by co-immunoprecipitation of TSHR-myc and TSHR-GFP using anti-Myc antibody. A notable feature of the co-immunoprecipitates was the absence of uncleaved holoreceptors, known to be the most abundant TSHR species on CHO-"

Both proteins were tagged at their cytosolic tails with RRR and KK XX motifs, respectively, resulting in their efficient retention in the ER. Co-transfection of the retained constructs with transport competent MV glycoproteins revealed a dominant negative effect on their biological activity indicating intracellular complex formation and thus retention. Pulse-chase analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that this effect is based on both homo- and hetero-oligomerization in the ER. Recombinant viruses additionally expressing ER-retained F showed an altered cytopathic phenotype accompanied by greatly reduced particle release. Similar mutant viruses additionally expressing ER-retained H could not be rescued indicating an even greater negative effect of this protein on virus viability.

MV H is thought to exist at the viral surface as a tetramer consisting of a dimer of two covalently linked dimers (7Plemper R.K. Hammond A.L. Cattaneo R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6485-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas F is considered to trimerize. Upon synthesis as an inactive precursor F0, the protein becomes proteolytically activated in the trans-Golgi network by furin yielding a large transmembrane F1 and a small F2 fragment. The mechanism of MV-induced membrane fusion may involve receptor-induced conformational changes in H and then F, pointing to a dynamic interaction between these proteins. This was first supported through studies showing that expression of H or hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) and F from the same paramyxovirus is necessary for efficient fusion, inferring their type-specific interaction (8Horvath C.M. Paterson R.G. Shaughnessy M.A. Wood R. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4564-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hu X.L. Ray R. Compans R.W. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 650-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Although compelling evidence for an interaction between H/HN and F exists, it remains unclear at which stage of cellular processing this occurs. Upon synthesis, both proteins are integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Because the ER possesses a high density of molecular chaperones (15Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), the virus might exploit these for the efficient formation of envelope glycoprotein complexes. Indeed, evidence for an ER association between HPIV-2 and -3 HN and F has been presented (16Tanaka Y. Heminway B.R. Galinski M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5005-5015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tong S. Compans R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in these studies soluble derivatives of the glycoproteins carrying KDEL sequences (18Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) were used, which may show folding patterns distinct from the native transmembrane proteins. In contrast, another study demonstrated that full-length simian virus 5 (SV5) and HPIV-3 HN and F proteins retained in the ER did not affect transport of homotypic HN and F species (19Paterson R.G. Johnson M.L. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1997; 237: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For these experiments, the authors added RRRRR (20Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and KK XX motifs (21Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) to the cytosolic tails of HN and F, respectively. In several studies theses retention motifs have proven to be valuable tools to study virus assembly (22Salzwedel K. West Jr., J.T. Mulligan M.J. Hunter E. J.

All studies following the interaction of paramyxovirus glycoproteins retained in the ER so far were based on the fate of plasmid-encoded, transiently expressed glycoproteins. Therefore, the effect of intracellularly retained viral glycoproteins on productive complex assembly in the context of a viral infection is unclear. We show that the H and F glycoproteins of MV interact in the ER and that this interaction has consequences for viral replication. By examining the influence of transiently expressed ER-retained F and H on transport of their unmodified homologues, strong homotypic and heterotypic interactions of MV glycoproteins in the ER were identified, which significantly reduced their biological activity. During virus infection, these interactions were found to be important for MV release and cytopathicity, implicating the ER as a site of MV glycoprotein complex formation. Vero (African green monkey kidney), HT1080 (human bone fibrosarcoma), and PA317 (mouse hybridoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Stably transfected HT1080 cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml puromycin and 293-3-46 helper cells (26Radecke F. Spielhofer P. Schneider H. Kaelin K. Huber M. Dotsch C. Christiansen G. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5773-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) in 1.2 μg/ml geneticin. For transient transfection LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used, and cells were analyzed 18–24 h post-transfection. To prepare virus stocks, Vero cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell and incubated at 37 °C until particles were released by three freeze-thaw cycles. Titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) titration on Vero cells according to the Spearman-Karber method (27Kado G. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1976; 37: 261-264PubMed Google Scholar). For virus growth kinetics, Vero cells (4 × 105 per time point) were infected with an m.o.i. of 0.03 pfu/cell and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, virus titers in cleared supernatants and freeze-thawed cell lysates were determined by TCID50 titration. Parental plasmids for mutagenesis and all experiments were pCG-HEdm and pCG-FEdmencoding MV-Edm H and F under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (28Cathomen T. Buchholz C.J. Spielhofer P. Cattaneo R. Virology. 1995; 214: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the quick change system (Stratagene) and mutant constructs confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western analysis. In all primer sequences altered or added nucleotides are underlined. Primers used to generate pCG-HEdm-ER were 5-CTTAGGGTGCAAGATCATCGATAATGCGACGTCGGCGCCGTTCACCACAACGAGACCGGATAAATGC and to generate pCG-FEdm-ER were 5-CCTATGTAAGGTCGCTCAAGAGTAAGACTCATTAATGATCCTCTACAACTCTTG. If indicated, the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted upstream of the MV-HEdm, MV-HEdm-ER, and MV-FEdm stop codon for detection purposes. Primers used were 5-CGGGAAGATGGAACCAATCGCAGAGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTAGGGCTGCTAGTGAACCAATCTC to generate MV-HEdm-CFLAG and MV-HEdm-ER CFLAG and 5-CATCAAAATCCTATGTAAGGTCGCTCGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTGATCCTCTACAACTCTTGAAACAC to generate MV-FEdm-CFLAG. Biological activity of all tagged proteins was unchanged when compared with the parental versions in transient transfection. To integrate HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER in a DNA copy of the measles genome, p(+)MV (26Radecke F. Spielhofer P. Schneider H. Kaelin K. Huber M. Dotsch C. Christiansen G. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5773-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), MluI, and AatII restriction sites were introduced upstream and downstream of the open reading frames adhering to the reported “rule of six” requirement (29Calain P. Roux L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4822-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers used for pCG-HEdm-ER CFLAG were 5-CTTAGGGTGCAAGATCATCGATAACGCGTATGCGGCGTC GGCGCCGTTCACCACAAC to generate the MluI site and 5-GATGACAAGTAGGGCTGCTAGTGAACGACGTCACCAATCTCATGATGTCACCCAGAC to generate the AatII site. Primers used for pCG-FEdm-ER were 5-CAGAACCCAGACCCCGGCCCACACGCGTGCGCCCCCAACCCCCGACAACC to generate the MluI site and 5-CCCTCTGGCCGAACAATATCGGTAGACGTCAAAAG GATCCACTAGTTCTAGAGTCG to generate the AatII site. The MluI AatII fragments were ligated into MluI AatII digested p(+)MPeGFPV and p(+)MHeGFPV plasmids carrying GFP in post-P or post-H position (30Wang Z. Hangartner L. Cornu T.I. Martin L.R. Zuniga A. Billeter M.A. Naim H.Y. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), thereby replacing GFP. This resulted in plasmids p(+)MV-(P)HEdm-ER and p(+)MV-(P)FEdm-ER and plasmids p(+)MV-(H)HEdm-ER and p(+)MV-(H)FEdm-ER. Measles genomes containing the GFP gene in pre-N position and the HEdm-ER-CFLAG or FEdm-ER open reading frame in post-H position were generated by cloning the GFP-containing SacII NotI fragment of p(+)MV-GFP (31Duprex W.P. McQuaid S. Hangartner L. Billeter M.A. Rima B.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9568-9575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into SacII NotI-digested plasmids p(+)MV-(H)HEdm-ER and p(+)MV-(H)FEdm-ER, resulting in plasmids p(+)MV-GFP (H)HEdm-ER and p(+)MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER. For Western analysis, 4 × 105 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA or infected with an m.o.i. of 0.03 pfu/cell and incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 62.5 mm EDTA; 0.4% deoxycholate; 1% Igepal (Sigma)) containing protease inhibitors (Complete mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Unless otherwise stated, 2.5 μg of total protein (determined using the DC Protein-Assay Kit (Bio-Rad)) was mixed with urea buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8; 8m urea; 5% SDS; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.03% bromphenol blue; 1.5% dithiothreitol) for 25 min at 50 °C. For nonreducing conditions, dithiothreitol was omitted. Samples were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), probed with the indicated antibody, and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment, lysates were mixed with denaturing buffer (final concentration 0.5% SDS; 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 25 min at 50 °C and then with deglycosylation buffer (final concentration 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5) and 0.5 units of Endo H for 12 h at 37 °C. Urea buffer was added and samples subjected to Western analysis. Transfected Vero cells were incubated for 30 min in labeling medium lacking cysteine, methionine, and ammonium sulfate and then labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated in chase medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for the indicated chase periods. For direct immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 1% deoxycholate; 1% Triton X-100; 0.1% SDS; 150 mmsodium chloride) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mmPMSF for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 25 min at 20,000 ×g and 4 °C. Lysates were incubated with antibodies directed against MV H (Chemicon) or the FLAG epitope (M2, Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C and then immune complexes adsorbed to protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 90 min at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed in lysis buffer, incubated in urea buffer for 25 min at 50 °C, and fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to Biomax films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Transfected Vero cells (5 × 103 cells in chamber slides (Chamber Slides; Lab Tec)) were fixed with methanol at −20 °C, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. After blocking with nonspecific goat antiserum (Sigma), cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MV H or F tails (32Cathomen T. Naim H.Y. Cattaneo R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently with Texas Red-coupled anti-rabbit serum (Sigma). As ER marker, fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled concanavalin A (Molecular Probes) was added to the secondary antibody. Cells were washed, fixed with ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes), and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Transfected Vero cells (2 × 106) were scraped in resuspension buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 10 mm sodium chloride; 1% Triton X-100; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm PMSF, and 600 μg of total protein was layered onto a 10–26% sucrose gradient prepared in resuspension buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For control, proteins were treated with 0.5% SDS on ice prior to loading. Gradients were centrifuged in an SW41 rotor for 18 h at 38,000 rpm at 10 °C, and 10 equal fractions were collected. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in urea buffer, and subjected to Western analysis. The location of marker proteins catalase (240,000 kDa), aldolase (158,000 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (68,000 kDa) (all Sigma) was determined by silver staining (Silver staining kit; Bio-Rad) of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Unless otherwise stated, Vero cells were co-transfected in duplicate with 1.0 μg each of plasmid DNA encoding FEdm and HEdm or GFP for control, and 3.0 μg of FEdm-ER or HEdm-ER and incubated at 32 °C to prevent them from reaching over-confluency. The number of syncytia in 20 representative fields of view was determined at the indicated times. Cells were co-transfected with 2.5 μg each of plasmid DNA encoding FEdm and HEdm or the ER-retained versions. Cells were washed in PBS, scraped in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4; 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 50 mm sodium fluoride; 50 mm sodium chloride; 5 mm EDTA; 5 mm EGTA; 100 μm sodium vanadate; 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm PMSF, and centrifuged for 25 min at 20,000 ×g and 4 °C. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of total protein using MV H-specific antibodies (Chemicon). As internal standard, 5 μg of total protein was directly mixed with urea buffer. After absorption of immune complexes to protein G-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.), samples were washed in buffer 1 (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6; 500 mm lithium chloride; 0.1% Triton X-100; 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then in buffer 2 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2; 2 mm EGTA; 10 mm magnesium chloride; 0.% Triton X-100; 1 mmdithiothreitol), resuspended in urea buffer for 25 min at 50 °C, and subjected to Western analysis using antibodies specific for F tail. Recombinant MV particles were generated essentially as described (26Radecke F. Spielhofer P. Schneider H. Kaelin K. Huber M. Dotsch C. Christiansen G. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5773-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The helper cell line 293-3-46 stably expressing MV-N, MV-P, and T7-polymerase was co-transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (ProFection; Promega) with plasmids encoding the MV genome and L polymerase. Helper cells were overlaid on Vero cells 76 h post-transfection and incubated until syncytia appeared or, for GFP-expressing viruses, fluorescence was detectable. Infectious centers were passaged on fresh Vero cells. The integrity of recombinant viruses was verified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. To generate ER-retained versions of full-length MV-Edm glycoproteins, a 5-amino acid RRRRR sequence was added to the cytosolic amino terminus of HEdm and a KSKTH sequence to the carboxyl terminus of FEdm (Fig.1 A). Expression and stability first of HEdm-ER was assessed by transient expression in Vero cells and pulse-chase analysis (Fig.1 B). Whereas the stability of HEdm-ER was similar to that observed for HEdm, HEdm-ER lacked the Golgi-specific conversion from core to complex N-linked oligosaccharide chains characterized by an ∼4 kDa increase in molecular mass over time (33Ogura H. Sato H. Kamiya S. Nakamura S. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2679-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting its inhibited export from the ER. This was further assessed by treating the samples corresponding to 180-min chase time with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) prior to immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). All of the HEdm-ER material was sensitive to Endo H treatment, supporting its efficient retention in the ER. Because most oligosaccharides on F0 are highly sensitive to Endo H (34Hu A. Cathomen T. Cattaneo R. Norrby E. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Endo H resistance cannot be used to monitor its ER export. Instead, processing of MV F from F0 to F1, mediated by furin in late Golgi compartments (35Bolt G. Pedersen I.R. Virology. 1998; 252: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was assessed after transient transfection of Vero cells; most unmodified FEdmwas proteolytically activated, but no antigenic material corresponding to an F1 fraction could be detected for FEdm-ER supporting its ER localization (Fig. 1 D). To investigate further the ER retention of HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER, their co-localization with an ER-specific lectin, concanavalin (Con) A, was compared with that of the unmodified parental proteins by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, E and F). Localization of HEdm-ER overlapped almost exclusively with ConA staining, confirming the ER retention of the HEdm-ER protein. In cells expressing HEdm, however, only some overlap with Con A staining was observed corresponding to the normal steady state level of HEdm in the ER. Slightly greater co-staining of FEdm with ConA was observed (Fig. 1 F), presumably reflecting a slightly higher steady state level of transport-competent FEdm than HEdm in the ER. In cells expressing FEdm-ER, however, almost complete co-localization with ConA was observed, confirming its ER retention. To analyze whether the presence of the ER retention signals influences native folding of HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER, their ability to homo-oligomerize was monitored. Covalently linked H-H homodimers were detected by separation of transiently expressed material under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 A). Both HEdm and HEdm-ER migrated exclusively as dimers under nonreducing conditions, whereas treatment of cell lysates with 1.5% dithiothreitol resulted in migration of both variants as monomers. Because MV F protein is thought to exist as a noncovalently linked trimer, sucrose gradient fractionation of FEdm-ER or FEdm proteins was employed to detect oligomeric versions (Fig. 2 B). The majority of unmodified F0 was found in fraction 5 corresponding to the molecular weight of an F trimer as determined by comparison with molecular weight marker proteins. Cleavage of F0 into F1 seemed to reduce the stability of the trimers because an increasing amount of F1 material was found in earlier fractions of the gradient corresponding to monomeric F protein. FEdm-ER was not proteolytically processed, and its F0 form was predominantly found in fraction 5, although some antigenic material corresponding to higher order complexes could be detected. Treatment of both FEdm and FEdm-ER with 0.5% SDS resulted in a shift of protein to the monomeric form sedimenting in fraction 3 of the gradient because of destruction of noncovalent complexes. Thus, F and H homo-oligomerization capacities are unchanged by their ER retention. We assessed the biological consequence of the ER localization of FEdm-ER and HEdm-ER by studying their effect on syncytium induction mediated by unmodified MV H and F when transiently co-expressed in Vero cells (Fig. 3 A). Expression of either HEdm-ER with unmodified FEdm or, reciprocally, FEdm-ER with unmodified HEdm resulted in minimal syncytium formation, consistent with efficient intracellular retention of HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER. Expression of both unmodified HEdm and FEdm with a 3-fold excess of HEdm-ER resulted in a dominant negative effect on syncytium formation, with a delay in development of cytopathic effects. Expression of FEdm-ER with unmodified HEdm and FEdm also delayed the onset of syncytia but to a lesser degree than that observed with HEdm-ER. This difference is probably because of the covalent and therefore more stable dimerization of MV H in comparison to the noncovalent homo-oligomerization observed for MV F. By using a 5-fold excess of the ER-retained constructs to establish more stringent retention of the unmodified proteins, only very few isolated syncytia could be detected in contrast to the massive formation of syncytia in cells expressing the unmodified proteins alone (Fig. 3 B). Subsequent Western analysis of cell lysates revealed that in the presence of FEdm-ER, proteolytic processing of FEdm to F1 was strongly inhibited, whereas in its absence, FEdm was efficiently processed to F1 indicating transport to post-ER compartments (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, in the cells co-expressing HEdm-ER (Fig.3 D), HEdm showed a strongly reduced rate of Golgi-type carbohydrate chain trimming, indicated by its nearly complete sensitivity to Endo H treatment. In the absence of HEdm-ER however, ∼50% of HEdm was found to be resistant to Endo H treatment. Thus, both FEdm and HEdm are strongly retained in the ER in the presence of FEdm-ER and HEdm-ER, respectively. To address whether hetero-oligomerization of the ER-retained glycoproteins with their unmodified counterparts also contributes to the dominant negative phenotype, their influence on transport kinetics of HEdm and FEdm was investigated by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 4,A and B). FLAG epitope-tagged versions of HEdm and FEdm proteins were used for these experiments to achieve identical immunoprecipitation conditions. Transport kinetics of the tagged glycoproteins were shown not to be influenced by the FLAG epitope itself (Ref. 7Plemper R.K. Hammond A.L. Cattaneo R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6485-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and data not shown). In the presence of equivalent amounts of HEdm and FEdm-ER, kinetics of carbohydrate chain conversion of HEdm to the Golgi-specific pattern was significantly reduced, with far less than 50% conversion after 180 min (Fig.4 A). In contrast, when co-expressed with FEdm, 50% carbohydrate chain conversion of HEdm was observed after less than 120 min. When the reciprocal analysis of FEdm transport was carried out, FEdm was processed efficiently, with furin cleavage ∼75% complete by 120 min in the presence of unmodified HEdm (Fig. 4 B). After co-expression with HEdm-ER, however, processing to F1 was less than 30% complete after 120-min chase time. Thus, both HEdm and FEdm are significantly retained in the ER because of a heterotypic interaction with HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER, respectively. Interestingly, the amount of metabolically labeled FEdmimmunoprecipitated in the presence of HEdm-ER was consistently reduced compared with that in cells co-expressing HEdm. Conceivably, this reflects a slightly reduced FEdm protein expression level in the presence of HEdm-ER. To assess hetero-oligomerization of MV glycoproteins in the ER by a more direct biochemical approach, we followed the interaction of FEdm or FEdm-ER with HEdm or HEdm-ER by co-immunoprecipitation of MV F with H, using anti-F antibodies for detection by Western analysis (Fig.4 C). The relative efficiency of co-precipitation was determined for each sample by comparison with directly loaded total cell lysates. FEdm-ER not only co-precipitated with HEdm, but this interaction was significantly more efficient than that of the unmodified parental proteins FEdm with HEdm. Similarly, the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of FEdm with HEdm-ER was substantially more efficient than that of FEdm with HEdm (Fig.4 C). For control, cells were co-transfected with both ER-retained glycoproteins; as expected very efficient co-precipitation was observed under these conditions. Thus, the dominant negative effect of the ER-retained species on syncytium formation is attributable to both homotypic interaction of FEdm-ER with FEdmor HEdm-ER with HEdm and heterotypic oligomerization of FEdm-ER trimers with HEdm or HEdm-ER complexes with FEdm. To address the interference function of HEdm-ER, which displayed the stronger negative effect on syncytium formation, in a viral infection, an MV-susceptible HT1080 cell line stably expressing HEdm-ER was generated. When infected with MV-Edm, however, generation of cell-associated infectious MV particles was unaffected, although release of virus was reduced at early time points (data not shown). Assessing the relative levels of nuclear and virally encoded H proteins demonstrated that the virus overcomes any inhibitory effects of HEdm-ER by producing a vast excess of virally encoded HEdm. To express ER-retained glycoproteins at higher levels in the context of a viral infection, the genes encoding HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER were thus inserted as additional transcription units downstream of either P or H in a positive strand copy of the MV genome (Fig. 5 A). Because of a transcription gradient described for MV, levels of gene expression from the P position are about three times higher than from the H position (36Cattaneo R. Rebmann G. Schmid A. Baczko K. ter Meulen V. Billeter M.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In repeated attempts none of these recombinant MVs could be recovered, whereas parallel rescues of unmodified MV-Edm were successful (data not shown). To facilitate detection of infection, full-length genomes carrying GFP in addition to HEdm-ER and FEdm-ER in post-H position were generated (Fig. 5 A). Whereas MV-GFP (H)HEdm-ER could not be rescued, MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER was recovered, and the integrity of the insert in the viral genome was confirmed for several independent clones by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing (data not shown). When a single infectious center of either MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER or MV-GFP was transferred to Vero cells, MV-GFP spread completely through the cell monolayer by 5 days post-infection (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER demonstrated a greatly reduced lateral spread characterized by the formation of very few defined syncytia even 7 days post-infection. Release of MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER particles into the medium was greatly delayed in comparison with MV-GFP, with ∼100-fold less particles released at 48–56 h post-infection (Fig. 5 C). This finding mirrored our previous observation of delayed particle release from HT1080 HEdm-ER cells. Consistent with the viral growth curve, barely detectable levels of F1 in released MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER particles were found 64 h post-infection, whereas F1 incorporated into MV-GFP was detected 48 h post-infection (Fig. 5 D). In MV-GFP-infected cells, F1 was detected 40 h post-infection, and the F1 signal was stronger than the F0 signal (Fig. 5 E), a pattern of F expression consistent in MV infections. In MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER-infected cells, however, appearance of F1 was greatly delayed as compared with F0, with a faint F1 band visible only after 48 h (Fig. 5 E). In contrast, ER export of MV H, as measured by conversion from core to Golgi-specific complex N-linked oligosaccharide chains, was only slightly reduced (Fig. 5 F), suggesting a stronger homotypic interaction in the context of this virus. Thus, in the presence of virally encoded FEdm-ER protein, transport of MV F and release of viral particles are significantly impaired resulting in a diminished cytopathic effect. Our study demonstrates that ER-localized MV H and F proteins interfere with the ER export of their unmodified homologues via both homo- and hetero-oligomerization. Importantly, ER retention of H and F has biological consequences, not only diminishing their ability to induce cell-cell fusion upon transient expression but also reducing particle release in the context of a viral infection. Although a concern of our approach may be that ER retention of MV H and F results in formation of non-native multimers,the demonstration that both proteins are able to homo-oligomerize efficiently suggests that this is not the case. Furthermore, that ER-retained SV5 and HPIV-3 HN and F carrying similar retention signals do not interact with their unmodified counterparts (19Paterson R.G. Johnson M.L. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1997; 237: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggests that our contrasting findings are not a general consequence of the approach but rather reflect a specific property of MV glycoprotein complex formation. Given the native conformation of our ER-retained MV glycoproteins and their inhibitory effect on biological activity of unmodified H and F through both homo- and hetero-oligomerization when transiently expressed, it was feasible to assess their impact on virus replication. When ER-retained and nonretained glycoproteins were both virally encoded, the retained proteins apparently had a strong negative effect on virus viability. Several recombinant MV genomes were constructed, but only that expressing the protein least efficient in ER retention, FEdm-ER, at the lowest level could be recovered and propagated. In MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER infected cells release of viral particles was severely impaired, and secondary infections were greatly reduced, resulting in a delay of viral spread through a cell monolayer. Consistent with this, processing of F0 to F1 was markedly delayed, suggesting ER retention of the virus-encoded unmodified F protein. This delay was not mirrored when following cell-associated infectious titer, possibly reflecting activation by furin cleavage of the ER-retained particles during the harvesting process. Although our transient expression data demonstrate both homo- and hetero-oligomerization of MV H and F in the ER, ER export of H in MV-GFP (H)FEdm-ER-infected cells was not significantly delayed. Thus under these conditions hetero-oligomerization of HEdm with FEdm-ER cannot be observed, possibly because of a combination of stronger homotypic than heterotypic interaction in the ER and a lower expression level of FEdm-ER compared with unmodified F. The recombinant particles in which this ratio is reversed, however, could not be rescued. In contrast to our findings, ER-retained HN and F proteins of the related SV5 and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) do not interact with their unmodified homologues when transiently expressed (19Paterson R.G. Johnson M.L. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1997; 237: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For these paramyxoviruses, it is therefore likely that HN and F interact functionally only at the cell surface, a strategy that may prevent fusion in inappropriate cellular compartments after furin cleavage. That MV H and F proteins do interact in the ER suggests MV must either adopt a different mechanism to prevent premature fusion or must not require such a strategy at all. It is intriguing to speculate that distinct entry mechanisms for different paramyxoviruses may confer virus-specific requirements for fusion regulation. The receptor for both SV5 and HPIV-3, and all paramyxoviridae with neuraminidase activity, is the abundant ganglioside sialic acid (37Markwell M.A. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, MV uses a specific protein, either CD46 or signaling lymphocytic activation molecule as a receptor (2Naniche D.

These proteins may be less available for early fusion than sialic acid, rendering the problem of inappropriate intracellular less pronounced for MV. In conclusion, the data obtained in our study show that MV H and F glycoprotein oligomers associate in the ER and that this interaction has relevance for efficient virus replication. Thus, the ER may be considered an assembly site of functional MV glycoprotein complexes. Although we have not observed any escape mutants of the virus expressing FEdm-ER so far, it is intriguing whether extended passaging results in the appearance of such mutants with altered glycoprotein complex stability. Analysis of these mutations may allow further insight into requirements for the interaction of H and F and thus into the earliest steps of MV particle assembly. We thank L. Hangartner and M. Billeter for providing plasmids encoding full-length MV genomes, B. Fuchs and S. Vongpunsawad for assistance, and A. Fielding for critical reading of the manuscript."

Likewise, it has been reported that BDNF rescues cerebellar granule neurons from apoptosis via both ERK and PI3K (24Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar) and motoneurons via PI3K (25Dolcet X. Egea J. Soler R.M. Martin-Zanca D. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Altogether, this illustrates that the implication of ERK and/or PI3K pathways in the mediation of cell survival is critically dependent of the cytokines but also of the biological systems examined. Three recent studies have suggested the involvement of PI3K in the GDNF-induced survival of dopaminergic, sympathetic, and spinal cord motor neurons (26Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9160-9169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although the PI3K targets and their role in the mediation of this antiapoptotic effect are still unknown. However, the fact that the development of the enteric neurons and not of these GDNF-responsive neurons is impaired inret-deficient mice supports the idea that the mechanisms underlying the survival of the crest-derived cells might be different from those of other origins.This prompted us to use in this study the human neuroectodermic SK-N-MC cell line, because it presents the advantage of expressing constitutively GFRα1 but not Ret (13van Weering D.H.J. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In these conditions, SK-N-MC cells could be stably transfected with either the wild type (WT) or the kinase-dead H13 ret cDNA. This model is suitable to dissect the signaling events induced by GDNF and to address their involvement in the survival of crest-derived cells. We demonstrate that the Ret-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt is essential for SK-N-MC cell rescue. Interestingly, we found that ERK is finely regulated by PI3K and Akt and that it does contribute to the ability of GDNF to prevent procaspase-3 cleavage. Altogether, our data underscore the critical role played by the PI3K/Akt pathway in tight control of ERK signal and GDNF-induced cell rescue. Implications of these findings in the understanding of how GDNF supports ENS development are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsThe full-length ret cDNA coding for the short isoform (Ret9; 1072 amino acids) was cloned into the pAlter vector (Promega), and site-directed mutagenesis of Ser765 by Pro (H13 mutation, TCC → CCC) was performed as already described (29Pasini B.

To generate SK-N-MC cell lines expressing either the WT or the H13 mutated Ret, 150-mm diameter plates of SK-N-MC cells were stably transfected with 10 μg of corresponding ret plasmid using the polyethyleneimine (Sigma) precipitation method. 48 h later, the transfected cells were selected in complete medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies). After 2 weeks, at least 100 G418-resistant clones were picked, expanded, and assayed for Ret expression by anti-Ret Western blotting (C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The SK-N-MC cell lines that express either the WT or the H13 mutated Ret are referred throughout as SK-RetWT and SK-RetH13 cells, respectively.Cell TreatmentsFor all experiments, cells were grown to 70% confluence, serum-starved for 6–16 h in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (A7030; Sigma), and stimulated with GDNF (+ in Figs. 1, 2 B, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10; 100 ng/ml; Genentech).

The Raf-1 kinase activity in immunoprecipitates was measured in vitro by its ability to stimulate the activity of a recombinant MEK-1; the activation of MEK-1 is then detected by the phosphorylation of recombinant p42ERK2(coupled MEK-ERK protein kinase assay). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, kinase reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

SK-RetWT cells were treated with either wortmannin (Wort; 100 nm) or PD98059 (50 μm) for 1 h, before being incubated with GDNF (100 ng/ml). 1 h later, anisomycin (10 μg/ml) was added. Apoptosis was measured, as described in the legend to Fig. 8, by analyzing the decrease of ΨM (A), the cleavage of procaspase-3 (B), and the DNA fragmentation (C). Pretreatment with wortmannin or PD98059 had no significant effect on basal SK-RetWT cell survival.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 10Activation of Akt is essential for the GDNF antiapoptotic function. SK-N-MC cells were cotransfected with RetWT and either the constitutive activated (GAG-AKT) or the negative (ST− AKT) mutant of AKT. Cells were then pretreated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) for 1 h, and anisomycin was added. After an additional 3 h, apoptosis was measured, as described in Fig. 8, by analyzing the decrease of ΨM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cell Lysis and ImmunoprecipitationCells were washed with PBS and solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μm aprotinin, 25 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1 mg of precleared whole cell lysates (WCL) was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of either anti-Ret, anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P); Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Shc (Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-p85PI3K(Upstate Biotechnology) antibody, for either 4 h (kinase assays) or 16 h at 4 °C, as described (39Bocciardi R. Mograbi B. Pasini B. Borrello M.G. Pierotti M.A. Bourget I. Fisher S. Romeo G. Rossi B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Western BlottingWCL (50 μg) or immunoprecipitates were separated on 9% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Ret (1:2000), biotinylated anti-Tyr(P) (Upstate Biotechnology; 1:10000), anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt (anti-P Akt; 1:1000; New England Biolabs) or the indicated monoclonal or polyclonal specific antibodies, as described (39Bocciardi R. Mograbi B. Pasini B. Borrello M.G. Pierotti M.A. Bourget I. Fisher S. Romeo G. Rossi B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2257-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the immunoblots were stripped by 30-min incubation at 50 °C in 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β mercaptoethanol and reprobed.Analysis of ERK ActivationAnalysis by Western BlottingWestern blots were generated as described above but developed with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the dually Thr202/Tyr204-phosphorylated, active form of ERK kinases (anti-phospho-ERK; 1:2000; New England Biolabs). Equal loadings of proteins were verified by reprobing the blot with Erk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody.Analysis by Elk-dependent Gene TranscriptionOnce phosphorylated, ERKs translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Elk-1 (reviewed in Ref. 40Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Hence, to assess the activation of the ERK pathway, we also measured the Elk-1-driven transcription of luciferase reporter gene using the PathDetect Elk-1 trans-reporting system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, SK-RetWT cells (0.8 106/six-well dish) were transiently transfected using the polyethyleneimine reagent with 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter pFR-LUC plasmid and 0.1 μg of pFA2-ELK-1 trans-activator plasmid. The contribution of signaling molecules to the activation of the ERK pathway was then tested by cotransfection with 0.5 μg of vectors encoding either dominant negative or positive mutants. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by measuring the activity of a cotransfected pRL-TK plasmid (0.01 μg) that expresses Renilla luciferase (dual luciferase reporter assay system; Promega). Following transfection, cells were left for 24 h in serum-free medium, and GDNF (100 ng/ml) was added for 18 h. 48 h after transfection, dual luciferase activities (firefly and Renilla) were measured in the same sample with a Berthold luminometer. The firefly luciferase activity was adjusted by dividing with the corresponding Renilla luciferase activity.Pull-down Experiment to Detect Activated RasRas activity was measured by a nonradioactive method based on the capability of the active GTP-bound Ras to bind to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (35Herrmann C. Martin A.G. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, SK-RetWT cells were stimulated with GDNF for 20 min and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% N-octyl-d-glucopyranoside. 15 μg of recombinant GST-Raf-1 Ras binding domain previously coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to ∼750 μg of protein extract. Protein complexes were allowed to form for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer with N-octyl-d-glucopyranoside and once with PBS and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-pan-Ras antibody (Calbiochem), as described above.Raf-1 Kinase AssayCells were stimulated with GDNF for 20 min, lysed (in Nonidet P-40 buffer), and immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Raf-1 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies for 4 h. The Raf-1 kinase activity in immunoprecipitates was measured in vitroby a coupled kinase assay. In this assay, the ERK cascade was reconstituted in vitro; the activity of the immunoprecipitated Raf-1 was measured by its ability to stimulate a recombinant nonphosphorylated MEK1 (400 ng), the activation of which was then revealed by phosphorylation of recombinant p42ERK2 (Raf-1 kinase cascade assay; Upstate Biotechnology). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C in the presence of Mg2+ and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of reduced Laemmli buffer, resolved onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of Raf-1 was verified by immunoblotting. Control reactions, in which either MEK1 or Raf-1 immunoprecipitates were omitted, showed no ERK phosphorylation.PI Kinase AssayCells were treated with GDNF or left unstimulated for 15 min prior to Nonidet P-40 cell lysis. The PI kinase assay was then carried out on anti-Tyr(P) (Upstate Biotechnology) immunoprecipitates with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and freshly prepared phosphatidylinositol (PI; Sigma) as substrate, as previously described (41Schmid-Antomarchi H. Benkirane M. Breittmayer V. Husson H. Ticchioni M. Devaux C. Rossi B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphate obtained was analyzed by thin layer chromatography using CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (8.6:7.6:1:1.4, v/v/v/v) as migration buffer. In the case of the anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates from SK-RetWT cells, PI kinase analysis was also performed in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin.Induction and Detection of ApoptosisCells were treated with GDNF for 1 h before being either incubated with anisomycin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) or camptothecin (1 μm; Sigma) or exposed to ultraviolet B irradiation (200 mJ/cm2). 2–4 h after the induction of apoptosis, both adherent cells (recovered after trypsinization) and nonadherent cells (present in the culture medium) were combined and washed in PBS. Then three different parameters describing characteristic features of apoptotic cells were measured as discussed below.Breakdown of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΨM)Early in apoptosis, the ΨMdecreases because of the opening of mitochondrial pores through which cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor are released into the cytoplasm. To discriminate between living cells (high ΨM) and apoptotic cells (low ΨM), th"
https://openalex.org/W2334564428,"We have recently identified the TSLC1 gene as a novel tumor suppressor in human non-small cell lung cancers. TSLC1 encodes a membrane glycoprotein with an extracellular domain homologous to those of immunoglobulin superfamily proteins. Truncation of TSLC1 in the cytoplasmic domain in a primary human tumor suggests that this domain is important for tumor suppressor activity. Here, we report the isolation of two TSLC1-like genes, TSLL1 and TSLL2, based on their structural homology with the sequences corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of TSLC1. Significant similarity was also observed in the extracellular domain as well as in the overall gene structure, indicating that these three genes form a unique subfamily (the TSLC1-gene family) in the immunoglobulin superfamily genes. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of TSLC1, TSLL1 is expressed exclusively in adult and fetal human brain, while TSLL2 is expressed in several specific tissues including prostate, brain, kidney and some other organs. Expression of TSLL1 and TSLL2 was lost or markedly reduced in many human glioma cell lines or some prostate cancer cell lines, suggesting that loss of expression of these genes might be involved in some human cancers."

These analyses revealed an overall conserved fold but differences in primary sequence and length, particularly in an N-terminal loop, lead to differences in nucleotide and divalent metal binding. Packing of hydrophobic residues is central to the interplay between the N-terminal α-helix, switch I, and the interswitch region, which along with differences in surface electrostatics provide explanations for the different biophysical and biochemical properties of ARF and ARF-like proteins.

ADP-ribosylation factor ARF-like GTPase activating protein interswitch region root mean square root mean square deviation switch I switch II N-terminal α-helix N-terminal loop ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1 and ARF-like (ARL) proteins comprise the ARF family within the Ras superfamily of regulatory GTPases. Members of this superfamily function as molecular nodes in signaling that can directly activate one or more enzymatic activities or coordinate the recruitment and assembly of more elaborate multisubunit complexes. The conformational changes that accompany the binding of GDP and GTP can lead directly to changes in the affinity of the GTPase for proteins, lipids, and membranes. For Ras superfamily members these conformational changes are centered in two functional regions, referred to as switch I (SW1) and switch II (SW2) (1Lacal J.C. McCormick F. The Ras Superfamily of GTPases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). Members of the ARF family have an additional nucleotide-sensitive region, an extension at the N terminus and a covalently attached myristate that together work as a “myristoyl switch” to coordinate activation (GTP binding) with translocation onto a membrane (2Beraud-Dufour S. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in membrane binding, there is also evidence that the N terminus may influence effector binding or activities (3Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13465-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Residues in SW1 and SW2 make direct contacts with effectors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) in a variety of GTPases, including ARFs (5Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 6Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the two switches in ARF may act to coordinate the binding and activities of two different proteins simultaneously, a GAP and an effector, to effectively coordinate recruitment of vesicle cargo and GTP hydrolysis (6Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal region (residues 1–17) of ARF have been shown to be sufficient to confer ARF activity and increased GTPase activity to an ARL protein despite the distance between the N terminus and switch or nucleotide binding region (3Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data highlight the complexity of interactions as well as the novel mechanisms of regulation of ARFs as compared with other members of the Ras superfamily. The distinction between ARFs and ARLs is based on both sequence relatedness and function (7Clark J. Moore L. Krasinskas A. Way J. Battey J. Tamkun J. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There are six mammalian ARFs and more ARLs, while the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only two ARFs and two ARLs. ARFs all share at least 60% identity in primary sequence and are active as (i) co-factor in the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs, (ii) direct activators or phospholipase D, and (iii) suppressors of lethality resulting from the deletion of the two yeast ARF genes. The biological roles of ARFs are central to many steps in vesicular traffic, particularly those involving the Golgi (8Roth M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, ARLs share 40–60% sequence identity with each other or with any ARF and lack each of the ARF activities described above (9Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P. Kennison J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Much less is known about biological roles, protein effectors, or the importance of membrane-lipid interactions for the ARLs. That ARFs are essential and highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution is highlighted by the findings that at least one ARF has been found in every eukaryote tested (although not yet in any prokaryote) and that each one tested has demonstrated the ability to complement the arf1−rf2−double mutant in yeast. Structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography of the two most divergent human ARFs, ARF1 and ARF6 (10Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and also for the ARF-like protein murine ARL3 (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These structures have revealed the fundamental conservation of structure between ARFs and other members of the Ras superfamily in the six β-strands at the core of the protein and surrounding helices. We report here structures of GDP-bound, S. cerevisiae ARF2 (ScARF2) and ARL1 (ScARL1), as determined by x-ray crystallography to 1.6 and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively. The structures of the two proteins show changes in and surrounding the N terminus. These differences give indications of how the diverse biochemical characteristics may be determined or mediated by the sequence and structure of the N terminus. In addition, comparison of surface electrostatics of the four ARF family members revealed surprisingly large differences that are discussed with respect to properties of each protein. ScARF2 and ScARL1 were expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria using the pET3C expression plasmid as described previously for other ARF proteins (12Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0 before protein expression was induced with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside (0.5 mm). Cells were harvested by centrifugation after ∼12 h of growth at 37 °C. Cells were resuspended in 25 mmTris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm GDP, pH 7.5 before lysis using a French press. Bacterial cell lysate was passed over a low substituted Q-Macro column (Bio-Rad; 100-ml bed volume) in the same buffer, and the flow-through was applied to a high substituted Q-Macro column (Bio-Rad; 50-ml bed volume). A linear gradient (50–350 mm NaCl, 500 ml) in lysis buffer was used to fractionate proteins. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 5 ml and loaded on a Sephacryl S-100 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 60 cm, 300-ml bed volume) gel filtration column. Protein purity was determined by denaturing (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the pooled fractions were concentrated to a final concentration of 1 mm protein for storage at −80 °C. Crystals of ScARF2 were grown by the hanging drop method combining equal volumes (2 μl) of the protein stock and mother liquor (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 mcacodylate, pH 6.5) at room temperature. ScARF2 crystals grew as thin plates (0.3 × 0.06 × 0.02 mm3) from a central hub and had to be separated before vitrification in 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5 and 15% glycerol using liquid propane. ScARL1 crystals were also obtained by the hanging drop (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mTris, pH 8.5). Statistics for the structure determination are shown in Table I. For ScARF2, data collection to better than 1.6 Å was performed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory X12b beam line (γ = 1.008 Å). One-degree oscillation frames were integrated with DENZO, then merged, and scaled with SCALEPACK from HKL (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Initial phases for the structure factors were determined by molecular replacement with AMoRe (14Navaza J.

Nucleotide bound to ScARF2 was released by the addition of ice-cold HClO4 to a final concentration of 0.5 m, incubation at 0 °C for 10 min, removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation, and neutralization of the supernatant by addition of 16 volume of 1 mK2HPO4, 0.5 m acetic acid and 16 volume of 3 m KOH at 0 °C. The solution of the extracted nucleotide was then exchanged into deionized water and lyophilized, and the residue was resuspended in a 20% propanol, 1% triethylamine, water mixture. All experiments were performed on a PE Sciex API 3000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turboionspray source. Product ion spectra were acquired to detect the (M − H)− ions of m/z 442.3 or 522.4. Data was acquired for a total of 1.7 min, thus each spectrum was the signal-averaged sum of ∼100 scans. Precursor ion spectra were acquired to detect either m/z 79.0 or 150.0. Data was acquired for a total of either 2.5 or 5.0 min, respectively, thus each spectrum was the signal-averaged sum of 300 scans. Nitrogen was used to collisionally activate precursor ion decomposition. ScARF1 and ScARF2 are over 97% identical and share about 74% identity with mammalian orthologs, e.g. HsARF1 or HsARF6 (see Fig. 1 A). ScARF1 and ScARF2 were each expressed in bacteria, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized as described under “Materials and Methods.” Crystals of ScARF2 diffracted to higher resolution (1.6 Å) and the resultant structure provided details not seen in previous ARF structures. Comparisons between yeast (ScARF2) and human (HsARF1 (10Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and HsARF6 (11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) structures provide insights into conserved features throughout this evolutionary distance. We have also crystallized and solved a structure for yeast ARL1 (ScARL1) at a lower resolution (3.2 Å). Data and model statistics for each new structure are shown in TableI. Because of the functional differences between ARFs and ARLs (9Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P. Kennison J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and greater divergence in sequence (40–60% identity) the variations between the structures provide details of structural divergence of likely functional importance. The secondary structures of GDP-bound ScARF2, ScARL1, and HsARF1 are essentially conserved (see Fig. 1 B); the topology includes seven β-strands, six α-helices, and 12 connecting loops. Of these, the protein core is an invariant six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices. The seventh strand forms an edge to the core and corresponds to the functionally important SW1 region seen in regulatory GTPases (1Lacal J.C. McCormick F. The Ras Superfamily of GTPases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of each protein is an α-helix (αNt) wedged between the C-terminal helix α-E and loop L-2/3, which connects strands β2 and β3, also referred to as the interswitch region (ISR). The presence of αNt is in contrast to the rather undefined secondary fold seen for the N-terminal sequence in the ARL3 model (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SW2 corresponds to L-3/B and αB, where L-3/B is on the opposite side of the N-terminal region and αB is opposite the bound GDP. The nucleotide binding site is on the surface of the protein between αNt and SW2 (Fig. 1 B). Higher affinity for GDP over GTP and lipid dependence on the binding of activating guanine nucleotides likely explain the presence of GDP in the nucleotide binding site of ARFs as purified from mammalian tissues or bacteria (17Kahn R.A. Goddard C. Newkirk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8282-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GDP was well fit in the binding site of previous ARF structures and in both yeast proteins described here. But there remained clear, but unexplained, density at the 3′ position of the ribose bound to ScARF2. Different orientations of the ribose were considered, but only a covalent modification at the 3′ position could be fit well (see Fig. 2 A). The presence of a modified GDP in the protein preparation used to produce the ScARF2 crystals was investigated using mass spectroscopy. The presence of GDP, with the predicted mass of 442 atomic mass units, was evident in the preparation as was the presence of a second species with a mass of 522 atomic mass units. The mass of the larger species was consistent with a modification to GDP that adds 80 atomic mass units and can be explained by an additional phosphate (HPO3). We estimate from the mass spectroscopy results and the electron density in the crystal structure that our preparation of ScARF2 has ∼70% GDP and 30% GDP-3′-phosphate bound. This is the first modified nucleotide found on a regulatory GTPase as purified, although no biological significance can yet be ascribed to this observation. The high resolution of the ScARF2 structure also allowed the definition of alternate conformations of side chains that were not evident in previous structures as well as the binding of a number of small molecules. For example, the invariant lysine (A2:K30), 2In discussing comparisons between the four ARF family members we use the numbering for HsARF1 as the benchmark for this family. Residue numbering in HsARF1 (PDB code 1HUR) is indicated by the abbreviation A1:“residue,” in ScARF2 as A2:residue, in ScARL1 as L1:residue, and in HsARF6 (PDB code 1E0S) as A6:residue. Single letter abbreviations are used for amino acids in this numbering scheme. which contacts the α- and β-phosphates, has alternate conformations for the γ- and δ-carbons. Only one of these conformations is observed for all the ARF family members structures published to date, except the HsARF1·GDP·GAP structure (6Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which has the other conformation. Our results show both conformations simultaneously present for Lys30 in ScARF2. In addition to more than 200 water molecules, the surface of the protein was found to bind two glycerol, one 1,3-propanediol, nine 1,2-ethanediol, and three ethanol molecules per protein monomer, all introduced by the use of glycerol as cryoprotectant. The most provocative of the binding sites for these molecules is the channel extending from the nucleotide and magnesium binding site (Fig. 2 B). The fact that this channel is lined by residues involved in magnesium binding (Glu54 and Asp67) and residues of the lower ISR (Asn52) as well as SW1 (Thr48 and Phe51) and SW2 (not shown) leads us to speculate a potential for this being a site of interaction with lipid, or other modulators, that could promote nucleotide exchange or conformational changes in one or both switches. Similar to murine Arl3-GDP (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) a covalent homodimer was observed for ScARL1; however, here the disulfide bond is within the asymmetric unit and is linking the two Cys81 residues present in SW2 (Fig. 3). Dimerization was not the result solely of crystallization as it was detectible by either nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high-resolution gel filtration chromatography (results not shown) prior to crystallization. This is the only known example of a covalent homodimer being formed by a member of the Ras superfamily. Recently ARF1 and Ras were proposed to form homodimers on 3A. G. Rosenwald, M. Rhodes, H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3737-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed membrane localization promotes dimer formation of Ras, which is essential, although not sufficient, for activation of its target molecule, Raf-1 (20Inouye K. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3737-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Dimerization also appears to be involved in the regulation of the activity of Rho family GTPases (21Zhang B.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test the functional importance of dimerization we constructed the C81S mutant of ScARL1 and integrated it at the ARL1 locus by homologous recombination. This point mutant was fully functional as defined only by rescue of the cold sensitivity seen in arl1−cells. Thus, there is no evidence to support a required role for dimerization, covalent or otherwise, of ScARL1. However, both ARFs and ARLs have conserved cysteines;e.g. all known ARL1 orthologs have a cysteine at the position homologous to L1:81, while ARL2 orthologs lack that cysteine but have one at position 103 (A1:102). The model for ScARL1 reported here includes a disordered gap at residues 71–74 because of the lack of density to model the structure appropriately. This region is the start of SW2 and typically has the highest crystallographic thermal values in GTPase structures. In contrast, the structure of the entire SW2 region of ScARF2 is well defined and completely determined, possibly due to the crystal contacts present in this area. Similarly, the entire SW2 region of the ARL3 structure could be modeled (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparison of the electrostatic surface of HsARF1, ScARF1, HsARF6, and ScARL1 revealed striking differences that are consistent with their membrane interactions. The electrostatic profiles of the four proteins fall into three categories: a patched surface, a primarily acidic surface potential, or a primarily basic surface potential (Fig. 4). HsARF1/ScARF2 comprise the group distinguished by the patched appearance of both anionic (negative potential in red) and cationic (positive potential in blue) areas as seen in Fig. 4, A and B. These patches of mixed charge, including SW1 and SW2, when positioning the N terminus toward the membrane, would provide a distinctive surface for protein interactions oriented toward the cytosol. Most prominent for HsARF1/ScARF2 is a horseshoe-shaped acidic cushion surrounding the N-terminal helix, which itself is predominantly basic (Fig. 4, A and B). Such a charged surface may assist in the orientation of the ARF1 to promote the interaction of the N terminus and the covalently bound myristate with membrane lipids. This may also help explain the ability of acidic lipids to promote nucleotide exchange through interaction with the N-terminal region (22Kahn R.A. Terui T. Randazzo P.A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The surface of ScARL1 is distinguished by an overall negative electrostatic potential (see Fig. 4 C). Like HsARF1, both human and yeast ARL1 are N-myristoylated, yet we have been unable to demonstrate 4H. Van Valkenburgh, J. D. Sharer, and R. A. Kahn, unpublished observations. any GTP-dependent binding of HsARL1 to membranes or lipid vesicles that is a hallmark of ARFs (23Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations lead us to predict that the binding of human and yeast ARL1 to membrane is more dependent on protein-protein interactions at the membrane than is the binding of ARFs. In contrast to the two profiles described above, the electrostatic potential of HsARF6 gives the protein a primarily cationic appearance (see Fig. 4 D). Interestingly the location on the surface of HsARF6 that surrounds and includes the N-terminal helix is strongly basic. An increased tendency to interact with acidic head groups of lipids would be predicted from such an electrostatic profile, and this may contribute to the finding that ARF6 more tightly associates with membranes even when GDP is bound. Despite the variation of the electrostatic potential for all four proteins as described above, there is one consistent observation among them. The highly conserved loop L-SW1/β2 is electrostatically isolated, both due to its exposure at the surface and its predominantly hydrophobic nature (especially noted for ScARL1 in Fig. 4 C). To identify structural differences between the four ARF family members, we aligned the structures of ScARF2, ScARL2, and HsARF6 against HsARF1. For an optimal alignment, one that would highlight the differences and maintain invariant features, we first superimposed the backbone Cα-atoms of the highly invariant fourth, fifth, and sixth β-strands. The r.m.s.d. for all Cα-atoms was then calculated and plotted against the sequence position as shown in Fig. 5. The largest differences were found at the N terminus (A1:2–19), the switch regions (SW1 = A1:36–52 and SW2 = A1:69–85), and the ISR (loop L-2/3, A1:57–62). Further prominent r.m.s. differences were found in regions A1:129–133 and A1:149–151. Amino acids 129–133 are adjacent to the highly conserved 126NKQD129sequence, which is directly involved in the binding of the guanine nucleotide base. Residues 149–151 are close to the GAP binding site as described by Goldberg (6Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Structural changes with a smaller r.m.s.d. were found in regions A1:100–120, at A1:27, and centered around A1:162 (see Fig. 5). Residues 100–120 are involved in binding to ARF-GAP (6Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Residue 27 is part of the putative phosphate binding sequence G X4GK. Residue 162 follows a group of residues involved in binding the guanine base as discussed in more detail below. That these differences in structure are scattered throughout the molecules and are mostly located in previously identified regions essential to function are consistent with these being functionally important regions and useful in defining specificity between the proteins. Membrane binding, nucleotide affinity, phospholipid dependence of GTP binding, and nucleotide hydrolysis by ARFs are all sensitive to the presence and sequence composition of the N-terminal 17 amino acids; they are the αNt and loop (L-Nt) comprising the “N-terminal region” (3Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kahn R.A. Terui T. Randazzo P.A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The structure and position of this region has only been determined for ARF(s) bound to GDP and is presumed to change dramatically upon binding GTP (5Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). How the presence or structure of the N-terminal region can so dramatically influence the nucleotide binding site has been the subject of much conjecture. A comparison of the four structures illustrates how the sequence of the N-terminal helix and the length of the following loop L-Nt can affect the structure of SW1 and the interswitch region and in so doing the nature of the nucleotide bound. In essence, the presence of the N-terminal region constrains the ISR (loop L-2/3), a primary determinant of the bound nucleotide. The largest differences detected from the comparison of the four structures were in these three elements: the N-terminal region, the ISR, and SW1. Differences in the N-terminal region (most obviously the lack of αNt) and the ISR were also reported for the recent structure of ARL3 (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A more detailed comparison of these areas is shown in Fig. 6. A key to the organization of these regions is the presence of hydrophobic residues, best viewed in HsARF1 (Fig. 6 A), which include Phe5, Phe9, Leu37, Leu39, Val56, Tyr58, Ile61, and Phe63, forming a hydrophobic cluster. Note, in particular, the extent to which Leu39 is inserted into the cluster and makes direct contact with the N-terminal helix. In HsARF6 (Fig. 6 B) the equivalent is Leu35, but it is much less well fit into this cluster due to the shortening of loop L-Nt, a four-residue deletion relative to HsARF1 (Fig. 1 A), and the presence of a leucine residue (Leu5) instead of a phenylalanine (Phe5), as in HsARF1(Fig. 6 A). These changes lead to a reorientation of the ISR and specifically Tyr54. The result is a large change in the structure of the N-terminal portion of SW1 of HsARF6. In contrast, loop L-Nt is much longer in ScARL1, allowing yet other structural differences in the ISR. When coupled with the change to L1:I40 (corresponding to A1:L39) this allows the first part of SW1 to make closer contacts and additional hydrogen bonds with the ISR (Fig. 6 C). Although ScARF2 (Fig. 6 D) has a shorter loop L-Nt than HsARF1, the conserved Leu39 and hydrophobic cluster prevent the change in SW1 seen in HsARF6 and ScARL1. In ARL3, differences in the structure of the N terminus and ISR result from differences in key residues,e.g. a lysine instead of glutamate at position 54 and the two phenylalanines in ARF1, Phe5 and Phe9, are serine and lysine, respectively, in ARL3 (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the different packing of hydrophobic residues modified by contributions from the N-terminal helix and the ISR, in addition to the variation in length of loop L-Nt, lead to differences in the initial portion of SW1. The presence of this hydrophobic cluster, the degree of residue insertion, and the ability of backbone hydrogen bond formation are most likely the principal causes for the change in structure at the start of the SW1 region. Glutamate 50 of HsARF6 influences nucleotide exchange, probably through effects on the binding of Mg2+ (11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This glutamate (A6:E50, A1:E54) cannot approach the metal to make the contacts seen in ARF1 (see Ref. 10Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar and Fig. 7, A and B), and thus a weakening of the affinity for Mg2+ was predicted (11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We find similar structural variations in ScARL1 and ScARF2 that are also predicted to have an impact on the affinity for magnesium (Mg2+) and consequently nucleotides (Fig. 7, Cand D). This may explain the observations that indicate each of these proteins exchange nucleotides more rapidly than HsARF1. It may also explain the absence of bound Mg2+ for some of the published structures (11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The predicted differences in affinity for magnesium result from an increase in distance, i.e. decrease in interaction, between a conserved glutamate (A1:E54, L1:E55), involved in binding of the Mg2+, and a conserved tyrosine hydroxyl (A1:Y35, L1:Y36). This results from structural changes and sequence variations in the SW1 area, specifically at residues A1:40–42 (L1:41–43). In ScARL1 (Fig. 7 C), the modified positioning of L1:I40, including the flip of its ψ-angle, combines with the sequence difference of L1:V43 (A1:I42) to allow L1:Y36 (A1:Y35) to interact with L1:E55 (A1:E54). A 90° rotation around X1 of L1:Y36 in ScARL1 (from −172° in HsARF1 to −79° in ScARL1) enables the tyrosine hydroxyl to hydrogen bond with L1:E55 (3.0 Å) (see Fig. 7 C), moving L1:E55 away from its position as an effective Mg2+ coordinator (10Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7 B). The same rotation of A2:Y35 is observed in ScARF2 (X1 = −82°) as well as the presence of a valine at residue 42, but because the topology around SW1 is more similar to HsARF1, A2:Y31cannot approach A2:E54 (5.0 Å) (see Fig. 7 D). This trend is most exaggerated in ARF6. Again the same rotation of A6:Y31 is observed (X1 = −76°), but because of the topology divergence in SW1 around this area relative to HsARF1, A6:Y31 is even further from A6:E50 (8.0 Å) (Fig. 7 A). Instead A6:E50 hydrogen bonds with A6:S38 (equivalent to residue A1:I42). Thus, the most dramatic repositioning of the conserved glutamate is found in HsARF6 (11Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) followed by ScARL1 and ScARF2, and the nearest approach of glutamate and magnesium is seen in HsARF1. Although the direct coordination of magnesium with this conserved glutamate was not seen in the other HsARF1 structure (24Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockcroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), all of these data are consistent with this glutamate playing a central role in the binding of magnesium to members of the ARF family and consequently to the affinity of guanine nucleotides. This argument was further supported by the recent ARL3-GDP model in which sequence variations in SW1, similar to those mentioned above, and the changes of both of the key residues (A1:E54and A1:Y35) to lysine result in altered binding of magnesium. In the ARL3-GDP model no Mg2+ is evident but a SO42− is interacting with both these lysines, and GDP binding, but not GTP binding, is Mg2+-independent (18Hillig R.C. Hanzal-Bayer M. Linari M. Becker J. Wittinghofer A. Renault L. Structure. 2000; 8: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, a change in the binding of magnesium can result from either the replacement of the critical glutamate or its interaction with tyrosine, in each case resulting in the loss of a critical coordination of the magnesium. Nucleotides bind to ARFs through interactions above and below the plane of the base. On one face are side chains from the second conserved G-domain, NKQD (A1:N126–D129) in the ARF family, and on the other face is a less conserved residue (A1:T161). Given the importance of these interactions and their conservation among GTPases it was surprising to note that after the N-terminal region, SW1, and SW2, the region with the highest r.m.s. deviation between structures (>1 Å) is found in loop L-5/D, A1:130LPNA133, immediately following A1:D129. A1:K127 (not shown) interacts hydrophobically along the face of the base while Asp129forms a hydrogen bond at the edge of the base. While these interactions were conserved in all four structures the distances of the bonds formed and orientations of side chains differed in ways that may predict differences in nucleotide affinities or handling. Not only does the r.m.s. analysis (Fig. 5) show substantial differences between the backbones in this G-domain, the side chains are oriented differently as well. A change in the residue corresponding to A1:N132 is always coordinated with a concomitant change at residue A1:N95 (see Fig. 1 A). These residues are on loops that interact with each other, and it is the type of interaction, which can vary with sequence changes, that causes the larger r.m.s. deviation at the location of loop L-5/D. On the other side of the base is the less conserved sequence (A1:158TCAT161) that provides A1:T161 for base interactions, but this interaction appears much less strong. The density for A2:T161 indicates this residue is rotating through about 90°. It is also hydrogen bonding with a water molecule. The sequence at this position varies within the ARF family and can be a valine, isoleucine, leucine, or alanine in different ARLs. Structural variation at the guanine base sandwich due to A1:T161 and Asp129 (in turn due to structural perturbations in the subsequent loop residues 130–133) most likely influences the ability of the protein to bind the base of the nucleotide and therefore influences the affinity of the nucleotide, similar to differences in the binding of magnesium. A rank order in predicted affinity for GDP is difficult as it results from at least three factors that do not necessarily exert their effect in a coordinated fashion: the residue at position A1:T161, the proximity and mobility of residues A1:D129-L130, and the orientation of A1:N132 resulting from its interaction with A1:N95. Another ARL structure, that of ARL2(GTP) bound to the δ subunit of phosphodiesterase (PDEδ), was published during the review of this manuscript (29Renault L. Hanzal-Bayer M. Hillig R.C.

Here, we report that an early step in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is reversibly inhibited by cholesterol levels significantly lower than those found in the plasma membrane. By UV-induced chemical cross-linking we further show that high cholesterol levels prevent cross-linking between ribosome-nascent chain complexes and components of the Sec61 translocon, but have no effect on cross-linking to the signal recognition particle. The inhibiting effect on translocation is different between different sterols.

The induced changes in membrane properties can help to modulate the activity of membrane-resident proteins, in addition to more specific protein regulation mechanisms (2Yeagle P.L. Yeagle P.L.

Cholesterol can further affect the function of individual proteins by direct binding (7Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since cholesterol increases the lipid chain order, the insertion of cholesterol leads to a laterally more condensed membrane (1Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Cholesterol/sphingolipid rafts and caveolae in the plasma membranes are good examples of such tightly packed, laterally segregated cholesterol-rich domains (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 11Brown D.A. London E. J.

Raft-like structures have also been suggested to exist in the Golgi and in the endocytic pathway, while the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and other internal membranes are devoid of rafts (12Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels differ markedly between different cellular membranes. The cholesterol concentration is low in the ER and increases throughout the secretory pathway. Most of the cellular cholesterol is found in the plasma membrane (13Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V.

Billheimer J.T. Faust J.R. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9649-9655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). All of the regulatory proteins residing in the ER respond to changes in the local cholesterol level. Changes in plasma membrane cholesterol are reflected in the ER cholesterol levels, allowing feedback control of cholesterol synthesis and esterification in the ER (20Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 21Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Given that membrane-bound ER resident enzymes normally function in a cholesterol-poor environment, they may be expected to be particularly sensitive to increases in cholesterol levels. Here we report that an early step in protein translocation across the ER membrane is reversibly inhibited by cholesterol levels significantly lower than those found in the plasma membrane. We have also examined whether a change in cholesterol double bond position or number affects protein translocation. 5α-Cholestan-3β-ol (dihydrocholesterol) and 4-cholesten-3β-ol (allocholesterol) inhibit protein translocation, whereas 4-cholesten-3-one (cholestenone), 7(5α)-cholesten-3β-ol (lathosterol), and 8(14)-cholesten-3β-ol (8-sterol) have no apparent effects. By UV-induced chemical cross-linking we further show that high cholesterol levels prevent cross-linking between ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) and components of the Sec61 translocon, but have no effect on cross-linking of RNCs to the signal recognition particle (SRP). These observations suggest that an increase in membrane stiffness renders the Sec61 protein translocation machinery in the ER unable to recognize and/or initiate translocation of nascent polypeptide chains. One possible implication of our findings is that Sec61 translocons that have leaked out to the Golgi compartment and beyond (23Greenfield J. High S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may be rendered nonfunctional by cholesterol-mediated inhibition. Unless otherwise stated, all enzymes, plasmid pGEM1, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Boston, MA). T7 DNA polymerase, [35S]Met, 14C-methylated marker proteins, ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, the cap analogues m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G and G(5′)ppp(5′)G, and [14C]oleoyl-coenzyme A (56 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ). Protein A-Sepharose, puromycin, and 7-methylguanosine 5′-monophosphate were from Sigma. Affinity-purified rabbit antisera to the C-terminal 13 amino acids of TRAM were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Most of the sterols used and methyl-β-cyclodextrin were obtained from Sigma. Allocholesterol was purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI) and 8-sterol from Research Plus Inc. (Bayonne, NJ). The purity of all sterols was examined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, and all, except for dihydrocholesterol, were 99% pure and were used without further purification. Dihydrocholesterol was purified by crystallization in ethanol-water at −20 °C overnight and was shown to be 99% pure by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Dog pancreas microsomes were prepared as described in Ref. 24Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar, 26Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by sequencing of plasmid DNA. All cloning steps were done according to standard procedures. For cloning into and expression of Lep from the pGEM1 plasmid, the 5′ end of the lep gene was modified, first, by the introduction of an XbaI site and, second, by changing the context 5′ to the initiator ATG codon to a “Kozak consensus” sequence (27Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, the 5′ region of the gene was modified to: … ATAACCCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGCGAAT … (XbaI site and initiator codon underlined). Mutants of Lep were cloned into pGEM1 behind the SP6 promoter as an XbaI-SmaI fragment. DNA template for in vitrotranscription of full-length Lep mRNA was prepared by transcription of the Lep-pGEM1 plasmid with SP6 RNA polymerase for 1 h at 37 °C. The transcription mixture was as follows: 1–5 μg of DNA template, 5 μl of 10× SP6 H-buffer (400 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.4, 60 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm spermidine HCl), 5 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl), 5 μl of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (10 mm), 5 μl of dithiothreitol (50 mm), 5 μl of NTP mix (10 mm ATP, 10 mm CTP, 10 mm UTP, 5 mm GTP), 18.5 μl of H2O, 1.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), 0.5 μl of SP6 RNA polymerase (20 units/μl). Translation of 1 μl of Lep mRNA in 9 μl of nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), 1 μl of [35S]Met (10 μCi/μl), 1 μl of amino acids mix (1 mm concentration of each amino acid except Met), 1 μl of mRNA, 1 μl of dog pancreas microsomes (2 units/μl; one unit is defined as the amount of microsomes required for 50% translocation of in vitro synthesized preprolactin) was performed as described in Ref. 28Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar at 30 °C for 1 h. Template for in vitro transcription of truncated Lep mRNA was prepared using PCR to amplify a fragment from the Lep-pGEM1 plasmid. The 5′ primer was situated 210 bases upstream of the translation start, and the amplified fragment thus contained the SP6 transcriptional promoter from pGEM1. The 3′ primer was chosen to produce a truncated fragment ending at codon 271 in Lep, and no stop codon was included. Translation/translocation reactions of truncated Lep mRNA for puromycin treatment (Fig. 3, panel B) were performed at 22 °C in a total volume of 14 μl. When relevant, 3.5 μg of cholesterol (0.23 μg/μl) was added after 25-min translation. After an additional 10-min incubation, 1.9 μl of potassium acetate (4 m), 1.5 μl of magnesium acetate (20 mm), and 1.5 μl of puromycin (30 mm) were added, and the incubation was continued at 22 °C for another 10 min. For alkali extraction, a 10-μl translation mix was diluted with 90 μl of ice-cold 0.1 m Na2CO3/NaOH, pH 11.5, and the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman tabletop 100.3 rotor. Before SDS-PAGE, the supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and all samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and gels were visualized on a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphoimager using the Fuji Image Reader 8.1j software. mRNA coding for truncated preprolactin polypeptide was synthesized by in vitro transcription using linearized pSPBP4 DNA and SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (29Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The PvuII restriction site (after codon 86) was chosen to obtain a run-off transcript encoding the N-terminal 86 residues of preprolactin. In vitro translation for photolysis (25 μl total volume) and immunoprecipitation (50 μl total volume) were done in wheat germ cell-free extract (29Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 30Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in the presence of 40 nm canine SRP, 8 equivalents (16 equivalents for immunoprecipitation) of column-washed rough microsomes (24Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), [35S]Met (5 μCi for cross-linking, 100 μCi for immunoprecipitation), and 15 pmol of εANB-Lys-tRNA (29Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Photoreactive Nε-(5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyl)-Lys-tRNA (εANB-Lys-tRNA) was prepared as detailed previously (31Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Samples were photolysed on ice for 15 min using a 500-watt mercury arc lamp (29Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). After photolysis, membranes or ribosomes were sedimented through a sucrose cushion in a Beckman airfuge at 4 °C for 5 min, 20 p.s.i. and 60 min, 30 p.s.i., respectively. Microsome and ribosome pellets were resuspended in buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing detergent (0.25% w/v SDS for Sec61α- and Sec61β-specific antibodies and 1% w/v SDS for TRAM- and SRP54-specific antibodies) and placed at 55 °C for a minimum of 30 min. The volume was increased with buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% v/v Triton X-100, 0.2% w/v SDS) for Sec61α and Sec61β antibodies and buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS) for TRAM and SRP54 antibodies. Samples were then precleared by rocking with protein A-Sepharose at room temperature for 1 h before the Sepharose beads were removed by sedimentation. Sec61α-, Sec61β-, TRAM-, or SRP54-specific antiserum was added to each supernatant, and the samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added to each sample and incubated for a minimum of 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized using a Bio-Rad GS-250 phosphorimager (29Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To enrich the microsomes with cholesterol or sterol analogues, complexes between methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CyD) and sterols were prepared by a slight modification of the procedure described in Ref. 32Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. 32 mg of CyD was dissolved in 1 ml of MS buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5), and this solution was added to a thin film of sterol (1 mg) in a tube. The molar ratio of sterol to CyD was 1/10. The mixture was sonicated in a bath sonicator for 20 min. Translation mixes including microsomes were incubated with various amounts of sterol in the form of sterol-CyD complexes during the translation/translocation assay. Sterol-CyD complexes were added to the translation mix together with mRNA and microsomes at the beginning of the incubation, unless otherwise stated. Microsomes were extracted with hexane/2-propanol (3/2, v/v) and water, and again with hexane, to obtain the total lipids. The organic phase was then collected and evaporated to dryness. The extracted lipids were applied on a high performance thin layer chromatography plate and eluted with chloroform:methanol:water (25:10:1.1 by volume) to separate the phospholipid classes. The phospholipids were visualized by staining with cupric acetate (3%, w/v and 8% H3PO4, w/v) and heating the plates for 15 min at 150 °C to develop the color and identified from standards run in parallel. The absorbance of the lipid spots was determined with a scanning densitometer (Camag TLC Scanner 3). The amount of sphingomyelin in the microsomal preparation was calculated from the absorbance data compared with a sphingomyelin standard series. The amount of cholesterol in the microsomal membranes was analyzed from the total lipid extract by gas-liquid chromatography (Shimadzu GC-14A). Epicoprostanol was added as an internal standard to the samples. The cholesterol amount in the sample was calculated compared with a standard sample with known cholesterol concentration. The samples were injected on a SacTM-5 column (0.25-μm film, 0.25 mm × 30 m, Supelco) with the inlet block at 260 °C and separated on the column with a temperature program of 6 °C·min−1 from 260 to 280 °C. The samples were detected with a flame ionization detector at 300 °C. The amount of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the microsomal preparation was calculated relative to the protein concentration in the microsomes. The protein concentration in the sample was determined by the method of Lowry (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The cholesterol measurements were done by an ACAT assay as described in Ref. 18Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar. In vitro translations were done in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of rough microsomes and cholesterol-CyD complexes or unloaded CyD. After translation the microsomes were sedimented in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge (4 °C, 70 K, 10 min, 100.3 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in MS buffer containing dithiothreitol (1 mm), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and [14C]oleoyl-coenzyme A (30 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to allow ACAT to esterify cholesterol residing in the ER fraction. After incubation, microsomes were sedimented, the enzyme was inactivated, and cholesterol esters were measured. Briefly, microsomal lipids were extracted with hexane/2-propanol (3/2 v/v), the solvent was evaporated, and the lipids were re-dissolved in hexane/2-propanol. The lipid samples were applied on normal phase thin layer chromatography plates and separated with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (130/30/2 v/v/v). Lipid spots were visualized by staining with iodine and identified from standards run in parallel. The cholesterol ester spots were cut into scintillation vials and counted for radioactivity with a LKB Rack-Beta liquid scintillation counter. To study the effect of cholesterol on protein translocation across the ER membrane, rough dog pancreas microsomes were incubated with different amounts of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CyD)-bound cholesterol in an in vitro protein translocation assay. As shown in Fig. 1,N-glycosylation of the C-terminal P2 domain of the model membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep, panel A) was completely blocked by 0.10 μg/μl cholesterol (panel B). Addition of cyclodextrin (Cyd) alone had no effect (panel B, lane 3). To ascertain that the inhibition of glycosylation was caused by an inhibition of translocation rather than an effect on the oligosaccharyltransferase, microsomes were subjected to alkaline extraction to assay for membrane integration of Lep (Fig. 1,panel C). In the absence of cholesterol, essentially all glycosylated molecules remained in the alkali-resistant membrane pellet (P), whereas most of the molecules were found in the supernatant (S) when translation was carried out in the presence of cholesterol. Finally, translocation of Lep was also assayed by signal peptide cleavage. For this, a construct with a signal peptidase cleavage site at the C-terminal end of an engineered H2 segment was used (the H2 sequence was … KKKKL14VPSAQA+A … where the “+” sign indicates the signal peptidase cleavage site; see Ref. 34Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, panel A). Again, translocation was completely inhibited in microsomes that were exposed to 0.10 μg/μl cholesterol (panel B). The reversibility of the cholesterol-dependent inhibition of translocation was tested by first preincubating microsomes at 30 °C for 20 min with an inhibiting concentration of cholesterol (0.10 μg/μl) followed by a second preincubation for 20 min with an excess of uncomplexed cyclodextrin to extract cholesterol back from the microsomal membranes. The treated microsomes (including the added CyD and cholesterol) were then used in a normal in vitro protein translocation assay. As shown in Fig. 3, a concentration of 5.2 μg/μl uncomplexed cyclodextrin in the second preincubation was sufficient to restore the translocation activity, showing that the inhibiting effect of cholesterol is reversible. To better define the step at which cholesterol exerts its inhibiting effect, we used Lep mRNA truncated at codon 271 (56 residues downstream of the glycosylation site) to produce nonglycosylated, translocon-bound RNCs, and then checked whether addition of cholesterol could still block full translocation (as assayed by glycosylation) after release of the nascent chain by treatment with puromycin and high salt (35Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, released nascent chains became glycosylated both in the absence (lane 5) and presence (lane 7) of cholesterol, albeit somewhat less efficiently in the latter case. It is unlikely that the cholesterol did not have time to equilibrate between the CyD-bound form and the microsomal membranes during the 10-min incubation preceding the addition of puromycin/high salt, since translocation of full-length Lep is efficiently blocked even when cholesterol is added together with Lep mRNA to the translation/translocation mix (Fig. 1). Since translation was carried out at 22 °C in this experiment rather than at 30 °C as is the experiments using full-length Lep mRNA, we also ascertained that translocation of full-length Lep was completely blocked when the same concentration of CyD-cholesterol as used with the truncated chains (0.23 μg/μl cholesterol) was included in the standard in vitro translation reaction at 22 °C (data not shown). We conclude that cholesterol has at best a marginal effect on translocation through the Sec61 translocon per se and thus that the main inhibition must be at an earlier step in the translocation pathway. Since the microsomal preparations used also contain varying levels of contaminating membranes (the sphingomyelin and unesterified cholesterol levels in the preparation were, respectively, 1.4 ± 0.05 nmol and 1.8 ± 0.05 nmol per mg of protein, suggesting some contamination by plasma membranes, endosomal membranes, and possibly by some Golgi membranes), the cholesterol levels in the ER-derived microsomes cannot be assessed by simply measuring overall cholesterol in the membrane fraction. Instead, an assay originally developed by Lange and Steck was used (18Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in which ER cholesterol is specifically esterified by the ER enzyme ACAT. Cholesterol levels were measured both in nontreated microsomes and in microsomes incubated with 2 μg of CyD-cholesterol and were found to be increased 3.7-fold in the treated sample (mean of three experiments; data not shown). Since the typical cholesterol level in the ER is about 0.2% of total cellular unesterified cholesterol (18Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), this suggests that the ER membranes in the treated microsomes contained maximally 0.8% of cellular free cholesterol equivalent. Thus, the amount of cholesterol in the ER membranes in the cholesterol-loaded microsomes is much less than the amount of cholesterol found in the plasma membrane. Depending on the cell type and assay method used, cellular plasma membranes have been reported to contain between 40 and 90% of the total cellular unesterified cholesterol (13Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Van Meer G. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes contain an intermediate level of cholesterol as compared with ER and the plasma membrane (36Colbeau A. Nachbaur J. Vignais P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 249: 462-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 37Orci L. Montesano R. Meda P. Malaisse-Lagae F. Brown D. Perrelet A. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is asymmetrically distributed within the Golgi, with greater amounts of cholesterol found in the portion of the Golgi located near the plasma membrane than in the Golgi located near the endoplasmic reticulum (37Orci L. Montesano R. Meda P. Malaisse-Lagae F. Brown D. Perrelet A. Vassalli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Compilation of published estimates of lipid content in various organelles suggest that whereas the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio in ER membranes is 0.08 or less, it is about 0.16 in Golgi membranes (38van Meer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, these values differ in cells from different tissues (see e.g. Ref. 39Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), so a direct comparison is difficult to make. Nevertheless, considering that the cholesterol-loaded microsomes in our preparations contain the equivalent of only ≤1% of the cellular free cholesterol, the cholesterol concentration of ER membranes in the loaded microsomes is most likely lower than the amount of cholesterol found in Golgi membranes. We conclude that cholesterol blocks protein translocation across microsomal membranes at a concentration that is similar to its concentration in the Golgi and significantly lower than in the plasma membrane. To further characterize the cholesterol-dependent inhibition of translocation, we used UV-inducible cross-linking to probe the interaction between RNCs and components of the translocation machinery. RNCs were prepared by translation of truncated mRNAs encoding the first 86 residues of the secretory model protein preprolactin (pPL). Lysyl-tRNAs carrying a modified εANB-lysine residue were added to the translation mix to incorporate the photoreactive εANB-Lys probe in place of lysine at positions 4, 9, 72, and 78 in pPL (Fig.5, panel A). The pPL-86-nascent chain is long enough to be efficiently targeted to the Sec61 translocon in the microsomal membrane, but is too short for signal peptide cleavage to take place (40Crowley K.S. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 41Krieg U.C. Johnson A.E. Walter P. J.

When expressed alone, E4orf4 kills transformed cells but not normal human cells. The only clear target of E4orf4 in mammalian cells is the Balpha (B55) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a member of one of three classes of regulatory B subunits. Here we report the effects of E4orf4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes two PP2A regulatory B subunits, CDC55 and RTS1, that share homology with mammalian B and B' subunits, respectively. E4orf4 expression was found to be toxic in yeast, resulting in the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase that failed to grow upon removal of E4orf4. E4orf4-expressing yeast also displayed an elongated cell morphology similar to cdc55 deletion strains. E4orf4 required CDC55 to elicit its effect, whereas RTS1 was dispensable. The recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme by E4orf4 was entirely dependent on Cdc55. These studies indicate that E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells and cell death in yeast require functional interactions with B-type subunits of PP2A. However, some inhibition of growth by E4orf4 was observed in the cdc55 strain and with an E4orf4 mutant that fails to interact with Cdc55, indicating that E4orf4 may possess a second Cdc55-independent function affecting cell growth."

Lonnerdal B. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G930-G934PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the iron binding capacity of Lf, a variety of other biological functions are attributed to Lf by as yet unknown mechanisms. For example, Lf exerts several effects on the inflammatory and immune responses against various tumors (2Baynes R. Bezwoda W. Khan Q. Mansoor N. Scand. J. Haematol. 1986; 36: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During this process, circulating levels of Lf increase significantly. On the other hand, Lf has been reported to act as an inhibitor of cytokine response in vitro at a very low concentration by suppressing the release of cytokines such as interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (3Machnicki M. Zimecki M. Zagulski T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1993; 74: 433-439PubMed Google Scholar). Lf also may act as a potent activator of natural killer cells and a direct inhibitor of tumor cell growth (4Bezault J. Bhimani R. Wiprovnick J. Furmanski P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2310-2312PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the balanced synthesis and exocrine secretion of the Lf in the cell suggest its precise roles in various biological systems. A previous report revealed that Lf enters the cell from the serum and is transported into the nucleus where it binds to DNA (5Garre C. Bianchi-Scarra G. Sirito M. Musso M. Ravazzolo R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently random DNA sequences capable of binding to Lf have been demonstrated, which may imply an Lf-mediated regulation of gene expression (6He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, little information on naturally occurring target genes that are directly responsive to Lf is available. Therefore, we have investigated one of the roles of Lf as a multifunctional regulatory protein. To do so, the exogenous human neutrophil Lf gene was overexpressed in various mammalian cells. There is considerable interest in the role of Lf because it acts as a trans-activator for the expression of a subset of responsive genes, particularly AP-1-inducible genes such as fibroblast collagenase-1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). The MMP1 exerts important effects on physiological and pathological conditions of cells including tumor metastasis (7Birkeda-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), although its exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we have focused on the elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which the overexpressed Lf mediates the stimulation of MMP1 production. Nested deletion and point mutations have allowed us to narrow down the Lf-responsive promoter region of the MMP1 gene to a specific element. By performing EMSA, we have attempted to see whether Lf could interact directly or indirectly with the promoter of the target gene. To test potential roles for specific signaling pathways in mediating Lf-induced gene expression, we have used several specific kinase inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant forms of kinase cDNAs. We demonstrate here that the activation of stress-activated MAPK signaling pathways by Lf plays a crucial role in the up-regulation of the MMP1 gene. Balb/c-3T3, HeLa, Jurkat, and COS-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown and transfected using DEAE-dextran (8Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), an equal amount (5 μg) of the human neutrophil Lf expression vector pLf, and CAT construct. Cotransfection with the pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (0.5 μg per transfection) and cytofluorometric analysis of β-galactosidase activity were performed to normalize for transfection efficiency. CAT activities were quantitated with a liquid scintillation counter. CAT assay data are averages of at least three separate experiments. Long term Lf-expressing cell lines, B-hLf2 and H-hLf6, were cloned by stably cotransfecting Balb/c and HeLa cells with either pLf or pCI-neo, respectively, by the calcium phosphate method (9Wilson L. Flyer D. Faller D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and followed by selecting desired clones with medium containing geneticin (G418). Both B-hLf2 and H-hLf6 cells were maintained in the complete medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418. Geneticin, TPA, poly(dI-dC), acetyl-CoA, SB203580, PD98059, and U0126 were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid pLf was the generous gift of P. Furmanski (6He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCollCAT-517 and MMP1 probe were generously provided by P. Angel (10Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell.

The 5′ deletion mutant plasmids pCollCAT-517, pCollCAT-296, pCollCAT-177, and pCollCAT-73 contain −517/+63, −296/+63, −177/+63, and −73/+63, respectively, of MMP1 promoter fragment in a promoterless CAT expression vector. Plasmids pMCP-1-CAT (JE2600), IL-2-CAT, and pCollCAT-70 were described elsewhere (11Timmers H.T.M. Pronk G. Bos J. Van der Eb A.

Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of Balb/c-pCI-neo and B-hLf2 cells were prepared by the method of Andrews and Faller (15Andrews N. Faller D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (12Weng H. Choi S. Faller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13637-13644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides with an AP-1 consensus binding site (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and reannealed by heating and cooling them down to the room temperature. A DNA fragment of the MMP1 gene promoter cut with PvuII/BamHI was used as either a probe or an unlabeled competitor. A DNA oligonucleotide specially designed for Lf binding (5′-CGCTTGAGGCACTTGCGCCGGAA-3′) contained the artificial Lf binding sequence (6He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and was prepared as described above. Iron-saturated Lf protein was purchased from Sigma. After washing cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested and solubilized in a SDS sample buffer. An 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% type A gelatin (Sigma) was used for gelatin zymograms. After running the gel at 4 °C, the gels were washed twice in 100 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h and incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2). Gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa or H-hLf6 cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl extraction method (12Weng H. Choi S. Faller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13637-13644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification were performed by using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sequences of primers used in the PCR were as follows: human MMP1, 5′-GGTGATGAAGCAGCCCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGTAGAATGGGAGAGTC-3′ (antisense); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′ (antisense). JNK activity in cell lysates was determined by immunocomplex protein kinase assays using the substrate glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun (16Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Dickens M. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Cellular lysates of the BALB/c-pCI-neo and B-hLf2 cells were prepared, and each 100 μg of cellular protein was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and probed with the anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-73) antibody (New England Biolabs). The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and checked with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were exposed to Kodak x-ray film for 3–5 min. Anti-JNK1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). To identify Lf-responsive promoters, a set of putative gene promoters linked to the reporter gene CAT was cotransfected with an Lf expression vector (pLf). Transcriptional activities of the MMP1 and MCP-1 gene promoters (Fig. 1 A, compare pCollCAT-517 and MCP-1-CAT, respectively) were stimulated at least 30–40-fold, whereas the interleukin-2 gene promoter was not affected by the Lf expression in Balb/c fibroblast cells. To examine the influences of Lf on the expression of endogenous cellular genes, Balb/c and HeLa cells were stably transfected with pLf. As expected, after neomycin selection, the resulting stable transfectants (designated B-hLf2 and H-hLf6) were found to express Lf protein (data not shown). Expression of MMP1 mRNA was elevated 15-fold in H-hLf6 as compared with the expression of the control gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as shown by RT-PCRs, which generated a 438-base pair product with a primer pair for the MMP1 coding region (Fig. 1 B). In COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pLf, the level of the MMP1 enzyme activity was also increased as measured by the zymography (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that the Lf acts as a transcriptional activator of the MMP1 gene in intact cells and functions in trans. The promoter of the TPA-inducible MMP1 gene was further analyzed to identify a cis-acting element for the Lf. A putative responsive region on the MMP1 gene promoter was identified by deletion analysis. Nested deletion of the MMP1 gene promoter linked to the reporter gene CAT up to the TPA-responsive element (TRE) (−73 to −67, TGAGTCA) preserved a moderately high inducibility of the chimeric gene by Lf (Fig. 2 A). The pCollCAT-73 construct spanning the −73/+63 region, which contains an active TRE, showed the weakest Lf-responsive activity as compared with other constructs with longer promoters. However, deletion of the first three nucleotides in the TRE (−70/+63) resulted in the reduction by 80% in Lf-responsive trans-activation (Fig. 2 B). Removal of the entire TRE immediately upstream of the TATA box (−60/+63) almost abolished all trans-activation by Lf. These observations indicate that the TRE or TRE-like sequence is required for the trans-activation of the MMP1 gene promoter by Lf. We were interested in elucidating the mechanism of MMP1 trans-activation by Lf. Other workers have shown that Lf can bind to DNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that Lf-induced trans-activation of MMP1 resulted from direct interaction of Lf with TRE or TRE-like sequences. To address this hypothesis, EMSAs were performed using radiolabeled TRE probes in the presence of highly purified iron-saturated Lf proteins (Fig. 3 A). However, neither the TRE consensus oligonucleotides nor the DNA fragment containing the −73/+63 region of the MMP1 gene promoter bound to Lf under the condition in which the artificial DNA oligonucleotides specially designed for Lf binding were efficiently bound (6He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The lack of binding to the TRE consensus sequences suggested that Lf-mediated trans-activation of the MMP1 promoter did not involve direct binding of Lf to the TRE. However, it was observed that AP-1 binding activity was greatly enhanced in B-hLf2 cells expressing Lf (Fig. 3 B). Lf-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity almost disappeared with the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of either the unlabeled TRE consensus oligonucleotides or the fragment of minimal MMP1 gene promoter. This experiment implies that up-regulation of MMP1 by Lf may be mediated through an alteration of either the activity or the level of AP-1 instead of a direct binding of Lf to DNA and that Lf may influence the AP-1 activation pathway. Many transcription factors including c-Jun, c-Fos, and ATF2 are effectors of three distinct groups of MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 MAPK, and JNK. To determine whether Lf-induced AP-1 activation possibly resulted from activation of any one of the MAPK pathways, the effect of specific kinase inhibitors (SB203580, PD98059, and U0126) was tested. As measured by EMSAs using nuclear extracts from B-hLf2 cells treated with SB203580, which is a specific inhibitor of p38α (SAPK2a) and its isoform p38β (SAPK2b) but which has no inhibitory effect on SAPK3 and SAPK4 (17Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T. Young P. Lee J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar), AP-1 DNA binding activity was reduced by about 50% as compared with control extracts (from cells that received only Me2SO) (Fig. 4 A). This result suggests that Lf-induced AP-1 activation is, at least in large part, p38 MAPK-mediated. In contrast, both PD98059 (18Alessi D. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar) and U0126 (19Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), which specifically inhibit phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2, had little effect on the AP-1 activity. MKK4 is an essential component of the JNK signal transduction pathway and also activates p38 MAPK (20Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was anticipated that interfering with the MKK4 activity by overexpression of the dominant-negative MKK4 (SEK1) might cause the inhibition of downstream pathways implicated in both JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Fig. 4 B demonstrates that the transient cotransfection of Balb/c cells with pLf and dominant-negative SEK1 selectively blocked AP-1 binding, indicating the involvement of stress-activated MAPK signaling modules in Lf-induced AP-1 activation. Furthermore, the expression of dominant-negative JNK1 inhibited the ability of Lf to trans-activate the MMP1 (Fig. 4 C). To confirm that the activated AP-1 observed in cells expressing Lf resulted from the activated JNK, the phosphorylation levels of c-Jun in lysates were determined. In B-hLf2 cells, JNK strongly phosphorylated Ser-73 of the c-Jun NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 4 D, upper panel). Moreover, Lf expression in B-hLf2 cells caused a marked increase in JNK1 protein kinase activity (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). Human Lf has been implicated in various biological processes including the regulation of cell growth and inflammation as well as the primary defense against bacterial infection (21Baveye S. Elass E. Mazurier J. Legrand D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lf has been considered to exert a control function in the balance of cellular components as a nuclear factor (6He J. Furmanski P. Nature. 1995; 373: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 22Damiens E. el Yazidi I. Mazurier E. Duthille I. Spik G. Boilly-Marer Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that sequence-specific binding of Lf to DNA occurs under stringent conditions. Here we demonstrate that overexpressed Lf is capable of regulating the expression of the MCP-1 and MMP1 genes, which are implicated in inflammation and metastasis (23Graves D.T. Jiang Y.L. Williamson M.J. Valente A.J. Science. 1989; 245: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe H. Nakanishi I. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that Lf specifically trans-activates MMP1, an AP-1-inducible gene, by altering the DNA binding properties of AP-1 in both fibroblasts and T lymphocytes. The biological significance of the up-regulation of the MMP1 gene by Lf is unclear. Circulating levels of Lf increase significantly during the inflammatory process (2Baynes R. Bezwoda W. Khan Q. Mansoor N. Scand. J. Haematol. 1986; 36: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally activated leukocytes and many tumor cells secrete large amounts of the metalloproteinases (25Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the activation of MCP-1 and MMP1 genes in response to Lf may be involved in physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis (3Machnicki M. Zimecki M. Zagulski T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1993; 74: 433-439PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liotta L. Steeg P. Stetler-Stevenson W. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). In this study, we also found that Lf required a TRE site for the trans-activation of the MMP1 gene and that AP-1 binding activity was substantially enhanced in cells expressing Lf. AP-1 activity in cells is known to be regulated by upstream signal transduction pathways such as the MAPK cascades (20Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed likely that Lf-mediated AP-1 activation might be mediated via known signaling networks. Our studies with specific kinase inhibitor drugs and dominant-negative components of the MKK4 pathway indicated that both JNK and p38 MAPK might contribute to Lf-induced AP-1 activation. Consistent with a role for MKK4 in Lf-responsive AP-1 activation, the MKK4 effector kinase JNK was activated by Lf. Together these data strongly suggest that SAPK and c-Jun may mainly mediate the Lf-induced signaling pathway. We do not rule out the possibility that the SAPK can also activate other transcription factors such as Elk1, MEF2c, and ATF2 so that their subsequent transcriptional and/or posttranslational targets in turn may contribute indirectly to the activation of AP-1 in cells expressing Lf (27Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The transcriptional targets of the Lf-mediated SAPK signaling pathway have not been fully established. However, we have observed that human neutrophil Lf greatly up-regulated AP-1-inducible inflammatory mediator cytokines and some particular genes in the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. 2S.-M. Oh and S.-Y. Choi, manuscript in preparation. Although the biological functions of Lf have been controversial (3Machnicki M. Zimecki M. Zagulski T. Int. J. Exp.

Res. 2000; 86: 921-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), our new results suggest an important role for Lf in gene regulation and eventually cellular activity. We demonstrated that the constitutively overexpressed Lf induced the MKK4-SAPK signaling pathway leading to AP-1 activation and MCP-1 expression. The increased expression of chemoattractants such as MCP-1 by the AP-1 causes leukocyte recruitment, resulting in the enhancement of the inflammatory response by releasing the protease MMP1 (25Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This AP-1-induced expression of MMP1 is likely to have a number of consequences, including remodeling of matrix, oxidative burst, and cell injury (29Babior B.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). It is likely that the circulating level of Lf is an important factor for the regulation of Lf-induced genes. Indeed, the effect of Lf on natural killer cell cytotoxicity depends on the level of Lf (30Damiens E. Mazurier E. El Yazidi I. Masson M. Duthille I. Spik G. Boilly-Marer Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multihormone signaling pathways may be involved in modulating Lf gene activity and its circulating level, and the activated human blood lymphocytes may express Lf receptors (31Faucheux B. Nillesse N. Damier P. Spik G. Mouatt-Prigent A. Pierce A. Leveugle B. Kubis N. Hauw J. Agid Y. Hirsch E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The autocrine property of the Lf molecule and its role in the specific gene activation imply the involvement of Lf receptors in further upstream signaling immediately following binding of Lf to its receptor. Therefore, studies are under way to investigate whether the expression level of Lf and its translocation through the receptor will be crucially related with the cellular activity in the response to a variety of stresses.

https://openalex.org/W2063024363,"A recently reported chitinase gene, expressed in the infective, third-stage (L3) larvae of the human filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus, belongs to the family 18 glycosyl hydrolases and has been designated Ov-chi-1. The gene product of Ov-chi-1 is chitinolytic. Allosamidin ablates activity of the native enzyme in a dose-dependent manner but did not significantly inhibit the moulting of L3 larvae. Mono-specific antibodies were used to characterize Ov-CHI-1 as a 60-kDa protein expressed almost exclusively in L3 stages. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Ov-CHI-1 expression is initiated in late L2 larvae and increases markedly in infective, L3 larvae. It is synthesized exclusively in the glandular esophagus and stored within discrete secretory granules. Secretion occurs through de-granulation during post-infective development, and the primary route of transport appears to be via the pseudo-coelom. An orthologue of Ov-chi-1 was detected in Caenorhabditis elegansby BLAST analysis. It is constitutively expressed at a low level and is overexpressed in dauer larvae and embryonated eggs. It is chitinolytic. We conclude that Ov-CHI-1 is a highly stage-specific enzyme that may have a role in infectivity of the parasite, aiding escape from the vector or participating in early post-infective migration and/or development. The identification of an orthologue in C. elegans opens the way for further studies into the biological function(s) of this intriguing parasite product.

They belong to the O-glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.14), a widespread group of enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety (1Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A new classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on similarities in amino acid sequences has been put forward (2Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar). This groups the five known chitinase classes into two glycosyl hydrolase families, each of which exhibits a strict conservation of the catalytic machinery and enzymatic mechanism. Chitinases of family 18 (class III and V) operate with retention of the anomeric configuration, whereas family 19 members (class I, II, and IV) invert the configuration at the hydrolysis site (3Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 4Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Hennig M. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Chitinases of family 18 have been well studied, with information available on the three-dimensional structure and the biochemistry of the enzyme reaction. This progress can be applied to the other members of the family, thereby enhancing an understanding of their individual roles. Chitinases have been detected in several parasitic organisms, including malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), hemoflagellate protozoa (Leishmania and Trypanosoma), and filarial nematodes (5Huber M. Caabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Schlein Y. Jacobson R.L. Shlomai J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

Interestingly, all of these taxa are transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods, in which the internal tissues are bound by chitinous material. Several experiments have pointed to a relationship between chitinase and parasite transmission (10Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D.C. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Schlein Y. Jacobs-Lorena R.L. Parasitol.

The evidence, however, in the filarial nematodes is more complex because of the existence of multiple genes and a spectrum of tissue and stage-specific expression patterns (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Fuhrman J.A. Lane W.S. Smith R.F. Piessens W.F. Perler F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Hyg. 1997; 56: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The interest in filarial chitinases stems primarily from their potential as a drug or vaccination target. For example, immunization with a recombinant chitinase expressed by the microfilariae of Brugia malayi induces partial protection against microfilaremia in Mongolian Jirds. DNA vaccination with the chitinase gene that is the subject of this report induces significant protection against the infective, third stage (L3)1 larvae of Onchocerca volvulus in mice (15Harrison R. Wu Y. Egerton G. Bianco A.E. Vaccine. 1999; 18: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast with the B. malayi chitinase, the O. volvulus chitinase is expressed by developing larvae (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was cloned by PCR using primers based on an L3-specific chitinase from the rodent filaria,Acanthocheilonema viteae (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By using the established nomenclature proposed by Blaxter and colleagues (16Blaxter M.L. Guiliano D. Scott A. Williams S. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 416-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this gene has been designated Ov-chi-1. It is the first chitinase gene to have been cloned from Onchocerca parasites, although the presence of a chitinase in the reproductive tract of Onchocerca gibsoni has been known for a number of years (17Gooday G.W. Brydon L.J. Chappell L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18King T.P. Brydon L. Gooday G.W. Chappell L.H. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Filarial nematodes are important human pathogens, and O. volvulus is one of the most significant from a public health perspective, causing the condition known as “River Blindness” that is characterized by skin and ocular pathology (19Connor D, H. George G.H. Gibson D.W. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1985; 7: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Thylefors B. Bull. W. H. O. 1978; 56: 63-73PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the superfamily Filarioidea, it is a highly specialized parasite with a life cycle involving development in both arthropods and vertebrates. The infective L3 larvae are the stage involved in transmission from blackflies (Simulium spp.) to humans. Gene products expressed by infective larvae are therefore of particular interest. Ov-CHI-1 was identified as an orthologue of a chitinase in A. viteae that is synthesized and secreted coincident with the timing of transmission (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the characteristics of the chitinase in the human parasite had not been determined. In this paper, we describe the biology of expression and secretion of the O. volvulus enzyme. This exhibits many parallels with the A. viteae chitinase and suggests that chitinases may be important products of infective larvae for some filarial species, contributing to infectivity of L3 larvae for their vertebrate hosts. Adult worms and microfilariae of O. volvulus were recovered from nodules excised from patients attending a clinic at the Medical Research Laboratories in Kumba, Cameroon (as part of a clinical management program). Microfilariae were purified on discontinuous Percoll gradients, as described (21Medina-De la Garza C.E. Brattig N.W. Tischendorf F.W. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1987; 38: 53-54PubMed Google Scholar). Blackflies (Simulium damnosum s.l.) infected with O. volvulus developing larvae were obtained from the Medical Research Laboratory at Kumba, Cameroon (courtesy of Drs. S. Lustigman and P. Enyong). Cryopreserved infective larvae were supplied by Dr. Lustigman (New York Blood Center), operating an Onchocerciasis Resources Project on behalf of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (New York). The related filaria, A. viteae was obtained from a laboratory-adapted cycle maintained in Mongolian jirds (Meriones unguiculatus) and argasid ticks (Ornithodorus tartakovskyi). L3 larvae were obtained from ticks infected at least 28 days previously. Adult worms were recovered from the subcutaneous tissues of jirds 60 days or greater following infection.B. malayi adult worms and microfilariae (supplied by TRS Laboratories) were obtained from Mongolian jirds 90 days or more after infection. L3 larvae were obtained from mosquitoes 12–15 days after infection (22Ibrahim M.S. Richie T.L. Scott A.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The full-length Ov-chi-1 cDNA was obtained from an O. volvulus L3 cDNA library in λUni-ZAP ER (courtesy of Professor Steve Williams, Smith College) as described (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This was amplified from the bacteriophage DNA by PCR using forward (5′GGGAAGCTTGGTTATGTTCGAGGATG3′) and reverse (5′GGATCCAAATCATTTGCATCTATT3′) primers corresponding with the ends of the open reading frame sequence. The amplified product was subcloned into the TA vector, pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, The Netherlands). The insert from pCR2.1-TOPO was re-amplified to subclone it into the expression vector expression vector, pJC40 (23Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For this, forward (5′GGGCATATGCGAATTGGAGCTATG3′) and reverse (5′GGATCCAAATCATTTGCATCTATT3′) primers were used, into which were incorporated NdeI and BamHI sites to aid directional cloning. Digestion with NdeI and BamHI resulted in two fragments due to an internal NdeI site, a 5′ fragment (1107 base pairs) and a 3′ fragment (528 base pairs). Each of these fragments were ligated into pJC40 and expressed. A full-length cDNA insert was also generated by partial NdeI and BamHI digestion and was expressed in pJC40. Because of spontaneous truncation of the protein product (see below), a further construct was made based on sequences downstream of the signal peptide. An insert corresponding with the mature protein was generated by amplification using the alternative forward primer 5′GAAGCTTGGTTATGTTCGAGGATG3′. Each of the constructs in pJC40 were transformed into Escherichia coli DE3 cells, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and expressed as a fusion with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel column (Probond resin, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies to recombinant Ov-CHI-1 proteins were produced in rabbits by immunization with 100 μg of antigen emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant (for the first inoculation) or Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (subsequent inoculations). Antigens were administered by subcutaneous injection on each of three occasions, at intervals of 3 weeks. Rabbits were bled 8 days after boosting. Specificity of the antibodies was tested by probing immunoblots of recombinant proteins and parasite extracts (see below). Proteins were extracted from parasites by boiling for 5 min in electrophoresis sample buffer (3% (w/v) SDS, 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% (v/v) glycerol) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 ×g. Extracts were fractionated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels using the Tris glycine-SDS system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with molecular mass markers (94 kDa, phosphorylase b; 67 kDa, bovine serum albumin; 43 kDa, ovalbumin; 30 kDa, carbonic anhydrase; 20 kDa, soybean trypsin inhibitor; 14 kDa, α-lactalbumin). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked by overnight incubation in 5% fetal calf serum in Tris/saline/Tween (TST: 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.5, 0.15m sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20) (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with rabbit antisera to Ov-CHI-1 at 1:3000 dilution in TST. Control blots were probed with preimmune rabbit IgG. Goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy + light chain) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Nordic, 1:2000) was used to localize antibody-antigen complexes. Blots were developed using 0.05% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution. Adult worms within nodules, developing larvae within blackflies (from day 1 to day 8 post-transmission), and post-infective larvae in culture (described below) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.075 m sodium cacodylate buffer and embedded for immunoelectron microscopy, as described (26Jenkins R.E. Taylor M.J. Gilvary N. Bianco A.E. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1996; 18: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sections (90 nm) mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids were reacted with rabbit antisera to recombinant Ov-CHI-1 serially diluted from 1:200 to 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Control sections were probed with normal rabbit serum, antisera to unrelated antigens, and the incubation buffer alone. Antibody-antigen complexes were revealed by reaction with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10, 15, or 20 nm gold (British Biocell). Sections were counterstained in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate solution. Chitinase activity in parasite extracts was measured using glycol-chitin substrate gel electrophoresis (27Trudel J. Asselin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Extracts of larvae were prepared in sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), without 2-mercaptoethanol or boiling, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8–20% gradient gels containing 0.01% (w/v) glycol chitin. Following electrophoresis, gels were immersed in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The gels were stained for glycol chitin with calcofluor white M2R (Sigma) in 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, and de-stained in water. Ultraviolet light was used to excite the fluorochrome and reveal dark bands of lysis corresponding to chitinolytic activity. O. volvulusinfective L3 larvae were homogenized in 200 μl of ice-cold 0.1m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.2. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was assayed for chitinase activity using the method of Robbins et al. (28Robbins P.W. Albright C. Benfield B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions containing soluble extract from 100 L3 larvae in 200 μl were set up with 20 μl of the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N′,N""-trisaccharide (4-MU-[GlcNAc]3) to give a final concentration of 20 μm. For assays of enzyme inhibition, a solution of allosamidin was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 1, 2, or 4 nm. Reactions were run for 4 h at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 0.1 mglycine-NaOH, pH 10.4. Fluorescence was measured immediately at 350 nm excitation, 440 nm emission in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model L330 Luminescence Spectrometer. The standard curve was constructed using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) in glycine buffer. Similar procedures were used to detect chitinolytic activity in extracts of Caenorhabditis elegans. Cryopreserved O. volvulus and Onchocerca ochengi (a closely related cattle parasite) infective L3 larvae were prepared for in vitro culture to promote further differentiation and moulting, equivalent to that seen following transmission to the vertebrate host (29Strote G. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1987; 38: 211-213PubMed Google Scholar, 30Strote G. Bonow I. Parasitol. Res. 1991; 77: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thawed larvae were washed three times by centrifugation (750 rpm for 5 min) and resuspension in tissue culture medium comprising an equal ratio of NCTC-135 and IMDM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. Single larvae was added to individual wells of a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Nunc, Life Technologies, Inc.) each containing 1.5 × 104 bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the same medium. The larvae were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and examined microscopically every 24 h for 8 days in order to assess moulting. The effects of allosamidin (31Sakuda S. Isogai A. Matsumoto S. Suzuki A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) on moulting were tested by addition of the inhibitor to the culture medium at concentrations between 5 and 5000 nm. To establish whether allosamidin could penetrated the filarial cuticle, a culture of A. viteae L3 larvae was set up with biotinylated allosamidin at a concentration 5000 nm (32Sakuda S. Sakurada M. Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2987-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A second culture was run in parallel in the absence of biotinylated inhibitor, as a negative control. Larvae were fixed for immunoelectron microscopy after 3–7 days. Ultrathin sections were processed with goat anti-biotin-conjugated gold (British Biocell) at a concentration of 1:200. Conditions for growth and maintenance of the C. elegans N2 strain are described by Brenner (33Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Life cycle stages of the worm were prepared as described by Wood et al. (34Wood W.B. the Community of Caenorhabditis elegans ResearchersThe Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-596Google Scholar). C. elegans chitinase cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using an oligo(dT) primer as the first-strand anchor and a C. elegans chitinase-specific primer (5′AAGCTTAGCTACATCAGACCGTGCTAC3′) deduced from the reported sequence (GenBankTM accession number U42835). The recombinant protein was expressed, and the antiserum was produced as described above. Family 18 glycosyl hydrolases possess a consensus pattern in their primary amino acid sequence (LIVMFY)(DN)G(LIVMF)(DN)(LIVMF)(DN)XE in which glutamic acid is the critical active site residue (described in the PROSITE data base). To test whether Ov-CHI-1 belongs to family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, we compared the inferred amino acid sequence with that from other members of the family. Three other sequences were included in the comparison as follows: human macrophage chitotriosidase (GenBankTM accession number U29615) (35Boot R.G. Renkema H. Strijland A. Jan Van Zonneveld A. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar); B. malayi microfilarial chitinase (GenBankTM accession number M73689); and an uncharacterized open reading frame from C. elegans(GenBankTM accession number U42835) annotated as a family 18 glycosyl hydrolase. An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Ov-chi-1 with those from C. elegansand human is shown in Fig. 1 (an alignment of Ov-chi-1 with the B. malayi sequence has been published previously (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The amino acid identity between O. volvulus and B. malayi chitinases is 65%, between O. volvulus and C. elegans is 36%, and between O. volvulus and human chitotriosidase is 30%. The region of greatest similarity occurs in the N-terminal segment of the sequence downstream of the signal peptidase cleavage site. Extensive sequence similarity also occurs throughout most of the open reading frame, with the exception of a region between amino acids 388 and 445 where there is higher degree of degeneracy (and insertions/deletions among the sequences). The family 18 consensus pattern occurs in each of the genes, between amino acids 139–148 in O. volvulus, 140–149 in B. malayi, 171–180 in C. elegans, and 132–141 in human (as numbered in Fig. 1). The active site glutamic acid residue is conserved in all species. Native Ov-CHI-1 obtained from extracts of O. volvulus L3 larvae demonstrates chitinolytic activity as determined by glycol chitin substrate gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). Enzyme activity was observed as two bands of hydrolysis at apparent molecular masses of 61 and 58 kDa. The enzyme activity from O. volvulus L3 larvae was relatively low compared with A. viteae based on signal intensities in this assay. In Fig. 2 A, the loading for O. volvulus represents enzyme derived from 800 larvae. The loading for A. viteae is equivalent to 100 larvae. Even taking into account the greater size of A. viteae, it is apparent that the O. volvulus enzyme is less active or abundant (or both). There is an apparent difference in the molecular mass of the chitinases from L3 larvae of O. volvulus (60 kDa) and A. viteae (75 kDa) as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The difference seen in Fig. 2 A is confirmed by the immunoblots in Fig. 4. Because the predicted molecular sizes from the amino acid sequences are similar (56 and 58 kDa respectively), it is possible that there are differences at the level of post-translational modification. There is evidence of N-linked glycosylation for the enzyme from A. viteae (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem.

Allosamidin is a glycoside antibiotic that has been shown to be a strong, competitive inhibitor of chitinases from insects and yeast (36Somers P.J.B. Yao R.C. Doolin L.E. McGowan M.J. Fukudas D.S.

Parasitol. 1988; 29: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the current experiments, it inhibited the chitinolytic activity of O. volvulus L3 extracts in a dose-dependent manner; there was a 70% inhibition of activity at 2 nm allosamidin in the presence of 20 μm substrate and complete ablation of activity at 5 nm allosamidin. Previously, it has been shown that the chitinase from A. viteae L3 larvae is expressed during differentiation in the intermediate host and secreted 3–6 days after entry into the phase of development in the vertebrate host (simulated by in vitro culture conditions (8Wu Y. Adam R. Williams S.A. Bianco A.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The high levels of secretion decline sharply coincident with the time of larval moulting. This suggests that the chitinase expressed by L3 larvae may be involved in either moulting or egress from the vector (via the mouth parts) during transmission. To test whether Ov-CHI-1 is involved in the moulting process, cultures were set up in the presence and absence of allosamidin (TableI). The in vitro moulting experiments demonstrate that at a concentration of inhibitor (5 nm) that virtually ablates activity of the extracted enzyme (Fig. 2 B), there is no effect on moulting (Table I). Moreover, a concentration of allosamidin of 3 orders of magnitude greater still did not depress moulting (Table I). At both concentrations, there was no apparent effect on larval viability (data not shown).Table IThe effect of exogenous exposure to allosamidin on moulting of O. volvulus and O. ochengi infective larvae was tested in vitroAllosamidin05 nm5000 nmO. volvulus47%44%31%O. ochengi47%66%69%Overall30/6436/6432/64Cultures were maintained for 8 days at 37 °C.

The rates of larval moulting in control samples are typical. It was demonstrated that allosamidin penetrated the cuticle of filarial larvae, in an experiment utilizing L3 stages of A. viteaeincubated in biotinylated allosamidin. Larvae examined by immunoelectron microscopy revealed labeling throughout the cuticle and hypodermis after exposure to the biotinylated inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). No labeling occurred in sections of worms from a control culture lacking inhibitor (Fig. 3 A). Four recombinant proteins (3′-protein and 5′-protein, spontaneously truncated full-length protein and stable full-length protein) generated from different fragments of Ov-chi-1 were used to raise anti-chitinase antibodies in rabbits. Their reactivity was determined by immunoblot analysis, as shown in Fig. 4. Antibodies raised against the 5′-construct (Fig. 4 A) reacted, as expected, with the full-length protein (lane 4) and the portion used to immunize (lane 2) but not with the 3′-protein (lane 1). There was strong reactivity with the spontaneously truncating full-length construct (lane 3), implying that the N-terminal end of the truncated protein was preserved. Antibodies raised against the 3′-construct (Fig. 4 B) reacted, as expected, with the full-length protein (lane 4) and the portion used to immunize (lane 1) but not with the 5′-construct (lane 2). Thus, the 5′- and 3′-constructs appear to be antigenically distinct. There was a weak response with the truncated product (lane 3) suggesting that at least some of the carboxyl end of the truncated protein was preserved. Antibodies raised against the truncated protein reacted in a similar manner to the 5′-construct (data not shown). Further characterization of the truncation was not attempted, although sequencing of the insert c"
https://openalex.org/W2320252828,"SH3 and SAM domains are protein interaction motifs that are predominantly seen in signaling molecules, adaptors, and scaffold proteins. We have identified a novel family of putative adaptor genes that includes HACS1. HACS1 encodes a 441 amino acid protein that is differentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and has restricted expression in human tissues. Its SH3 domain is most similar to the same motif in Crk and its SAM domain shares homology with a family of uncharacterized putative scaffold and adaptor proteins. HACS1 maps to human chromosome 21q11.2 in a region that is frequently disrupted by translocation events in hematopoietic malignancies. Polyclonal antibodies against HACS1 recognized a 49.5 kDa protein whose mRNA is expressed in human immune tissues, bone marrow, heart, lung, placenta and brain. Cell lines and primary cells from acute myeloid leukemias and multiple myeloma patients express HACS1. Immunostaining and cellular fractionation studies localized the HACS1 protein predominantly to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2030046256,"Understanding the role for DNA methylation in tumorigenesis has evolved from defining the location and extent of methylation in a variety of cancer-related genes to clarifying the functional and site-specific effects of aberrant methylation on gene expression. Our objectives were to characterize the functional effects of DNA methylation in the BRCA1 promoter and to clarify the functional status of the BRCA1 CRE (cAMP response element) motif. Luciferase reporter assays confirm that an intact CRE is important for BRCA1 expression in transient transfections. Luciferase activities were decreased in constructs where the CRE recognition sequence was altered and when constructs were methylated in vitro. Gel mobility shift and competition assays identified a DNA-protein complex recognizing the CRE motif that we were able to supershift using CREB-specific antibody. Furthermore this CRE is methylation sensitive, and we localized this methylation effect to a CpG dinucleotide within the BRCA1 CRE motif. The consequences of aberrant DNA methylation at specific transcription factor motifs, along with the multiple mutational events that can occur in a variety of essential genes such as BRCA1, paint a complex picture where both genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to tumour formation."

Conversely, enrichment of cell membrane gangliosides by ganglioside preincubation enhanced growth factor-elicited cell proliferation. In the absence of serum and growth factors, NeuNAcα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4(NeuNAcα2–3)Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1Cer (GD1a) acted like a growth factor when cells were pretreated with the ganglioside, stimulating proliferation of normal human dermal fibroblasts and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, growth inhibition was observed when high concentrations of gangliosides were continuously present in the culture medium during incubation of fibroblasts with growth factors (Li, R., Manela, J., Kong, Y., and Ladisch, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 34213–34223). Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby gangliosides elicit proliferation-coupled signaling in normal human dermal fibroblasts. Incubation of the fibroblasts with GD1a enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor autophosphorylation and Ras and MAPK activation in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of the cells to GD1a also enhanced the phosphorylation of Elk-1 by the activated MAPK. Brief pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 blocked the enhancing effect of gangliosides on EGF-induced MAPK activation. In the absence of serum and growth factors, GD1a incubation induced phosphorylation of Src kinase, Ras activation, and phosphorylation of MAPK and Elk-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of Src kinase was confirmed by enhanced Src kinase activity. Brief treatment of the cells with PP1 blocked the activation of Src kinase and MAPK. Again, PD98059 treatment inhibited ganglioside-elicited MAPK phosphorylation.

The receptors for most growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 are transmembrane tyrosine-specific protein kinases. They all share a crucial signaling pathway that runs from the cell surface to the nucleus. The binding of a growth factor to its tyrosine kinase receptor on the cell surface results in receptor trans autophosphorylation and activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK cascade (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). This cascade passes the signal to the nucleus through phosphorylation of transcription factors that regulate gene expression, eventually leading to DNA synthesis and cell division (2Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar,3Lopez-llasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In addition, the activated receptor tyrosine kinase may also activate other intracellular signaling proteins, including phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Src-like non-receptor tyrosine kinase (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Non-receptor tyrosine kinases,e.g. Src, have no extracellular or transmembrane domains but possess modular domains that are responsible for subcellular targeting and regulation of catalytic activity (4Hubbard S.R.

Thus, one important issue is to investigate how membrane lipids interact with receptor molecules at the cell surface and initiate signaling for cells to proliferate. Cell surface gangliosides exist in glycosphingolipid-enriched domains and modulate transmembrane signaling (10Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Hakomori S. Yamamura S. Handa A.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Our recent study provides a new perspective on the biological effect of gangliosides on cell proliferation (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of cellular ganglioside synthesis that conceivably abolishes ganglioside domain formation blocks growth factor-mediated cell proliferation. Conversely, enrichment of cell membrane gangliosides by ganglioside incubation that conceivably promotes ganglioside domain formation enhances growth factor-elicited cell proliferation. Strikingly, gangliosides themselves exert a growth factor-like effect in the absence of serum and growth factors, enhancing fibroblast proliferation. However, the mechanisms remain to be investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine how gangliosides stimulate fibroblast proliferation. We tested two specific hypotheses: (i) Interaction of gangliosides with EGF receptors in plasma membrane enhances EGF-receptor phosphorylation and MAPK activation. (ii) Gangliosides stimulate non-receptor Src kinase and initiate proliferation signaling. The present study demonstrates that gangliosides enhance epidermal growth factor signaling and activate Src kinase. EGF (6 kDa, mouse submaxillary glands, receptor grade) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and reconstituted with serum-free medium. The stock solution was stored at −70 °C. EGF was directly added to the culture medium by diluting the stock solutions before use. GD1a, GT1b (bovine brain), GM3, GD3, and lactosylceramide (bovine buttermilk) were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). 2The gangliosides used are abbreviated according to the nomenclature of Svennerholm): (Svennerholm, L.

Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99; mouse monoclonal IgG26), anti-c-Src antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG), and anti-Csk (C-20, rabbit polyclonal IgG) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-Src antibody (rabbit polyclonal) was purchased from BIOSOURCE International. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in fibroblast growth medium (FGM) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT), 0.5 ml of insulin, 0.5 ml of human FGF, and 0.5 ml of GA1000 (Clonetics). For serum-free culture, fibroblast basal medium (FBM) was used. Cells from passages 3–10 were used for this study (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed every 3 days. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. NHDF were seeded at the density of 2 × 105 cells/dish (100 × 20 mm; area = 55 cm2) or 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (area = 9.4 cm2) in FGM with 2% FBS. After reaching ∼70% of confluence, NHDF were incubated with gangliosides in FGM with 2% FBS for 18 h. After removal of the culture medium by aspiration, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and starved overnight (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol.

The cells were then exposed to 2 ng/ml EGF in serum-free FBM for 5 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were incubated with gangliosides either in FGM with 2% FBS or in serum-free FBM for 6 or 18 h, washed, and exposed to 2 ng/ml EGF in serum-free FBM without starvation. The cells were immediately washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed. The lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated briefly on ice, and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (the cell lysate) was adjusted to 1 μg/μl and used for kinase assays. Proteins were quantified by the Lowry method, using bovine albumin as a standard (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 266-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). 200 μl of cell lysate (∼200 μg of total protein) was mixed with 100 μl of washed Protein G-Sepharose agarose bead slurry (50-μl packed beads) and stirred by a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After microcentrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 5 s, the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and mixed with 4 μg of anti-EGF receptor antibody (sheep polyclonal IgG). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with stirring. The immune complexes were recovered by adding 100 μl of washed Protein G-Sepharose agarose bead slurry (50-μl packed beads) and gently rocking the mixture for 2 h at 4 °C. After microcentrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 s and removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After microcentrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant of each sample (∼40 μg) was loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation of EGF receptor was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody p-Tyr (PY99). Alternatively, total cell lysate was used to determine the phosphorylation of EGF receptor, using either a phospho-EGF receptor antibody (Y1173, mouse monoclonal IgG) or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody p-Tyr (PY99). Total EGF receptor was detected by an anti-EGF receptor antibody. NHDF were lysed in the Mg2+ lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 4% Igepal CA-630, 40 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Ras-GTP from 500 μg of total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with Raf-1 Ras-binding domain (a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) agarose, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Ras antibody (18Delgado P. Fernandez E. Dave V. Kappes D. Alarcon B. Nature. 2000; 406: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Total Ras was measured by anti-Ras immunoblot analysis of 20 μg of the lysate. Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was determined by Western blot analysis, using phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. MAPK antibody was used to detect the total MAPK in each sample. MAPK activity was further determined by measuring Elk-1 phosphorylation. In these experiments, phospho-p44/42 MAPK was first immunoprecipitated by phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody, as described in the protocol of the Bio-Rad MAPK assay kit. Briefly, 200 μl of cell lysate (∼200 μg of total protein) was transferred to a 1-ml microcentrifuge tube, and 15 μl of resuspended immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) monoclonal antibody was added to each tube. The mixture was incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C and microcentrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and 500 μl of kinase buffer. Active MAPK (Erk2, 20 ng/200 μl of control cell lysate) was used as a positive control. The pellet prepared above was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein. The resulting suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was terminated with 25 μl of SDS sample buffer. Each sample was boiled for 5 min, vortexed, and microcentrifuged for 2 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. After transfer, the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was incubated in 25 ml of blocking buffer for overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with primary phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibody (rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:1000 dilution) with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit second antibody (1:2000) and proteins were detected using the LumiGLO chemiluminescence reagents. Proteins with different molecular weights were used as standards. NHDF were seeded at the density of 2 × 105 cells/dish (100 × 20 mm, area = 55 cm2) or 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (area = 9.4 cm2) in FGM with 2% FBS and were cultured until their density reached ∼70% confluence. The cells were then incubated with ganglioside in FGM with 2% FBS for 18 h. After removal of the culture medium by aspiration, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and starved overnight (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), followed by the lysis of the cells as described above. In some experiments, cells were incubated with ganglioside either in FGM with 2% FBS or in serum-free FBM for 6 or 18 h, washed, and lysed without serum starvation. The phosphorylation of Src was detected by Western blot analysis, using phospho-Src kinase antibody. Total Src was measured by Western blot analysis using c-Src antibody. Src kinase activity was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of a Src substrate peptide, using a Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Briefly, Src was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate (∼200 μg of protein). One-fifth of the immunoprecipitated protein (in 10 μl) was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube that contained 10 μl of Src substrate peptide (final concentration, 120 μm) and 10 μl of Src kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mmMnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 250 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol). After gentle mixing, 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) was added to the tube. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with agitation, followed by addition of 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid and incubation for 5 min at room temperature to precipitate the phosphorylated peptide. 25 μl of the mixture was then slowly spotted onto the center of a numbered P81 paper square. The paper squares were washed five times for 5 min with 0.75%phosphoric acid and then once with acetone for 3 min. Finally, the paper squares were transferred to scintillation vials, and 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added for γ-counting. 32P incorporated into the substrate peptide was calculated by subtraction of the nonspecific binding of [γ-32P]ATP and binding of phosphorylated endogenous proteins in the sample extracts (B) from the total count (A). The picomoles of phosphate incorporated into substrate peptide per minute was calculated by the formula, (A −B) × 2.4/(specific radioactivity × 10 min), where specific radioactivity = 2760 cpm/pmol of ATP. Csk in total cell lysate and plasma membrane was determined by Western blot analysis. Plasma membrane was isolated as previously described (19Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). NHDF at 90% confluence were washed twice with buffer consisting of 0.25 m sucrose/1 mm EDTA/20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8. The cells were scraped off the dishes in 3 ml of buffer. After being centrifuged at 1400 × g for 5 min, cells from two culture dishes (100 × 20 mm; area = 55 cm2) were resuspended in 1.0 ml of buffer and homogenized in a 2-ml tissue grinder with 20 strokes. The suspension was then transferred to a 1.5 ml-centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant fraction was removed and stored on ice. The pellet from each tube was resuspended in 1.0 ml of buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min again. The two postnuclear supernatant fractions were combined, layered on top of 2.3 ml of 30% Percoll in buffer, and centrifuged at 84,000 ×g for 30 min. The plasma membrane fraction was collected using a Pasteur pipette, mixed with 1 ml of buffer in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 20 min. The pellet (plasma membrane) was lysed, and Csk was detected by Western blot analysis, using an anti-Csk antibody. Total lipid extracts of cell pellets and culture supernatants were obtained by extracting the lyophilized starting material twice with chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume) for 18 h at 4 °C with stirring. Gangliosides were isolated by partitioning the dried total lipid extract in diisopropyl ether/1-butanol/17 mm aqueous NaCl (6:4:5, by volume). Gangliosides, in the lower aqueous phase, were further purified by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration (20Ladisch S. Li R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPTLC analysis of gangliosides was performed using 10- × 20-cm precoated Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt). The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/0.25% aqueous CaCl2·2H2O (60:40:9, by volume) to separate gangliosides, which were stained as purple bands with resorcinol reagent (21Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 139-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The data presented in each figure are the results obtained from a typical experiment. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and essentially the same results were obtained. The optical density of protein bands from Western blot analysis was quantified using Scion image software from Scion Corp. The -fold induction or percent increase was calculated to compare the difference between control and treatment groups. Ganglioside preincubation caused a dose-dependent enhancement of EGF-induced fibroblast proliferation (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This finding points to the possibility that gangliosides enhance the EGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway. Thus, in our initial experiments we determined the effect of gangliosides on EGF receptor autophosphorylation in NHDF. We used the same conditions that we previously used (13Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following 18-h incubation of NHDF with ganglioside GD1a in FGM with 2% FBS, the cells were washed and starved in serum-free medium overnight, followed by exposure of the cells to ±EGF (2 ng/ml) for 5 min in serum-free medium (16Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C.F. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson Jr., J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, GD1a was shown to enhance EGF-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation by three experimental approaches (Fig. 1). In the first approach, the cell lysate was directly used for the detection of EGF receptor phosphorylation by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.1 A). Preincubation of the cells with 10 and 20 μm GD1a caused 28 and 56% increase in EGF-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, respectively (Fig.1 A), whereas the total EGF receptor level was nearly equal in each sample. The EGF receptor (170 kDa) was identified by Western blot analysis using an anti-EGF receptor antibody, as well as by the standard protein marker (Fig. 1 A). Additional separate experiments confirmed the enhancing effect of ganglioside GD1a on EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig.1 C). In the second approach, the EGF receptor phosphorylation of the same cell lysate was detected by an anti-phospho-EGF receptor antibody (Fig.1 A). GD1a preincubation clearly enhanced EGF receptor phosphorylation. Although exerting a strong enhancing effect on EGF receptor phosphorylation, ganglioside GD1a alone did not cause EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). In the third approach, EGF receptors were first immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with an anti-EGF receptor antibody. A specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, p-Tyr (PY99), was then used to detect EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Again, ganglioside GD1a enhanced EGF receptor phosphorylation in the tested range of 10–50 μm. The detection of EGF receptor phosphorylation using immunoprecipitated EGF receptors was a more sensitive approach than simply using the total cell lysate. For example, preincubation of NHDF with 10 μmGD1a essentially doubled the EGF-stimulated EGF receptor phosphorylation. Thus, ganglioside GD1a enhances EGF-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation. To determine whether gangliosides affect the time course of EGF receptor activation, we exposed fibroblasts to 2 ng/ml EGF for 0–60 min, following GD1a treatment and starvation. As expected, stimulation of the cells with EGF rapidly activated the EGF receptor. Within 5 min, EGF receptor phosphorylation reached the maximal level and, after 60 min, it had returned to the basal level (Fig.2). When cells were preincubated with GD1a, EGF receptor phosphorylation was clearly enhanced over the entire time course of EGF receptor activation. The greatest enhancing effect of GD1a was observed at the peak of EGF receptor phosphorylation (5 min). Therefore, gangliosides enhance EGF receptor activation rather than alter the time course of EGF receptor activation induced by EGF. We next asked whether ganglioside incubation activated Ras, which is an important component of EGF receptor-mediated signaling. Ras functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. Upon activation, Ras exchanges GDP for GTP, becomes associated with the N-terminal region of Raf, and causes activation of Raf. In turn, Raf activates MEK and MAPK (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). As expected, exposure of the cells to EGF activated Ras. Incubation of the cells with 10 and 20 μm GD1a increased the level of Ras-GTP by 41 and 83%, respectively, whereas the total Ras remained at the same level (Fig.3 A). Additional separate experiments confirmed the enhancing effect of GD1a on Ras-GTP level (Fig. 3 C). Because MAPK plays a central role in cell proliferation (23Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of GD1a on activation MAPK (p44/p42 MAPK or Erk1/Erk2). In these studies, we used a phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody and a p44/42 MAPK antibody. The phospho-MAPK antibody recognizes only the phosphorylated MAPK, whereas the MAPK antibody recognizes total MAPK (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated MAPK). Thus, the MAPK antibody was used to detect the total MAPK in each sample for Western blot analysis. Using this method, we detected the enhanced phosphorylation of MAPK by GD1a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4) under the same experimental conditions as described above. Exposure of NHDF to 10, 20, and 50 μmGD1a caused a 19%, 55%, and 65% increase in MAPK phosphorylation. To further assess the effect of gangliosides on MAPK activity, we measured the phosphorylation of Elk-1, a transcription factor and a substrate of MAPK. Following GD1a ganglioside incubation, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated using a specific anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody. The activity of MAPK was determined by measuring the phosphorylation of Elk-1. As shown in Fig. 4, GD1a enhanced the Elk-1 phosphorylation induced by EGF. For example, 20 μm GD1a increased the phosphorylation of Elk-1 by 68%. Brief pretreatment of the cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK (14Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), blocked MAPK activation by EGF, and the enhancing effect of ganglioside GD1a on EGF-induced MAPK activation was also diminished (Fig. 5). This suggests that GD1a promotes fibroblast proliferation at least in part through enhancement of the EGF receptor-mediated Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway. To investigate the influence of ganglioside structure on EGF-induced signaling, we tested four highly purified gangliosides: one monosialoganglioside, GM3; two disialogangliosides, GD1a and GD3; and one trisialoganglioside, GT1b. One neutral glycosphingolipid, lactosylceramide, was also tested. As shown in Fig. 6, NHDF contain GM3 and GD3 as their major ganglioside components. GD1a and GT1b are present only in a trace amount. Among the gangliosides tested, GD1a was the most active molecule in en"

The ability of high extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) to increase total inositol phosphate (InsP) production, an index of phospholipase C (PLC) activation, was determined. Receptor expression was assessed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.

There were no PLC responses to high [Ca2+]o (up to 30 mm) in cells expressing CaRs with C-terminal tails of only 3 residues (CaR-(1–866)), even though these receptors were expressed in the membrane. We scanned the residues between Ser866 and Val895 using tandem-Ala and single-site mutagenesis. Two point mutants (His880 → Ala and Phe882 → Ala CaR) showed 50–70% reductions in high [Ca2+]o-induced InsP production. The levels of expression and glycosylation of these mutants were comparable with wild-type CaRs, but both receptors were profoundly retained in intracellular organelles and co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP. This suggested that the signaling defects of these receptors were likely because of defective trafficking of receptors to the cell surface. Modeling of the C-terminal domain of the CaR indicated that His880 and Phe882 are situated in a putative α-helical structure of 15 amino acids between residues 877 and 891 in the C-terminal tail.

Functional properties are beginning to be ascribed to specific domains of the CaR. Considerable insights regarding the structure-function properties of the CaR have resulted from studying naturally occurring receptor mutants in kindreds with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (10Brown E.M. Bai M. Pollak M. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease. Academic Press, New York1998: 479-499Google Scholar). These studies strongly support the idea that the amino acids in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the CaR directly or indirectly participate in binding of Ca2+ or other cationic agonists to the receptor and in determining receptor sensitivity to ligand. (10Brown E.M. Bai M. Pollak M. Avioli L.V. Krane S.M. Metabolic Bone Disease. Academic Press, New York1998: 479-499Google Scholar). Studies in vitro on the biochemical properties of loss-of-function mutations in the CaR, in combination with receptor mutagenesis, indicate that specific residues in the second and third intracellular loops of the CaR are critical for PLC activation and efficient cell-surface expression (11Chang W. Chen T.-H. Pratt S.A. Shoback D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19955-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Studies of C-terminally truncated CaRs indicate that most of the amino acids in the tail of the receptor are not directly involved in PLC activation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (12Ray K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This work, however, further suggests that a discrete domain in the tail (residues 874–888 and a specific Thr residue) is important in modulating receptor expression, signal transduction, and desensitization (12Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29712-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The importance of the C-terminal tail of the CaR to parathyroid function is highlighted by studies of patients with FHH and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) who have mutations in this region. In one kindred, an Alu-repetitive insertion was found in their CaR genes at residue 876 (13Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This results in a receptor protein that terminates at amino acid 876 but to which is added a non-CaR peptide, Gln-Leu-Thr-Leu-Ser plus 29 Phe residues, encoded by the inserted Alu sequence. When CaR cDNA with the same Alu insertion is expressed in HEK-293 cells, the ability of high [Ca2+]o to raise intracellular [Ca2+] is significantly impaired (to 10% or less of the wt CaR) (13Bai M. Janicic N. Trivedi S. Quinn S.J. Cole D.E. Brown E.M. Hendy G.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In an unusual kindred with features of both FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism, mutation of Phe881 (Phe882 in the bovine CaR) to Leu in the C-terminal tail results in defective signal transduction (15Carling T. Szabo E. Bai M. Ridefelt P. Westin G. Gustavsson P. Trivedi S. Hellman P. Brown E.M. Dahl N. Rastad J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2000; 85: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In HEK-293 cells, this mutant receptor shows reduced intracellular Ca2+ responses to high [Ca2+]o (15Carling T. Szabo E. Bai M. Ridefelt P. Westin G. Gustavsson P. Trivedi S. Hellman P. Brown E.M.

Finally, a family reported with a large deletion in the tail of the CaR (amino acids 895–1075) has autosomal dominant hypocalcemia indicating a gain-of-function (16Lienhardt A. Garabedian M. Bai M. Sinding C. Zhang Z. Lagarde J.P. Boulesteix J. Rigaud M. Brown E.M. Kottler M.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 2000; 85: 1695-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, this mutant CaR demonstrates enhanced cell-surface expression and increased sensitivity to high [Ca2+]o (16Lienhardt A. Garabedian M. Bai M. Sinding C. Zhang Z.

Overall, this work supports the importance of the tail of the CaR and accentuates its diverse roles. The present studies were undertaken to identify residues in the tail of the CaR involved in regulating receptor expression and coupling to signaling pathways. Our results demonstrated that His880and Phe882, in a putative α-helical domain in the C-terminal tail of the CaR, are important for the efficient targeting of the receptor to the cell surface. Mutations of these residues and or their deletion cause intracellular retention of the receptor and reduced PLC activation. The bovine parathyroid CaR cDNA (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D.

The upper primer used in PCRs is derived from a sequence (5′-TGCAGATTGTCATCTGTGCC-3′) at the 5′-end of a unique XhoI site (nucleotide 2762) in the bovine parathyroid CaR cDNA.

Each of these primers introduces a stop codon and XbaI site at the 3′-end of the construct. After digestion with XhoI and XbaI, PCR fragments were ligated into wt CaR/pGEM-HE (3Chang W. Pratt S.

Tandem-alanine (TA) and single-site mutant receptors in the background of wt CaR/pBS and CaR-(1–895)/pBS were made by PCR or site-directed mutagenesis using the Chameleon kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Subcloning of mutant CaR constructs into pcDNA1/Amp for transient transfections was done by ligating the XhoI-XbaI fragments from CaR-(1–866)/pGEM-HE, CaR-(1–895)/pGEM-HE, CaR-(1–929)/pGEM-HE, wt CaR/pBS, or CaR-(1–895)/pBS containing the truncated, mutated, or wt sequences of the C-terminal tail of the receptor into an XhoI-XbaI fragment of wt CaR/pcDNA1/Amp with the remaining CaR sequence. Wt CaR/pcDNA1/Amp was made by ligating the 3619-base pair fragment of wt CaR/pBS into pcDNA1/Amp cut with NotI and HindIII restriction enzymes. To generate mutant CaR constructs for stable transfections, a KpnI-NheI fragment of the pGEM-HE construct containing the mutant CaR cDNA of interest was subcloned into pCEP4 as described previously (3Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total InsP accumulation was assessed by labeling transfected HEK-293 cells with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) for 18–24 h as detailed previously (11Chang W. Chen T.-H. Pratt S.A. Shoback D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19955-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We measured [3H]InsP accumulation in triplicate in the presence of LiCl (10 mm) after incubating cells for 60 min with different [Ca2+]o at 37 °C. Total [3H]InsPs were analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography (3Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner.

Results expressed as the average fold increase in total [3H]InsPs were calculated by dividing total [3H]InsPs produced by elevating [Ca2+]o by basal [3H]InsPs at 0.5 mm Ca2+. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times for confirmation unless otherwise noted. Crude membrane protein fractions were prepared from HEK-293 cells, electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as detailed previously (3Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted with one of two affinity-purified rabbit antisera (21825B (50 nm) or 321113A (10 nm)) (3Chang W. Pratt S.

CaR protein expression in membrane protein fractions prepared from cells expressing wt and expressing mutant CaRs constructs was assessed by immunoblotting in at least two independent experiments. In studies of receptor glycosylation, crude membrane protein fractions were digested with PNG-F or Endo-H as described (23Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). For experiments with Endo-H, membrane proteins (10 μg) were denatured in a solution containing SDS (0.05%, w/v) and 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mm) at 37 °C for 15 min. After adding Endo-H (500 units), NaOAc (70 mm; pH 5.2), and Triton X-100 (0.8%, v/v), proteins were further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. For PNG-F digestion, membrane proteins (10 μg) were incubated with this enzyme (0.2 units) in the presence of Tris-HCl (150 mm; pH 8) and Triton X-100 (1.3%) at 37 °C for 1 h after samples were denatured with SDS (0.375%, w/v) and 2-mercaptoethanol (75 mm) at 37 °C for 15 min. Digested samples were immunoblotted as above. For dual-fluorescence immunocytochemistry, transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 20 min and permeabilized with methanol (80%) (11Chang W. Chen T.-H. Pratt S.A. Shoback D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19955-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rabbit anti-CaR antiserum (21825A; 500 nm) plus either mouse anti-Grp78 (BiP) or rat anti-CD44 antiserum, cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated and Texas Red-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies for 60 min at room temperature (3Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,19Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, cells on coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Gel Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined with a Leica TCS confocal microscope (Laboratory for Cell Imaging, San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center). Fluorescent images were obtained sequentially and stored in a microcomputer. Paired pseudo-colored images and their overlays are presented. Differences between wt and mutant CaR responses were tested by analysis of variance with the F-test using Excel 98 (MicroSoft, Seattle, WA). To determine whether the C-terminal tail of the bovine parathyroid CaR plays a role in signal transduction, we constructed three truncated receptors, CaR-(1–866), CaR-(1–895), and CaR-(1–929), that retain 3, 32, or 66 of the 222 amino acids in the tail, respectively (Fig. 1 a). Truncated and wt CaRs were either stably or transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and PLC activation was assessed by total InsP accumulation in response to changes in [Ca2+]ofrom 0.5 to 5.0 mm. In cells stably expressing wt CaRs, this increment in [Ca2+]o increased InsP production by 24.5 ± 2.8-fold (Fig. 1 b), not significantly different from the responses in cells expressing CaR-(1–929) (28.8 ± 3.6-fold). In cells expressing CaR-(1–895), however, raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5 mm increased InsPs by 10.7 ± 1.7-fold. This response was ≈40% that of wt CaR-expressing cells and was confirmed in three independent cell lines tested (Fig. 1 b). In cells stably expressing CaR-(1–866) with only a three-amino acid tail, raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 30 mm failed to stimulate InsP production (Fig. 1 b and data not shown). These findings indicate that progressive truncation of the C-terminal tail of the CaR reduced the ability of the receptor to activate PLC. To determine whether the dampened signaling of these stably expressed truncated receptors was due to reduced expression, we performed immunoblotting. Approximately 10-fold more membrane protein from cells expressing CaR-(1–895) was required to produce a signal comparable with that of cells stably expressing wt CaRs (Fig. 1 c). The level of expression of the CaR-(1–866) in HEK-293 cells was significantly higher than that of CaR-(1–895) (Fig. 1 c). This was confirmed in two additional cell lines we generated and suggested that the inability of this mutant to activate PLC was not due to deficient receptor synthesis. To address whether the above properties of truncated CaRs were in some way due to stable transfections, we compared these results to those from transiently transfected cells. High [Ca2+]o-induced InsP responses in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing CaR-(1–895) were comparable with those of the wt CaR (Fig. 1 d). As predicted, the expression levels of this mutant receptor were also comparable with those of the wt CaR (Fig. 1 e). High [Ca2+]o, however, also failed to increase InsP production in cells transiently expressing CaR-(1–866). The level of expression of CaR-(1–866) in these experiments was comparable with the wt CaR (Fig. 1 e). In contrast to CaR-(1–895), the level of expression of the severely truncated mutant CaR-(1–866) was similar to that of wt CaRs in both transient and stable transfections. Immunoblots showed the expected differences in size between wt and truncated CaRs as follows: wt CaR > CaR-(1–929) > CaR-(1–895) > CaR-(1–866) (Fig. 1, c and e). In both stably and transiently transfected cells expressing these cDNAs, two predominant glycosylated receptor forms as well as larger, likely aggregated receptors (>205 kDa) were evident (Fig. 1 e). The expression pattern of CaR-(1–866) in stably transfected cells differed somewhat from that of transiently transfected cells. Although the ≈100-kDa protein was observed in both systems (Fig. 1, c and e), a 125-kDa band was seen only in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 1 e), suggesting that post-translational modifications of this mutant receptor might differ as a result of variations in expression levels or receptor processing. This was confirmed in two immunoblots from two different membrane preparations. To determine whether these truncated receptors were efficiently targeted to the membrane, we used confocal immunomicroscopy. In transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, CaR-(1–866), CaR-(1–895), and CaR-(1–929) were strongly localized to the membrane (Fig. 1 f, green) and co-localized extensively with the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, which serves as a cell-surface marker (17Bourguignon L.Y. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar, 18Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 f, red). This was evident with the overlay of images (Fig.1 f, yellow). Thus, the signaling defects of CaR-(1–866) were clearly not the result of the inability of this receptor to be inserted into the membrane. The above observations indicate that the region between residues 866 and 895 may contain critical determinants of PLC activation. To identify further the specific residues involved, we scanned this region by constructing seven TA mutant receptors in which 2–4 non-Ala residues were substituted with Ala, initially in the context of CaR-(1–895) (Fig.2 a). When these receptors were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, their ability to increase InsP production varied (Fig. 2 b). The two most striking mutants (Ala879–883 CaR-(1–895) and Ala892–895CaR-(1–895)) had at least a 50% reduction in their responses to a 4.5 mm increment in [Ca2+]o(asterisks, Fig. 2, a and b). Their InsP responses were only 3.1 ± 0.4- and 2.8 ± 0.1-fold, respectively. This was 40–45% of the response in cells expressing CaR-(1–895) (7.1 ± 0.4-fold increase) (Fig. 2 b). These findings indicate that mutating residues in these two regions significantly blocked the signaling ability of CaR-(1–895). We next examined the expression of these TA CaR mutants by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 c). Whereas the lower ≈110-kDa bands in CaR-(1–895) and the seven TA mutants were reduced in intensity, compared with the lower band (≈140 kDa) in the wt CaR, the intensity of this band was in fact greatest in membrane fractions from cells expressing Ala879–883 CaR-(1–895) and Ala892–895 CaR-(1–895) (Fig. 2 c, lanes 5 and 8). The intensity of the upper band (≈140 kDa) in membrane fractions from Ala879–883 CaR-(1–895) and Ala892–895 CaR-(1–895) mutant expressing cells was greater than in CaR-(1–895) (Fig. 2 c, lanes 5 and 8 versus 1). Thus, it is unlikely that the signaling defects we observed in these two TA mutants are due to defective receptor synthesis. To determine which residue(s) in these regions are responsible for reduced signaling through PLC, we engineered these TA mutants in the context of the full-length CaR. Surprisingly, in cells expressing Ala892–895 CaR, raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm increased InsP production by 12.6 ± 1.3-fold (Fig. 3 a). This was twice the response in cells expressing wt CaRs (6.0 ± 0.4-fold) in four experiments. The expression of Ala892–895 CaR was comparable with that of wt CaR (Fig. 3 b). Therefore, these sites were not examined further. In contrast, in cells expressing Ala879–883 CaR, the ability of high [Ca2+]o to increase InsPs was completely blocked (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that residues 879–883 were required for efficient PLC activation. Because the expression level of Ala879–883 CaR was comparable with that of the wt CaR (Fig. 3 b), deficient receptor synthesis was judged not to be a likely explanation for the reduced signaling responses. Instead, these results suggested that one or more of three non-Ala residues, His880, Phe882, and/or Lys883, are critical for efficient coupling of the CaR to PLC. To pinpoint which of these three amino acids is important in mediating PLC signaling, we generated single-site Ala mutants (His880→ Ala CaR, Phe882 → Ala CaR, and Lys883 → Ala CaR) and tested their ability to increase InsP production in response to increasing [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm. In cells expressing Lys883 → Ala CaRs, this increment in [Ca2+]o stimulated InsP production by 9.9 ± 0.3-fold, which was comparable with wt CaR responses (10.3 ± 0.9-fold). In cells expressing His880 →Ala CaRs and Phe88"

https://openalex.org/W2082180646,"P73, a p53-homologue gene, has been studied for its possible role in head and neck squamous epithelium (HNSE) differentiation and carcinogenesis. P73 RNA and protein were analysed in 50 biopsies, including well- and moderately-differentiated carcinomas, and 21 matched normal adjacent tissues. P73 immunohistochemical analyses revealed intense p73 nuclear staining in basal and parabasal cells of normal squamous epithelium, in contrast with complete absence of staining in the more superficial cell layers. Moderately-differentiated carcinomas demonstrated homogeneous and diffuse staining in all tumour cells, while only basal cells were stained in well-differentiated carcinomas as in normal tissue. No correlation was observed between p73 and p53 protein expression. Immunostaining for p63, another p53-related protein previously described as being involved in HNSE morphogenesis and overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), was found to be similar to p73 labelling in carcinomas, but spread to the more differentiated layers in normal epithelium. Biallelic expression of p73 was found in tumours as well as in matched normal tissues. Comparison of p73 transcript levels between tumours and normal tissues showed decreased mRNA expression in 5/17 (30%) tumours independently of the differentiation status. Mutation and loss of heterozygosity analyses of the p73 gene revealed wild type status and no deletion. Our results strongly suggest that: (i) p73 is associated with homeostasis and control of differentiation of head and neck squamous epithelium probably in concert with p53 and p63; (ii) down-regulation of p73 expression could participate in HNSE carcinogenesis."

Despite this structural similarity and the extranuclear location of both isozymes, only δE induces neurite outgrowth (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Their catalytic properties are similar, suggesting that subtle targeting differences are responsible for their disparate functional roles. It is not known whether sequence differences in their one alternative exon are responsible for their targeting differences. The intent of this work has been to define the targeting domain for both γC and δE CaMK-II. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-linked deletion constructs of γC and δE CaMK-II were prepared, and their oligomeric nature and localization were evaluated. Our findings define a targeting domain that is located in between the central variable domain and the C-terminal association (oligomerization) domain. The localization of δE CaMK-II suggests that it promotes neurite outgrowth through the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured on polystyrene dishes in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (BioWhitaker, Walkersville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with penicillin and/or streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37 °C. The first 301 and the last 22 amino acids encoded by full-length wild type or constitutively active CaMK-II cDNAs used in this study were identical as described previously (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Constitutively active mutants were prepared by point mutagenesis of Thr287 to Asp287, which renders CaMK-II active in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. Using polymerase chain reaction-mediated directional cloning, CaMK-II cDNAs were linked to sequences encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by using the vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). EGFP is placed at the NH2 terminus of CaMK-II with only one additional codon (encoding a glycine residue) separating the two sequences. Primers were synthesized containing restriction enzyme sites (BspE1 at the 5′ end and BamHI at the 3′ end) to amplify the desired cDNA fragment. They enabled the in-frame introduction of CaMK-II domains on the C-terminal side of EGFP. Proper clone construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing in both directions as described previously (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) by evaluation of enzymatic activity (for full-length CaMK-IIs) and by anti-GFP immunoblotting. Sequence analysis was performed using Gene Jockey II (Biosoft, Inc, Cambridge, United Kingdom). cDNAs encoding full-length CaMK-II isozymes were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 h followed by culture for at least an additional 18 h. Transfection efficiencies routinely exceeded 50%. Transfected cells were grown for 1–2 days, harvested with trypsin-EDTA, and then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2.5 mm EGTA. Pellets were resuspended in 3 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer, which consisted of 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.6 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 μm okadaic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.01 mg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Samples were then sonicated (three 5-s bursts on ice), centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and either assayed immediately or frozen and stored at −80 °C. Lysates prepared by sonication solubilized over 90% of the total CaMK-II activity as measured by solution assays and immunoblots (data not shown). Cytosolic fractions were diluted to 0.1–0.2 mg/ml protein in homogenization buffer, and 10 μl was assayed for CaMK-II activity as described previously (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Mini-Protean II gel electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm of nitrocellulose sheets for 1 h at 100V and blocked with TBSTA containing 2.5% nonfat dry milk, 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2% normal goat serum for 1 h. The anti-GFP antibody was a mouse monoclonal IgG (CLONTECH). Primary antibodies were typically diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBSTA and incubated between 1 and 12 h with the nitrocellulose blot. Blots were washed three times with TBSTA and incubated for 1 h with 0.5 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kierkegaard Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, MD) in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBSTA. Blots were developed with 0.25 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.25 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.4. Monomeric molecular weights of bands were interpolated from a linear plot of log Mr of standards versus RF. Whole cell lysates were filtered through 0.45-μm syringe tip filters and then loaded onto a 40 × 1.0-cm Superose-12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.001 mg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Superose-12 was the matrix chosen, because it spanned predicted monomeric and oligomeric CaMK-II sizes. The reported exclusion limit for Superose-12 is 2 × 106 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Retention times of standards, which included thyroglobulin (Mr = 669,000), β-amylase (Mr = 200,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 66,000), and carbonic anhydrase (Mr = 29,000), were determined from in-line absorbance at 280 nm. Sample fractions were assessed for GFP fluorescence using the Fluorstar fluorescence microtiter plate reader (B&L Systems, Maarsen, Holland) or with anti-GFP immunoblotting. Elution volumes (Ve) were plotted as a function of the void volume (V0) and the total volume (VT). V0 was determined using blue dextran, and VT was determined using glycine. Native molecular weights of samples were interpolated from a linear plot of log Mr of standards versus Kav (Ve −V0/VT −V0) as described previously (28Scopes R.K. Cantor C.R. Protein Purification: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1987: 188Google Scholar). Transfected fibroblasts were grown on polystyrene dishes or glass coverslips for 1–2 days after transfection. Cells were imaged either directly on a heated stage or after fixation. Fixation was routinely performed as follows. Coverslips were first rinsed in PBS, incubated with fresh 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce) in PBS, and then post-fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Cells were stained with 100 nm rhodamine-phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) for actin, the AA2-purified mouse monoclonal antibody for total tubulin (courtesy of Dr. Anthony Frankfurter, University of Virginia) at 1 μg/ml, or the V9 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for vimentin. For the latter two, 1 μg/ml rhodamine-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kierkegaard Perry Labs) in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBSTA was used as the secondary antibody. Cells were imaged using the Olympus Fastscan 2000 12-bit digital camera mounted on an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY). Images were compiled using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems, Inc, San Jose, CA). To characterize the minimal targeting domain of γC and δE CaMK-II, deletion constructs (Fig. 1, A–F) were linked at their NH2 termini to EGFP. This and other labs have shown that the catalytic properties of GFP-linked full-length constructs (A) are not affected by an NH2-terminal GFP domain (18Shen K. Meyer T. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). C-terminal constructs (B) encode the variable and association domains over the last 185 (γC) or 182 (δE) residues. Variable domain constructs (C and D) begin with Ser311(γC) or Thr311 (δE) and end 108–111 (C) or 51–54 (D) residues downstream. Association domain constructs (E and F) have a normal C terminus but begin with Thr354 (γC) or Thr351 (δE) for construct E or with Ala398 for construct F as shown in Fig. 1. The sequence comprising these last 195 (γC) or 192 (δE) residues is shown with differences highlighted (Fig. 1). These 11-GFP-CaMK-II constructs were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. After 2 days, cells were harvested and evaluated by anti-GFP immunoblots (Fig. 2). As expected, full-length γC and δE migrated at 84 kDa, which was 27 kDa larger than full-length CaMK-II alone (A). All other constructs were proportionally smaller as predicted. Lysates containing transfected full-length CaMK-II exhibited Ca2+/CaM-dependent catalytic activity, which exceeded total endogenous CaMK-II activity levels by at least 4-fold (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Summary includes predicted monomeric size of constructs, actual monomeric mass (Mr) as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, native mass (Mr) of the major peak as interpolated by Superose-12 gel filtration, and the ratio of native to monomeric molecular weight. CaMK-II targeting may depend upon oligomerization. Therefore, we evaluated the native molecular weights of all expressed constructs. Previous studies have indicated that the minimal oligomerization domain of α CaMK-II begins approximately at Ala384 (17Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which corresponds to Ala398 in δE CaMK-II. Other studies indicate that the α CaMK-II association domain comprises the last 135 amino acids but is most dependent upon the last 110 residues (18Shen K. Meyer T. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The boundaries of the association domain had not yet been determined for γ or δ CaMK-IIs, but we expected constructs A, B, E, and possibly F to oligomerize based on homology to α CaMK-II. To assess oligomerization, lysates of cells transiently transfected with γC and δE CaMK-II constructs were applied to a Superose-12 gel filtration column (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Anti-GFP immunoblots demonstrated that protein constructs remained intact through gel filtration and peaked at different elution volumes (Fig. 3,δE only). Quantitative profiles for all constructs were obtained by analyzing the GFP fluorescence of each fraction (Fig. 3, bottom panels). Elution profiles were plotted as a function of Kav, and native sizes were interpolated (Table I). For both γC and δE, constructs A, B, E, and F exhibited major peaks corresponding to oligomers of at least 9 subunits. Construct A had a substantial secondary peak corresponding to monomer and additional shoulders on both of these peaks. Constructs B, E, and F all had less relative contribution from their “monomeric” peaks and were, therefore, considered to have oligomerized more efficiently. Constructs C and D did not oligomerize whatsoever as they showed single peaks corresponding to their monomeric size. These results indicate that the C-terminal 142 residues of γ and δ CaMK-II can efficiently oligomerize, and that the C-terminal 95 amino acids of δ CaMK-II are sufficient for oligomerization. The localization patterns of full-length GFP-linked γC and δE CaMK-IIs were determined using conventional fluorescence microscopy of living cells 2 days after transfection. The populations of cells are shown at low magnification, and individual cells are shown at higher magnification using both phase-contrast and fluorescence illumination (Fig. 4). Note that these images demonstrate the high transfection efficiencies typically obtained in these experiments. Both GFP-linked CaMK-IIs demonstrated localization patterns that were similar to both the indirect immunofluorescence pattern of transfected non-GFP-linked CaMK-IIs (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to endogenous CaMK-II determined by using gene-specific antibodies (12Tombes R.M. Mikkelsen R.B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). γC CaMK-II exhibited a dispersed and uniform distribution throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, δE CaMK-II exhibited a distinctive perinuclear and cortical cytoplasmic staining as previously reported for endogenous δ CaMK-II in rodent fibroblasts, astrocytes, and myoblasts (10Takeuchi Y. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Miyakawa T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Tombes R.M. Mikkelsen R.B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Hoch B. Haase H. Schulze W. Hagemann D. Morano I. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). C-terminal construct B of γC (Fig. 5,top row) and δE (Fig. 5, bottom row) CaMK-II localized similar to full-length construct A. γC was uniformly dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas δE showed cortical and perinuclear localization. High intensity fluorescent particles were occasionally seen with some constructs (see Fig. 5, γC constructs B and E and δE constructs E and F). Constructs C and D span the entire variable domain. Construct C ends within the first third of the association domain, whereas construct D encodes a smaller segment that ends in a region that links the variable and association domains (see Fig. 1). Neither construct exhibited any targeting, as they were found throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in an identical pattern to GFP alone (Fig. 1, GFP panel,top row). GFP is slightly more enriched in the nucleus but is not exclusively found in the nucleus. Construct E has a normal C terminus but begins at either Thr354 (γ) or Thr351 (δ) and thus lacks any variable domain sequences. Construct E is oligomeric (see Table I). Although it was lacking variable domain sequences, construct E localized much like constructs A or B, i.e. it exhibited the striking perinuclear distribution for δ and the dispersed cytoplasmic localization for γ CaMK-II. Construct F was prepared for δ CaMK-II only. This 95 amino acid domain begins at Ala399 and continues to the C terminus. This construct is synthesized at its predicted size and is efficiently oligomeric at 11 times its monomeric size (Fig. 3 and Table I). δ Construct F, however, was not targeted like full-length δE constructs A, B, or E. Like GFP alone, δ construct F was found throughout the cell in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but unlike GFP, it was oligomeric and often seen as small cytoplasmic fluorescent particles (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that alternative exons in the central variable domain are not necessary for cytoplasmic targeting of γ and δ CaMK-IIs. Rather, the sequence that comprises the difference between constructs E and F is necessary for targeting. Further support for this conclusion comes from our observations that GFP-linked δCCaMK-II oligomerizes and localizes in an identical perinuclear fashion to δE. The δC gene product is a δ CaMK-II isozyme, which naturally lacks alternative variable domain sequences (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Living cells transfected with full-length δE construct A or C-terminal constructs B and E often exhibited filaments in the perinuclear region. These filaments were more easily seen when cells were permeabilized and fixed (Fig. 6). γC CaMK-II constructs did not exhibit these filaments. The δE filamentous pattern was observed even when cells were detergent washed or extracted, which supports a co-localization with the cytoskeleton and not endomembranes. Therefore, fixed cells were counterstained with antibodies against tubulin or vimentin and were counterstained with phalloidin for actin. δE CaMK-II co-localized with F-actin around the nucleus and at the cell cortex. The arrows point out some of these co-localizing CaMK-II and actin fibers (Fig. 6). Vimentin and tubulin fibers were enriched in the perinuclear region but not in the same bundles or fibers as CaMK-II and actin. CaMK-II did not co-localize with actin stress fibers, the predominant actin structure in these cells. A particularly striking-merged color image of a δE CaMK-II pattern (green) with F-actin (red) reveals co-localizing yellow filaments passing around and above the nucleus and into a short actin-rich extension (Fig. 7). Actin stress fibers can be seen as fibers that run along the base of the cell and do not co-localize with CaMK-II.Figure 7Wild-type δE CaMK-II and actin co-localization. NIH/3T3 cells transfected with full-length δE CaMK-II were fixed with formaldehyde after 2 days and counterstained with rhodamine-phalloidin. Images were combined into the color view with CaMK-II in green, actin in red, and coincident fluorescence in yellow. Scale bar corresponds to 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From this actin co-localization and our previous finding that constitutively active GFP-linked δE CaMK-II can induce neurite outgrowth (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we predicted that transfected constitutively active δE CaMK-II might induce actin polymerization and demonstrate a more pronounced co-localization with actin, and this is what we observed. δE CaMK-II co-localized with enhanced levels of F-actin along the entire length of the cellular extensions that it induced, particularly at the tip (Fig. 8, middle panel). Cells that were not transfected or were transfected with constitutively active γC CaMK-II exhibited normal actin patterns and showed no extensions (Fig. 8, top panel). Both of these constitutively active constructs were previously shown to exhibit high levels of autonomous (Ca2+/CaM-independent) activity (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). At a higher magnification, constitutively active δE CaMK-II could be seen at the tips of these extensions in a pattern that co-localized with bundled and cortical F-actin (Fig. 8, bottom panel). We interpret these results as indicating that cellular extensions are formed in the presence of constitutively active δE CaMK-II through either the induction or stabilization of actin fibers. Cytosolic CaMK-II activity is involved in the differentiation of adipocytes, myocytes, and pre-neuronal cells (24VanBerkum M.F. Goodman C.S.

Of the four CaMK-II genes, δ CaMK-II gene products are the most highly expressed in these cells and have been shown to directly induce neuritogenesis (12Tombes R.M. Mikkelsen R.B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J.

Brain Res. 2000; 85: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most CaMK-II gene products are strikingly similar in structural and kinetic features, leading to the conclusion that δ CaMK-IIs, like other protein kinases, must be selectively targeted to substrates to influence events such as neurite outgrowth. In this study, we have demonstrated that δE CaMK-II, an isozyme independently discovered in heart and pre-neuronal cells (8Tombes R.M. Krystal G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Mayer P. Mohlig M. Idlibe D. Pfeiffer A. Basic Res.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), co-localizes with F-actin in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery. This is the identical localization for endogenous δ CaMK-II in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (12Tombes R.M. Mikkelsen R.B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), rat myoblasts (27Hoch B. Haase H. Schulze W. Hagemann D. Morano I. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and rat astrocytes (10Takeuchi Y. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Miyakawa T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When δE CaMK-II is made constitutively active and is transfected, it induces cellular extensions (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), localizes along and at the tips of these cellular extensions, and increases filamentous F-actin. γCCaMK-II, a catalytically and structurally similar isozyme originally found at high levels in T lymphocytes (35Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), is found in the cytosol but does not induce neurite outgrowth and does not co-localize with F-actin. We have also shown that γC and δE CaMK-II targeting is not dependent on the central variable domain. Constructs C and D target no differently than GFP alone, whereas C-terminal construct E, which lacks central variable domain sequences, targets like full-length CaMK-II. This finding was somewhat surprising, because there are γ and δ CaMK-II isozymes that have central variable domain (nuclear)-targeting sequences (10Takeuchi Y. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Miyakawa T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J.

Because δ targeting does not require alternative exons in the variable domain, the δE CaMK-II targeting shown here represents the “default” targeting pattern for δ gene products such as δC CaMK-II, which is the principal δ CaMK-II isozyme expressed in embryonic cells (6Bayer K.-U.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with our finding that δC and δECaMK-II show identical localization and are equally capable of inducing neurite outgrowth (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The variable domains of both δC and α CaMK-II are structurally similar (8Tombes R.M. Krystal G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), i.e. they lack alternative exons and are therefore the simplest products of their respective genes. Whereas δC CaMK-II has targeting sequences in the C-terminal domain, α CaMK-II can be targeted to the post-synaptic density by heterooligomerization with β CaMK-II (19Shen K. Teruel M.N.

Although we have now shown that central variable domain sequences are not necessarily required for CaMK-II targeting, it is undoubtedly clear that proper targeting is necessary for CaMK-II function. γC CaMK-II and δE CaMK-II targeting requires only the last 150 residues, which does not include the central variable domain. Our findings indicate that the first 50 residues of this C-terminal domain are necessary for targeting, and the last 95 residues are minimally necessary for oligomerization. Therefore, targeting is dependent upon oligomerization, but oligomerization alone does not result in targeting. The 50 amino acid domain corresponds to δE Thr351-Ala399 (Fig. 1), which is analogous to α Thr337-Ala384. In a model of full-length oligomeric α CaMK-II, this domain is part of a linker between the NH2-terminal peripheral catalytic domain and the C-terminal association domain, which form a central oligomeric core (36Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Petersen J.D. Choi C. Beushausen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This creates the structural potential for the interaction of this domain with other proteins. Oligomerization has also been reported as necessary for CaMK-II targeting to the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl, d-aspartate receptor, although the targeting sequences are found in the catalytic domain (37Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Regardless of where the targeting domain resides, its juxtaposition as an oligomer may present a unique three-dimensional targeting site that is not present in monomeric CaMK-II. Both γC and δE CaMK-II are composed of three separate exons in their variable region (8Tombes R.M. Krystal G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed through the examination of the human δ CaMK-II gene on chromosome four (4q25) and the human γ CaMK-II gene on chromosome 10 (10q22) via sequence analysis through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The second of these three exons (δE329–342, EPQTTVIHNPDGNK) contains some unique and repeated sequence elements that are absent from γC (21Johnson L.D. Willoughby C.A. Burke S.H. Paik D.S. Jenkins K.J. Tombes R.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2380-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This exon, however, is not responsible for δ CaMK-II targeting to the perinuclear region as described here. Although the function of this domain is not yet known in δ CaMK-II, the analogous γ domain (EPQTTVVHNATDGIK) is used in γACaMK-II to regulate the targeting of a preceding nuclear targeting domain (10Takeuchi Y. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Miyakawa T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, no known δ CaMK-II expresses this domain in combination with the nuclear targeting domain (8Tombes R.M. Krystal G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CaMK-II has been reported to form 100-nm “clusters” in cultured hippocampal neurons (38Dosemeci A. Reese T.S. Petersen J. Tao-Cheng J.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3076-3084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear what constitutes the molecular basis of these clusters, but we do not believe that they are related to the much larger fluorescent particles as described here. The particles observed here were seen only with oligomeric constructs A, B, E, and F and, therefore, were not an artifact of EGFP by itself. They were most prominent with δ construct F, which interestingly was the only oligomeric construct that lacked any subcellular targeting capability. We also observed these particles more often with γC than with δE oligomeric constructs. We suspect that when overexpressed oligomeric CaMK-IIs exceed the level of endogenous binding partners, they are more prone to cellular disposal pathways, appearing as accumulations of fluorescence. In this study, we have shown that differentially effective γ and δ CaMK-II isozymes are differentially targeted. δE CaMK-II co-localizes with F-actin in the perinuclear region and the cellular cortex in a manner that is consistent with its role in neuritogenesis. Our evidence indicates that the targeting of δE CaMK-II is dependent on sequences residing between Thr351 and Ala398. Targeting is also dependent upon oligomerization but not on the central variable domain. δ CaMK-II oligomerization requires no more than the last 95 residues. Further identification of binding targets and substrates of δ CaMK-II isozymes will help identify their precise locus of action and may account for known effects of Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation on neurite stabilization, outgrowth, and turning (39Lau P.-M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3988-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, we hypothesized that prefoldin interacts with its target proteins, actin and tubulins, via a common mechanism. Therefore, we sought to identify similar features in the two nonhomologous proteins β-actin and α-tubulin enabling them to interact specifically with prefoldin.Using truncation analysis, we identified in both target proteins two regions necessary for prefoldin interaction. Mutations of particular residue stretches within these regions to alanine reduce or abolish the binding of β-actin or α-tubulin to prefoldin and reveal a common signature sequence in the most amino-terminal site. The presence of a strikingly similar prefoldin interaction motif in these nonrelated target proteins suggests that they are recognized by similar prefoldin subunits. This argument is strengthened by our observation that fragments of actin containing these two regions compete efficiently with β-actin and with α- and β-tubulin for prefoldin binding. Similar motifs are present in γ-tubulin and in the newly identified prefoldin target protein Arp1.DISCUSSIONIn β-actin and α-tubulin, we identified regions important for binding to prefoldin. Either target protein contains two such regions, of which the amino-terminal ones (site I) are strikingly similar (underlined and boxed in Fig. 2A). This is remarkable because actin and α-tubulin are nonhomologous. We looked for other candidate prefoldin target proteins containing the site I motif, but our data base searches were hampered by the shortness of the sequence. When restricted to one organism (e.g. man or Drosophila), we found either no hits or actins or tubulins (depending on the length and sequence of the input). However, the site I signature sequence (Fig. 2A) is present in β-tubulin (Fig. 1A), in γ-tubulin, and in the newly identified prefoldin target Arp1. Intriguingly, the EHGI sequence preceded by hydrophobic residues at the −3 and −7 position in site I is extremely well conserved in all actins, in Arp1, and in all α-, β-, and γ-tubulin isoforms. We note that in native β-actin, His-73 is methylated. The role of this methylation is unclear, although it may be tempting to speculate that this modification could play a role in the recognition of non-native actin by prefoldin or in its transfer from prefoldin to CCT. The following observations argue against such a scenario. In yeast, prefoldin is required for normal kinetics of actin production (21Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein H. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but His-73 in yeast actin is not methylated (22Kalhor H.R. Niewmierzycka A. Faull K.F. Yao X. Grade S. Clarke S. Rubenstein P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and mutants in His-73 do not show a phenotype in vivo (23Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The potential importance of His-73 methylation in these processes is difficult to verify because of the low levels of incorporation of 14C-methyl in β-actin produced in lysates (data not shown) and because prefoldin can be bypassed in this system (11Rommelaere H. De Neve M. Melki R. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The latter is consistent with our observation that Arp2 and Arp3 do not bind prefoldin despite being target proteins for CCT. This also indicates that not all proteins interacting with the cytosolic chaperonin are also prefoldin targets. We note that the sequences of site I and site II of Arp2 and Arp3 are not absolutely conserved with respect to actin and even contain charge alterations, perhaps suggesting that charged residues are important in the interaction of eukaryotic prefoldin with target proteins.Site I appears to be more important for prefoldin recognition because the binding behavior of alanine scan mutants in site I was more affected than that of the analogous site II mutants. Additionally, our various competition experiments confirmed the relative importance of site I. Obviously, further research is needed to completely dissect the individual importance of each residue in the motif, but based on its sequence, we put forward that polar interactions are important for the interaction between prefoldin and its target proteins. This is consistent with structural data available for prefoldin from archaebacteria. For Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicumprefoldin, it was proposed that this interaction occurs via exposed hydrophobic surface patches at the distal regions of the locally untwisted coiled coils (6Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotic prefoldin subunits, the tips appear less hydrophobic, supporting our view that target protein interaction occurs partly by hydrophilic interactions.In the respective crystal structures of actin and tubulin (24Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 25Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the site I amino acids are located in loops, whereas those of region II are in rather similar loop-α-helix structures. These regions of the protein do not appear to be essential for nucleotide binding, with the possible exception of the site II α-helix in tubulin (residues Tyr-224 and Asn-228 may contact the nucleotide base; Ref. 25Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In actin, the EGHI tetrapeptide sequence is close to a polymer contact (in the refined Holmes model; Ref. 26Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), but it is not directly involved in contacting neighboring protomers, nor has it been described as an actin-binding protein interaction site. Similarly, in α- and β-tubulin, this tetrapeptide is in a loop that is not involved in tubule formation and is probably not involved in contacting microtubule-associated proteins because it is on the inside of the protofilament (27Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In tubulins, residues more carboxyl-terminal of this loop are much less conserved, and in α-tubulin, even insertions are accommodated. Thus, this extreme conservation of the site I signature sequence suggests another important function, which may well be the interaction with prefoldin during translation. Site II seems to be generally less well conserved (for example, Arp1 and β- and γ-tubulin), and this may explain why these target proteins bind less well to prefoldin than actin and α-tubulin (see Fig. 4; the fragments of Arp1 and β- and γ-tubulin also show binding to CCT, whereas actin and α-tubulin do not).If we consider the modeled structure of actin in the electron microscopic reconstruction of actin-CCT (10Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Grantham J. Hynes G.M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5971-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), site I and II are both solvent-exposed, facing out of the CCT cylinder but spatially close to CCT subunits. This is suggestive of a mechanism in which prefoldin with bound actin docks to CCT by specific interactions between prefoldin and CCT subunits in such a way that the CCT recognition sites in non-native actin are properly presented to CCT subunits. Indeed, the two prefoldin interaction sites in β-actin are located at either side of the amino-terminal CCT interaction site (11Rommelaere H. De Neve M. Melki R. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the same applies for α-tubulin. 2M. De Neve, H. Rommelaere, D. Waterschoot, J. Vandekerckhove, and C. Ampe, unpublished observations. Because prefoldin is thought to transfer non-native target proteins to CCT after the formation of a transient ternary complex with CCT (4Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), some prefoldin subunits may serve to specifically contact certain CCT subunits, and this may be the reason why, in eukaryotes, both these chaperones consist of multiple subunits, i.e. some are required for target protein binding, and/or some are required for proper docking onto subunits of the partner chaperone. Chaperones assist folding and prevent aggregation of proteins in the crowded environment of the cell. The eukaryote cytosol contains several chaperones, of which hsp70 family members and the cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT)1 have been best studied (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1995; 375: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In particular, class I chaperonins appear to recognize general hydrophobic properties of target proteins (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), whereas CCT interacts with target proteins through discrete binding determinants (11Rommelaere H. De Neve M. Melki R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,15Dobrzynski J.K. Sternlicht M.L. Peng I. Farr G.W. Sternlicht H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3988-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, we hypothesized that prefoldin interacts with its target proteins, actin and tubulins, via a common mechanism. Therefore, we sought to identify similar features in the two nonhomologous proteins β-actin and α-tubulin enabling them to interact specifically with prefoldin. Using truncation analysis, we identified in both target proteins two regions necessary for prefoldin interaction. Mutations of particular residue stretches within these regions to alanine reduce or abolish the binding of β-actin or α-tubulin to prefoldin and reveal a common signature sequence in the most amino-terminal site. The presence of a strikingly similar prefoldin interaction motif in these nonrelated target proteins suggests that they are recognized by similar prefoldin subunits. This argument is strengthened by our observation that fragments of actin containing these two regions compete efficiently with β-actin and with α- and β-tubulin for prefoldin binding. Similar motifs are present in γ-tubulin and in the newly identified prefoldin target protein Arp1. DISCUSSIONIn β-actin and α-tubulin, we identified regions important for binding to prefoldin. Either target protein contains two such regions, of which the amino-terminal ones (site I) are strikingly similar (underlined and boxed in Fig. 2A). This is remarkable because actin and α-tubulin are nonhomologous. We looked for other candidate prefoldin target proteins containing the site I motif, but our data base searches were hampered by the shortness of the sequence. When restricted to one organism (e.g. man or Drosophila), we found either no hits or actins or tubulins (depending on the length and sequence of the input). However, the site I signature sequence (Fig. 2A) is present in β-tubulin (Fig. 1A), in γ-tubulin, and in the newly identified prefoldin target Arp1. Intriguingly, the EHGI sequence preceded by hydrophobic residues at the −3 and −7 position in site I is extremely well conserved in all actins, in Arp1, and in all α-, β-, and γ-tubulin isoforms. We note that in native β-actin, His-73 is methylated. The role of this methylation is unclear, although it may be tempting to speculate that this modification could play a role in the recognition of non-native actin by prefoldin or in its transfer from prefoldin to CCT. The following observations argue against such a scenario. In yeast, prefoldin is required for normal kinetics of actin production (21Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein H. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but His-73 in yeast actin is not methylated (22Kalhor H.R. Niewmierzycka A. Faull K.F. Yao X. Grade S. Clarke S. Rubenstein P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and mutants in His-73 do not show a phenotype in vivo (23Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The potential importance of His-73 methylation in these processes is difficult to verify because of the low levels of incorporation of 14C-methyl in β-actin produced in lysates (data not shown) and because prefoldin can be bypassed in this system (11Rommelaere H. De Neve M. Melki R. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The latter is consistent with our observation that Arp2 and Arp3 do not bind prefoldin despite being target proteins for CCT. This also indicates that not all proteins interacting with the cytosolic chaperonin are also prefoldin targets. We note that the sequences of site I and site II of Arp2 and Arp3 are not absolutely conserved with respect to actin and even contain charge alterations, perhaps suggesting that charged residues are important in the interaction of eukaryotic prefoldin with target proteins.Site I appears to be more important for prefoldin recognition because the binding behavior of alanine scan mutants in site I was more affected than that of the analogous site II mutants. Additionally, our various competition experiments confirmed the relative importance of site I. Obviously, further research is needed to completely dissect the individual importance of each residue in the motif, but based on its sequence, we put forward that polar interactions are important for the interaction between prefoldin and its target proteins. This is consistent with structural data available for prefoldin from archaebacteria. For Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicumprefoldin, it was proposed that this interaction occurs via exposed hydrophobic surface patches at the distal regions of the locally untwisted coiled coils (6Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotic prefoldin subunits, the tips appear less hydrophobic, supporting our view that target protein interaction occurs partly by hydrophilic interactions.In the respective crystal structures of actin and tubulin (24Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 25Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the site I amino acids are located in loops, whereas those of region II are in rather similar loop-α-helix structures. These regions of the protein do not appear to be essential for nucleotide binding, with the possible exception of the site II α-helix in tubulin (residues Tyr-224 and Asn-228 may contact the nucleotide base; Ref. 25Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In actin, the EGHI tetrapeptide sequence is close to a polymer contact (in the refined Holmes model; Ref. 26Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), but it is not directly involved in contacting neighboring protomers, nor has it been described as an actin-binding protein interaction site. Similarly, in α- and β-tubulin, this tetrapeptide is in a loop that is not involved in tubule formation and is probably not involved in contacting microtubule-associated proteins because it is on the inside of the protofilament (27Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In tubulins, residues more carboxyl-terminal of this loop are much less conserved, and in α-tubulin, even insertions are accommodated. Thus, this extreme conservation of the site I signature sequence suggests another important function, which may well be the interaction with prefoldin during translation. Site II seems to be generally less well conserved (for example, Arp1 and β- and γ-tubulin), and this may explain why these target proteins bind less well to prefoldin than actin and α-tubulin (see Fig. 4; the fragments of Arp1 and β- and γ-tubulin also show binding to CCT, whereas actin and α-tubulin do not).If we consider the modeled structure of actin in the electron microscopic reconstruction of actin-CCT (10Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Grantham J. Hynes G.M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5971-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), site I and II are both solvent-exposed, facing out of the CCT cylinder but spatially close to CCT subunits. This is suggestive of a mechanism in which prefoldin with bound actin docks to CCT by specific interactions between prefoldin and CCT subunits in such a way that the CCT recognition sites in non-native actin are properly presented to CCT subunits. Indeed, the two prefoldin interaction sites in β-actin are located at either side of the amino-terminal CCT interaction site (11Rommelaere H. De Neve M. Melki R. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3246-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the same applies for α-tubulin. 2M. De Neve, H. Rommelaere, D. Waterschoot, J. Vandekerckhove, and C. Ampe, unpublished observations. Because prefoldin is thought to transfer non-native target proteins to CCT after the formation of a transient ternary complex with CCT (4Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A.

Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), some prefoldin subunits may serve to specifically contact certain CCT subunits, and this may be the reason why, in eukaryotes, both these chaperones consist of multiple subunits, i.e. some are required for target protein binding, and/or some are required for proper docking onto subunits of the partner chaperone.

The present studies explore the potential mechanisms by which NHERF transduces cAMP signals to inhibit NBC. In BSC-1 cells, cells that express NBC but lack NHERF, 8-bromo-cAMP (100 μm for 15 min) failed to inhibit transport until wild-type mNHERF-(1–355) was expressed. mNHERF-(116–355) containing PDZ II and C-terminal ezrin-binding sequences or a mutant unphosphorylated form of rabbit NHERF effectively transduced the cAMP signals that inhibited NBC. By contrast, mNHERF-(1–126) encompassing N-terminal PDZ I and mNHERF-(1–325), which lacks ezrin-binding, failed to support cAMP inhibition of NBC activity. NBC and NHERF did not associate with each other in yeast two-hybrid or co-immunoprecipitation assays, and confocal microscopy indicated distinct subcellular localization of the two proteins.

Subsequent to the elucidation of the role of NHERF in the regulation of NHE3, a role for this protein in the regulation of the activity of other transporters has been proposed, and it has been suggested that the signal-complex model of regulation of renal transport proteins may be more common than currently appreciated (4Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the renal proximal tubule, there is an intimate relation between the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger and the basolateral membrane sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBC). These two transporters are regulated in parallel in response to a variety of experimental maneuvers, hormones, and second messengers (5Akiba T. Alpern R.J. Eveloff J. Calamina J. Warnock D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Ruiz O.S. Arruda J.A. Talor Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F414-F420PubMed Google Scholar, 7Geibel J. Giebisch G.

The coordinated regulation of NHE3 and NBC appears to be the result of specific regulatory mechanisms and not merely the consequence of the availability of ion substrates for the transporters. NBC, like NHE3, is regulated by stimuli that raise intracellular cAMP (8Pastoriza-Munoz E. Harrington R.M. Graber M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Ruiz O.S. Arruda J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F560-F565PubMed Google Scholar). In association with Bernardo et al. (10Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we have previously provided evidence that PKA-mediated inhibition of renal NBC requires NHERF. It is not known, however, if NHERF functions to form a signal-complex that regulates NBC activity or if NBC itself is phosphorylated by PKA. To study the relation between NBC and NHERF, wild-type, truncated, and mutated forms of NHERF were expressed in BSC-1 cells to determine if NHERF binds NBC, if NHERF is required for the phosphorylation of NBC, if the phosphorylation of NHERF is required for NBC regulation, and if NBC requires tethering to the actin cytoskeleton to be regulated by cAMP. The results indicate that the interaction between NHERF and NBC differs from the interactions between NHERF and NHE3. Although the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) binding domain of NHERF is required for cAMP regulation of NBC, NHERF does not bind to NBC or facilitate cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of NBC. Moreover, 15-min treatment of the cells with cAMP does not affect the cell surface expression NBC. It is suggested that cAMP-mediated inhibition of NBC is the result of a biochemical modification of the NBC transporter by a process that requires NHERF but is not associated with phosphorylation of the transporter itself. Studies were performed using BSC-1 cells that express endogenous NBC activity but lack endogenous NHERF (10Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin.

Constructs encoding N-terminal mNHERF-(1–126), C-terminal mNHERF-(116–355), full-length mNHERF-(1–355), and mNHERF-(1–325) that eliminated the proposed ezrin-radixin-moesin-merlin (ERM) binding domain were inserted in-frame into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro+ vector (2Zizak M.

The mutant form of rabbit NHERF was made using the MORPH mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), and the mutation was confirmed by double-stranded sequencing (2Zizak M. Lamprecht G.

Serine residues 287, 289, and 290 were mutated to alanine residues using an oligonucleotide of the following sequence: 5′-GCTGGTGTCAGCGGCGGCGGCTCTTGC-3′. For each form of NHERF tested, several groups of BCS-1 cells were transfected separately. Each group was handled and studied independently. Mixed cell cultures expressing an individual form of NHERF did not differ from like cultures, and the results were pooled for analysis. NBC activity was assayed in BSC-1 cells grown on glass coverslips using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM) (10Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-deprived for 12–20 h and then loaded with 12 μm BCECF-AM in an assay buffer of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 90 mm sodium gluconate, 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm tetramethyl 2mmonium-PO4, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm mannitol, and 2 mm CaSO4 for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then perfused with the same solution not containing BCECF for 1 min. The cells were acidified with a solution containing 115 mm potassium gluconate, 9 mm HEPES, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 25 mm choline bicarbonate, 10 mm glucose, and 2 mm CaSO4 for 10 min. NBC activity was determined using a solution containing 5 mm potassium gluconate, 9 mm HEPES, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 110 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm glucose, and 2 mm CaSO4. Ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), 50 μm, was added to all perfusion solutions to inhibit Na+/H+ exchanger activity. In initial experiments, chloride-containing solutions were compared with sulfate containing solutions to determine if BSC-1 cells expressed a sodium-dependent or sodium-independent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger. BCECF fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 500 and 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The NH4SO4 pulse was used to achieve an initial pHi of 6.0–6.2. Four or more regions of interest encompassing groups of cells were delineated on each coverslip. The results from each region were averaged to constitute a single experimental observation. NBC activity, expressed as ΔpHi/s, represented the initial slope of transport activity measured within the first 20 s of sodium-dependent pHi recovery. Over this brief time period, the relationship between pHi and time was essentially linear. To analyze the effects of cAMP on NBC activity, cells were pretreated with 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP during the final 15 min of dye loading and continuously throughout the perfusion process. At the end of each experiment, the cells were equilibrated in pH clamp media containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mmMES, 110 mm KCl, 14 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm tetramethyl 2mmonium-PO4, 25 mm glucose, and 10 μm nigericin at pH 6.0 and 7.3. Preliminary experiments established that the ratio values were linear with pH between these values. All measurements were made on cells at the same passage on the same day. To determine the in vivo phosphorylation of NBC, cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and labeled in vivo for 4 h using the same media containing 2.5 mCi of [γ-32P]orthophosphate. At the end of the incubation, half of the cells were treated with 100 μm8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min. Control and cAMP treated cells were scraped and resuspended in 500 μl of a solution containing 60 mmHepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenanthroline, and 1 mm iodoacetamide (IP buffer)). Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g and resuspended in IP buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, lysed by being drawn through a 27-gauge needle, agitated on a rotating rocker at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. The supernatants were first precleared with Protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads by rocking for 1 h. The beads were then spun down, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with an anti-NBC polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads previously treated with BSC-1 cell extract solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 were then added and allowed to rock for an additional 2 h. The beads were eluted by boiling in 70 μl of Laemmli SDS-sample buffer. The phosphoprotein corresponding to NBC was identified on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. To extend these observations, an in vitro“back-phosphorylation” assay was employed to assess PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NBC. The rationale for this approach is that in vivo activation of PKA by cAMP should phosphorylate specific serine residue(s) in the C terminus of NBC and render them unavailable for back-phosphorylation in vitro by PKA. Wild-type or BSC-1 cells expressing mNHERF-(1–355) were studied under basal conditions or after treatment of the cells with 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min. The immunoprecipitation procedures were performed as indicated above using Protein A-Sepharose beads. Samples were eluted from the beads with 100 μl of 30 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.8, and immediately neutralized by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 11. Samples were phosphorylated at pH 7.4 for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 21 mm glycine, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 180 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega), and 50 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by boiling in Laemmli buffer and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. After autoradiography, Western immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-NBC antibodies were performed to assess sample loading of the gels, and the immune complexes were detected by Enhanced Chemical Luminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, III). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cell lysates from BSC-1 cells expressing wild-type mNHERF-(1–355) in the absence or presence of treatment with 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min. The lysates were split, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using either an anti-NBC antibody or anti-NHERF antibody following the protocol outline above. The individual antibodies were conjugated to Protein A-Sepharose beads using disuccinimidyl suberate. NBC and NHERF were resolved on 10 and 6% polyacrylamide gels, respectively. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using mNHERF-(1–355), mNHERF-(1–126), or mNHERF-(116–355) as bait and NBC or the C-terminal 700 bp of rabbit NHE3 as prey. PCR-amplified constructs were subcloned into pLexA or pB42AD vectors (CLONTECH). All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Yeast bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into the yeast reporter strain EGY48[p8op-lacZ] and plated on synthetic dropout plates [−his, −ura, −trp] to select for transformants. Yeast colonies were harvested and lysed, and activity was determined using a luciferase assay. Activity was calculated as units/A600. Colonies expressing only the bait or prey were run as controls with each screen. These colonies expressed only minimal activity. The results are expressed as the ratio (-fold increase) of activity in the experimental colonies divided by the highest value of the appropriate control yeast colonies. Western immunoblotting was used to confirm expression of the fusion proteins. Cell surface expression of NBC was determined in mNHERF-(1–355)-expressing BSC-1 cells under control conditions or after 15 min of treatment with 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated at 4 °C using a borate buffer containing sulfosuccinimide-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithioproprionate-biotin, scraped, solubilized with Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g (11Collazo R.

A portion of the supernatant was separated, and the remainder was incubated with avidin-agarose. The avidin-agarose beads were washed in buffer, and the bound proteins were solubilized and heated gently to yield the surface fraction. The fractions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon membranes, and Western analysis was performed using anti-NBC antibodies. Multiple antibodies to NBC1 were utilized. The following antigens were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits: a polypeptide representing amino acids 153–172 and 1016–1035 of rat NBC1, a polypeptide representing the terminal 18 amino acids of human NBC1, a maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to amino acids 990–1035 of rat NBC1, and a MBP fused to amino acids 338–391 of rat NBC1. In addition, antibodies raised in guinea pig against both MBP fusion proteins were used. All of the antibodies yielded a single band of ∼120 kDa using BSC-1 cell lysates, and comparable results were obtained with each antibody. Preliminary studies established that the signal for each antibody was ablated by preincubation of the antibody with the polypeptide antigen used to generate the antibody. Unless otherwise indicated, studies were performed using the antibody to the terminal 18 amino acids of human NBC1. Western immunoblots of BSC-1cell lysates were performed using antibodies to NBC1 or NHERF (2Zizak M. Lamprecht G. Steplock D. Tariq N. Shenolikar S. Donowitz M. Yun C. Weinman E.J. J. Biol.

Control and cAMP-treated (100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min) BSC-1 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min followed by washing and quenching of aldehyde groups with 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and treated with 6 mguanidine for 10 min to unmask antigenic sites (12Wade J.B. Welling P. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Biol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slides were incubated with a guinea pig or rabbit polyclonal antibody to NBC and an antibody to rabbit NHERF or ezrin (SC-6407, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, they were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The secondary antibodies were coupled to Alexa 488 or 568 dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:100. Specimens were examined with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (13Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were analyzed by analysis of variance (14Harper J.F. Comput. Biol. Med. 1984; 14: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 indicates that BSC-1 cells express NBC1 (Fig. 1 A). Also shown in Fig. 1 is the inability to detect a cross-reacting antigen to an anti-rabbit NHERF polyclonal antibody in wild-type BSC-1 cells and the ready expression of mNHERF-(1–355) in the transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Immunoblots of cell lysates expressing the other truncated and mutated forms of NHERF demonstrated NHERF bands of the appropriate size but no change in the endogenous expression of NBC (data not shown). NBC is expressed in the basolateral surface of the BSC-1 cells (see Figs. 4and 6) where it co-localizes with Na+-K+-ATPase (not shown). Ezrin is expressed predominantly at the apical membrane but, at high resolution, can be seen throughout the BSC-1 cells. Preliminary experiments indicated that NBC also localizes to the basolateral membranes of rat kidney (not shown).Figure 4mNHERF-(1–355)-expressing BSC-1 cells were fixed and double-labeled using a guinea pig antibody to NBC1 (red) and a rabbit antibody to NHERF (green). Confocal images from planes near the basolateral surface of the cells were obtained from control cells (−cAMP) and from cells treated with 100 μm8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min (+cAMP). No merged coloris observed in any sections, indicating that the two proteins do not co-localize.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6XZ reconstructions of confocal microscopy images of mNHERF-(1–355)-expressing BSC-1 cells studied in the absence (−cAMP) or presence of 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP (+cAMP) for 15 min.

Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, cells were prepulsed using either NH4Cl or NH4SO4 to lower pHi to 6.0–6.2 to maximally stimulate transporters activated by intracellular acidosis. In the absence of CO2and bicarbonate, pHi recovered rapidly in the presence of sodium. The sodium-dependent pHi recovery was totally inhibited by amiloride (1 mm) or EIPA (50 μm) indicating the operation of a Na+/H+ exchanger. Accordingly, all ensuing experiments were conducted in the presence of 50 μm EIPA. After acidification, the pHi remained unchanged or tended to drift slowly over several minutes to more alkaline values when the cells were perfused with a sodium-free choline bicarbonate/potassium gluconate solution containing EIPA (Fig. 2 A). This “drift” was not apparent in all cells and did not differ between cells prepulsed with NH4Cl or NH4SO4. Even in cells that demonstrated this slow upward pH shift, the rate was orders of magnitude slower than that observed in the presence of sodium, was not affected by cAMP, and, for the purposes of these experiments, was not considered further in the calculation of the rates of NBC transport. As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was a rapid rise in pHiwhen the cells were perfused with sodium bicarbonate. To determine if BSC-1 cells contained a sodium-dependent anion exchanger, the rate of sodium-dependent pHi recovery was determined using chloride-containing or chloride-free solutions. The total duration of exposure to chloride free solutions was 35–45 min. Sodium-dependent pHi recovery averaged 0.053 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s when the all-incubating, prepulse, and perfusion solutions contained chloride and 0.059 ± 0.005 ΔpHi/s (n = 6) and when the solutions contained sulfate but no chloride (p = NS). Taken together, these findings indicate that BSC-1 cells possess an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger and a sodium bicarbonate symporter. They do not exhibit a sodium-independent chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, a sodium-dependent anion exchanger, or a potassium-dependent mechanism for transfer of base equivalents. These finding are in accord with prior studies of Jentsch et al. (15Jentsch T.J. Janicke I. Sorgenfrei D. Keller S.K. Wiederholt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12120-12127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, NBC activity was taken as the rate of sodium-dependent pHi recovery in cells preincubated in chloride-free solutions, prepulsed with NH4SO4, and perfused with a chloride-free sodium bicarbonate solution containing EIPA. Transfection of BSC-1 cells with the pcDNA vector alone did not affect NBC activity or confer cAMP responsiveness to these cells. NBC activity in wild-type BSC-1 cells averaged 0.049 ± 0.003 ΔpHi/s in the absence of cAMP and 0.056 ± 0.006 ΔpHi/s in the presence of cAMP (n = 6, p = NS) (TableI). By contrast, in BSC-1 cells expressing mNHERF-(1–355), NBC activity averaged 0.032 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s in the absence of cAMP and 0.022 ± 0.002 ΔpHi/s in the presence of cAMP (n = 9,p < 0.05). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2 B. These results confirm prior studies and indicate the absolute requirement for NHERF for cAMP to inhibit NBC activity (10Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). They also replicate prior observations that overexpression of NHERF in BSC-1 cells tends to decrease basal NBC activity (10Bernardo A.A. Kear F.T. Santos A.V.P. Ma J. Steplock D. Robey R.B. Weinman E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In cells expressing mNHERF-(1–126), including PDZ I, NBC activity averaged 0.029 ± 0.003 ΔpHi/s and 0.027 ± 0.003 ΔpHi/s in the absence and presence of cAMP, respectively (n = 8, p = NS). In cells expressing mNHERF-(116–355), including PDZ II, NBC activity averaged 0.029 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s in the absence and was significantly decreased to 0.016 ± 0.003 ΔpHi/s in the presence of cAMP (n = 8, p < 0.05). To study the role of the ERM binding domain, mNHERF-(1–325) was expressed in the BSC-1 cells. In cells expressing the ezrin binding domain-deficient NHERF, NBC activity averaged 0.029 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s in the absence and 0.029 ± 0.005 ΔpHi/s in the presence of cAMP (n = 8,p = NS). To study the role of NHERF phosphorylation in cAMP-mediated inhibition of NBC, rabbit NHERF containing serine to alanine mutations at positions 287, 289, and 290 was expressed. Prior studies have indicated that rNHERF S287A/S289A/S290A is not a phosphoprotein in vivo and is not phosphorylated by PKA (2Zizak M. Lamprecht G. Steplock D. Tariq N. Shenolikar S. Donowitz M.

Preliminary studies established that wild-type rabbit NHERF was equivalent to mouse NHERF in supporting cAMP inhibition of NBC activity in BSC-1 cells. In cells expressing rabbit NHERF S287A/S289A/S290A, NBC activity averaged 0.043 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s and 0.026 ± 0.002 ΔpHi/s in the absence and presence of cAMP, respectively (n = 8, p < 0.05).Table IThe effect of cAMP on Na+/bicarbonate co-transport in BSC-1 cells expressing NHERFCell lineBasalcAMPInhibition%Control (n = 6)aThe numbers in parentheses indicate the number of measurements.0.049 ± 0.0030.054 ± 0.006+8.6 ± 9.7Mouse NHERF-(1–355) (n = 9)0.032 ± 0.0030.022 ± 0.002bp < 0.01 (versuscontrol).30.7 ± 3.6Mouse NHERF-(1–126) (n = 8)0.029 ± 0.0030.027 ± 0.0029.2 ± 4.3Mouse PDZ II-(116–355) (n = 8)0.029 ± 0.0040.016 ± 0.003bp < 0.01 (versuscontrol).42.7 ± 5.7Mouse NHERF-(1–325) (n = 8)0.029 ± 0.0040.029 ± 0.0053.8 ± 7.6Rabbit NHERF (S287A/S289A/S290A) (n = 8)0.043 ± 0.0040.026 ± 0.002bp < 0.01 (versuscontrol).37.5 ± 5.8Na+/bicarbonate co-transport activity was measured in BSC-1 cells using BCECF fluorescence in the absence or presence of 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP for 15 min.

https://openalex.org/W2066016982,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) stimulates a network of intracellular signaling pathways that displays extensive cross-talk. We have demonstrated previously that the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is important for TPO-induced endomitosis in primary megakaryocytes (MKs). One known pathway by which TPO induces ERK activation is through the association of Shc with the penultimate phosphotyrosine within the TPO receptor, Mpl. However, several investigators found that the membrane-proximal half of the cytoplasmic domain of Mpl is sufficient to activate ERK in vitro and support base-line megakaryopoiesis in vivo. Using BaF3 cells expressing a truncated Mpl (T69Mpl) as a tool to identify non-Shc/Ras-dependent signaling pathways, we describe here novel mechanisms of TPO-induced ERK activation mediated, in part, by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Similar to cells expressing full-length receptor, PI3K was activated by its incorporation into a complex with IRS2 or Gab2. Furthermore, the MEK-phosphorylating activity of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) was also enhanced after TPO stimulation of T69Mpl, contributing to ERK activity. PKCζ and PI3K also contribute to TPO-induced ERK activation in MKs, confirming their physiological relevance. Like in BaF3 cells, a TPO-induced signaling complex containing p85PI3K is detectable in MKs expressing T61Mpl and is probably responsible for PI3K activation. These data demonstrate a novel role of PI3K and PKCζ in steady-state megakaryopoiesis.

As for other cytokine systems, it is becoming clear that the response to TPO is characterized by networks of multiple branching and converging signaling pathways, which display extensive cross-talk. As such, blockade of one signaling pathway can be compensated by alternate pathways. This may partially explain relatively mild hematopoietic phenotypes of mice in which supposedly critical signaling pathways are disrupted by homologous recombination (1Teglund S. McKay C.

We demonstrated previously that the ERK/MAPK pathway is activated in response to TPO in both a BaF3 cell line engineered to express full-length Mpl (BaF3/Mpl) and in primary MKs, and plays an important role in MK endomitosis (4Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, MKs from mice engineered to express only a truncated Mpl receptor missing 60 residues from the COOH terminus of the cytoplasmic domain (T61 or Δ60 mice) display a reduced capacity to activate ERK and have significantly decreased endomitotic capability after TPO administration in vivo (3Luoh S.M.

The classic pathway of ERK activation is via growth factor-induced Shc phosphorylation followed by its association with Grb2 (5Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Consequently, ERK can be activated by Ras-GTP through Raf and MEK phosphorylation. Several groups have reported that Shc is strongly activated in response to TPO (7Drachman J.G. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Hence, Shc-dependent activation of Ras is likely to be an important mechanism of TPO-induced ERK activation. However, we also demonstrated that TPO stimulation of BaF3 expressing a truncated form of Mpl missing 52 residues from the COOH terminus of the cytoplasmic domain (BaF3/T69) could activate ERK without Shc phosphorylation (4Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and support cell growth. Consistent with these results, platelets from T61 mice also retain some ability to activate ERK, independent of Shc (3Luoh S.M. Stefanich E. Solar G. Steinmetz H. Lipari T. Pestina T.I. Jackson C.W. de Sauvage F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, Shc is not absolutely essential for ERK activation. Because the signals emanating from the full-length receptor are very diverse and redundant, studies of signaling from these truncated receptors allowed us to investigate only the minimally required set of signals for resting-state megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, the pathways from the truncated Mpl to MAPK may be novel, as they are not mediated by the conventional Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras pathway. Therefore, potentially new mechanisms of ERK activation have been explored in this study, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). Two types of PI3K have been shown to play important roles in cytokine-mediated signal transduction. Class IA PI3Ks, comprising p85 adapter and p110 catalytic subunits, are activated by cytokines and growth factors, whereas class IB PI3K (PI3Kγ), comprising p101 adapter and p110 catalytic subunits, is activated by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 8Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). A constitutively active form of class IA PI3K has been demonstrated to activate MAPK by stimulating Ras (9Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Interference with the PI3K pathway, either by using pharmacological inhibitors (10Marra F. Pinzani M. DeFranco R. Laffi G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) also blocks ERK activation, suggesting that PI3K is necessary for ERK activation in these systems. We have shown previously that TPO-induced PI3K activation is dependent on the recruitment of the active enzyme into signaling complexes containing Gab/IRS docking proteins (15Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, a docking protein, Gab1, has been implicated in PI3K and thus ERK activation in gp130 receptor signaling (16Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, in other systems, constitutively active forms of this class of PI3K are insufficient to activate ERKs (17Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 18Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In one report, wortmannin-sensitive ERK activation was mediated by the class IB PI3K, PI3Kγ (19Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and the effect was dependent on its protein kinase, not lipid kinase activity (20Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI3K-induced ERK activation has been shown to depend on both cell type and signal intensity; ERK activation depends on PI3K only at low signaling intensities (11Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, several questions remain to be explained: how truncated Mpl receptors activate ERK, whether PI3K is activated by the truncated receptor in response to TPO, how it is activated, and whether it plays a role in ERK activation. PKC is an expanding family of serine-threonine kinases, comprising numerous isoforms, which display varied patterns of tissue distribution and different physiological functions. Pharmacological agents modifying PKC that function in an isoform-specific manner have been generated, potentially providing clinically useful strategies to provide desirable therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse reactions. PKC was reported to be activated by TPO in UT7/Mpl cells (21Kunitama M. Shimizu R. Yamada M. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Okada K. Miura Y. Komatsu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the specific isoform utilization of PKCs and its contribution to ERK activation has not been reported in the TPO system. Several isoforms of PKCs have been shown to activate ERK (22Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PDK1, a kinase dependent on PI3K, can activate atypical isoforms of PKCs (23Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J.

An atypical PKC isoform, PKCζ, has been implicated in Ras-independent ERK activation, either by direct phosphorylation of Raf1 (27van Dijk M.C. Hilkmann H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or of MEK (22Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), serving as a linker between PI3K and ERK pathway. BaF3/Mpl cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mmol/literl-glutamine, 100 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with murine interleukin-3 (IL-3), obtained from the conditioned medium of engineered baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. BaF3 cells expressing various truncation mutants of Mpl (28Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and primary MK isolation from BDF1 mice by unit gravity sedimentation (4Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. T61 mice were a gift of Dr Frederick de Sauvage (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA). T61 MKs were isolated by a procedure similar to that for the wild type MKs, except that 10% fetal bovine serum was added to initial bone marrow cultures because these MKs developed poorly in the presence of TPO alone. At 48 h after culture initiation, nonadherent cells were transferred to a new flask because of excessive growth of adherent macrophages in serum-containing media. An MTT assay for cellular proliferation/survival in response to TPO was performed as reported previously (4Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-IRS2, anti-PI3K (p85 subunit), and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Dr. Toshio Hirano (Osaka, Japan) generously provided rabbit anti-Gab2 antibodies. Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody and anti-phospho-ERK were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All chemical inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). BaF3 cells and MKs were deprived of serum and cytokines for 14 and 6 h, respectively, before stimulation with 14 ng/ml murine TPO for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as reported previously (15Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of lysates was measured by Protein/DC assay (Bio-Rad). Specific proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were then added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The pelleted beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel electrophoresis loading buffer, and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Bands were scanned and quantified by the ImageQuant software. The PI3K activity assay was performed as described previously (15Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A DN p85 PI3K cDNA in SRα plasmid was a gift from Dr. Wataru Ogawa (Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan). A DN SHP2 construct in a eukaryotic expression vector, pCAGGS, was a generous gift from Dr. Hiroshi Maegawa (Shiga University, Kyoto, Japan). To generate cell lines, 100 µg of DN plasmids were co-transfected with 10 µg of pMX-puro (a gift from Dr. Toshio Kitamura) into BaF3/T69 cells by electroporation. A control culture was transfected with pMX-puro plasmid alone. Puromycin at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml was added 24 h after transfection. Expression of the dominant negative protein was determined by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates. Cells were lysed with MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaVO4, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin), immediately frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C until assayed. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min, and 20 µl of packed GST-Ras-binding domain beads were added to 1 ml of supernatant. The mixture was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with MLB before being subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with a pan-Ras antibody (Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY). Cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 500 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 50 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmNaVO4 and sonicated for 20 s. Five hundred µg of protein was pre-cleared with 1 µg of rabbit IgG and 20 µl of protein A agarose beads and immunoprecipitated overnight with 3 µg of anti-PKCζ. Forty µl of Protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated for another 2 h. Beads were then washed two times with the high salt buffer (500 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), three times with lysis buffer, and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate, 20 mm NaVO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol). One-tenth of the last wash was collected for Western blot analysis of PKCζ to assess protein levels in the immune complexes. The kinase buffer was then added with 0.02 mmATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and either 5 µg of recombinant MEK1 (Santa Cruz, CA) or 16 µg of myelin basic protein (MBP) in a total volume of 25 µl. The kinase reaction was performed at 25 °C for 1 h, stopped by adding 20 µl of Western loading buffer and boiling for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried and exposed to film, and the intensity of bands was quantitated by PhosphorImaging. In searching for pathways responsible for Shc-independent ERK activation, the PI3K pathway was explored. As shown in Fig. 1A, TPO stimulation of BaF3/T69 clearly induced ERK phosphorylation, but to a lower extent than that seen in BaF3/Mpl cells. Using phosphorylation of Akt as a marker of PI3K activity, BaF3/T69 cells were found to retain the ability to activate PI3K in response to TPO, although weakly compared with that seen in BaF3/Mpl. Our group has shown that PI3K is essential for cellular proliferation in BaF3/Mpl and primary MK (31Geddis A. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34473-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As TPO-induced Akt activation is much weaker in BaF3/T69 cells than in cells with full-length Mpl, its physiological relevance needed to be determined. BaF3/T69 cell proliferation in response to various concentrations of TPO was assessed by an MTT assay in the presence or absence of a specific PI3K inhibitor, Ly 294002. This inhibitor significantly decreased TPO-induced BaF3/T69 survival/proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). At 16 µm final concentration, there were almost no viable cells remaining in culture. Therefore, despite only modest activation, PI3K plays an important role in proliferation of BaF3/T69 cells. Our previous studies have shown that the major mechanism of TPO-induced PI3K activation was via recruiting active enzyme into Gab- or IRS-containing signaling complexes (15Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To expand upon our Western blot analyses, PI3K activity associated with Gab2-and IRS2-complexes was determined, comparing BaF3/Mpl and BaF3/T69. Phosphoinositol was used as a substrate. After TPO stimulation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either Gab2 or IRS2, and in vitro PI3K activity was assessed by measuring [γ-32P]ATP incorporation into phosphoinositol separated by thin layer chromatography (Fig.2A). Each reaction was conducted with an equal amount of immunoprecipitated docking protein, as determined by parallel Western blot experiments (Fig. 2A,lower panel). PI3K activity was clearly detectable after TPO stimulation in Gab2 and IRS2 signaling complexes derived from both BaF3/Mpl and BaF3/T69 cells. In BaF3/Mpl, the Gab2-associated PI3K activity was more prominent than the IRS2-associated activity. In contrast, the TPO-induced Gab2-associated PI3K activity was significantly lower, and the IRS2-containing complex became more prominent in BaF3/T69 cells. To further explore the mechanisms of PI3K activation in BaF3/T69 cells, we studied the two PI3K-associated signaling complexes in response to TPO, Gab2/SHP2/PI3K and IRS2/PI3K. Gab2 and SHP2 phosphorylation in BaF3 cells expressing full-length Mpl and various COOH-terminally truncated forms of Mpl (designated by T followed by the number of remaining cytoplasmic residues) is shown in a diagram (Fig.2B). A truncation of Mpl that eliminates the two terminal tyrosine residues of Mpl (T98) significantly reduced Gab2 phosphorylation and SHP2 association (compare Mpl to T98; Fig.2C, upper panel). Formation of the complex was further reduced in cells expressing shorter receptors, but as long as a receptor supported JAK2 phosphorylation (T98 through T53; Ref. 28Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) a modicum of Gab2 and SHP2 phosphorylation was seen. A different result was obtained with the IRS2 complex. TPO-induced p85 PI3K association with IRS2 was not decreased in BaF3/T69, compared with that of BaF3/Mpl cells (data not shown). Consistent with the PI3K activity data, IRS2-containing complex formation was not found to be dependent on the terminal half of Mpl. Specific PI3K inhibitors (Ly 294002 and wortmannin) were used to determine the roles of PI3K in ERK activation. In both BaF3/Mpl cells and BaF3/T69 cells, either Ly 294002 or wortmannin inhibited ERK phosphorylation in response to TPO (Fig.3). Compared to cells without inhibitors, TPO-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in BaF3/Mpl cells was reduced by wortmannin at 100 nm final concentration to 62 and 32%, respectively (n = 2). As BaF3/T69 supported less ERK activation, wortmannin decreased ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation to 17 to 12% of control, respectively (n = 3). These data suggest that PI3K is critical for ERK activation by this truncated receptor. To assess the role of PI3K by a different means, a dominant negative construct of p85 PI3K was used. The dominant negative p85 contained a small deletion, rendering it unable to bind to the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110 (32Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, its SH2 domains are intact, allowing it to compete with the wild type protein for binding to Gab and IRS docking proteins. Similar to the results with the chemical inhibitor, DN p85 significantly inhibited both Akt and ERK activation in BaF3/T69 cells. In two separate experiments, Akt and ERK phosphorylation were decreased by dominant negative expression to 57 and 55% (pAkt) and 47 and 25% (pERK2) of that seen in control cells not expressing the DN p85 construct. However, TPO-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was unchanged by the presence of DNp85, suggesting that the inhibition was specific (data not shown). SHP2 has been implicated in ERK activation in insulin and other growth factor systems (33Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr, T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The pathway from SHP2 to MAPK has been shown to be dependent on Ras (35Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 36Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We demonstrated above that SHP2 is phosphorylated and associates with Gab2 in response to TPO in BaF3/T69. In the lysophosphatidic acid and epidermal growth factor systems, binding of SHP2 to Gab1 is required for MAPK activation (37Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A homologous SHP2 and Gab2 association in TPO system may function similarly. Therefore, the roles of SHP2 and Ras for ERK activation were investigated in BaF3/T69 cells. First, Ras activation after TPO stimulation was assessed in BaF3/Mpl and BaF3/T69 cells. Cell lysates were incubated with the Ras-binding domain of Raf1/GST fusion protein coupled to glutathione beads. As Raf1 binds only the active form of Ras, the amount of active Ras in cells was assessed by Western blot analysis probing the amount of Ras bound to Raf1/GST beads in the presence and absence of TPO with a pan-Ras antibody. BaF3/Mpl cells stimulated with TPO activate Shc, leading to Ras activation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there was no Ras activation in BaF3/T69 cells, although ERKs were activated. Because the known signaling pathway from SHP2 to ERK is mediated by Ras, it is less likely that SHP2 induces ERK activation in BaF3/T69 cells. To more directly investigate the role of SHP2 in ERK activation in BaF3/T69 cells, a dominant negative SHP2 construct was used (38Maegawa H. Hasegawa M. Sugai S. Obata T. Ugi S. Morino K. Egawa K. Fujita T. Sakamoto T. Nishio Y. Kojima H. Haneda M. Yasuda H. Kikkawa R. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30236-30243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). BaF3/T69 cells were stably transfected with a dominant negative SHP2 expression plasmid. Clones that highly expressed DN SHP2 and those that did not express the protein were selected for further study (Fig.4B). Endogenous SHP2 phosphorylation after TPO stimulation was markedly inhibited in DN cells (Fig. 4C,second panel). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4C, the DN SHP2 had no effect on ERK activation in TPO-stimulated BaF3/T69 cells. Atypical isoforms of PKC, particularly PKCζ, have been implicated in Ras independent ERK activation in other cell systems (30Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,39Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered PKCζ a potential candidate for mediating Ras-independent ERK activation in BaF3/T69 cells. The function of PKC isoforms was initially evaluated using two pharmacological inhibitors of PKCs, low concentrations of bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), and Ro 31-8220. At low concentrations BIM is an inhibitor of the conventional and novel isoforms of PKC, displaying only minor effects on atypical isoforms of PKCs. In contrast, Ro 31-8220 is a relatively specific inhibitor of atypical isoforms of the kinase (26Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Perez L. Price D. Galloway L. Poklepovic A. Sajan M.P. Cenni V. Sirri A. Moscat J. Toker A. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). TPO-induced ERK activation in BaF3/T69 cells was not affected by BIM (Fig.5A), although PMA-induced activation of ERK was blocked (indicating that the inhibitor was active), suggesting that conventional and novel isoforms of PKCs are not essential for ERK activation by T69Mpl."
https://openalex.org/W2092608482,"ACK2 (activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase-2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is a specific target/effector for the GTP-binding protein Cdc42. Thus far the biological function of this tyrosine kinase has not been determined. Using an inducible eukaryotic expression system in fibroblasts, we demonstrate that ACK2 can strongly influence cell shape and growth as well as focal complex formation. ACK2 was found to associate with the focal adhesion complex components talin and vinculin, but not with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in a kinase-independent manner. The tyrosine kinase activity of FAK was also inhibited in cells overexpressing both wild-type and kinase-defective ACK2. This may be due to a competition between ACK2 and FAK for Src, which is an essential cofactor for FAK activation, as we have found that ACK2 specifically binds Src in cells. The ACK2-Src interaction appears to be mediated by the SH3 domain of Src, and the phosphorylation of ACK2 is enhanced in cells overexpressing the hyperactivated Src(Y527F) mutant. Overexpression of both wild-type and kinase-defective ACK2 also results in a severe inhibition of cell growth. In addition, ACK2 dissolves actin stress fibers and disassembles focal complexes but in a kinase-dependent manner. These results, taken together with previous studies demonstrating an association of ACK2 with integrin β1 (Yang, W., Lin, Q., Guan, J.-L., Cerione, R. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8524–8530) and clathrin (Yang, W., Lo, C. G., Dispenza, T., and Cerione, R. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 17468–17473), suggest that the binding and protein tyrosine kinase activities of ACK2 coordinate changes in cell morphology and growth with the disassembly of focal adhesion sites, perhaps to organize new integrin complexes that are required for endocytosis and/or for cellular differentiation. ACK2 (activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase-2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is a specific target/effector for the GTP-binding protein Cdc42. Thus far the biological function of this tyrosine kinase has not been determined.

This may be due to a competition between ACK2 and FAK for Src, which is an essential cofactor for FAK activation, as we have found that ACK2 specifically binds Src in cells. The ACK2-Src interaction appears to be mediated by the SH3 domain of Src, and the phosphorylation of ACK2 is enhanced in cells overexpressing the hyperactivated Src(Y527F) mutant. Overexpression of both wild-type and kinase-defective ACK2 also results in a severe inhibition of cell growth. In addition, ACK2 dissolves actin stress fibers and disassembles focal complexes but in a kinase-dependent manner. These results, taken together with previous studies demonstrating an association of ACK2 with integrin β1 (Yang, W., Lin, Q., Guan, J.-L., Cerione, R. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8524–8530) and clathrin (Yang, W., Lo, C. G., Dispenza, T., and Cerione, R. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 17468–17473), suggest that the binding and protein tyrosine kinase activities of ACK2 coordinate changes in cell morphology and growth with the disassembly of focal adhesion sites, perhaps to organize new integrin complexes that are required for endocytosis and/or for cellular differentiation. activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase deoxybromouridine Src homology 3 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium calf serum fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase tetracycline ACKs1 (activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinases) are a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that specifically interact with the GTP-bound, active form of Cdc42, a Rho family GTPase (1Yang W.

Lin Q. Guan J.-L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell attachment strongly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK2. Unlike the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which has a tyrosine kinase activity that is specifically increased by cell adhesion on fibronectin-coated plates, the tyrosine kinase activity of ACK2 is stimulated when attaching cells to either fibronectin- or polylysine-coated plates. Interestingly the stimulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of ACK2 by adhesion is, at least partially, mediated by integrin β1. Data from immunoprecipitation studies indicated that ACK2 associated with an integrin β1complex (3Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.-L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that this tyrosine kinase may have a regulatory role in the assembly or disassembly of focal adhesion complexes.To further address the cellular function of the Cdc42-specific target ACK2, we used a Tet-off inducible eukaryotic cell expression system. Here we show that the overexpression of ACK2 in NIH3T3 cells strikingly affected cell morphology as well as inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK, perhaps as an outcome of the binding of ACK2 to c-Src. These ACK2-mediated effects were all largely independent of ACK2 tyrosine kinase activity as was a marked inhibition of cell growth that accompanied the inducible expression of ACK2. The expression of ACK2 also resulted in the disruption of actin stress fibers and focal complexes, although these effects were dependent on ACK2 tyrosine kinase activity. Overall the data indicate that the Cdc42 target ACK2 participates in the down-regulation of focal adhesion complex organization and acts as a negative regulator of mitogenic signaling activity.DISCUSSIONThe GTP-binding protein Cdc42 has been implicated in a diversity of cellular activities that ultimately mediate changes in cell shape, motility, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and cell survival (15Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Among the major questions concerning the underlying mechanisms for these different functions are the cellular roles played by the individual targets of Cdc42. Here we have examined the cellular effects of the highly specific Cdc42 target ACK2 and found that it has a significant influence on cell shape, cell cycle progression, and the actin cytoskeleton. Specifically both wild-type and kinase-dead ACK2 induce cell extensions and inhibit cell growth. The effects are somewhat enhanced when expressing a kinase-competent ACK2 compared with the kinase-defective version. Nonetheless, the latter causes clear changes in cell shape and retards cell growth, arguing that it is the binding ability (rather than the tyrosine kinase activity) of ACK2 that is mainly responsible for these effects. However, there is a significant requirement for the kinase activity of ACK2 in its ability to dissolve actin stress fibers and disassemble focal complexes. Thus, one can envisage a model where the binding of ACK2 to integrin β1 and/or vinculin, talin, and c-Src initially results in a modulation of FAK activity and cytoskeletal alterations that lead to cellular extensions. The activation of ACK2 tyrosine kinase activity apparently then gives rise to the phosphorylation of a focal contact or cytoskeletal-associated component(s) that directs focal adhesion disassembly and the dissolution of actin stress fibers.All of this makes it attractive to think of ACK2 as playing a key regulatory role both through its binding partners and tyrosine phosphosubstrate(s) in coordinating changes in cell shape with a slowing of cell cycle progression. The coordination of these activities becomes important during cellular differentiation. This is especially the case when considering the shape changes and effects on actin stress fibers that accompany neuronal differentiation. Previous studies have shown that the inhibition of actin stress fiber formation results in cell membrane protrusion or neurite outgrowth (17Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Microinjection of the constitutively active Rho mutant Rho(G14V) or the catalytic domain of the p160 RhoA-binding kinase ROKα into rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells rapidly induced neurite retraction (18Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), while introduction of the C3 exoenzyme, which is a specific inhibitor for Rho activation, promoted neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (17Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, the microinjection of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42(T17N)) inhibited neurite outgrowth completely, indicating that active Cdc42 is required for this neuronal activity. Microinjection of activated Cdc42 into PC12 cells leads to a loss of actin stress fibers and focal complexes. Thus, ACK2, which is capable of inducing cellular extensions and disrupting actin stress fibers, may be responsible for mediating these Cdc42-stimulated events during a differentiation response.It has been well established that a FAK·Src complex plays a pivotal role in integrin-mediated cell growth (19Jones R.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Cary L.A. Han D.C. Guan J.-L. Histol.

Thus, it seems likely that some of the effects of ACK2 on cell growth are through its interactions with Src, perhaps by blocking the proper activation of FAK and preventing its transmission of mitogenic signals through the Grb2/Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hauch C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 22Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, thus far we have not been able to draw a direct correlation between the ACK2-Src interaction and ACK2-mediated growth inhibition. We have found that an ACK2 SH3 domain mutant that is incapable of binding clathrin is also unable to inhibit cell growth (data not shown). This provides us with a clue that the ACK2-clathrin interaction is somehow linked to the ACK2-mediated effects on cell cycle progression. Such a possibility is interesting as proteins that participate in the endocytosis of growth factor or other mitogenic receptors are often growth inhibitory. The potential regulatory effects of ACK2 on growth factor receptor and/or integrin endocytosis giving rise to a down-regulation of these receptors could strongly contribute to the effects of ACK2 on cell shape and the actin cytoskeleton as well as cell cycle progression and thereby serve a multipurpose function toward the generation of a differentiation signal. It will be interesting to see how general a role ACK2 plays in cellular differentiation processes and whether such roles are connected to the regulation of ACK2 by integrins and other cell adhesion molecules. Such a connection may be manifested by the involvement of ACK2 in the disruption of focal adhesion complexes and the organization of new integrin complexes necessary for clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis. Future studies will be directed toward testing these ideas.

At least four different isoforms have been identified, of which isoform Pax-5a has been extensively studied, while functions for alternative isoforms were previously unknown. Here, using a transient transfection system, we provide evidence that alternative isoform Pax-5d acts as a dominant-negative regulator by suppressing activity of Pax-5a in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, co-expression in the presence of alternative isoform Pax-5e causes an increase in Pax-5a activity. Protein studies on Pax-5e using Western blot analysis revealed that this 19-kDa isoform migrates as a 27-kDa species on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, while a mutant Pax-5e form in which a C-terminal cysteine residue has been mutated, runs at the expected 19 kDa. Using both Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays, we further provide evidence that this size discrepancy may be caused by a tight association between Pax-5e and a thioredoxin-like factor. Comparison of various B cell lines as well as resting and lipopolysaccharide-activated mature B lymphocytes shows that increased B cell proliferation correlates with increased levels of Pax-5e/thioredoxin, whereas increased Pax-5d amounts correlate with inhibition of cell growth. Together, our results suggest that during activation and differentiation of B lymphocytes, Pax-5a function is modulated by two alternative spliced isoforms: the dominant negative Pax-5d isoform may mediate inhibition of Pax-5a activity in resting B cells, while alternative isoform Pax-5e associated with thioredoxin may increase Pax-5a activity through an unknown (redox) mechanism.

Together, our results suggest that during activation and differentiation of B lymphocytes, Pax-5a function is modulated by two alternative spliced isoforms: the dominant negative Pax-5d isoform may mediate inhibition of Pax-5a activity in resting B cells, while alternative isoform Pax-5e associated with thioredoxin may increase Pax-5a activity through an unknown (redox) mechanism. nucleotide(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction small resting B cells lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody thioredoxin bovine serum albumin B-cell specific activator protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay amino acid(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis B lymphocytes are the major players of the humoral immune system and are essential to the detection and elimination of pathogens. Spatial and temporal gene expression of B cell-specific transcription factors largely determines the maturation and activation pathways in a B cell, and is a tightly regulated process. A number of transcription factors have now been identified as essential for B cell development and activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Reya T. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 2Liberg D. Sigvardsson M. Curr. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 127-153PubMed Google Scholar), including one of the products encoded by the Pax-5 gene, the B-cell specific activator protein (BSAP). Pax-5 expression is first detected in the developing central nervous system (3Adams B. Dorfler P. Agguzi A. Kozmik P. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 4Asano M. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1991; 39: 29-39Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After birth and throughout life, Pax-5 transcripts are found in cells of the B-lymphoid lineage and in testis of the adult mouse (3Adams B. Dorfler P. Agguzi A. Kozmik P. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Within the B cell lineage, Pax-5 is expressed during early stages of B cell development up to the mature B-cell, but is greatly down-regulated or absent in plasma cells (5Barberis A. Widenhorn K. Vitelli L. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1990; 22: 37-43Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Pax-5gene in mouse results in a complete block of B cell development at the pro-B cell stage, revealing the essential role of this gene in early B cell lymphopoiesis (6Urbanek P. Wang Z.Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Pax-5-binding sites have been identified on the promoters of a number of B cell-specific genes (reviewed in Ref. 7Hagman J. Wheat W. Fitszimmons D. Hodson W. Negri J. Dizon F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 245: 169-194PubMed Google Scholar). Among the positively regulated Pax-5 targets are genes encoding the CD19 co-stimulatory receptor (8Kozmik Z. Wang S. Dörfler P. Adams B. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and the protein-tyrosine kinase Blk (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pax-5 functions as a repressor for the immunoglobulin J chain and the Ig 3′α enhancer (10Rinkenberger J.L. Wallin J.J.

In addition to its role in B-lymphopoiesis, Pax-5 has been implicated in activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes since its decreased expression resulted in reduced numbers of cells post-activation (13Wakatsuki Y. Neurath M. Max E.E. Strober W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recent reports by Tell et al. (14Tell G. Scaloni A. Pellizari L. Formisano S Pucillo C.

Pucillo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) provide evidence that Pax-5a activity is regulated through a redox mechanism that involves Ref-1. The authors show that an oxidized form of Pax-5a is unable to interact with DNA, whereas the reduced form binds strongly, and that an intramolecular disulfide bond within the paired domain of Pax-5a causes interference with specific DNA binding (14Tell G. Scaloni A. Pellizari L. Formisano S Pucillo C. Damante G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exposure of B cells to H2O2 results in rapid transfer of the cytoplasmic redox factor Ref-1 into the nucleus and this correlates with an increase in Pax-5 binding activity (15Tell G. Zecca A. Pellizzari L. Spessotto P. Colombatti A. Kelley M.R. Damanter G. Pucillo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Pax-5 gene produces four isoforms as a result of alternative splicing: Pax-5a (full-length Pax-5 or BSAP),Pax-5b, Pax-5d, and Pax-5e (16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Pax-5a and Pax-5d isoforms, but not Pax-5b, are expressed at detectable levels in normal B cells, although the levels of Pax-5d transcripts are significantly lower than those of Pax-5a (16Zwollo P.

Pollock R. Zwollo P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, both Pax-5a and Pax-5d, but not Pax-5e, possess an intact DNA-binding domain, enabling them to interact with and compete for Pax-5-binding sites on DNA in vitro (Fig. 1; Ref. 16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither Pax-5d nor Pax-5e possesses transactivation, repression, or partial homeodomain homology regions at the C terminus. Instead, in Pax-5d and -5e, the region encoded by exons 6–10 is replaced with a 128 nt1 novel sequence (16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with unknown function. Based on the DNA binding abilities and expression pattern of Pax-5a and -5d, we hypothesize that the two isoforms compete for DNA-binding sites and have opposite effects on transcription of target genes in vivo. Although a number of studies have shown clear functional significance for isoform Pax-5a (8Kozmik Z. Wang S. Dörfler P. Adams B. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 18Zwollo P. Rao S. Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 7: 2198-2211Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar), no prior work had yet characterized the functions of isoforms Pax-5d and -5e. Thus, the first goal of our studies was to determine the transactivation properties of both isoforms. Here we show, using a transient transfection system, that Pax-5d has a transactivating function opposite to that of Pax-5a, whereas, unexpectedly, isoform Pax-5e increases the activity of Pax-5a. Upon further characterization we found evidence that isoform Pax-5e forms a strong complex in the nucleus with a thioredoxin-like molecule. Furthermore, using B cell lines as well as resting and LPS-activated B cells, we show that the ratio of Pax-5d to Pax-5e correlates with the proliferation state of the B cell. The observed changes in Pax-5d/5e ratio are regulated at the protein level, as we found no evidence for changes in ratios of Pax-5d to Pax-5e transcript levels. In summary, data presented here suggest that during B cell activation/proliferation, the activity of transcription factor Pax-5a may be regulated through changes in relative amounts of alternative isoforms Pax-5d and Pax-5e, and such changes likely affect expression of Pax-5 target genes. Murine B-lymphoid cell lines KEFTL-1 (pro-B), HAFTL-1 (pro-B), FE1NC3 (pro-B), HRC3 (pro-B), 18.8 (pre-B), PD31 (pre-B), 70Z/3 (pre-B), WEHI-231 (immature B), A20/2J (mature B), A20 (mature B), B17.10 (mature B), 2PK3 (mature B), and CH12 (pre-secretor B), and Sp2/0 (plasma cell), were either gifts from Dr. Steve Desiderio (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) or purchased through ATCC. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhitaker, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The COS-1 cell line (ATCC), a transformed African green monkey kidney cell line, was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 (ATCC), an embryonic mouse fibroblast cell line, was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc. Life Technology), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The γ42(3i)AS-CAT reporter construct was created using the pγ42CassI CAT reporter (20Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. Science. 1998; 279: 1961-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Expression of CAT is driven by the truncated rat γ42-fibrinogen promoter (−54 to +36), which includes a TATA box and a single Sp-1-binding site. Three copies of the high-affinity Pax-5-binding site from the CD19promoter (5′-CAGACACCCATGGTTGAGTGCCCTCCAG-3′) were inserted into the polylinker upstream of the γ42-fibrinogen promoter. Recombinant constructs were sequenced to determine copy number and orientation of Pax-5-binding sites. The effector constructs pcDNA.5a and pcDNA.5d were made by cloning the cDNA sequences of Pax-5a, Pax-5d, or Pax-5e into NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3 construct was used as a negative control effector construct, and the HBIICAT construct (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. The pcDNA.5e.mC5 construct was made using a PCR-directed site-specific mutagenesis approach. Primers m5b/5eATG2.S (5′-ccgtgcggccgc323CCATGTTTGCCTGGGAG339-3′, containing in small letters a linker and the NotI restriction site) and m5d/5e.mC5,AS, 5′-gcttctaga202CTAGGACCCTGGGAAGCCCGGTCCTCTG CTGCTA735-3′, including in small letters a linker XbaI restriction site) were used to amplify the region encoding the complete Pax-5e isoform, using pcDNA.5e as a template. A single replacement mutation of nt T (from codon TGC (Cys) to AGC (Ser), underlined as T on antisense primer) replaced the most 3′-terminal cysteine (Cys5) codon with the structurally related Serine residue. The amplified sequence was cloned into the NotI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cysteine replacement mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Transient transfections of B cell lines A20/2J and Sp2/0 were performed by the DEAE-dextran (21Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) method as described previously (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonlymphoid cell lines COS-1 and NIH 3T3 were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Data were quantified using an NIH Image software analysis program (rsb.ihfo.nih.gov/nih-image/). Relative CAT conversion was determined as described previously (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Splenic B cells were obtained from 3–6-month-old BALB/c mice (bred at The College of William and Mary). Small resting B cells (SRBs) were isolated from a 70% Percoll gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (18Zwollo P. Rao S. Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18647-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SRB populations were activated by culturing in complete RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented as above) in the presence of 20 μg/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) for the required period of time. Cells were collected at specified times and processed for nuclear extracts as described elsewhere (22Wallin J.J. Rinkenberger J.L. Rao S. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. Zwollo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15959-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Procedures for nuclear extract preparation were carried out on ice in a cold room at 6 °C. Total cellular RNA was isolated from Percoll-purified SRBs or LPS-activated B cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RT-PCR the cDNA was made using 1 μg of RNA and random hexamers using an RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the PCR reactions, two 5′-sense primers were used: primer Pax-5.164.S (5′-164CCAGGCAGCTTCGGGTCAGCC184) anneals to a sequence in exon two (present on Pax-5d, but absent from Pax-5e), whereas primer Pdcon.1.S (5′-322ACCATGTTTGCCTGGGAG339) which recognizes a sequence on exon 3, can anneal to either Pax-5d or Pax-5e. One antisense primer was used, PP15 (16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), complementary to the novel sequence present in both Pax-5d and Pax-5e. PCR amplification of cDNAs were performed in 100-μl reactions, with 1 min denaturing at 94 °C, 1.5 min, annealing at 55 °C, and 1.5 min extension at 72 °C for 26 cycles, in the presence of all three primers in each sample. Two PCR-amplified DNA bands were expected, a 571-nt band that is Pax-5d specific, and a 413-nt band representing both Pax-5d and Pax-5e. Nuclear extracts and cytoplasmic fractions from SRBs, LPS-activated B cells, or cell lines were separated on 12–15% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) as described previously (18Zwollo P.

Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide CD19/BSAP probe (5′-CAGACACCCATGGTTGAGTGCCCTCCAG-3′) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of nuclear extract to poly(dI·dC) (in μg) was kept constant at 1:2 in all experiments. In antibody supershift/competition EMSAs, nuclear extracts were preincubated in the presence of 1 μl of (1:5 diluted) antibody without probe for 10 min at 30°C. Products were separated by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in buffer containing 33 mm Tris-HCl, 33 mm boric acid, and 0.74 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak X-Omat-AR film. The plasmids (pBluescript) containing the isoform Pax-5a (pcDNA.5a), Pax-5d, (pcDNA.5d), or Pax-5e (pcDNA.5e) were transcribed in sense direction with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, as described previously (16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Translation was carried out using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT; Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. SRBs were partially purified by Percoll gradients and grown in culture in the presence of 20 μg/ml LPS for 2 or 6 days. Cells from both time points were always processed at the same time: first, cells were cultured in long term labeling mixture (1% fetal bovine serum, 90% RPMI minus methionine, and 10% complete RPMI) in the presence of 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 8 h (24Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current. Protocols in Immunology, Unit 8.3. Vol. 2.

Nuclear extracts for both time points were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of ED-1 (1:250 dilution), α-TRX supernatant (1:30 dilution), or 6G11 supernatant (1:30 dilution), and mouse anti-Thy-1.2 mAb HO-13–4 (ATTC) hybridoma supernatant (1:30) as negative control. For ED-1 and 6G11, Protein G-Sepharose was then added for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation, denaturing of the complexes, and finally, SDS-PAGE analysis. For α-TRX/IgA containing nuclear extracts, Protein G-Sepharose was preincubated with goat anti-IgA antiserum (1:50; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 2 h, followed by repeated washes of the beads before their addition to the nuclear extracts. Gels were dried, fixed, and incubated in fluorographic reagent using an Amplify kit (NAMP100; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by exposure to x-ray film for 2–6 days. Pax-5a plays essential roles during B cell development and activation, and this isoform has been studied extensively. In contrast, no prior studies had yet investigated the regulatory properties of two alternative Pax-5 isoforms, Pax-5d and -5e. The transactivation function of isoform Pax-5a on the tyrosine kinase gene blkwas previously determined in our laboratory using the chloramphenicol transferase (CAT) reporter gene: Pax-5a acts as an activator of blk expression (18Zwollo P. Rao S. Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18647-18655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we initially used the same target promoter sequence as was used for Pax-5a to investigate Pax-5d and -5e function, but due to low transfection efficiency in B cell lines combined with low activity of the blk promoter (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were unable to determine reliable quantitative differences. As an alternative approach, we created an artificial promoter containing multiple Pax-5 DNA-binding sites, similar to an approach previously used by others (25Dörfler P. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Three copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the high affinity Pax-5 DNA-binding site from the murine CD19 promoter were cloned in sense or antisense orientation upstream of the TATA element of the truncated rat γ42-fibrinogen promoter driving expression of the CAT gene, as shown in Fig. 2 A. Both sense and antisense reporters gave similar promoter activities and the antisense construct, named γ42(3i)AS-CAT, was used in all subsequent experiments. To verify the specificity of γ42(3i)AS-CAT, namely, that reporter expression was expressed in the presence, but not absence, of endogenous Pax-5a protein, transient transfections using DEAE-dextran were performed in the mature B cell line A20/2J and the plasma cell line SP2/0. As expected, CAT expression was detected in the Pax-5 positive A20/2J line (Fig. 2 B), but no activity was detectable in the Pax-5 negative SP2/0 line (Fig. 2 C). As a control for transfection efficiency, the HBIICAT construct was used. This construct contains a portion of the RNA polymerase II promoter and drives high expression of CAT (9Zwollo P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on earlier in vitro data (16Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showing that Pax-5a and -5d have similar affinity for Pax-5 DNA-binding sites on the blkpromoter, we first sought to investigate whether the potentially dominant negative isoform Pax-5d can inhibit Pax-5a activity in vivo. For this set of experiments, the NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line was used because this cell type does not express endogenous Pax proteins, allowing for transfection of highly controlled amounts of various Pax-5 isoforms. To determine the activity of Pax-5a alone on the γ42(3i)AS-CAT reporter in this cell line, co-transfections were performed with the expression vector pcDNA.5a. The pcDNA3 vector without insert was used in all subsequent transfections as a negative control, and added where necessary to maintain equal amounts of total transfected DNA. Results from repeated CAT assays showed that the reporter gene was expressed at high levels in the presence, but not absence, of Pax-5a (Fig. 3 A) confirming a positive transactivating function for this isoform using the γ42(3i)AS-CAT reporter. In contrast, isoform Pax-5d alone was unable to activate the reporter gene, yielding only basal levels of transcription that were similar to those produced in the presence of the control plasmid pcDNA3 (Fig. 3 A). Next, it was tested whether alternative isoform Pax-5d could affect the activity of Pax-5a. Reporter construct γ42(3i)AS-CAT was transiently co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells using fixed amounts of pcDNA.5a and increasing amounts of pcDNA.5d (Fig. 3 A). The data showed that Pax-5d was able to suppress Pax-5a dependent activity of the CAT reporter in a dose-dependent manner, although relatively high amounts of Pax-5d were needed for efficient suppression (discussed in later section). To verify that amounts of transfected DNA corresponded with the correct amounts of Pax-5a and Pax-5d protein, nuclear extracts from transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Results using the ED-1 antibody (which detects Pax-5a and -5d protein with the same intensity, as both have a complete paired domain), showed the expected expression patterns of both proteins (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), and Pax-5d expression was independently verified using the Pax-5d/5e specific monoclonal 6G11 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). Kidney cells contain endogenous Pax proteins which have been shown to interact with Pax-5 DNA-binding sites (27Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dorfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell.

It contains two internal hydrophobic domains (34 residues each) that have enough residues to form four transmembrane (TM) segments. In this study, we have determined the membrane topography of mPRA1 in both intact cells and isolated microsomes. The putative TM segments of mPRA1 were used to substitute for a known TM segment of a model membrane protein to determine whether the mPRA1 segments integrate into the membrane. Furthermore, N-linked glycosylation scanning methods were used to distinguish luminal domains from cytoplasmic domains of mPRA1. The data demonstrate that mPRA1 is a polytopic membrane protein containing four TM segments. These TM segments act cooperatively during the translocation and integration at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. All hydrophilic domains are in the cytoplasm, including the N-terminal domain, the linker domain between the two hydrophobic domains, and the C-terminal domain. As a result, the bulk of mPRA1 is located in the cytoplasm, supporting its postulated role in regulating Rab membrane targeting and intracellular trafficking.

However, its membrane topography is unknown.This study examines the membrane topography of mouse PRA1 (mPRA1). The mPRA1 contains two long internal hydrophobic domains (Fig.1 A). The first hydrophobic domain (HD1) contains 34 residues, which could contain a signal anchor sequence to target the nascent polypeptide chain to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiate translocation across the ER membrane. The second hydrophobic domain (HD2) also contains 34 residues, which could contain a stop-transfer sequence to terminate the translocation. These processes would occur co-translationally at the ER translocon (5Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16994) Google Scholar) hydropathy analysis of the mPRA1 primary sequence (Fig. 1 B), the mPRA1 may adopt one of several possible membrane topologies. Because HD1 and HD2 contain enough residues to form four transmembrane (TM) segments, one model suggests that the mPRA1 is a polytopic membrane protein with HD1 and HD2 each passing through the membrane twice, placing all hydrophilic domains (the N-terminal, C-terminal, and linker (L) domains) in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 D). The assignment of these hydrophilic domains to the cytoplasmic side (versus luminal side) is based on the size of the N-terminal domain (78 residues) and the charge distribution adjacent to the TM domains. Thus, a large and stably folded N-terminal domain and domains containing more positively charged residues are likely to be found on the cytoplasmic side of membranes (8Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E.

https://openalex.org/W2076478546,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA), one of the most promising immunosuppressive drugs recently developed, is a potent inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, the first committed step toward GMP synthesis. We found that all the drug effects on yeast cells were prevented by bypassing GMP synthesis, thus confirming the high specificity of MPA. Although the primary target of MPA is clearly identified, we aimed to further understand how GTP depletion leads to growth arrest and developed a new approach based on proteome analysis combined with overexpression studies. Essential proteins down-expressed in the presence of MPA were identified by protein two-dimensional gel analysis and subsequently overexpressed in yeast. Two such proteins, Cdc37p and Sup45p, when overexpressed allowed partial relief of MPA toxicity, strongly suggesting that their lower amount after MPA treatment significantly contributed to the MPA effect. These conserved proteins involved in cell cycle progression and translation are therefore important secondary targets for MPA. Our data establish that MPA effects occur through inhibition of a unique primary target resulting in guanine nucleotides depletion, thereby affecting multiple cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2325318315,"Ras-genes encode for proteins important for transmitting extracellular signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In this study we investigated the impact of Ras on cell cycle progression after hepatectomy by using adenoviral vectors (adv) expressing beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), a dominant-negative (Ras N17) or a dominant-active (Ras 61L) form of H-Ras. Partial hepatectomy was performed in mice treated with the different adenoviruses and cell cycle progression was studied by analysing factors involved in cell cycle control during liver regeneration. After hepatectomy, adv Ras 61L increases DNA synthesis significantly in comparison to the other treatment groups. Higher Ras activity results in an early increase of transcriptional active E2F-3, which is associated with higher cyclin E, but almost unchanged cyclin D protein expression. However, Northern blot analysis and cyclin E promoter experiments indicate that, besides transcriptional mechanisms also post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in regulating cyclin E protein expression after partial hepatectomy in mice treated with adv Ras 61L. Cyclin E phosphorylation studies demonstrate that adv Ras 61L results in hypophosphorylation of cyclin E compared to the control group at early time points after hepatectomy, when cyclin E protein expression strongly increases and there is only a minor effect on cyclin E mRNA levels. Our experiments indicate adv Ras 61L in vivo increases Cyclin E expression by higher transcription via E2F and a post-transcriptional mechanism. These mechanisms result in an earlier activation of an active CDK2/Cyclin E complex which, in turn, triggers DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1994666923,"Mipp is a kelch-related, placental-specific gene that is ectopically expressed in many BALB/c mouse mammary carcinomas of various etiologies. The Kelch family encompasses proteins that are emerging as key links between microfilaments and a variety of cellular structures and functions. Mouse mammary tumors express two mipp transcripts (2.2 and 5.6 kb). We cloned the 2.2 kb mipp mRNA and analysed the product of its 1.7 kb ORF. The 584 residue MIPP protein has an N-terminal BTB domain and six C-terminal tandem Kelch repeats. Despite expression of two mipp RNAs, only a single MIPP protein is expressed in mammary tumors. MIPP protein binds to microfilaments in vitro and co-immunoprecipitates with actin. MIPP co-localized with concanavalin A at the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that MIPP might mediate interactions between microtubules and actin filaments. Because MIPP expression is widespread in mouse mammary tumors, it might contribute to tumorigenesis. Although MIPP had little effect on the growth rate of human breast cell lines following transfection, it greatly reduced the formation of duct-like structures on reconstituted basement membrane. Our results suggest that MIPP could contribute to malignant progression in the mouse mammary epithelial cells by perverting their response to cues from the extracellular matrix."
