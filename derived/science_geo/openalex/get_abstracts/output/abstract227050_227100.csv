https://openalex.org/W1994183741,"IN order to find out on how small a scale ecological differentiation can occur, a study is being made of the differentiation in the grass Agrostis tenuis in the region around Aberystwyth. Samples of sixty separate tillers taken at random from each of a number of different habitats have been cultivated, suitably laid out in trial, in an experimental garden. A considerable amount of very local differentiation has been found, an account of which will be published elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2062284841,THE discovery of phoretic associations between Afronurus and Simulium species and between the early stages of Simulium neavei and freshwater crabs has been reported in Nature1. I was then under the impression that S. neavei was the only species which lived in a state of phoresis with Potamon niloticus (the crab concerned); but subsequent surveys have revealed that the earlier stages of at least two other species participate in this association.
https://openalex.org/W2072929797,"SINCE the original studies of Stokstad and co-workers1, the growth-promoting effect of aureomycin has been established with several species of animals. So far as we know there are, however, no reports about the effect of aureomycin on guinea pigs. We have used aureomycin in investigations dealing with the synthesis of vitamins in the intestines of rats and guinea pigs. In these experiments it was found that the effect of aureomycin on guinea pigs is quite different from that observed with rats. The same proportional dose which has had a growth-promoting effect on rats appears to be very toxic to guinea pigs."

https://openalex.org/W2056903938,"IT is well known that oxygen consumption increases if the temperature of the environment is raised above the neutral zone (28°–30° for the rat). Normal rats, in a chamber saturated with water vapour, invariably respond to a temperature of 35° C. with a marked rise in oxygen consumption."

https://openalex.org/W2057939588,"SINCE Kögl and Erxleben showed, in 1939, that D-glutamic acid can be isolated from cancerous tissue, D-peptidases have been the subject of many researches. Kögl and Erxleben's demonstration seems to have particular interest, when considered together with the fact that penicillins, on acid hydrolysis, yield an amino-acid of D-configuration, penicillamine, on one hand, and the fact that both antibiotics, tyrocidin and gramicidin S, give D-phenylalanine as their hydrolysis product, on the other. While engaged in the study of capability of soil bacteria to metabolize benzoic acid and its related compounds, and some amino-acids1, we have recently observed that, of thirty-four strains of soil bacteria employed in our experiment, two strains, KT82 and KT83, have the ability to utilize benzoyl-D-phenylalanine (melting point 139°–140°; [α]D13= − 14.9) as well as benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (melting point 139°–140°; [α]D13= + 14.8) as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen."

https://openalex.org/W2018477607,"ARTERIO-VENOUS studies carried out on lactating udders of living cows have repeatedly led to the conclusion that the free amino-acids of the circulating blood are taken up by the gland1. Most authors agree that the observed arterio-venous differences in free amino-acids are inadequate to account quantitatively for the synthesis of the milk proteins—casein and lactalbumin. Other workers found an uptake of protein-bound carbohydrates by the udder of the lactating goat2. No uptake of amino-acids by the udder of the goat and the cow was found during inanition even though some milk was still being secreted2. Recently, carbon-14 labelled valine and carbon-14 labelled lysine were injected intravenously into lactating rabbits3, and the activity of milk and blood proteins estimated. In both cases it was found that the milk proteins were highly radioactive. As this activity was much greater than that of the blood proteins, it was clear that the free amino-acids of the blood were being incorporated directly into the milk proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2064567335,"IN 1948 Okamoto1 reported that o-aminophenol showed a tuberculostatic effect both in vitro and in vivo (in guinea pigs). He also referred to favourable progress when this drug was used clinically in pulmonary tuberculosis. In the course of a study of the chemotherapy of experimental tuberculosis, we have included o-aminophenol in our tests."

https://openalex.org/W2011395656,"IN the course of an investigation (to be reported elsewhere) of press liquor, a waste product of the South African rock lobster industry, it was necessary to examine certain nitrogenous fractions. The solute in de-proteinized (trichloroacetic acid) press liquor was found to consist almost entirely of free amino-acids. A phenol/lutidine chromatogram showed an unknown substance giving a pink to pink-purple colour with ninhydrin. From its position on the chromatogram, it could be either methionine sulphoxide, or the ‘T-spot’ (β-aminoisobutyric acid) of Crumpler, Dent, Harris and Westall1. The first possibility was disproved by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of molybdate; the unknown appearing in its usual position, unlike the sulphoxide, which is oxidized to the sulphone and appears elsewhere on the chromatogram."
https://openalex.org/W2135443170,"THE real relation between ontogeny and the adult stages of ancestors (phylogeny) in multicellular organisms (Metazoa and Metaphyta) is now firmly established in the sense that ontogeny is not an abbreviated or modified phylogeny, that is, the stages of development of an individual do not correspond to the adult forms of the ancestors, as was required by the so-called biogenetic law or theory of recapitulation propounded by Ernst Haeckel. All stages of ontogeny are subject to hereditary changes of evolutionary character. Moreover, the greater changes achieved in the early stages of ontogeny, resulting in paedomorphosis and neoteny, appear to be the most important from the point of view of large-scale evolution (macro-evolution). The changes brought about in later stages of ontogeny, resulting in geronto-morphosis, have an adaptive and specialized significance (Garstang, Sewertzoff, de Beer, Hadži)."
