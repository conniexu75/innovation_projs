https://openalex.org/W3093215896,"Extensive ecosystem restoration is increasingly seen as being central to conserving biodiversity1 and stabilizing the climate of the Earth2. Although ambitious national and global targets have been set, global priority areas that account for spatial variation in benefits and costs have yet to be identified. Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning. Our results confirm the vast potential contributions of restoration to addressing global challenges, while underscoring the necessity of pursuing these goals synergistically. Multicriteria optimization identifies global priority areas for ecosystem restoration and estimates their benefits for biodiversity and climate, providing cost–benefit analyses that highlight the importance of optimizing spatial planning and incorporating several biomes in restoration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3093370683,"Age is the dominant risk factor for most chronic human diseases, but the mechanisms through which ageing confers this risk are largely unknown1. The age-related acquisition of somatic mutations that lead to clonal expansion in regenerating haematopoietic stem cell populations has recently been associated with both haematological cancer2–4 and coronary heart disease5—this phenomenon is termed clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)6. Simultaneous analyses of germline and somatic whole-genome sequences provide the opportunity to identify root causes of CHIP. Here we analyse high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 97,691 participants of diverse ancestries in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme, and identify 4,229 individuals with CHIP. We identify associations with blood cell, lipid and inflammatory traits that are specific to different CHIP driver genes. Association of a genome-wide set of germline genetic variants enabled the identification of three genetic loci associated with CHIP status, including one locus at TET2 that was specific to individuals of African ancestry. In silico-informed in vitro evaluation of the TET2 germline locus enabled the identification of a causal variant that disrupts a TET2 distal enhancer, resulting in increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells. Overall, we observe that germline genetic variation shapes haematopoietic stem cell function, leading to CHIP through mechanisms that are specific to clonal haematopoiesis as well as shared mechanisms that lead to somatic mutations across tissues. Analysis of 97,691 high-coverage human blood DNA-derived whole-genome sequences enabled simultaneous identification of germline and somatic mutations that predispose individuals to clonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells, indicating that both inherited and acquired mutations are linked to age-related cancers and coronary heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W3093292403,"De novo mutations in protein-coding genes are a well-established cause of developmental disorders1. However, genes known to be associated with developmental disorders account for only a minority of the observed excess of such de novo mutations1,2. Here, to identify previously undescribed genes associated with developmental disorders, we integrate healthcare and research exome-sequence data from 31,058 parent-offspring trios of individuals with developmental disorders, and develop a simulation-based statistical test to identify gene-specific enrichment of de novo mutations. We identified 285 genes that were significantly associated with developmental disorders, including 28 that had not previously been robustly associated with developmental disorders. Although we detected more genes associated with developmental disorders, much of the excess of de novo mutations in protein-coding genes remains unaccounted for. Modelling suggests that more than 1,000 genes associated with developmental disorders have not yet been described, many of which are likely to be less penetrant than the currently known genes. Research access to clinical diagnostic datasets will be critical for completing the map of genes associated with developmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3093011094,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed many social, economic, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models to vital statistics data to estimate the all-cause mortality effect of the pandemic for 21 industrialized countries. From mid-February through May 2020, 206,000 (95% credible interval, 178,100–231,000) more people died in these countries than would have had the pandemic not occurred. The number of excess deaths, excess deaths per 100,000 people and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. England and Wales and Spain experienced the largest effect: ~100 excess deaths per 100,000 people, equivalent to a 37% (30–44%) relative increase in England and Wales and 38% (31–45%) in Spain. Bulgaria, New Zealand, Slovakia, Australia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced mortality changes that ranged from possible small declines to increases of 5% or less in either sex. The heterogeneous mortality effects of the COVID-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system. Application of Bayesian models to vital statistics data from 21 industrialized countries shows that approximately 206,000 additional people died than if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occured. The heterogeneous distribution of excess deaths across the countries reflects differences in how the pandemic has been managed as well as the resilience of healthcare systems in these nations."
https://openalex.org/W3093230960,"In the mammalian lung, an apparently homogenous mesh of capillary vessels surrounds each alveolus, forming the vast respiratory surface across which oxygen transfers to the blood1. Here we use single-cell analysis to elucidate the cell types, development, renewal and evolution of the alveolar capillary endothelium. We show that alveolar capillaries are mosaics; similar to the epithelium that lines the alveolus, the alveolar endothelium is made up of two intermingled cell types, with complex 'Swiss-cheese'-like morphologies and distinct functions. The first cell type, which we term the 'aerocyte', is specialized for gas exchange and the trafficking of leukocytes, and is unique to the lung. The other cell type, termed gCap ('general' capillary), is specialized to regulate vasomotor tone, and functions as a stem/progenitor cell in capillary homeostasis and repair. The two cell types develop from bipotent progenitors, mature gradually and are affected differently in disease and during ageing. This cell-type specialization is conserved between mouse and human lungs but is not found in alligator or turtle lungs, suggesting it arose during the evolution of the mammalian lung. The discovery of cell type specialization in alveolar capillaries transforms our understanding of the structure, function, regulation and maintenance of the air-blood barrier and gas exchange in health, disease and evolution."

https://openalex.org/W3093002718,"Telomeres-repeated, noncoding nucleotide motifs and associated proteins that are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes-mediate genome stability and determine cellular lifespan1. Telomeric-repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from chromosome ends2,3; these RNAs in turn regulate telomeric chromatin structure and telomere maintenance through the telomere-extending enzyme telomerase4-6 and homology-directed DNA repair7,8. The mechanisms by which TERRA is recruited to chromosome ends remain poorly defined. Here we develop a reporter system with which to dissect the underlying mechanisms, and show that the UUAGGG repeats of TERRA are both necessary and sufficient to target TERRA to chromosome ends. TERRA preferentially associates with short telomeres through the formation of telomeric DNA-RNA hybrid (R-loop) structures that can form in trans. Telomere association and R-loop formation trigger telomere fragility and are promoted by the recombinase RAD51 and its interacting partner BRCA2, but counteracted by the RNA-surveillance factors RNaseH1 and TRF1. RAD51 physically interacts with TERRA and catalyses R-loop formation with TERRA in vitro, suggesting a direct involvement of this DNA recombinase in the recruitment of TERRA by strand invasion. Together, our findings reveal a RAD51-dependent pathway that governs TERRA-mediated R-loop formation after transcription, providing a mechanism for the recruitment of lncRNAs to new loci in trans."

https://openalex.org/W3092857332,"Lineage-specific epigenomic changes during human corticogenesis have been difficult to study owing to challenges with sample availability and tissue heterogeneity. For example, previous studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least 9 major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal cortex alone1,2. Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased levels of chromatin interactivity-termed super-interactive promoters-are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells. Our findings provide insights into cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in the developing human cortex and advance our understanding of gene regulation and lineage specification during this crucial developmental window."
https://openalex.org/W3093018209,"Henry Miller stated that ""to relieve a full bladder is one of the great human joys"". Urination is critically important in health and ailments of the lower urinary tract cause high pathological burden. Although there have been advances in understanding the central circuitry in the brain that facilitates urination1-3, there is a lack of in-depth mechanistic insight into the process. In addition to central control, micturition reflexes that govern urination are all initiated by peripheral mechanical stimuli such as bladder stretch and urethral flow4. The mechanotransduction molecules and cell types that function as the primary stretch and pressure detectors in the urinary tract mostly remain unknown. Here we identify expression of the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO2 in lower urinary tract tissues, where it is required for low-threshold bladder-stretch sensing and urethral micturition reflexes. We show that PIEZO2 acts as a sensor in both the bladder urothelium and innervating sensory neurons. Humans and mice lacking functional PIEZO2 have impaired bladder control, and humans lacking functional PIEZO2 report deficient bladder-filling sensation. This study identifies PIEZO2 as a key mechanosensor in urinary function. These findings set the foundation for future work to identify the interactions between urothelial cells and sensory neurons that control urination."
https://openalex.org/W3093044960,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are blood cancers that are characterized by the excessive production of mature myeloid cells and arise from the acquisition of somatic driver mutations in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Epidemiological studies indicate a substantial heritable component of MPNs that is among the highest known for cancers1. However, only a limited number of genetic risk loci have been identified, and the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of MPNs remain unclear. Here, by conducting a large-scale genome-wide association study (3,797 cases and 1,152,977 controls), we identify 17 MPN risk loci (P < 5.0 × 10-8), 7 of which have not been previously reported. We find that there is a shared genetic architecture between MPN risk and several haematopoietic traits from distinct lineages; that there is an enrichment for MPN risk variants within accessible chromatin of HSCs; and that increased MPN risk is associated with longer telomere length in leukocytes and other clonal haematopoietic states-collectively suggesting that MPN risk is associated with the function and self-renewal of HSCs. We use gene mapping to identify modulators of HSC biology linked to MPN risk, and show through targeted variant-to-function assays that CHEK2 and GFI1B have roles in altering the function of HSCs to confer disease risk. Overall, our results reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for inherited MPN risk through the modulation of HSC function."
https://openalex.org/W3092921638,"Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate genomic architecture. Here, we present a structural model of the endogenously purified human canonical BAF complex bound to the nucleosome, generated using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-linking mass spectrometry, and homology modeling. BAF complexes bilaterally engage the nucleosome H2A/H2B acidic patch regions through the SMARCB1 C-terminal α-helix and the SMARCA4/2 C-terminal SnAc/post-SnAc regions, with disease-associated mutations in either causing attenuated chromatin remodeling activities. Further, we define changes in BAF complex architecture upon nucleosome engagement and compare the structural model of endogenous BAF to those of related SWI/SNF-family complexes. Finally, we assign and experimentally interrogate cancer-associated hot-spot mutations localizing within the endogenous human BAF complex, identifying those that disrupt BAF subunit-subunit and subunit-nucleosome interfaces in the nucleosome-bound conformation. Taken together, this integrative structural approach provides important biophysical foundations for understanding the mechanisms of BAF complex function in normal and disease states."

https://openalex.org/W3093407063,"Baryonic processes in galaxy evolution include the infall of gas onto galaxies to form neutral atomic hydrogen, which is then converted to the molecular state (H2), and, finally, the conversion of H2 to stars. Understanding galaxy evolution thus requires an understanding of the evolution of stars and of neutral atomic and molecular hydrogen. For the stars, the cosmic star-formation rate density is known to peak at redshifts from 1 to 3, and to decline by an order of magnitude over approximately the subsequent 10 billion years1; the causes of this decline are not known. For the gas, the weakness of the hyperfine transition of H I at 21-centimetre wavelength-the main tracer of the H I content of galaxies-means that it has not hitherto been possible to measure the atomic gas mass of galaxies at redshifts higher than about 0.4; this is a critical gap in our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here we report a measurement of the average H I mass of star-forming galaxies at a redshift of about one, obtained by stacking2 their individual H I 21-centimetre emission signals. We obtain an average H I mass similar to the average stellar mass of the sample. We also estimate the average star-formation rate of the same galaxies from the 1.4-gigahertz radio continuum, and find that the H I mass can fuel the observed star-formation rates for only 1 to 2 billion years in the absence of fresh gas infall. This suggests that gas accretion onto galaxies at redshifts of less than one may have been insufficient to sustain high star-formation rates in star-forming galaxies. This is likely to be the cause of the decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density at redshifts below one."
https://openalex.org/W3092697099,"We examine how information from trusted social media sources can shape knowledge and behavior when misinformation and mistrust are widespread. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe, we partnered with a trusted civil society organization to randomize the timing of the dissemination of messages aimed at targeting misinformation about the virus to 27,000 newsletter WhatsApp subscribers. We examine how exposure to these messages affects individuals’ beliefs about how to deal with the virus and preventative behavior. In a survey of 864 survey respondents, we find a 0.26σ increase in knowledge about COVID-19 as measured by responses to factual questions. Through a list experiment embedded in the survey, we further find that potentially harmful behavior—not abiding by lockdown guidelines—decreased by 30 percentage points. The results show that social media messaging from trusted sources may have substantively large effects not only on individuals’ knowledge but also ultimately on related behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3093042586,"Changes in gene regulation underlie much of phenotypic evolution1. However, our understanding of the potential for regulatory evolution is biased, because most evidence comes from either natural variation or limited experimental perturbations2. Using an automated robotics pipeline, we surveyed an unbiased mutation library for a developmental enhancer in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that almost all mutations altered gene expression and that parameters of gene expression—levels, location, and state—were convolved. The widespread pleiotropic effects of most mutations may constrain the evolvability of developmental enhancers. Consistent with these observations, comparisons of diverse Drosophila larvae revealed apparent biases in the phenotypes influenced by the enhancer. Developmental enhancers may encode a higher density of regulatory information than has been appreciated previously, imposing constraints on regulatory evolution. A robotic pipeline is used to survey a library of mutations in a Drosphila gene enhancer, showing that most mutations altered gene expression and had widespread pleiotropic effects that are likely to constrain regulatory evolution."

https://openalex.org/W3093167159,"Fluid intake is an essential innate behaviour that is mainly caused by two distinct types of thirst1–3. Increased blood osmolality induces osmotic thirst that drives animals to consume pure water. Conversely, the loss of body fluid induces hypovolaemic thirst, in which animals seek both water and minerals (salts) to recover blood volume. Circumventricular organs in the lamina terminalis are critical sites for sensing both types of thirst-inducing stimulus4–6. However, how different thirst modalities are encoded in the brain remains unknown. Here we employed stimulus-to-cell-type mapping using single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the cellular substrates that underlie distinct types of thirst. These studies revealed diverse types of excitatory and inhibitory neuron in each circumventricular organ structure. We show that unique combinations of these neuron types are activated under osmotic and hypovolaemic stresses. These results elucidate the cellular logic that underlies distinct thirst modalities. Furthermore, optogenetic gain of function in thirst-modality-specific cell types recapitulated water-specific and non-specific fluid appetite caused by the two distinct dipsogenic stimuli. Together, these results show that thirst is a multimodal physiological state, and that different thirst states are mediated by specific neuron types in the mammalian brain. The authors uncover the diverse transcriptomic cell types of thirst-driving neurons in the lamina terminalis and show that unique combinations of neuron types respond to and mediate distinct thirst states."
https://openalex.org/W3093076264,"The strand-exchange reaction is central to homologous recombination. It is catalysed by the RecA family of ATPases, which form a helical filament with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and ATP. This filament binds to a donor double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to form synaptic filaments, which search for homology and then catalyse the exchange of the complementary strand, forming either a new heteroduplex or-if homology is limited-a D-loop1,2. How synaptic filaments form, search for homology and catalyse strand exchange is poorly understood. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy analysis of synaptic mini-filaments with both non-complementary and partially complementary dsDNA, and structures of RecA-D-loop complexes containing a 10- or a 12-base-pair heteroduplex. The C-terminal domain of RecA binds to dsDNA and directs it to the RecA L2 loop, which inserts into and opens up the duplex. The opening propagates through RecA sequestering the homologous strand at a secondary DNA-binding site, which frees the complementary strand to sample pairing with the ssDNA. At each RecA step, there is a roughly 20% probability that duplex opening will terminate and the as-yet-unopened dsDNA portion will bind to another C-terminal domain. Homology suppresses this process, through the cooperation of heteroduplex pairing with the binding of ssDNA to the secondary site, to extend dsDNA opening. This mechanism locally limits the length of ssDNA sampled for pairing if homology is not encountered, and could allow for the formation of multiple, widely separated synapses on the donor dsDNA, which would increase the likelihood of encountering homology. These findings provide key mechanistic insights into homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W3092861146,"The impact of cancer on lifespan is significantly increasing worldwide. Enhanced activity of drug efflux pumps and the incidences of the tumor microenvironment such as the apparition of a hypoxic gradient inside of the bulk tumor, are the major causes of chemotherapy failure. For instance, expression of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) has been associated with metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy and reduced survival rate. One of the current challenges to fight against cancer is therefore to find new molecules with therapeutic potential that could overcome this chemoresistance. In the present study, we focused on the bioactive plant flavonoid quercetin, which has strong antioxidant and anti-proliferative properties. We examined the efficacy of combined treatments of quercetin and the anti-cancer drugs gemcitabine and doxorubicin, known to specifically act on human pancreatic and hepatic cancer cells, respectively. Moreover, our study aimed to investigate more in-depth the implication of the multidrug transporter MDR1 and HIF-1α n chemoresistance and if quercetin could act on the activity of the drug efflux pumps and the hypoxia-associated effects. We observed that the anti-cancer drugs, were more effective when administered in combination with quercetin, as shown by an increased percentage of dead cells up to 60% in both 2D and 3D cultures. In addition, our results indicated that the combination of anti-cancer drugs and quercetin down-regulated the expression of HIF-1α and increased the expression levels of the regulator of apoptosis p53. Moreover, we observed that quercetin could inhibit the efflux activity of MDR1. Finally, our in vitro study suggests that the efficiency of the chemotherapeutic activity of known anti-cancer drugs might be significantly increased upon combination with quercetin. This flavonoid may therefore be a promising pharmacological agent for novel combination therapy since it potentializes the cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine and doxorubicin on by targeting the chemoresistance developed by the pancreatic and liver cancer cells respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3093269897,"Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling condition that generates considerable morbidity, mortality, and both medical and indirect social costs. Treatment options are limited. A novel therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown efficacy in six phase 2 trials. Its cost-effectiveness is unknown.To assess the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MAP) from the health care payer's perspective, we constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of treating patients with chronic, severe, or extreme, treatment-resistant PTSD with MAP. In six double-blind phase 2 trials, MAP consisted of a mean of 2.5 90-minute trauma-focused psychotherapy sessions before two 8-hour sessions with MDMA (mean dose of 125 mg), followed by a mean of 3.5 integration sessions for each active session. The control group received an inactive placebo or 25-40 mg. of MDMA, and otherwise followed the same regimen. Our model calculates net medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Efficacy was based on the pooled results of six randomized controlled phase 2 trials with 105 subjects; and a four-year follow-up of 19 subjects. Other inputs were based on published literature and on assumptions when data were unavailable. We modeled results over a 30-year analytic horizon and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses. Our model calculates expected medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. For 1,000 individuals, MAP generates discounted net savings of $103.2 million over 30 years while accruing 5,553 discounted QALYs, compared to continued standard of care. MAP breaks even on cost at 3.1 years while delivering 918 QALYs. Making the conservative assumption that benefits cease after one year, MAP would accrue net costs of $7.6 million while generating 288 QALYS, or $26,427 per QALY gained.MAP provided to patients with severe or extreme, chronic PTSD appears to be cost-saving while delivering substantial clinical benefit. Third-party payers are likely to save money within three years by covering this form of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3093046839,"Persons with dementia are at high risk for loss of decision-making ability due to increased cognitive decline as the disease progresses. Participation in advance care planning (ACP) discussions in the early stages of dementia is crucial for end-of-life (EoL) decision-making to ensure quality of EoL care. A lack of discussions about ACP and EoL care between persons with dementia and family caregivers (FCGs), can lead to decisional conflicts when persons with dementia are in the later stages of the disease. This study explored the effects of a family-centered ACP information intervention among persons with dementia and FCGs. The study was conducted in outpatient clinics in Taiwan. Participants were dyads (n = 40) consisting of persons diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their FCGs. A one-group, pretest–posttest, pre-experimental design was employed. The intervention was provided by an ACP-trained senior registered nurse and was guided by ACP manuals and family-centered strategies. Outcome data were collected with four structured questionnaires regarding knowledge of end-stage dementia treatment, knowledge of ACP, attitude towards ACP, and EoL decisional conflict about acceptance or refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilators, and tracheostomy. Paired t tests compared differences between pre-intervention data and 4-weeks’ post-intervention data. The intervention resulted in significant improvements among persons with dementia and FCGs for knowledge of end-stage dementia treatment (p = .008 and p < .001, respectively), knowledge of ACP (both p < .001), and significant reductions in decisional conflicts (both p < .001). Scores for positive and negative attitude toward ACP did not change for persons with dementia; however, there was a reduction in negative attitude for FCGs (p = .001). Clinical care for persons with dementia should incorporate ACP interventions that provide knowledge about EoL dementia care using family-centered care strategies that facilitate regular and continuous communication between FCGs, persons with dementia, and medical personnel to reduce decisional conflicts for EoL care."

A data-driven approach was developed to estimate medical resource deficiencies due to medical burdens at county level during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study duration was mainly from February 15, 2020 to May 1, 2020 in the U.S. Multiple data sources were used to extract local population, hospital beds, critical care staff, COVID-19 confirmed case numbers, and hospitalization data at county level. We estimated the average length of stay from hospitalization data at state level, and calculated the hospitalized rate at both state and county level. Then, we developed two medical resource deficiency indices that measured the local medical burden based on the number of accumulated active confirmed cases normalized by local maximum potential medical resources, and the number of hospitalized patients that can be supported per ICU bed per critical care staff, respectively. Data on medical resources, and the two medical resource deficiency indices are illustrated in a dynamic spatiotemporal visualization platform based on ArcGIS Pro Dashboards.

https://openalex.org/W3093074147,"Sporotrichosis is a neglected endemic mycosis with a high incidence in Latin America, mainly in Brazil. Sporothrix schenckii is the most frequent species in Latin America, whereas Sporothrix brasiliensis is the predominant species observed in Brazil and is associated with both human and animal sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis treatment remains restricted to a few options, itraconazole being the first choice for human and animal therapy. In this work, we screened the molecular library Pathogen Box (Medicines for Malaria Venture [MMV], Switzerland) in search of compounds with anti-Sporothrix activity. Our initial screen of the 400 compounds identified five compounds that inhibited more than 80% of S. brasiliensis and S. schenkii growth. Among those, three compounds (MMV675968, MMV102872, and MMV002817 (known as iodoquinol)) not previously described as antifungals or agrochemicals, were selected for further evaluation. MMV102872 and iodoquinol showed the most promising combination of antifungal activity (lower inhibitory concentration) and fungal selectivity (lower cytotoxicity in LLC-MK2 cells). Scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry analyses revealed that MMV102872 and iodoquinol induced changes in cell morphology, membrane integrity, and the presence of neutral lipids, impairing fungal survival. Our results indicate that MMV102872 and iodoquinol are promising molecules for use as scaffolds for the development of new antifungal agents."

The evolution of citizens’ concerns and behaviours over time is a central piece to support public policies. Objective To unveil perceptions and behaviours of the Portuguese population regarding social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for more informed public policies. Methods Online panel survey distributed in three waves between March 13th and May 6th 2020. Data collected from a non-representative sample of 7,448 respondents includes socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported measures on levels of concern and behaviours related to COVID-19. We performed descriptive analysis and probit regressions to understand relationships between the different variables. Results Most participants (85%) report being at least very concerned with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation reached a high level of adherence during the state of emergency. Around 36% of the sample anticipated consumption decisions, stockpiling ahead of the state of emergency declaration. Medical appointments suffered severe consequences, being re-rescheduled or cancelled. We find important variation in concerns with the economic impact across activity sectors. Conclusion We show that high level of concern and behaviour adaptation in our sample preceded the implementation of lockdown measures in Portugal around mid-March. One month later, a large share of individuals had suffered disruption in their routine health care and negative impacts in their financial status."
https://openalex.org/W3000703345,"Individuals tend to avoid cognitive demand, yet, individual differences appear to exist. Recent evidence from two studies suggests that individuals high in the personality traits Self-Control and Need for Cognition that are related to the broader construct Cognitive Effort Investment are less prone to avoid cognitive demand and show less effort discounting. These findings suggest that cost-benefit models of decision-making that integrate the costs due to effort should consider individual differences in the willingness to exert mental effort. However, to date, there are almost no replication attempts of the above findings. For the present conceptual replication, we concentrated on the avoidance of cognitive demand and used a longitudinal design and latent state-trait modeling. This approach enabled us to separate the trait-specific variance in our measures of Cognitive Effort Investment and Demand Avoidance that is due to stable, individual differences from the variance that is due to the measurement occasion, the methods used, and measurement error. Doing so allowed us to test the assumption that self-reported Cognitive Effort Investment is related to behavioral Demand Avoidance more directly by relating their trait-like features to each other. In a sample of N = 217 participants, we observed both self-reported Cognitive Effort Investment and behavioral Demand Avoidance to exhibit considerable portions of trait variance. However, these trait variances were not significantly related to each other. Thus, our results call into question previous findings of a relationship between self-reported effort investment and demand avoidance. We suggest that novel paradigms are needed to emulate real-world effortful situations and enable better mapping between self-reported measures and behavioral markers of the willingness to exert cognitive effort."
https://openalex.org/W3092799794,"Ray tracing software systems are commonly used to analyze the optics of solar energy devices, since they allow to predict the energy gains of devices in real conditions, and also to compare them with other systems constantly emerging in the market. However, the available open-source packages apply excessive simplifications to the model of light-matter interaction, making that the optical behaviour of the systems can not be properly characterized, which in turn implies disagreements between physical experiments and computer simulations. We present here the open source python package OTSun, which applies the Fresnel equations in their most general form, without further simplifications, and is suitable for the simulation of both solar-thermal and photovoltaic systems. The geometrical objects used in this package are created using the parametric 3D modeler FreeCAD, which is also a free and open source program and allows for the construction of arbitrary geometries that can be analyzed with OTSun. These, and other software capabilities, make OTSun extremely flexible and accurate for the optical analysis of solar devices with arbitrary geometry. Additionally, OTSun has a companion webtool, OTSunWebApp, that allows for the usage of certain features of the package without the need to install anything locally. We also show here two numerical experiments that we performed in order to validate the model and implementation: The analysis of the optical efficiency of a Linear Fresnel Reflector (with moving objects), and of a second surface mirror (with variable wavelengths). In each case, the numerical computations had deviations of less than 0.25% from reference models (either computed with another program or with exact formulas)."
https://openalex.org/W3093278296,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a guideline in 2015 for managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection (PSBI) when referral is not feasible in young infants aged 0–59 days. This guideline was implemented across 303 Basic Health Unit (BHU) Plus primary health care (PHC) facilities in peri-urban and rural settings of Sindh, Pakistan. We evaluated the implementation of PSBI guideline, and the quality of care provided to sick young infants at these facilities. Methods Thirty (10%) out of 303 BHU Plus facilities were randomly selected for evaluation. A survey team visited each facility for one day, assessed the health system support, observed the management of sick young infants by health care providers (HCP), validated their management, interviewed HCPs and caretakers of sick infants. HCPs who were unable to see a young infant on the day of survey were evaluated using pre-prepared case scenarios. Results Thirty (100%) BHU Plus facilities had oral amoxicillin, injectable gentamicin, thermometers, baby weighing scales and respiratory timers available; 29 (97%) had disposable syringes and needles; 28 (93%) had integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)/PSBI chart booklets and job aids and 18 (60%) had a functional ambulance. Each facility had at least one HCP trained in PSBI, and 21 (70%) facilities had been visited by a supervisor in the preceding six months. Of 42 HCPs, 19 (45.3%) were trained within the preceding 12 months. During the survey, 26 sick young infants were identified in 18 facilities. HCPs asked about history of breastfeeding in 23 (89%) infants, history of vomiting in 17 (65%), and history of convulsions in 14 (54%); weighed 25 (97%) infants; measured respiratory rate in all (100%) and temperature in 24 (92%); assessed 20 (77%) for movement and 14 (54%) for chest indrawing. HCPs identified two infants with fast breathing pneumonia and managed them correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol. HCPs identified six (23%) infants with clinical severe infection (CSI), two of them were referred to a higher-level facility, only one accepted the referral advice. Only one CSI patient was managed correctly per IMCI/PSBI protocol at the outpatient level. HCPs described the PSBI danger signs to eight (31%) caretakers. Caretakers of five infants with CSI and two with pneumonia were not counselled for PSBI danger signs. Five of the six CSI cases categorized by HCPs were validated as CSI on re-examination, whereas one had pneumonia. Similarly, one of the two pneumonia patients categorized by HCPs had CSI and one identified as local bacterial infection was classified as CSI upon re-examination. Conclusion Health system support was adequate but clinical management and counselling by HCPs was sub-optimal particularly with CSI cases who are at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Scaling up PSBI management is potentially feasible in PHC facilities in Pakistan, provided that HCPs are trained well and mentored, receive refresher training to appropriately manage sick young infants, and have adequate supplies and counselling skills."
https://openalex.org/W3093307095,"Abstract Genes involved in 3′-splice site recognition during mRNA splicing constitute an emerging class of oncogenes. SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated splicing factor in cancer, and SF3B1 mutants corrupt branchpoint recognition leading to usage of cryptic 3′-splice sites and subsequent aberrant junctions. For a comprehensive determination of alterations leading to this splicing pattern, we performed a pan-TCGA screening for SF3B1-specific aberrant acceptor usage. While the most of aberrant 3′-splice patterns were explained by SF3B1 mutations, we also detected nine SF3B1 wild-type tumors (including five lung adenocarcinomas). Genomic profile analysis of these tumors identified somatic mutations combined with loss-of-heterozygosity in the splicing factor SUGP1 in five of these cases. Modeling of SUGP1 loss and mutations in cell lines showed that both alterations induced mutant- SF3B1 -like aberrant splicing. Our study provides definitive evidence that genetic alterations of SUGP1 genocopy SF3B1 mutations in lung adenocarcinoma and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3021100205,"Deep learning has achieved a great success in natural image classification. To overcome data-scarcity in computational pathology, recent studies exploit transfer learning to reuse knowledge gained from natural images in pathology image analysis, aiming to build effective pathology image diagnosis models. Since transferability of knowledge heavily depends on the similarity of the original and target tasks, significant differences in image content and statistics between pathology images and natural images raise the questions: how much knowledge is transferable? Is the transferred information equally contributed by pre-trained layers? To answer these questions, this paper proposes a framework to quantify knowledge gain by a particular layer, conducts an empirical investigation in pathology image centered transfer learning, and reports some interesting observations. Particularly, compared to the performance baseline obtained by random-weight model, though transferability of off-the-shelf representations from deep layers heavily depend on specific pathology image sets, the general representation generated by early layers does convey transferred knowledge in various image classification applications. The observation in this study encourages further investigation of specific metric and tools to quantify effectiveness and feasibility of transfer learning in future."
https://openalex.org/W3093294365,"Background Guidelines encourage relevant information exchange between pharmaceutical staff and patients during self-medication consultation. Thereby, assessing the patient's situation and providing information is crucial for patient safety. So far, limited studies have investigated this information exchange, particularly in Germany. We aimed to assess the attitude towards and the current practice of guideline-recommended information exchange in German community pharmacies. Methods In total, twelve guideline-recommended parameters were predefined for gathering patient-related information and for the provision of information. These information exchange parameters were evaluated in two parts: Firstly, in a self-report of pharmaceutical staff via an online questionnaire to assess the reported importance, difficulty and frequency of the parameters as well as barriers to their implementation; secondly, in a non-participant observation in five pharmacies to evaluate the actual consultation practice. Results In the self-report, all parameters were rated by more than 76% of 1068 participants as important. 'Concurrent medication' was determined to be the most difficult parameter to address (54%). All parameters of information gathering were rated to be addressed during routine counselling by at least 70% of the respondents. Parameters of information provision were all rated to be addressed by at least 45%. 'Lack of patient's interest' was identified as the most frequent barrier to appropriate counselling (84%). During the observation, the information gathering parameters were each addressed between 8 to 63% in the consultations, parameters of information provision between 3 to 34%. Conclusion Despite broad acceptance, the guideline parameters of information exchange were comparatively little addressed during the actual routine care. This might be due to a perceived 'lack of patient's interest' in counselling. Our results suggest to scrutinize whether patients are in fact not interested in counselling and to further explore how the positive intention of pharmaceutical staff towards information exchange can be further translated into everyday practice."
https://openalex.org/W3093389139,"On March 15, 2020 Puerto Rico implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including a mandatory curfew, as part of a state of emergency declaration to prevent the community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the island. From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 70,656 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,704 were positive, corresponding to 1,311 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,311 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. Through May 31, 2020, there were 143 COVID-19 associated deaths in Puerto Rico, for a case fatality risk of 10.9%. We compared the observed cases and deaths with Gompertz model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (85 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 15.87% (95% CI: 7.59%, 24.15%), corresponding to R of 1.82 (95% CI:1.37, 2.30). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.95% (95% CI: -4.99%, -0.92%), corresponding to R of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). We estimate that, had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 6,155 additional COVID-19 cases would have occurred by May 15, with 211 additional COVID-19 deaths by May 31. These findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early NPIs as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results also provide a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to subsequent containment stages in Puerto Rico."
https://openalex.org/W3093199472,"Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically heterogenous group of disorders caused by respiratory chain dysfunction and associated with progressive, multi-systemic phenotype. There is no effective treatment or cure, and no FDA-approved drug for treating mitochondrial disease. To identify and characterize potential therapeutic compounds, we developed an in vitro screening assay and identified a group of direct AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators originally developed for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Unlike previously investigated AMPK agonists such as AICAR, these compounds allosterically activate AMPK in an AMP-independent manner, thereby increasing specificity and decreasing pleiotropic effects. The direct AMPK activator PT1 significantly improved mitochondrial function in assays of cellular respiration, energy status, and cellular redox. PT1 also protected against retinal degeneration in a mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, further supporting the therapeutic potential of AMP-independent AMPK agonists in the treatment of mitochondrial disease."
https://openalex.org/W3093362237,"Organophosphorus (OP) insecticide self-poisoning causes over 100,000 global deaths annually. Around a third of patients are intubated and up to half of these can die. Post-mortem analysis of OP poisoned patients' lungs reveals consolidation, edema and hemorrhage, suggesting that direct or indirect lung damage may contribute to mortality. The lung injury caused by these formulated agricultural preparations is poorly characterised in humans, and a valid histopathology scoring system is needed in a relevant animal model to further investigate the disease and potential treatments. We conducted two pilot studies in anesthetized minipigs, which are commonly used for toxicological studies. In the first, pigs were given 2.5 mL/kg of either OP (n = 4) or saline (n = 2) by gavage and compared with positive controls (iv oleic acid n = 2). The second study simulated ingestion followed by gastric content aspiration: mixtures of OP (n = 3) or saline (n = 2) (0.63-0.71mL/kg) were placed in the stomach, and then small volumes of the gastric content were placed in the lung. At post-mortem examination, lungs were removed and inflation-fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin. Samples (n = 62) were taken from cranial and caudal regions of both lungs. Two experienced lung histopathologists separately scored these samples using 8 proposed features of damage and their scores related (Kendall rank order). Two elements had small and inconsistent scores. When these were removed, the correlation increased from 0.74 to 0.78. Eight months later, a subset of samples (n = 35) was re-scored using the modified system by one of the previous histopathologists, with a correlation of 0.88. We have developed a reproducible pulmonary histopathology scoring system for OP poisoning in pigs which will assist future toxicological research and improve understanding and treatment of human OP poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W3092776841,"Background Proper utilization of skilled care services in neonatal illnesses is crucial to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to evaluate the level and factors associated with seeking care from skilled healthcare service providers for reported neonatal illnesses in rural Matlab, Bangladesh. Methods This community based cross-sectional study was based on data from a randomly selected sample comprised of 2223 women who delivered live-born babies in 2014. Data were collected from June to October 2015 through a structured questionnaire. We used a multivariable logistic regression model and presented the results by adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of the neonates, 1361 (61.2%) suffered from at least one complication, and among these, 479 (35.2%) sought care from skilled healthcare service providers. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the participants’ husbands’ educational level, number of antenatal care visits, and place of childbirth were significantly associated with seeking skilled care for reported neonatal illnesses. The care-seeking from skilled healthcare service providers for neonatal illness was more than two times higher (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.51–3.39) in the group in which the participants’ husband had attended school for more than 10 years as compared to the group in which they had attended school for less than six years. The AORs of seeking skilled care were 1.93 (95% CI = 1.42–2.62) and 2.26 (95% CI = 1.51–3.39) with the mothers receiving two to three and four or more antenatal care services, respectively, compared to the mothers with no or one antenatal care visit. Women who gave birth at a health facility were three times (AOR = 3.24, 95% CI = 2.50–4.19) more likely to seek skilled care for sick neonates compared to those who gave birth at home. Conclusion The utilization of skilled care for neonatal sicknesses was low in this rural setting in Bangladesh. The participants' husbands’ higher school attendance, increased number of ANC visits, and facility delivery were positively associated with care-seeking from skilled healthcare providers for neonatal illness. The husbands with low school attendance should be targeted for intervention, and continue efforts to increase ANC coverage and facility delivery to improve neonatal health in this country’s rural area."
https://openalex.org/W3092920818,"Retinal rods function as accurate photon counters to provide for vision under very dim light. To do so, rods must generate highly amplified, reproducible responses to single photons, yet outer segment architecture and randomness in the location of rhodopsin photoisomerization on the surface of an internal disk introduce variability to the rising phase of the photon response. Soon after a photoisomerization at a disk rim, depletion of cGMP near the plasma membrane closes ion channels and hyperpolarizes the rod. But with a photoisomerization in the center of a disk, local depletion of cGMP is distant from the channels in the plasma membrane. Thus, channel closure is delayed by the time required for the reduction of cGMP concentration to reach the plasma membrane. Moreover, the local fall in cGMP dissipates over a larger volume before affecting the channels, so response amplitude is reduced. This source of variability increases with disk radius. Using a fully space-resolved biophysical model of rod phototransduction, we quantified the variability attributable to randomness in the location of photoisomerization as a function of disk structure. In mouse rods that have small disks bearing a single incisure, this variability was negligible in the absence of the incisure. Variability was increased slightly by the incisure, but randomness in the shutoff of rhodopsin emerged as the main source of single photon response variability at all but the earliest times. Variability arising from randomness in the transverse location of photoisomerization increased in magnitude and persisted over a longer period in the photon response of large salamander rods. A symmetric arrangement of multiple incisures in the disks of salamander rods greatly reduced this variability during the rising phase, but the incisures had the opposite effect on variability arising from randomness in rhodopsin shutoff at later times."

Therefore, identifying factors associated with contraceptive utilization among women of reproductive age during extended postpartum period is essential.This study aimed to assess factors associated with modern contraceptives use among postpartum women in Bukombe District, Geita region.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women who were in their first year after child birth in Bukombe district. A total of 511 women were included using multistage sampling techniques. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using Stata 15 (College Station, Texas, USA).The prevalence of postpartum modern contraceptive was 11.9%. The most frequently used method was implant (6.5%). Most women started to use the contraceptive during the first three months after delivery. Living in urban (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.20-3.79), having business (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.31-2.28), last born aged 3-4 months (AOR = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.11-9.85) and menses resumption (AOR = 9.24, 95% CI: 3.60-23.72) were predictors for postpartum contraceptive use. However, fear of side effects, poor knowledge about contraceptives, husband restrictions, distance to health facility and contraceptive availability were reported as barriers for postpartum modern contraceptive use.Prevalence of postpartum modern contraceptive use in the study area is still low. Numerous factors were reported as barriers for postpartum contraceptive use. A strategy such as health education on befits of post-partum modern contraceptive use and counseling women about side effects may help to improve its uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3093006876,"Purpose To evaluate see-through Augmented Reality Digital spectacles (AR DSpecs) for improving the mobility of patients with peripheral visual field (VF) losses when tested on a walking track. Design Prospective Case Series. Participants 21 patients with peripheral VF defects in both eyes, with the physical ability to walk without assistance. Methods We developed the AR DSpecs as a wearable VF aid with an augmented reality platform. Image remapping algorithms produced personalized visual augmentation in real time based on the measured binocular VF with the AR DSpecs calibration mode. We tested the device on a walking track to determine if patients could more accurately identify peripheral objects. Main outcome measures We analyzed walking track scores (number of recognized/avoided objects) and eye tracking data (six gaze parameters) to measure changes in the kinematic and eye scanning behaviors while walking, and assessed a possible placebo effect by deactivating the AR DSpecs remapping algorithms in random trials. Results Performance, judged by the object detection scores, improved with the AR DSpecs (P<0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test) with an average improvement rate of 18.81%. Two gaze parameters improved with the activated algorithm (P<0.01, paired t-test), indicating a more directed gaze on the central path with less eye scanning. Determination of the binocular integrated VF with the DSpecs correlated with the integrated standard automated perimetry (R = 0.86, P<0.001), mean sensitivity difference 0.8 ± 2.25 dB (Bland-Altman). Conclusions AR DSpecs may improve walking maneuverability of patients with peripheral VF defects by enhancing detection of objects in a testing environment."
https://openalex.org/W3092793015,"Precision medicine emphasizes predictive, preventive and personalized treatment on the basis of information gleaned from personal genetic and environmental data. Its implementation at health systems level is regarded as multifactorial, involving variables associated with omics technologies, public genomic awareness and adoption tendencies for new medical technologies. However, interrelationships of the various factors and their synergy has not been sufficiently quantified. Based on a survey of 270 participants involved in the use of molecular tests (omics-based biomarkers, OBMs), this study examined how characteristics of omics biomarkers influence precision medicine implementation outcomes (ImO) through an intermediary factor, public genomic awareness (represented by User Response, UsR). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was applied to develop and test a 3 latent variable mediation model; each latent variable being measured by a set of indicators ranging between three and six. Mediation analysis results confirmed a partial mediation effect (an indirect effect represented as the product of paths 'a' and 'b' (a*b)) of 0.36 at 90% confidence level, CI = [0.03, 9.94]. Results from the individual mediation paths 'a' and 'b' however, showed that these effects were negative(a = -0.38, b = -0.94). Path 'a' represents the effect of characteristics of OBMs on the mediator, UsR; 'b' represents the effect of the mediator, UsR on implementation outcomes, ImO, holding OBMs constant. The results have both theoretical and practice implications for biomedical genomics research and clinical genomics, respectively. For instance, the results imply better ways have to be devised to more effectively engage the public in addressing extended family support for extended family cascade screening, especially for monogenic hereditary conditions like BRCA-related breast cancer and colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome families. At basic biomedical research level, results suggest an integrated biomarker development pipeline, with early consideration of factors that may influence biomarker uptake. The results are also relevant at health systems level in indicating which factors should be addressed for successful."
https://openalex.org/W3093117561,"Background A cancer disease can affect the satisfaction with the physical appearance, so that the standardized assessment of the body image is important in cancer patients. The German version of the Self-Image Scale is a self-report measure that uses two subscales to assess appearance satisfaction (self-acceptance) and perceptions of partners' acceptance of their appearance (partner-acceptance). The present study aimed to validate the Self-Image Scale's two-factor structure in a sample of cancer patients with a variety of different diagnoses to further increase its utility. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis methods were used to examine the two-factor model in a sample of cancer patients (N = 278). Scale reliability and validity were then assessed through internal consistency measures and correlations with external criteria such as depressiveness, anxiety, distress, and relationship satisfaction. Results The proposed factor structure was supported by the results and the internal consistencies were good with α = .83 for the self-acceptance scale and α = .88 for the partner-acceptance scale while additional correlations with external criteria were observed as expected. Conclusions The results support the use of the German version of the Self-Image Scale in cancer patients in general. Future research directions include validation across further entities of cancer, the in-depth investigation of sex differences, and research in other diseases that might impact body image."
https://openalex.org/W3093267863,"Background Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a rising threat of the TB control program caused mainly by treatment interruption in Ethiopia. The success of the current treatment regimen for DR-TB is poor partly due to a high treatment interruption rate. Thus, this study assessed treatment interruption and associated factors among DR-TB patients. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 550 DR-TB patients who have initiated treatment from September 2010 to December 2017. Data were entered using Epi Data version 4.200 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. A bi-variable logistic regression model was first fitted, and variables having a p-value < 0.2 in the bi-variable analysis were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model. Crude and Adjusted Odds Ratios (COR and AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength of association between the treatment interruption and independent variables. Variables with p-value <0.05 in the multi-variable model were considered as statistically significant predictors of treatment interruption. Results In this study, the prevalence of treatment interruption among patients registered on DR-TB treatment was 14.55% (95% CI: 11.83, 17.76). Of the interrupters, the treatment interruption during the intensive and continuation phase of treatment was reported as 45% and 71.25%, respectively. Similarly, about 15% of patients had treatment interruption both during the intensive and continuation phase of treatment. The average duration of treatment interruption was 12 (±2.03 SD) and 6 (±1.2 SD) days during the intensive and continuation phase of treatment, respectively. Patients who had no treatment supporter [AOR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.23–3.66] and developed adverse drug events [AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.22–2.85] were statistically significant predictors of treatment interruption. Conclusions Treatment interruption was low in the study setting. The presence of treatment supporter and absence of drug side effects was significantly associated with decreased occurrence of treatment interruption. Thus, patient linkage to treatment supporter and excellent pharmacovigilance are highly recommended in the study setting."
https://openalex.org/W3093199584,"The seminal vesicle secretions of guinea pig and rabbit were analyzed for semen coagulum proteins. Using SDS-PAGE we discovered a previously not fully recognized semen coagulum protein, Svp5, in the guinea pig and a single predominant component, SVP200, in the rabbit. Potential genes of these proteins were identified in genome databases by their homology with human and murine genes. The structure of their fullength transcripts was determined using seminal vesicle cDNA and sequencing primers based on genomic sequences. Homology searching indicated that both Svp5 and SVP200 were synthesized from composite genes that were the result of merger between two genes showing homology with human SEMG2 and PI3. For a deeper understanding of the evolution of the genes, we retrieved and analyzed genome sequences from the REST gene loci, encompassing genes of semen coagulum proteins and related rapidly evolving seminal vesicle-transcribed genes, of 14 rodents and 2 lagomorphs. The analysis showed that rodents of the suborders myomorpha, hystricomorpha, and castorimorpha had unique sets of REST genes, whereas sciuromorpha seemed to be lacking such genes. It also indicated a closer relationship between myomorpha and castorimorpha than to rodents of the two other analyzed suborders. In the lagomorph species, the pika appeared to be devoid of REST genes, whereas the rabbit had a single expressed REST gene, SVP200, and two pseudogenes. The structural similarity of semen coagulum proteins in rabbit and hystricomph species suggests that they are closely related. This was also supported by other similarities at their REST gene loci, e.g. the finding of a PI3-like gene in the rabbit that also had features in common with caltrin2 of hystricomorph rodents. The homologies indicate that hystricomorpha may have separated from myomorpha and castorimorpha before the separation of hystricomorpha from lagomorpha."
https://openalex.org/W3093297367,"Matching habitat choice is gaining attention as a mechanism for maintaining biodiversity and driving speciation. It revolves around the idea that individuals select the habitat in which they perceive to obtain greater fitness based on a prior evaluation of their local performance across heterogeneous environments. This results in individuals with similar ecologically relevant traits converging to the same patches, and hence it could indirectly cause assortative mating when mating occurs in those patches. White-eyed mutants of Drosophila fruit flies have a series of disadvantages compared to wild type flies, including a poorer performance under bright light. It has been previously reported that, when given a choice, wild type Drosophila simulans preferred a brightly lit habitat while white-eyed mutants occupied a dimly lit one. This spatial segregation allowed the eye color polymorphism to be maintained for several generations, whereas normally it is quickly replaced by the wild type. Here we compare the habitat choice decisions of white-eyed and wild type flies in another species, D. melanogaster. We released groups of flies in a light gradient and recorded their departure and settlement behavior. Departure depended on sex and phenotype, but not on the light conditions of the release point. Settlement depended on sex, and on the interaction between phenotype and light conditions of the point of settlement. Nonetheless, simulations showed that this differential habitat use by the phenotypes would only cause a minimal degree of assortative mating in this species."
