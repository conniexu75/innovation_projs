https://openalex.org/W1987234748,"We have cloned a 2.0-kb EcoRI fragment of human genomic DNA (NB-19-21) which has homology to the v-myc oncogene but is distinct from the classical c-myc gene. This sequence is amplified from 25- to 700-fold in eight of nine tested human neuroblastoma cell lines which contain either homogeneously staining regions or double minutes (HSRs or DMs), the caryological manifestations of amplified genes. In the remaining line, the c-myc proto-oncogene is amplified approximately 30-fold. NB-19-21 hybridizes to a 3.2-kb cytoplasmic, poly(A)+ RNA species that is abundant only in lines in which the sequence is amplified. We propose that the gene encoding the NB-19-21-related RNA species may represent a new oncogene, which we call N-myc. NB-19-21 derives from chromosome 2; but in the five HSR-containing lines that have amplified this sequence, none has HSRs on chromosome 2. NB-19-21 is associated with DMs in a DM-containing line. A second, randomly cloned, amplified DNA segment from the HSR of one of the neuroblastoma lines is amplified in a subset of the lines in which NB-19-21 is amplified. In addition, this probe identifies a novel joint in the amplification unit of one line relative to that of the others. We suggest that, in the eight lines which have amplified NB-19-21, the amplification units are overlapping, but not identical, and that transposition of the common sequences may occur prior to amplification."

https://openalex.org/W1601882650,"Transcription factor A from immature Xenopus oocytes is found associated with 5 S RNA in a 7 S nucleoprotein complex. Atomic absorption analysis of EDTA-dialyzed 7 S particles reveals 2 mol of zinc/mol of particle. Factor A obtained from EDTA-dialyzed particles binds specifically to the 5 S RNA gene as determined by DNase I footprinting. Factor A alone, obtained by RNase digestion of the 7 S particle, contains zinc when dialyzed in the absence of EDTA. However, the zinc bound to free factor A is removed by dialysis against a buffer containing EDTA. The apoprotein does not bind to the 5 S RNA gene. Inhibition of footprinting is also effected by addition of EDTA to factor A without prolonged dialysis. Under these conditions, specific DNA binding ability is restored following addition of zinc. 1,10-Phenanthroline also inhibits binding of factor A to the intragenic control region of the 5 S RNA gene. In addition, this reagent specifically inhibits factor A-dependent synthesis of 5 S RNA but not factor A-independent tRNA synthesis in a HeLa cell in vitro transcription system."
https://openalex.org/W1994898384,"A mouse monoclonal antibody and human autoimmune sera directed against various classes of small ribonucleoprotein particles have been tested for inhibition of mRNA splicing in a soluble in vitro system. The splicing of the first and second leader exons of adenovirus late RNA was inhibited only by those sera that reacted with U1 RNP. Both U1 RNP-specific human autoimmune serum and sera directed against the Sm class of small nuclear RNPs, including a mouse monoclonal antibody, specifically inhibited splicing. Antisera specific for U2 RNP had no effect on splicing nor did antisera specific for the La or Ro class of small RNPs. These results suggest that U1 RNP is essential for the splicing of mRNA precursors."

https://openalex.org/W2039749338,"Using a whole cell extract of HeLa cells, we synthesized unspliced RNAs containing the first two leaders and the first intervening sequence of the adenovirus 2 major late transcription unit. Upon incubation of these pre-mRNAs in reaction mixtures containing a nuclear extract and a postnuclear fraction (S100), removal of the first intervening sequence and concomitant joining of the first leader to the second leader was observed. This splicing reaction requires proteins, Mg2+ ions, and ATP. The S100 fraction alone has no splicing activity but stimulates splicing when added to the nuclear extract. Upon fractionation of the postnuclear S100 by chromatography on ion exchange and gel filtration columns, the stimulatory activity copurifies with small ribonucleoprotein particles."

https://openalex.org/W140004033,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases Na+ uptake in several cell types through an electroneutral, amiloride-sensitive pathway putatively identified as Na+/H+ countertransport. We have previously shown (Rothenberg, P., Glaser, L., Schlesinger, P., and Cassel, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4883-4889) that EGF rapidly activates amiloride-sensitive net Na+ influx in the A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell line. We also described the presence of transmembrane, amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange in A431 cells using a new fluorescence technique for the measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) based on the incorporation of fluorescein-dextran into the cell cytoplasm. The low pKa of fluorescein (approximately 6.4) prevented the direct assessment of the inferred, EGF-induced cytoplasmic alkalinization, mediated by stimulated Na+/H+ exchange. In this paper, 4',5'-dimethylfluorescein (pKa 6.75) was coupled to dextran, allowing increased pH sensitivity of the fluorescence assay in the physiological range. Using this improved assay, basic features of pHi regulation in A431 cells are documented, including the role of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+-linked C1-/HCO3-exchange in acid extrusion. We directly demonstrate a rapid elevation of pHi by addition of EGF as well as by serum in A431 cells. The pHi increase is half-maximal at 5-10 ng/ml of EGF, is dependent on external Na+, independent of external Ca2+, and inhibited by millimolar amiloride. EGF and serum also enhance Na+/H+ exchange-mediated cytosolic acidification when the transmembrane Na+ concentration gradient favors Na+ efflux from the cells. An alkaline pHi shift, caused by activation of Na+/H+ exchange, may be an important primary event in the mechanism of EGF action."

https://openalex.org/W2000777577,"We have compared the polypeptides undergoing axonal transport in the retinal ganglion cells of neonatal and adult rabbits, and have observed the following: (1) Representative polypeptides of five different adult transport groups are axonally transported from the time of birth. (2) Polypeptides of group IV (a group that includes actin and myosin) are transported two-fold more rapidly in neonates than in adults. (3) Two polypeptides, M (145K) and L (73K) that are components of neurofilaments and move with the fifth, slowest group of transported proteins, are transported approximately eight-fold more rapidly in neonatal rabbits than in adults. (4) H, a third group V polypeptide, that serves to crosslink neurofilaments, was not detected in the rabbit optic nerve until 12 days after birth. We consider the possibility that the late induction of the crosslinker precipitates a cytoskeletal ""phase transition"" that may be responsible for the developmental alterations in apparent transport velocities, and may have additional consequences for neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2094778829,"RNA polymerase III was purified to about 90% homogeneity from ovarian tissue of Xenopus laevis. The enzyme accurately initiates and terminates transcription of 5S RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei, but not when naked 5S DNA is used as a template. A sensitive hybridization technique was used to demonstrate that the purified polymerase, even when supplemented with a transcription factor that binds specifically to the 5S RNA gene internal control region, is unable to initiate synthesis at the start site of the 5S RNA gene. However, the polymerase alone terminates transcription at precisely the same site that is recognized in vivo and in complete transcription extracts. The purified polymerase distinguishes between weak and strong terminator sequences with the same relative efficiency as the enzyme in complete extracts. We conclude that the pure enzyme can recognize the simple consensus sequence found at the end of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W1966694632,"When the cloned h22 histone gene repeat unit of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris is injected into the frog oocyte nucleus, transcription initiates faithfully in the promoter region of the H3 gene, but transcription termination or RNA processing to yield genuine H3 mRNA 3' ends is very inefficient. The generation of 3' ends can be enhanced by the injection of a small sea urchin poly (A)- RNA into the oocyte cytoplasm one day prior to injection of the histone gene repeat unit. This RNA is approximately 60 nucleotides in length and appears to be present in relatively low abundance in embryos of both Psammechinus and Paracentrotus. RNA extracted from a nuclear DEAE fraction, previously shown to complement the lesion in H3 gene expression, also causes the appearance of true 3' ends of H3 mRNA. Furthermore, RNA extracted from our 12S ""termination"" factor includes an RNA species comigrating with the 60 nucleotide RNA from poly (A)- RNA. We suggest that the 12S nuclear ""termination"" component is in fact a small nuclear RNP."
https://openalex.org/W1596645541,"In response to the mitogenic lectin concanavalin A, the rate of protein synthesis in bovine small lymphocytes increased about 3-fold in 10 h and about 6-fold in 24 h. The rate of synthesis of the cytoskeletal protein actin, which comprises about 10% of total protein synthesis, increased in parallel with total protein synthesis. The cellular levels of actin mRNA were determined at various times after mitogen addition using a cDNA probe derived from a recombinant plasmid carrying a fragment coding for bovine actin. Actin mRNA sequences were found to increase significantly within 3 h and to increase 3.6 +/- 1.2-fold within 10 h after mitogen addition. Therefore, the increase in actin synthesis after mitogenic activation seems to be accounted for by accumulation of actin mRNA sequences. Total translatable mRNA and poly(A) sequences also accumulated in parallel with total protein synthesis, suggesting that regulation of actin synthesis was not unique. Two direct studies of mRNA utilization indicated that there is little, if any, translational regulation of actin synthesis. A detailed examination of actin mRNA-containing polysomes and total polysomes revealed no significant change in the average size of polysomes after cell activation. Therefore, given that the rates of polypeptide elongation and termination are constant after mitogen addition (Kay, J.E., Ahern, T., Lindsay V.J., and Sampson, J. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 378, 241-250), the rate of translational initiation per active mRNA must be unchanged. In addition, no significant amount of unutilized, nonpolysomal actin mRNA was detected in total cell extracts from either unstimulated or activated cells. Together these data suggest that elevated protein synthesis in activated lymphocytes is regulated by mRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1675030349,"The regulation of glucose transport by a beta-adrenergic agonist and other cAMP stimulators was assessed by kinetic analyses of 3-O-methylglucose (MG) transport in rat and human adipocytes and in isolated rat plasma membrane vesicles. Basal MG transport was biphasically affected by L-isoproterenol in rat adipocytes: lower concentrations (10-25 nM) of L-isoproterenol stimulated the basal rate by increasing the Vmax, but higher concentrations (0.5-2 microM) of L-isoproterenol inhibited the basal rate. On the other hand, the maximum insulin-stimulated MG transport rate was not affected by 25 nM L-isoproterenol, but was suppressed by 2 microM L-isoproterenol in rat adipocytes. In the presence of adenosine deaminase plus L-isoproterenol (25 nM and 2 microM), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or forskolin, both basal and the maximum rates of MG transport were suppressed in rat adipocytes. However, from kinetic experiments, both L-isoproterenol plus adenosine deaminase and Bt2cAMP decreased the Vmax. On the other hand, isobutymethylxanthine and forskolin decreased the Vmax as well as increased the K8. MG transport in plasma membrane vesicles was directly inhibited by either forskolin or isobutylmethylxanthine. In contrast, both 25 nM and 2 microM L-isoproterenol with or without adenosine deaminase, Bt2cAMP, or cAMP had no effect on MG transport in rat plasma membrane vesicles. In human adipocytes, L-isoproterenol always stimulated basal MG transport and did not suppress the maximum rate of MG transport, even though cAMP production was maximally stimulated by L-isoproterenol. Both adenosine deaminase plus L-isoproterenol and Bt2cAMP did not suppress the basal rate, but did show a modest suppression (40%) of the maximum insulin effect on MG transport in human adipocytes. However, both isobutylmethylxanthine and forskolin remarkably suppressed (85%) both the basal and the maximum rate of MG transport by both increasing the K8 and decreasing the Vmax. These results indicate MG transport in both rat and human adipocytes is regulated by 3 different mechanisms: (I) L-isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulates basal MG transport by increasing the Vmax, (II) cAMP mediates a decrease in MG transport by decreasing the Vmax, and (III) both forskolin and isobutylmethylxanthine also decrease MG transport by directly inhibiting the binding of MG molecules to transporters, resulting in a decrease in the Vmax and an increase in the K8."

https://openalex.org/W1517859613,"In this paper, we describe a simple and highly sensitive manual assay for isotope fluxes through ion-conducting pathways, particularly cation-specific channels, in heterogenous populations of small membrane vesicles. We measure uptake of tracer of the ion of interest, against a large chemical gradient of the same ion. As a result of the imposed chemical gradient, a transient electrical diffusion potential is set up across the membranes of those vesicles which are highly permeable to the ion of interest. The isotope tends to equilibrate with the diffusion potential and is therefore concentrated selectively and transiently into those vesicle containing the channels. Furthermore, when performed in this way, the time course of tracer equilibration occurs over several minutes, rather than the sub-second range expected for tracer equilibration into channel-containing vesicles in the absence of an opposing chemical gradient of the permeant ion. The use of the procedure is demonstrated for three Na-conducting channels: gramicidin D incorporated into phospholipid vesicles, amiloride-blockable Na channels in toad bladder microsomes, and veratridine-activated tetrodotoxin-blockable Na channels in rat brain synaptic membranes. For all three cases, it proved simple to measure a specific 22Na uptake, in a minute time range, using very low concentrations of the channel-containing vesicles. By comparison with isotope flux measurements performed without an opposing Na gradient, the power of the present assay derives from both the very large gain in sensitivity and the convenient time course."
https://openalex.org/W2038734404,"Embryonal carcinoma cell lines present strong developmental analogies with early embryonic cells. Previous studies have shown that treatment of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid induces the expression of the classical transplantation antigens which are indispensable for effective interactions between cells. In contrast to several genes that were analyzed, all of which were highly and heterogeneously methylated in F9 cells, the H-2K gene was poorly methylated if at all. Activation of the H-2K gene upon differentiation of F9 cells was accompanied by an increase in DNA methylation. While increased methylation of the H-2K gene in one of the two homologous chromosomes was correlated with a low level of expression, increased methylation in both chromosomes was associated with a high level of expression. Treatment of differentiated F9 cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in inhibition of DNA methylation and a concomitant repression of the H-2K gene expression. Thus, in contrast to the many examples of an inverse correlation between the level of gene methylation and its transcriptional activity, expression of the H-2K gene is directly correlated with the extent of methylation. This finding offers an explanation whereby the hypomethylation observed in tumor cells may be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a malignant state of growth."
https://openalex.org/W1494584932,"In order to study developmental transitions of myosin heavy chain gene expression, we have cloned from newborn mouse skeletal muscle a recombinant plasmid (plasmid MHC 32) that contains an insertion coding for the COOH-terminal portion of an adult fast myosin heavy chain isoform of mouse skeletal muscle. By Northern blots and dot blots, it has been shown that the MHC 32 sequence reveals a broad cross-hybridization with RNA from different mammalian striated muscle tissues. Southern blots with mouse genomic DNA show only one homologous gene, but cross-hybridization at lower stringency to seven to eight different bands, some containing multiple genomic fragments, among which are probably the genes encoding the different striated muscle isoforms. S1 protection experiments with RNA from mouse skeletal muscle before and after birth demonstrate that plasmid MHC 32 is homologous to a major mRNA species of adult skeletal muscle. This adult mRNA is a predominant sequence within 5-6 days after birth. It begins to accumulate at 1-3 days; at the 18th day fetal stage, another major mRNA species is detected as partially homologous with the adult MHC 32 sequence. This fetal myosin heavy chain mRNA is still predominant at 1-3 days after birth, but is rapidly (by 5-6 days) replaced by the adult MHC sequence. There is thus a rapid transition after birth from fetal to adult skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain mRNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2070537481,"By a combination of primer extension and S1 mapping, we have identified and characterized at least nine epsilon-globin initiation sites in the 4.5 kb upstream of the canonical mRNA cap site. These occur in four regions, -65 to -250, -900, -1480, and -4500 bp from the translation initiation codon ATG. Transcripts from eight sites yield sufficient material for direct RNA analysis and in all of these instances the molecules are capped. Approximately 10%-15% of epsilon-globin transcripts originate from these upstream sites in both an erythroleukemic cell line and purified erythroblasts from first-trimester human embryos. In three established cell lines derived from adult non-erythroid tissue, low levels of transcription of the epsilon-globin gene occur, but the RNA molecules originate exclusively from one of the upstream sites identified in erythroid cells. These findings suggest modification of the current models of transcription of globin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1537080078,"Bovine cDNA clones containing coding sequences for growth hormone, prolactin, alpha subunit, and luteinizing hormone beta (LH beta) have been used to quantitate their respective mRNA concentrations in anterior pituitary glands isolated from ovariectomized ewes, or from ovariectomized ewes treated for three weeks with estradiol. Concentrations of mRNAs for prolactin or growth hormone remained unchanged in either physiological state. In contrast, treatment with estradiol resulted in a 98% decrease of mRNA for LH beta, relative to untreated animals. This change in mRNA was associated with a similar decrease in the concentrations of pituitary and serum LH. Administration of estradiol also led to a reduction (86%) of alpha subunit mRNA. These results suggest that estrogen regulates the expression of the genes encoding both the alpha and LH beta subunit prior to translation. Furthermore, the pronounced effect of estradiol on the concentrations of mRNAs for alpha subunit and LH beta suggest that the assembly of mature glycoprotein hormones may not be limited solely by the rate of accumulation of the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2054554350,"The rate of in vivo transcription from the E. coli tRNA and rRNA promoters depends on both cellular growth rate and aminoacid availability. To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved we determined the extent of interaction of RNA polymerase with the promoter of the tyrT stable RNA gene. We show that the enzyme can protect from DNAase I digestion a region of at least 85 bp of the wild-type tyrT promoter and only approximately 62 bp of the lacUV5 mRNA promoter, the protected region extending on the antisense strand to approximately 65 and 42 bp respectively upstream of the transcription startpoint. A mutant tyrT promoter, tyrTp27, is protected more extensively, RNA polymerase interactions extending to at least approximately -130. We propose that these upstream interactions of RNA polymerase perform two functions; activating initiation by polymerase bound at the primary binding site and increasing the concentration of polymerase in the vicinity of the tyrT promoter, thus allowing a high rate of maximal expression and enabling the promoter to be regulated over a wide range of activity."
https://openalex.org/W1898229450,"25-Hydroxycholesterol inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol to chicken myeloblasts caused a rapid inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, producing approximately an 80% decrease in enzyme activity after 60 min. The mode of action of 25-hydroxycholesterol was determined by immunoprecipitating radiolabeled enzyme from 25-hydroxycholesterol-treated myeloblasts. The decline in enzyme activity due to addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol was not associated with increased levels of [32P]PO4 incorporation into the immunoprecipitated reductase polypeptide (Mr = 94,000). Hence, 25-hydroxycholesterol did not appear to regulate reductase activity by enzyme phosphorylation, as observed for other modulators of HMG-CoA reductase. However, 25-hydroxycholesterol was shown to inhibit reductase activity by causing a 350% increase in the relative rate of reductase degradation and a 72% decrease in the relative rate of reductase synthesis. These alterations in the rates of degradation and synthesis occurred rapidly (within 10-30 min after addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol) and can account completely for the 25-hydroxycholesterol-induced inhibition of enzyme activity. The rapid decline in the rate of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase in 25-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells was not associated with concomitant changes in the levels of reductase mRNA; therefore, suggesting that 25-hydroxycholesterol must inhibit the rate of reductase synthesis by translational regulation. We also present evidence that mRNA purified from chicken myeloblasts codes for two reductase polypeptides of Mr = 94,000 and 102,000."

https://openalex.org/W2063924086,"We have investigated low abundance RNAs transcribed in vitro and in vivo from the human beta-globin gene. These RNAs contain globin mRNA sequences covalently linked to sequences transcribed from the 5' flanking region between -235 and the mRNA cap site (+1). Their synthesis in vitro is sensitive to high (100 micrograms/ml) levels of alpha-amanitin but not to low (2 micrograms/ml) levels, and one region of the DNA template bordering their 5' termini is similar to a small segment of Alu repetitive DNA and to the RNA polymerase III promoter consensus sequence. Therefore, these RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III but extend into the mRNA-coding region that is usually transcribed by polymerase II. The polymerase III transcripts are polyadenylated and are probably spliced. Their presence in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood reticulocytes implies that they play some role in the erythroid cell."
https://openalex.org/W2153215392,"In the Trypanosoma b. brucei AnTat 1.1C clone, the gene coding for the variant-specific surface antigen is telomeric and appears as a hybrid sequence, partially modified by gene conversion. This conversion is very similar to that observed in another AnTat 1.1-expressor clone (AnTat 1.1B). This sequence is not activated by duplicative transposition, although it could be activated by duplication in another clone (AnTat 1.10). Instead activation of the AnTat 1.1C gene seems operated by reciprocal recombination between its own telomere and the telomere carrying the previous (AnTat 1.16) ELC. Indeed, from the switch to AnTat 1.1C onward, the AnTat 1.16 ELC becomes a new silent member of its gene family, whereas in the variant directly derived from AnTat 1.1C (AnTat 1.3B), the AnTat 1.1C-containing telomere is lost, probably replaced by a large duplicate, at least 40 kb long, of the AnTat 1.3 gene-containing telomere. Different DNA rearrangement mechanisms used by the trypanosome to change its antigenic type thus contribute, by gain and loss of genes, to the evolution of the repertoire for surface antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1564991378,"Human complex-forming glycoprotein, heterogeneous in charge (protein HC) has previously been isolated from urine and immunochemically shown to be present in low and high molecular weight forms in blood plasma (Tejler, L., and Grubb, A. O. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 439, 82-94). In the present work, the major low and high molecular weight forms of the protein were isolated from plasma by immunosorption followed by gel chromatography. The plasma low molecular weight protein HC and the urinary protein had similar, if not identical, molecular weight, amino acid composition, NH2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences and electrophoretic mobility. The low molecular weight plasma protein HC carried a yellow chromophore like the urinary protein, but its molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm was lower and its charge heterogeneity less pronounced than that of urinary protein HC. The plasma high molecular weight protein HC had a hydrodynamic volume which was greater than that of monomeric IgA but smaller than that of dimeric IgA. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the isolated high molecular weight protein followed by electrophoretic blotting and immunochemical analysis demonstrated that the protein contained four polypeptide chains: two light immunoglobulin chains (Mr = 23,000), one IgA alpha-chain (Mr = 54,000), and one chain with Mr approximately 90,000 which carried both alpha-chain and protein HC antigenic determinants. Whether the protein HC X IgA complex is a functionally significant part of the humoral immune system cannot be decided without further experimentation, but the complex was found to be completely absent from the blood plasma of patients with a selective deficiency of IgA-secreting immunocytes. The isolated low and high molecular weight plasma protein HC components were used as standard proteins in the construction of a quantitative crossed immunoelectrophoretic assay for the simultaneous quantitation of the two major protein HC components in blood plasma. The plasma concentrations of the low and high molecular weight protein HC components were measured by this method in 13 healthy Caucasians. The results for the low molecular weight protein HC were: mean, 20.3 mg/liter, S.D., 3.2 mg/liter, range, 13.6-26.0 mg/liter; and for the protein HC X IgA complex: mean, 293 mg/liter, S.D., 176 mg/liter, range, 36-620 mg/liter."
https://openalex.org/W1597415571,"Abstract Malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) mRNA was partially purified to 12% of total mRNA activity (greater than 150-fold enrichment) from 3-5-3'-triiodo-L-thyronine-carbohydrate-stimulated rat liver by polysome immunopurification followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. This preparation was used as the template for synthesis of cDNA on a pBR322-SV40 hybrid plasmid DNA primer which was then circularized with linker DNA and used to transform Escherichia coli. The resulting transformants were screened by in situ differential hybridization using 32P-labeled poly(A+)RNA prepared from uninduced and 3-5-3'-triiodo-L-thyronine-carbohydrate-induced rat livers. Of 750 transformants screened, 6 were found to hybridize differentially; 1 of these, prME, contained an insert of about 1250 base pairs and hybrid-selected an mRNA which directed synthesis of malic enzyme in a cell-free translation system. Using this cDNA as a probe, we demonstrated that the level of malic enzyme mRNA after thyroid hormone treatment was markedly increased and the size of the major malic enzyme mRNA was shown by Northern analysis to be about 2700 nucleotides in length."
https://openalex.org/W1542678692,"alpha 1-Cysteine proteinase inhibitor was isolated from normal and acute phase rat serum. The procedure, which includes successive fractionations on AcA 34, Cibacron blue Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, and hydroxyapatite, but avoids the use of an affinity chromatography step on a cysteine proteinase gel, led to the preparation of two electrophoretically distinct components. These resolved to a single band of apparent Mr = 68,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A slightly higher Mr was estimated from gel filtration studies, possibly related to the rather high carbohydrate content (15.25% of the dry weight). The purified protein exhibited strong inhibiting capacity towards papain with a Ki of 5 X 10(-11) M. As shown by immunochemical quantitation as well as functional activity, a 6-10-fold increase in the alpha 1-cysteine cysteine proteinase inhibitor content was recorded in inflammatory serum, thus demonstrating the protein to be a typical acute phase reactant. Its partial physicochemical characterization (Mr, isoelectric point, extinction coefficient, amino acid and carbohydrate compositions) shows large similarities with alpha 1 acute phase globulin whose biological function remains unknown, and which is present at the same concentration (about 0.5 g/liter) in normal serum. Identity between the two molecules has been further demonstrated by double immunodiffusion analysis since a continuous precipitating line was observed when purified alpha 1-cysteine proteinase inhibitor was reacted against anti-alpha 1 acute phase globulin and anti-alpha 1-cysteine cysteine proteinase inhibitor antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1966007232,"We have isolated and characterized a transposable element from Dictyostelium discoideum denoted Tdd-1. There are approximately 50 complete copies of the element per haploid genome and approximately 100-150 partial elements. Southern blots of DNA from different Dictyostelium discoideum strains show that Tdd-1 is a mobile element. Tdd-1 is 4.9 kb long, with 313 bp inverted repeats. These repeats lie near the termini, but unlike other transposable elements one end of Tdd-1 extends 36 bp past the repeat and the other extends 1 bp. Tdd-1 encodes a series of developmentally regulated transcripts, all with the same polarity, that increase dramatically in abundance after approximately 10 hr of development. We have also identified a heat shock inducible transcript of the opposite polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2067032380,"The Aplysia abdominal ganglion neurons, R3-R14, modulate cardiovascular activity. In vitro translations of poly(A)+ RNA from these cells suggest that they contain a prevalent mRNA encoding a 14 kd protein. Utilizing differential screening techniques with 32P-labeled cDNA synthesized from the poly(A)+ RNA of identified neurons, we isolated the corresponding gene. The Aplysia haploid genome contains a single copy of this sequence, which is interrupted by two large introns and spans approximately 7 kb of genomic DNA. The R3-R14 neurons specifically express this gene, resulting in the synthesis of a 1.25 kb mRNA not found in other abdominal ganglion cells or in the head ganglia. The gene was shown to encode a 13.5 kd precursor, which is proteolytically cleaved into at least three peptides with molecular weights of 5.0, 3.3, and 1.3 kd. These peptides and glycine are thought to act as chemical messengers in the central nervous system and peripherally."
https://openalex.org/W1515835094,"We have found that butyrate selectively inhibits hormonal induction of a few specific proteins and messenger RNAs in hepatoma cells. The fatty acid salt reversibly abolishes induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by dexamethasone and dibutyryl cyclic AMP in HTC cells by inhibiting the production of tyrosine aminotransferase messenger RNA. Half-maximal inhibition of enzyme induction occurred in 0.9 mM butyrate. This effect is highly specific, since 4 h after the addition of butyrate to induced HTC cells, the relative abundance of only five messenger RNA species out of several hundred observable on two-dimensional gels of translational products is changed. Upon removal of the butyrate from cell cultures pretreated with dexamethasone, tyrosine aminotransferase activity begins to increase more rapidly than if dexamethasone is added to control cultures, indicating that part of the induction process occurs in the presence of butyrate. A dose-dependent reduction of fast histone acetylation by butyrate was demonstrated by treating cells with butyrate followed by a short pulse with [3H]acetate and chase in a high concentration of butyrate. The butyrate concentration test range over which rapid histone acetylation is inhibited is similar to that which inhibits enzyme induction to the same extent. In contrast, the slow form of histone acetylation is unaffected in the concentration range examined. The induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by dexamethasone is delayed in hypoacetylated cells. This lag is consistent with the time required to initiate the recovery of the fast form of histone acetylation after its transient disappearance (Covault, J., Perry, M., and Chalkley, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13433-13440). We conclude that sodium butyrate interferes with the ability of dexamethasone and dibutyryl cyclic AMP to increase production of several specific species of messenger RNA in hepatoma cells. This effect correlates well with its ability to reduce rapid acetylation of histones in HTC cells; we discuss potential roles of rapid histone acetylation in modulating hormonal stimulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1486674198,"Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) undergoes a conformational change after reaction with proteases. In this report, it is shown that although two trypsin molecules may bind simultaneously to each alpha 2M, only one trypsin is necessary to induce alpha 2M conformational change. Ternary complexes of alpha 2M and either two radioiodinated trypsins or two nonradioiodinated trypsins were purified by gel filtration chromatography. The nonradioactive complex did not bind 125I-trypsin, even after incubation for 24 h with the free protease present at a large molar excess. Under comparable conditions, a large molar excess of nonradioactive trypsin did not cause significant dissociation of the complex prepared with radioiodinated protease. Equations are presented that distinguish between two separate models of protease binding and demonstrate that binary alpha 2M-trypsin complex retains no significant trypsin binding activity despite the presence of a vacant protease binding site. Purified alpha 2M-plasmin complex, with 1.10 mol of plasmin/mol of inhibitor, also retained no trypsin binding activity as assessed with radioiodinated protein binding experiments. These studies suggest that reactions of alpha 2M with proteases are accurately described by the trap hypothesis (Barrett, A. J., and Starkey, P. M. (1973) Biochem. J. 133, 709-724) independent of protease size or binding stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1594255905,"Plastids were isolated from dark-grown Euglena gracilis, from cells exposed to light for 3 h, and from normal, light-grown cells. Plastid protein synthesis was then measured either in organello, by incorporation of [35S]Met into isolated plastids, or in vitro, by programming wheat germ, reticulocyte, or Escherichia coli translation systems with RNA isolated from the plastids. Specific and total rates of protein synthesis in organello increased during light-induced development about 100-fold. In contrast, specific mRNA activity of plastid RNA increased no more than 3-fold, and the estimated total mRNA activity of plastids increased less than 10-fold. Protein synthesis in plastids appears therefore to be subject to strong regulation at a level other than that of transcription superimposed on weak transcriptional regulation. The synthesis of the large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase in particular appears to be under translational control. There is also qualitative evidence for regulation. Most plastid mRNAs, as indicated by translation in vitro, electrophoresis, and fluorography of their translation products, increase with light-induced development as a coordinate set. A second or proplastid set can be detected in RNAs from immature plastids, but not from mature chloroplasts. A few mRNAs appear only later in development, corresponding to a delayed set. Most translation products measured in organello also appear to belong to the coordinate set, a few to the proplastid and delayed sets, and a further few to a transient set, which appears only early in development."
https://openalex.org/W2011154059,"Blood erythroid cells from five beta-thalassemic donors were incubated with [3H]leucine at 37 degrees C to label the pool of excess, free hemoglobin alpha chains. The 3H-labeled cells were split and reincubated in nonradioactive media that either supported ATP production (with 5 mM glucose) or inhibited ATP production (without glucose but with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose and 0.20 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol). During the 6-h incubation in the glucose medium, the total cellular protein 3H radioactivity decreased about 30%, while the ATP levels remained constant. Chromatographic separation of the alpha- and non-alpha-globin chains of the crude (stroma included) lysates and electrophoretic separation of the free alpha chains and tetrameric hemoglobins of the stroma-free soluble phases both showed that degradation of the alpha chains was responsible for the decrease in protein 3H radioactivity. Conversely, in the energy-deprived cells, the ATP levels dropped to less than 10% of that of the energy-supported cells, and the turnover of alpha-globin 3H radioactivity of the crude lysates was only 5-10%. These results indicate that proteolysis of excess, newly synthesized alpha chains in beta-thalassemic cells is ATP-dependent. The accumulation, mostly in the stromal fraction, of intact 3H-alpha chains in the ATP-deprived cells suggests that an ATP-dependent step occurs early in the biochemical pathway of alpha chain proteolysis. Denaturation resulting in insolubility of the free alpha chains may be a recognition signal for activation of this proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1581678753,"We have investigated the effects of several phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the activity of a cGMP-stimulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase purified from calf liver supernatant. Theophylline, RO 20-1724, and MY 5445 were not effective inhibitors. With 0.5 microM [3H]cGMP as substrate or with 0.5 microM [3H]cAMP in the presence of 1 microM cGMP, activity was inhibited by papaverine, dipyridamole, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), and cilostamide. With 0.5 microM [3H]cAMP as substrate, however, only cilostamide was inhibitory; papaverine, dipyridamole, and IBMX increased activity. The increase was dependent on both drug and substrate concentration with maximal stimulation (150-180%) at concentrations of cAMP between 0.5 and 2.5 microM. At higher cAMP concentrations, the three drugs were inhibitory; inhibition was maximal at approximately 40 microM and decreased at higher cAMP concentrations. Inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis was maximal at approximately 3 microM and decreased at higher concentrations. Papaverine, IBMX, dipyridamole, and cilostamide inhibited [3H] cGMP hydrolysis competitively with Ki values of 3, 6.5, 7, and 11.5 microM, respectively. Papaverine, IBMX, or dipyridamole reduced the Hill coefficient for cAMP hydrolysis from 1.8 to 1.1-1.2, and Lineweaver-Burk plots were linear or nearly linear. With cilostamide, however, Lineweaver-Burk plots remained curvilinear. Thus, three competitive inhibitors, papaverine, dipyridamole, and IBMX, can mimic substrate and effect allosteric transitions that increase catalytic activity, whereas another, cilostamide, apparently cannot. Differences in the actions of these inhibitors presumably reflect differences in the molecular requirements for effective interaction at catalytic and allosteric sites on phosphodiesterase, i.e. differences in the structure of these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2056961080,"Clone pB41-6 (2.5 kb) contains sequences that are repeated 200–300 times in the Dictyostelium genome; about 40 of these sequences are part of a 4.5 kb repeated and apparently transposable genomic element. Clone pB41-6 hybridizes to a large number of cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNAs whose accumulation begins in the first hour of differentiation. In order to understand the regulation of these repeated sequences, we have sequenced pB41-6. It contains three long open reading frames in the “sense” strand. Remarkably, about 70 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site is a sequence identical to that responsible for induction of the Drosophila heat shock genes. A search of published sequences also generated a similar sequence upstream of one of the Dictyostelium actin genes. Indeed, we found that both pB41-6-related RNAs and actin mRNAs are increased as a result of heat shocking growing cells, and that transcription of pB41-6 sequences is induced by heat shock. Thus Dictyostelium contains a set of genes that are induced as a response to heat shock or to the stresses that trigger the initiation of development. We show here that the principal component of this “stress” is not amino acid starvation but the high density of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591000486,"Cytotoxicity and growth inhibition by 5-fluorouracil in methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase gene-amplified KB cells in the presence of 30 microM thymidine correlates with incorporation of this fluorinated pyrimidine into RNA. Growth of these cells over several generations in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of 5-fluorouracil does not depress the steady state levels of either 18 or 28 S RNA but actually causes an increase. Similarly the rates of RNA and protein synthesis in 5-fluorouracil-treated cells are not decreased. The level of dihydrofolate reductase RNA from 5-fluorouracil-treated cells increases in a dose-dependent manner correlated with 5-fluorouracil incorporation into RNA. The qualitative size distribution of the dihydrofolate reductase RNA species is unaffected when examined by the Northern blotting technique indicating an RNA processing lesion is not induced by 5-fluorouracil incorporation into RNA. As the dose of dihydrofolate reductase RNA increases, there is no change in the level of dihydrofolate reductase specific activity, but the level of enzyme activity per cell increases. The relevance of these phenomena to the mechanism of 5-fluorouracil effect on RNA and relevance to combination chemotherapy with methotrexate are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563637714,"Bleomycin treatment of primary chick skin fibroblasts and chick lung fibroblasts resulted in a selective dose-dependent increase of cell layer procollagen synthesis. Solid support hybridization of total cellular RNA to 32P-labeled pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) cDNAs did not indicate an increase of total cellular procollagen type I mRNAs in bleomycin-treated cells. However, bleomycin treatment of chick skin fibroblasts causes a redistribution of procollagen type I mRNAs within the nuclear, cytoplasmic, and polysomal subcellular fractions. Both the nuclear and cytoplasmic procollagen type I mRNAs are significantly decreased in concentration after bleomycin administration. In contrast, the polysomal procollagen type I mRNAs are significantly increased in both chick skin and lung fibroblasts treated with bleomycin. Administration of dexamethasone to bleomycin-treated fibroblasts resulted in a reversal of the bleomycin-induced increase in cell layer procollagen synthesis. The increased amounts of polysomal procollagen type I mRNAs in bleomycin-treated cells were also reduced by subsequent administration of dexamethasone. These data indicate that bleomycin treatment of chick skin and chick lung fibroblasts results in a specific increase in procollagen synthesis in the cell layer which is mediated by elevated levels of polysomal type I procollagen mRNAs via a repartitioning of these mRNAs within the fibroblast. Furthermore, dexamethasone reverses the bleomycin-induced elevations of both cell layer procollagen synthesis and polysomal type I procollagen mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1571327651,"Abstract The keratin polypeptide patterns of two murine transplantable squamous cell carcinomas--originally induced by chemical means in the back skin and in the forestomach epithelium--are deficient in high molecular weight keratin subunits (greater than 60 kDa) invariably present in the corresponding normal tissues. In addition, the keratin polypeptide composition within the low molecular weight range showed further alterations with regard to the corresponding keratin subset of normal tissues in that both tumors expressed a 40-kDa protein, and a 56-kDa protein was selectively found in the forestomach tumor. A comparison of the charge properties of normal and tumor keratin polypeptides revealed that the two uppermost tumor proteins at 60 and 58 kDa were basic in nature whereas their normal molecular weight counterparts belonged to the acidic subset of the pattern. These tumor proteins also showed mutually identical peptide maps which, however, were considerably different from those of the normal proteins. The remaining tumor keratin subunits at 52, 50, 48, and 45 kDa, common also to the normal tissues, had retained their normal charge properties. In vitro translation of mRNA, isolated from both normal and tumor tissue, revealed that every tumor keratin polypeptide is encoded by its own mRNA. In contrast to normal keratinizing tissues, there is therefore no indication of post-translational protein processing in tumors. The in vitro translation products of tumor RNAs had all properties in common with the in vivo tumor proteins, thus indicating that every deviation of the tumor keratin spectrum from the normal state is determined at the mRNA level."
https://openalex.org/W1537283353,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and its subunits were studied as substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylated residues were identified in peptide fragments by sequence analysis following appropriate hydrolysis and purification. Only the free beta-subunit was phosphorylated. Intact beta subunit incorporated 1 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide. This was localized to Thr 97, within the sequence -Arg-Arg-Ser-Thr-, which resembles one type of acceptor site for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. Since beta Thr 97 did not phosphorylate in native hCG, this residue may be masked by the alpha subunit. Reduced and carboxymethylated hCG beta phosphorylated to 2.8 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide. Besides Thr 97, phosphate was also found at Ser 66 and Ser 96. Ser 66 occurs within a segment recognized to be favored for phoshorylation with the general sequence -Arg-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ser-. The appearance of this site in the linearized peptide suggests that Ser 66 is buried in the native conformation of the beta subunit. Two synthetic peptides representing residues 93-102 of hCG beta were also examined. The disulfide form of the peptide phosphorylated at Thr 97 while the linear peptide phosphorylated at Ser 96. Conformation as well as primary structure can thus influence the site of phosphate incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1963640109,"A substitution mutant of the yeast tRNA3leu gene results in the sequence change of GCC to AAA at positions 10, 11, and 12 in the noncoding strand. The ability to form a D stem is lost. Transcription in the heterologous Xenopus germinal vesicle system is not drastically affected, but splicing of the tRNA precursor does not occur. To determine whether this effect is caused by the change in sequence or the change in conformation we constructed two new mutants. In one, mutation results in the sequence change of GGC to TTT at positions 24, 25, and 26. The ability to form a D stem is lost; transcription is unaffected, but excision of the intron does not occur. The other, a double mutant, is characterized by both substitutions described above, and the ability to form a D stem is retained. The precursor derived from the double mutant is accurately spliced in X. laevis germinal vesicle extracts, therefore excision of the intervening sequence appears to depend on the formation of a D stem."
https://openalex.org/W1555432509,"An RNA processing activity capable of cleaving Bacillus subtilis phage SP82 early mRNA has been purified to apparent homogeneity from crude extracts of uninfected B. subtilis. The enzyme, a functional monomer of Mr approximately 27,000, cleaves only at the 5' side of adenosine residues at processing sites and is competitively inhibited by double-stranded synthetic RNA polymers. Processed SP82 mRNAs were translated in an Escherichia coli cell-free system and no qualitative or quantitative effects of processing on the synthesis of polypeptides was observed. The processing enzyme does not cleave T7 mRNA, E. coli precursor rRNA, or double-stranded poly(AU). A recombinant plasmid containing portions of two B. subtilis rRNA gene sets was transcribed in vitro and the resulting RNA was cleaved in the spacer region between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes. The ability of the B. subtilis processing enzyme to cleave SP82 mRNA and B. subtilis precursor rRNA and the fact that the enzyme has high affinity for double-stranded RNA suggest that it is the functional analog of E. coli RNase III."
https://openalex.org/W1556680142,"In the present work we show that sarcoma and normal hamster tissues contain a protein which agglutinates normal and transformed cells. The inhibition of agglutination by galacturonic acid and occasionally by fucose suggests a resemblance of this protein with vegetal lectins. When added 5 h after interferon, the crude semipurified and electrophoretically homogeneous preparations reduce within 20 h the antiviral state pre-established by interferon. These two biological tests have enabled us to monitor the subsequent purification steps. The isolation of the biologically active protein is greatly facilitated by its resistance to pepsin and nucleases, whereas its sensitivity to trypsin and Pronase suggests its proteinaceous character. Furthermore, the molecule is stable when heated 1-2 min at 100 degrees C in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. After pepsin treatment, Sephacryl G-200 gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, 25-40-fold purification can be obtained. When controlled by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a double band (DEAE-cellulose sample) or single band (octyl-agarose sample) is detected in the 65,000-dalton region and no other contaminator is present. The eluted protein retains full biological activity when assayed by the degradation of the interferon-induced antiviral protection in the cell or titrated by cell agglutination."
https://openalex.org/W1615247214,"Synthesis of a complementary strand on the circular viral (+)-DNA of phage phiX174, coated with single-stranded DNA binding protein, is primed by the synthesis of an oligonucleotide by the primosome. Processive primosome movement on the lagging strand with the replication fork was proposed as a model for the discontinuous portion of Escherichia coli chromosome replication (Arai, K. and Kornberg, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 69-73; Arai, K., Low, R. L., and Kornberg, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 707-711). RNA primers covalently bound to the 5'-end of a DNA chain are heterogeneous with respect to both size and nucleotide composition. The chain length of the DNA-linked RNA primers is shorter than a decanucleotide, predominantly ranging from 1 to 9 residues. The primers start with adenylate followed mainly by a purine nucleotide (Pu) at the second position suggesting that pppA-Pu is a preferred initiation sequence. The inner sequences are more heterogeneous and no consensus or preferred sequence was found beyond the third position. The size distribution of the primer is influenced by the relative concentration of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates; the proportion of mononucleotide (riboadenylate) primer increases upon decreasing the relative ribonucleoside triphosphate concentration. Mapping of the transition sites from RNA to DNA on HaeIII endonuclease fragments suggest they are distributed randomly and occur frequently on the phiX174 genome. These results suggest that the selection of RNA priming sites is affected by primase at the preferred sequence 3'-T-pyrimidine nucleotide-5' on the template within the DNA domain generated by the dnaB protein. These properties of RNA priming have important implications for site selection by the primosome on the lagging strand at the replication fork of the E. coli chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1647414965,"Abstract The beta subunit of human choriogonadotropin (hCG) was previously shown to be phosphorylated by beef skeletal muscle cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Keutmann, H. T., Ratanabanangkoon, K., Pierce, M. W., Kitzmann, K., and Ryan, R. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14522-14527). The phosphorylation site was primarily at Thr 97, located within the determinant loop region proposed by Ward and Moore (Ward, D. N., and Moore, W. T. (1979) Animal Models for Research in Fertility and Contraception (Alexander, N. J., ed) pp. 151-164, Harper and Row, Baltimore, MD) to be important for hormonal activity and specificity. Biological and immunological studies were carried out to determine the effect of this modification on the activity of hCG. The phosphorylated hCG beta recombined with hCG alpha to form phosphorylated hCG (*hCG). The recombined *hCG retained full immunological activity in a radioimmunoassay using anti-hCG serum and 125I-hCG. The biological activities of the *hCG on appropriate rat gonadal cells, as studied by hCG radioreceptor assay, follitropin radioreceptor assay, and adenylate cyclase assay, were 0.29 +/- 0.04, 0.29 +/- 0.07, and 0.69 +/- 0.13 times as potent as hCG, respectively. The reduced receptor binding activity of *hCG was not due to dissociation of the hormone into its subunits. The far ultraviolet CD spectrum of the *hCG showed no gross conformational change induced by phosphorylation. We conclude the following: 1) Thr 97 is not involved in subunit-subunit interaction and is not part of the hCG antigenic site recognized by this particular antiserum; 2) Thr 97 does appear to participate in the hCG-receptor interactions; 3) modification of Thr 97 does not result in an enhancement of follitropin-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W1604063803,"The H-4 rat hepatoma cell line grown in tissue culture was used as a model system to investigate the action of cAMP in tyrosine aminotransferase induction. An immunoprecipitation technique was used to quantitate the amount and the rate of synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase; the level of mRNA coding for tyrosine aminotransferase was determined by in vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from hepatoma cells. Our results demonstrated that 8-bromo-cAMP gave time-dependent and proportionate increases in the tyrosine aminotransferase activity, the amount of immunoprecipitable tyrosine aminotransferase, the rate of synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase, and the level of mRNATAT in H-4 hepatoma cells. The time course of increase in mRNATAT preceded the increase in synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase and was dependent on the continuous production of poly(A)+ RNA. Pretreatment of the cells with cordycepin completely abolished the 8-bromo-cAMP-evoked increase in mRNATAT activity. These results provided evidence that the primary action of cAMP in tyrosine aminotransferase induction is the increase of functional mRNATAT and that this increase can completely account for the increase in tyrosine aminotransferase activity."
