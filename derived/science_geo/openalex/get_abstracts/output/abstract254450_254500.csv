Descriptions of the internalization process vary from energy-independent cell penetration of membranes to endocytic uptake. To elucidate whether the mechanism of entry of CPP constructs might be influenced by the properties of the cargo, we used time lapse confocal microscopy analysis of living mammalian cells to directly compare the uptake of the well-studied CPP TAT fused to a protein (>50 amino acids) or peptide (<50 amino acids) cargo. We also analyzed various constructs for their subcellular distribution and mobility after the internalization event. TAT fusion proteins were taken up largely into cytoplasmic vesicles whereas peptides fused to TAT entered the cell in a rapid manner that was dependent on membrane potential. Despite their accumulation in the nucleolus, photobleaching of TAT fusion peptides revealed their mobility. The bioavailability of internalized TAT peptides was tested and confirmed by the strong inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression of two TAT fusion peptides derived from the tumor suppressor p21(WAF/Cip) and DNA Ligase I measured in living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2014923090,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid metabolite, promotes cell proliferation and survival whereas its precursor, sphingosine, has the opposite effects. However, much remains unknown about their regulation. Here we identify a novel human ceramidase (haCER2) that regulates the levels of both sphingosine and S1P by controlling the hydrolysis of ceramides. haCER2 is localized to the Golgi complex and is highly expressed in the placenta. High ectopic expression of haCER2 caused fragmentation of the Golgi complex and growth arrest in HeLa cells due to sphingosine accumulation. Low ectopic expression of haCER2 increased S1P without sphingosine accumulation, promoting cell proliferation in serum-free medium. This proliferative effect was suppressed by dimethylsphingosine, an inhibitor of the S1P formation, or by the RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated inhibition of S1P(1,) a G-protein-coupled receptor for S1P. The RNAi-mediated down-regulation of haCER2 enhanced the serum deprivation-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of HeLa cells, which was inhibited by addition of exogenous S1P. Serum deprivation up-regulated both haCER2 mRNA and activity in HeLa cells. haCER2 mRNA is also up-regulated in some tumors. Taken together, these results suggest that haCER2 is important for the generation of S1P and S1P-mediated cell proliferation and survival, but that its overexpression may cause cell growth arrest due to an accumulation of sphingosine."
https://openalex.org/W2132182857,"Leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs) are lipid mediators that play a key role in regulating acute inflammatory responses. Their roles in neural stem cell (NSC) functions are of interest. We showed here that LTB(4) and LXA(4) regulated proliferation and differentiation of murine NSCs that were isolated from embryo brains. Proliferation of NSCs was stimulated by LTB(4) (3 to 100 nM) and blocked by receptor antagonist (IC(50)=2.7 microM). In contrast, LXA(4), and its aspirin-triggered-15-epi-LXA(4) stable analog attenuated growth of NSCs at as little as 1 nM. Both lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitors and LTB(4) receptor antagonists caused apoptosis and cell death. Gene chip analysis revealed that growth-related gene expressions such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cyclin E, p27, and caspase 8 were tightly regulated by LTB(4); LXA(4) gave the opposite gene expressions. In addition to proliferation, LTB(4) induced differentiation of NSCs into neurons as monitored by neurite outgrowth and MAP2 expression. These results indicate for the first time that LTB(4) and LXA(4) directly regulate proliferation and differentiation of NSCs, suggesting these new pathways may be useful in restoring stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063281852,"The hybrid sensor kinase RpfC positively regulates the expression of a range of virulent genes and negatively modulates the synthesis of the quorum sensing signal diffusible signal factor (DSF) in Xanthomonas campestris. Three conserved amino acid residues of RpfC implicated in phosphorelay (His198 in the histidine kinase domain, Asp512 in the receiver domain, and His657 in the histidine phosphotransfer domain) were essential for activation of the production of extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) virulence factors but were not essential for repression of DSF biosynthesis. Domain deletion and subsequent in trans expression analysis revealed that the receiver domain of RpfC alone was sufficient to repress DSF overproduction in an rpfC deletion mutant. Further deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis analyses identified a peptide of 107 amino acids and three amino acid residues (Gln496, Glu504, and Ile552) involved in modulating DSF production. Co-immunoprecipitation and far Western blot analyses suggested an interaction between the receiver domain and RpfF, the enzyme involved in DSF biosynthesis. These data support a model in which RpfC modulates two different functions (virulence factor synthesis and DSF synthesis) by utilization of a conserved phosphorelay system and a novel domain-specific protein-protein interaction mechanism, respectively.

This latter mechanism represents an added dimension to conventional two-component signaling paradigms. Two-component regulation is the predominant form of signal recognition and response coupling mechanism used by bacteria to sense and respond to diverse environmental stresses and cues ranging from common environmental stimuli to host signals recognized by pathogens and bacterial cell-cell communication signals (1Grebe T.W.

Bacteria chromosomes encode numerous two-component systems, implying diversified roles in signal modulation of microbial physiology and ecology. For example, the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris carry, respectively, >60 and >100 pairs of genes encoding two-component systems (4Qian W.

The structures of both sensors and regulators are modular, and numerous variations in domain architecture and composition have evolved to tailor to specific needs in signal perception and signal transduction (2Stock A.M.

Among the extremely diversified family of histidine kinase sensors, the simplest (also known as orthodox kinases) consists of only sensing and kinase domains. The more complex hybrid sensors contain, in addition to sensing and kinase domains, a REC domain typical of two-component regulators and in some cases a C-terminal histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) domain (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar, 6Bijlsma J.J. Groisman E.A.

The family of sensor kinases with this latter domain organization includes ArcB of Escherichia coli, BvgS of Bordetella sp., GacS of Pseudomonas sp., and RpfC of X. campestris pv. campestris (8Hrabak E.M.

In the case of such hybrid sensor-regulator kinases, the phosphoryl group from the autophosphorylated histidine (His1) residue is transferred to an aspartate (Asp1) residue of the REC domain and is further relayed to a histidine residue (His2) in the HPT domain. Subsequently, the His2 transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartate (Asp2) residue in the REC domain of the cognate response regulator (12Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. J. Biol.

Although the REC domain of hybrid sensor kinases is implicated in phosphorelay, it is by no means clear that this is its sole function (15Galperin M.Y. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 552-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In X. campestris pv. campestris, the hybrid sensor kinase RpfC and cognate regulator RpfG are implicated in the positive regulation of biofilm dispersal and the production of virulence factors (16Dow J.M. Crossman L. Findlay K. He Y.Q. Feng J.X. Tang J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10995-11000Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Slater H. Alvarez-Morales A. Barber C.E.

This two-component system is believed to respond to the cell-cell communication signal DSF (16Dow J.M. Crossman L. Findlay K. He Y.Q. Feng J.X. Tang J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Synthesis of DSF requires an enzyme encoded by the rpfF gene (18Barber C.E. Tang J.L. Feng J.X. Pan M.Q. Wilson T.J.G. Slater H. Dow J.M. Williams P. Daniels M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Recent microarray and genetic analyses have revealed that DSF also modulates additional functions associated with stress resistance and adaptation (21He Y.W. Xu M. Lin K. Ng Y.J. Wen C.M. Wang L.H. Liu Z.D. Zhang H.B. Dong Y.H. Dow J.M. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A number of lines of evidence support a role for RpfC/RpfG in the perception and transduction of the DSF signal. The addition of DSF can restore virulence factor production and induce biofilm dispersal in rpfF mutants but not in rpfC and rpfG mutants, respectively (16Dow J.M. Crossman L. Findlay K. He Y.Q. Feng J.X. Tang J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10995-11000Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 17Slater H. Alvarez-Morales A. Barber C.E. Daniels M.J. Dow J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 986-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RpfC/RpfG two-component system has been reconstructed in P. aeruginosa and shown to confer responsiveness to exogenously added DSF, as seen through its effects on swarming motility (19Ryan R.P. Fouhy Y. Lucey J.F. Crossman L.C. Spiro S. He Y.W. Zhang L.H. Heeb S. Camara M. William P. Dow J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutation of rpfC (but not of rpfG) leads to overproduction of DSF. These findings suggest that the RpfC sensor kinase may control two signaling pathways in X. campestris pv. campestris, with one activating virulence factor production and the other inhibiting DSF biosynthesis. The former pathway is dependent on the RpfG response regulator, but the latter apparently is not. The work in this paper had the aim of establishing the molecular mechanisms underlying this dual signaling action of RpfC. As outlined above, RpfC is a hybrid sensor kinase in which the sensory input and kinase domains are fused to a receiver domain and a C-terminal HPT domain. By domain deletion and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we have shown here that RpfC transduces signals for the regulation of virulence factor production through a phosphorelay system but modulates DSF biosynthesis through a domain-specific protein-protein interaction mechanism involving the REC domain. This latter finding, which offers an insight into possible additional roles of the REC domain of hybrid sensor kinases, presents a new dimension to the conventional two-component signaling paradigms. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The wild-type X. campestris pv. campestris strain Xc1 has been described previously (20Wang L.H. He Y.W. Gao Y. Wu J.E. Dong Y.H. He C. Wang S.X. Weng L.X. Xu J.L. Tay L. Fang R.X. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The Xc1 derivatives carrying various mutations or constructs were described in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. X. campestris pv. campestris strains were grown at 30 °C in YEB medium (22Zhang H.B. Wang L.H. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), unless otherwise stated. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations when required: 100 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml rifampicin, and 15 μg/ml tetracycline; X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucopyranoside) was included in the medium at 60 μg/ml for the detection of GUS (β-glucuronidase) activity. DSF signal was added to the medium in a final concentration of 3 μm when necessary.FIGURE 2Identification of essential domains for the regulation of extracellular enzyme activity and DSF production.

The open reading frame and the coding sequences for various domains of RpfC were deleted using the allelic exchange vector pK18mobsacB following the methods described previously (17Slater H. Alvarez-Morales A. Barber C.E. Daniels M.J. Dow J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 986-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, for generation of the rpfC deletion mutant Xc1ΔC, two rpfC DNA fragments rpfC-1 (the 5′ region of ∼531 bp) and rpfC-2 (the 3′ region of ∼649 bp) were amplified using two primer pairs, rpfC-1-FOR and rpfC-1-REV and rpfC-2-FOR and rpfC-2-REV (supplemental Table S1). The resultant DNA fragments were cleaved with BamHI and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. The fusion fragment rpfC-12 was then amplified using the ligation mixture as the template with primer pair rpfC-1-FOR and rpfC-2-REV. The fusion fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of the vector pK18mobsacB. After sequence verification, the recombinant plasmid was mobilized into strain Xc1 by triparental mating. Transconjugants were selected on LB medium supplemented with rifampicin and kanamycin. A second selection was done on LB medium containing 5% (w/v) sucrose and rifampicin to select for resolution of the vector by a second crossover event. The in-frame deletion of rpfC was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Similar methods were applied to generate the HPT domain deletion mutant RpfCΔ1, the REC-HPT domain deletion mutant RpfCΔ2, the HK-REC-HPT domain deletion mutant RpfCΔ3, and the transmembrane-HK-REC domain deletion mutant RpfCΔ4, using the primers listed (supplemental Table S1). For the preparation of in trans expression constructs, the coding sequence of the REC domain of RpfC or its truncated versions was obtained by PCR amplification using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR fragments were cleaved with BamHI and HindIII and cloned under the control of the lac promoter in the broad host range vector pLAFR3. The recombinant constructs were sequence-verified and mobilized into the RpfC null mutant Xc1ΔC by triparental mating. The resultant transformants were selected on LB medium supplemented with rifampicin and tetracycline. Quantification of DSF and Virulence Factor Production— DSF synthesis, bioassay, and quantification were performed as described previously (20Wang L.H. He Y.W. Gao Y. Wu J.E. Dong Y.H. He C. Wang S.X. Weng L.X. Xu J.L. Tay L. Fang R.X. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). DSF signals were extracted from the supernatants of bacterial cultures 40 h after inoculation, unless otherwise indicated. For determination of biofilm formation, 1 ml of bacterial cell culture at A600 = 1.6 was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and the existence of a gum-like substance on the top of the bacterial pellet was checked as described previously (21He Y.W. Xu M. Lin K. Ng Y.J. Wen C.M. Wang L.H. Liu Z.D. Zhang H.B. Dong Y.H. Dow J.M. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).

RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—The detailed methods for RNA extraction and oligomicroarray analysis have been described previously (21He Y.W. Xu M. Lin K. Ng Y.J. Wen C.M. Wang L.H. Liu Z.D. Zhang H.B. Dong Y.H. Dow J.M. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial cells at A600 = 1.6 were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 4 min at 10,000 rpm. RNA was purified by using an RNeasy midicolumn (Qiagen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. RT-PCR analysis was done using the Qiagen® OneStep RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for RT-PCR analysis were listed in supplemental Table S1, and a total of 250 ng of total RNAs were used for each reaction. In Situ Site-directed and Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis— Three conserved amino acid residues of RpfC predicted to be involved in phosphorelay (His1198 in the HK domain, Asp1512 in the REC domain, and His2657 in the HPT domain) were identified via the sequence alignment with the following homologues: RpfA (NCBI accession number(s) U62023), LemA (M80477), BvgS (M25401), GacS (AB219364), ArcB (X53315), and CheY (M13463). The three conserved residues were changed to alanine or valine by using substituted PCR primers (supplemental Table S1). The resultant PCR fragments were cloned into the SmaI site of pK18mobsacB. The recombinant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and mobilized into strain Xc1 by triparental mating. Transconjugants were selected on LB medium supplemented with rifampicin and kanamycin. The second selection was done on YEB medium containing 5% (w/v) sucrose and rifampicin. The potential mutants were selected based on DSF production and biofilm formation phenotypes. The point mutation was verified by PCR amplification of the corresponding DNA fragment and DNA sequencing. For alanine scanning mutagenesis of the REC domain, the coding region was amplified using the primers rpfC-F3 and rpfC-R3 listed in supplemental Table S1 and cloned into the vector pGEMT-easy. Point mutation was conducted using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions. After DNA sequencing verification, the mutated REC fragments were cut by BamHI and HindIII and cloned under the control of the lac promoter in expression vector pLAFR3. These constructs were then separately mobilized into strain Xc1ΔC by triparental mating. Anti-FLAG Co-immunoprecipitation—The REC coding sequence was fused in-frame by PCR with that of FLAG using two primers listed in supplemental Table S1. After digestion with BamHI and HindIII, the PCR fragment was cloned in vector pLAFR3. The construct was transferred to the rpfC deletion mutant Xc1ΔC by conjugation. The expression of FLAG-REC fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and DSF bioassay. A total soluble protein sample was prepared when bacterial cell density reached 1.0 at A600 and then applied onto EZview™Red Anti-FLAG® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the gel was washed with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and the FLAG-tagged protein and its binding proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.5. After condensation with Microcon YM-10 (Amicon), the eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Visible protein bands were excised from the gel, and the peptide sequences were deciphered by mass spectrometry (quadrupole time-of-flight). Protein Purification and Anti-serum Preparation—The REC coding sequence was fused in-frame to the coding sequence of the His6 tag in expression vector pET-14b (Novagen) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 28 °C with shaking at 250 rpm to 0.7 at A600, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and growth was continued overnight at 18 °C with a gentle shaking at 200 rpm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min and resuspended in the lysis buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.1 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cells were sonicated on ice with 5 × 15-s bursts and 90-s cooling intervals. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then filtered using a 0.45-μl filter before adding to an affinity column containing Ni2+-chelating Sepharose fast flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) for affinity binding. The column was washed with a buffer solution of the same pH containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The bound His6-REC protein was eluted from the column with a 250 mm imidazole gradient and used as an antigen to obtain polyclonal antisera by immunizing rabbits through subcutaneous injections at two-week intervals. RpfF and green fluorescent protein were also purified in the same way for far Western blot analysis. Preparation of recombinant AlbD protein was described previously (25Zhang L. Birch R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Western Blot and Far Western Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—Western blotting was performed as described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). In vitro far Western blot assay was performed following the method of Hall (27Hall R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified REC (0.1 μg), RpfF (10 μg), AlbD (10 μg), and green fluorescent (10 μg) proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), which was then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% nonfat powdered milk overnight at room temperature. The blocked membrane was overlaid with REC domain protein (30 μg/ml in blocking buffer) for 4 h at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 four times, the blots were incubated with primary polyclonal anti-REC serum followed by washing and incubation with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). The hybridization signal was detected using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Conserved Phosphorelay Mechanism of RpfC Is Essential for Induction of Virulence Gene Expression but Not for Down-regulation of DSF Biosynthesis—RpfC is a hybrid sensor regulator, consisting of a transmembrane, an HK, a REC, and a HPT domain (Fig. 1A). Multiple sequence alignment analysis of RpfC and homologues identified several potential residues implicated in phosphotransfer, including the autophosphorylatable His1198 in the HK domain, the phosphor-accepting Asp residue (Asp1512) in the REC domain, and the phosphor-accepting His2657 in the HPT domain of RpfC (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, we also identified the potential phosphor-accepting aspartate (Asp280) residue in the REC domain of response regulator RpfG (data not shown). The conserved structure implies that the RpfC/RpfG two-component system may sense and transduce signals (including DSF) through the His1→Asp1→His2→Asp2 multiple phosphorelay system. To determine whether the conserved phosphorelay mechanism in RpfC is involved in regulation of the dual functions, i.e. induction of virulence factor production and down-regulation of DSF production, we substituted His1198 and His2657 of RpfC with alanine and Asp1512 with valine by site-directed mutagenesis. These altered rpfC alleles were transferred to the chromosome to replace the wild type. RT-PCR analysis showed that these point mutations did not affect the expression of rpfC (supplemental Fig. S2) but resulted in decreased production of EPS and reduced activity of cellulase and protease, which was similar to the RpfC null mutant Xc1ΔC (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, strains expressing the RpfC phosphotransfer-deficient variants H198A, D512V, and H657A produced a low level of DSF similar to the parental wild-type strain Xc1 (Fig. 1B) and unlike the rpfC deletion mutant Xc1ΔC, which produced elevated levels of DSF. These findings suggested that the conserved His198-Asp512-His657 phosphorelay mechanism is required for induction of extracellular enzyme and EPS virulence factors but not for the RpfC-dependent inhibition of DSF synthesis. The REC (but Not the HPT) Domain Is Required for Repression of DSF Biosynthesis—To address the mechanistic basis of RpfC modulation of DSF biosynthesis, we first generated a panel of mutants with in-frame deletions in the chromosomal copy of the rpfC gene, which expressed variants of RpfC lacking one or more domains (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that these deletions did not affect the expression of the altered rpfC protein (supplemental Fig. S2). As expected, deletion of any of the three domains (HK, REC, or HPT) containing the conserved phosphorelay residues resulted in decreased activity of cellulase (Fig. 2B) and reduced EPS production and protease activity (data not shown). However, although deletion of both REC and HPT domains led to overproduction of DSF, the truncated RpfC lacking only the HPT domain remained active in the repression of DSF biosynthesis (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, all of the deletion mutants (RpfCΔ2, RpfCΔ3, and RpfCΔ4) lacking the REC domain overproduced the signal (Fig. 2, A and C). These data, which seem to exclude the involvement of HPT in modulation of DSF signal generation, suggest a role for the REC domain in this function. The Isolated REC Domain Can Repress DSF Biosynthesis—To further test the hypothesis that the REC domain is involved in RpfC-dependent repression of DSF biosynthesis, we cloned the coding region of this domain (the amino acid residues 450-599 of Rp"
https://openalex.org/W2137154133,"TRPV4 is a calcium-permeable channel activated by extracellular hypotonicity, polyunsaturated fatty acids, phorbol esters, and heat. We show that TRPV4 is localized in the basolateral membrane of the mouse mammary cell line HC11. Activation of TRPV4 caused an increase in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration through influx of extracellular Ca(2+), triggering two independent chains of events: 1) a rapid increase in transcellular conductance through the activation of apical large conductance calcium-activated (BK) potassium channels that were blockable by paxilline; 2) a slow increase in paracellular permeability for small solutes. The latter effect was accompanied by a down-regulation of the tight junctional proteins claudin -1, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -8 and by dramatic changes in tight junction morphology, including frequent large breaks in the tight junction strands. This dual modulation of epithelial permeability after TRPV4 activation may be involved in regulating the tonicity across mammary gland epithelia. TRPV4 activation may also be responsible for exudation and edema formation during inflammation processes.-Reiter, B., Kraft, R., Günzel, D., Zeissig, S., Schulzke, J-D., Fromm, M., Harteneck, C.

https://openalex.org/W2102600622,"Class 3 semaphorins (sema 3) are secreted guidance proteins. Sema 3A expressed by endothelial cells controls vascular morphogenesis through integrin inhibition. Sema 3C is required for normal cardiovascular patterning. Here we examined the potential role of sema 3C as regulator of endothelial cell function in vitro using mouse glomerular endothelial cells (MGEC). We determined that MGEC express sema 3C mRNA and protein and its receptors mRNA. Recombinant sema 3C induced MGEC proliferation 18 +/- 2% above control, as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and reduced starvation-induced apoptosis by 46 +/- 3%, as indicated by an in situ marker of activated caspase 3. Sema 3C increased MGEC adhesion to fibronectin 79 +/- 13% and to collagen 55 +/- 12% as compared with control. Sema 3C-induced MGEC adhesion was prevented by integrin blocking antibodies and involved beta1 integrin serine phosphorylation. Sema 3C-induced MGEC adhesion and proliferation were similar to those induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Sema 3C induced a 44 +/- 11% increase in MGEC directional migration and stimulated MGEC capillary-like network formation on collagen I gels. Collectively, our data indicate that sema 3C promotes glomerular endothelial cell proliferation, adhesion, directional migration, and tube formation in vitro by stimulating integrin phosphorylation and VEGF120 secretion, functions that are similar to VEGF-A and opposite to sema 3A."
https://openalex.org/W2014811987,"Chlamydia trachomatis has evolved a profound anti-apoptotic activity that may aid in chlamydial evasion of host defense. The C. trachomatis anti-apoptotic activity has been correlated with blockade of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, inhibition of Bax and Bak activation, and degradation of BH3-only proteins. This study presents evidence that a chlamydia-secreted protease factor designated CPAF is both necessary and sufficient for degrading the BH3-only proteins. When the C. trachomatis-infected cell cytosolic extracts were fractionated by column chromatography, both the CPAF protein and activity elution peaks overlapped with the BH3-only protein degradation activity peak. Depletion of CPAF with a CPAF-specific antibody removed the BH3-only protein degradation activity from the infected cell cytosolic extracts, whereas depletion with control antibodies failed to do so. Notably, recombinant CPAF expressed in bacteria was able to degrade the BH3-only proteins, whereas CPAF mutants similarly prepared from bacteria failed to do so. Finally, bacterium-expressed CPAF also degraded the human BH3-only protein Pumaα purified from bacteria. These results demonstrate that CPAF contributes to the chlamydial anti-apoptotic activity by degrading the pro-apoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 subfamily members."

Here we uncovered a novel role for the activated Abl kinase in the regulation of EGFR endocytosis. We show that activated Abl impairs EGFR internalization. Moreover, we show that activated Abl phosphorylates the EGFR primarily on tyrosine 1173, and that mutation of this site to phenylalanine restores ligand-dependent endocytosis of the EGFR in the presence of activated Abl.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Following endocytosis, the internalized EGFR may recycle back to the plasma membrane for continued signaling or is targeted for degradation in the lysosomal compartment, thereby irreversibly terminating receptor signaling. Defective internalization of ligand-activated EGFR leads to prolonged signals from the cell surface and may result in cellular transformation (1Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 2Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 3Polo S. Pece S.

EGFR endocytosis requires post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, monoubiquitination, and polyubiquitination at multiple sites (3Polo S. Pece S. Di Fiore P.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). A critical regulator of ligand-dependent EGFR down-regulation is the Cbl adaptor protein. Cbl is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that mediates ligand-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR, which is required for targeting the receptor to sorting endosomes and subsequently to the lysosomal degradative compartment. Cbl also forms a complex with CIN85 and endophilin to regulate internalization of ligand-bound EGFR (5Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Cbl is recruited to the receptor in response to EGF stimulation by direct binding to phosphotyrosine 1045 of the EGFR (6Grovdal L.M. Stang E. Sorkin A. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tysgankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Cbl also binds indirectly to the EGFR through the Grb2 adaptor protein (8Waterman H. Katz M.

Cbl has been shown to regulate both endocytosis and targeting of the EGFR for lysosomal degradation following ubiquitination (1Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A role for Cbl in EGFR internalization is also supported by the observation that a mutant EGFR lacking the Cbl-binding site exhibits impaired ligand-induced ubiquitination and endocytosis, enhanced recycling to the plasma membrane, and increased mitogenic signaling (8Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T.M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, down-regulation of both c-Cbl and the related Cbl-b by RNA interference resulted in substantial inhibition of EGFR internalization (12Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Additionally, EGFR internalization is inhibited in cells depleted of the Grb2 adaptor or by mutation of the Grb2-binding site on the receptor (9Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 10Huang F. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGFR endocytosis is restored in Grb2-depleted cells by a chimeric protein that fuses the Grb2 Src homology 2 (2Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) domain to Cbl (10Huang F. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings show that in addition to a role in lysosomal sorting and degradation of the receptor, Cbl regulates EGFR internalization. Escape from Cbl-mediated degradation has been linked to increased oncogenicity of the EGFR and other ErbB family members. Highly oncogenic forms of the viral erbB protein kinase have lost the Cbl-docking site (13Choi O.R. Trainor C. Graf C. Beug H. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An EGFR deletion mutant lacking exons 2-7 (EGFRvIII) found in glioblastoma patients exhibits reduced Cbl recruitment and fails to be ubiquitinated and internalized (14Schmidt M.H. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Bogler O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6505-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enhanced destruction of Cbl induced by the activated Src tyrosine kinase, or sequestration of Cbl by activated Cdc42 or Sprouty2, has been shown to inhibit Cbl-mediated down-regulation of the EGFR and may contribute to EGFR oncogenicity (15Wu W.J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Wong E.S. Wong M. Fong C.W. Lin J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.J. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, deregulation of the EGFR in cancer may occur not only through amplification or point mutations of the receptor resulting in elevated receptor levels or ligand-independent receptor activation, but also by uncoupling the EGFR from ligand-induced down-regulation. The mechanisms that promote the uncoupling of these processes are just beginning to be defined. Here we identify a novel role for the Abl tyrosine kinase in uncoupling ligand-activated EGFR from receptor internalization. The Abl family kinases, Abl1 (c-Abl) and Abl2 (Arg), play a role in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, proliferation, and survival (17Pendergast A.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 85: 51-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that endogenous Abl kinases are rapidly activated after EGFR stimulation (18Plattner R. Kadiec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 19Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G. Nature. 2006; 439: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 20Srinivasan D. Plattner R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Abl kinases are required for EGF-mediated membrane ruffling and Rac activation at physiological concentrations of the ligand (21Sini P. Cannas A. Koleske A.J. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SH2 domains of Abl1 and Abl2 have been shown to bind with high affinity to the EGFR and other ErbB family members by interacting with multiple tyrosines on the phosphorylated receptors (19Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G. Nature. 2006; 439: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 22Zhu G. Decker S.J. Mayer B.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1775-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the effects of Abl activation on EGFR physiological functions. Similar to the EGFR, Abl kinase hyperactivation has been linked to the pathogenesis of cancer. Chromosomal translocation events in human leukemias give rise to structurally altered oncogenic Abl fusion proteins such as Bcr-Abl, Tel-Abl, and Tel-Arg (17Pendergast A.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 85: 51-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enhanced expression of Abl kinases is observed in a subset of primary colon carcinomas and metastatic tumors (23Chen W.S. Yang W.K. Lin W.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), as well as in pancreatic ductal carcinomas and renal medullary carcinoma (24Crnogorac-Jurcevic T. Efthimiou E. Nielsen T. Loader T. Terris B. Stamp G. Baron A. Scarpa A. Lemoine N.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4587-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Simpson L. He X. Pins M. J. Urol. 2005; 173: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, Abl kinases are constitutively activated downstream of ErbB receptors and Src kinases in breast cancer cell lines (20Srinivasan D. Plattner R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here we show that the activated Abl kinase phosphorylates the EGFR at specific sites and uncouples the receptor from ligand-mediated internalization. Additionally, we show that kinase-active Abl disrupts the Cbl recruitment to the activated EGFR. Thus, Abl and the EGFR may function synergistically in the pathogenesis of human tumors.

EGF Internalization Assays in COS7 Cells—Cells were plated in coverslips, transfected, and serum-starved 1 day after transfection for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were placed in serum-free DMEM 10 min prior to the addition of 50 ng/ml EGF at 37 °C for 15 min. After EGF stimulation, cells were placed for 15 min in acidic washing buffer (0.2 m acetic acid, pH 2.8, 0.5 m NaCl) to remove cell surface EGF. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were permeabilized at room temperature with 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed twice with 1× PBS, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and immunostained with primary antibodies for EGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) or Abl (Ab-3) in the presence of 2% NDS.

EGF internalization in NR6 cells was analyzed in a similar manner, and the number of cells positive for EGF internalization was determined by counting the number of vesicles/μ2 for each cell. Numbers ranged from 0 to 5. EGFR internalization-negative cells had a ratio lower than 0.5 vesicles/μ2, whereas cells with ratios ranging between 0.5 and 5 were counted as positive for EGFR internalization.

Cells were placed in ice-cold binding medium (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min and treated with 40 ng/ml rhodamine-EGF (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 4 °C. To examine the internalization of EGF, EGF-containing medium was replaced with warm DMEM, in which the cells were incubated for 15 min in serum-free media followed by addition of acidic washing buffer as indicated above. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and immunostained for Abl. EGFR internalization was analyzed with a confocal microscope. Transfected proteins were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and rhodamine-EGF complexes were detected with a CY3 filter channel and three-dimensional projections of slices throughout the cell. Cell counting was performed with the identity of the sample remaining unknown to the observer. Analysis of EGFR Endocytosis by Cell-surface Biotinylation—NR6 cells expressing wild type EGFR were retrovirally transduced with vector control MIGR1 or MIGR1-Abl-PP and serum-starved 1 day after infection. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. EGFR internalization was stopped by placing the cells at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in 1× PBS, and a solution with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link NHSSS-Biotin (Pierce) was added for 15 min. Unreacted biotin was quenched by the addition of 50 mm glycine, and cells were lysed in 1× NETN Buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with the addition of inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,300 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After quantification of protein concentration with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), equal amounts of protein were used to pull down the cell-surface biotinylated product with Tetralink Tetrameric Avidin Resin, Promega V2591. Subcellular Fractionation—COS7 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and subjected to EGF stimulation 48 h after transfection at the indicated time points. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and scraped in Hypotonic Buffer C (10 mm HEPES-K, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm NaEGTA), which was supplemented with inhibitors as described above. Resuspended cells were placed at -80 °C for 30 min and thawed (twice) in order to break down the membrane fraction. Cell suspensions were spun at 14,300 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) from the pellet containing the membrane fraction. Pellets were resuspended in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 1 mm EGTA) with the addition of the inhibitors described above. Protein concentration was quantified as described above. The purity of the fractions was analyzed by Western blotting for ERK1 in the cytosolic fraction and transferrin receptor in the membrane fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and Western-blotted for the proteins of interest. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitations—For phosphorylation experiments cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated in modified RIPA buffer with inhibitors (described above). To analyze Cbl/EGFR interactions, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) with the combination of inhibitors described above and the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm). In both cases, lysates were rotated for 20 min at 4 °C prior to centrifugation for 10 min at 14,300 rpm in a microcentrifuge also at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were utilized for immunoprecipitations, incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h (or overnight for the EGFR) and protein G-Sepharose beads (protein A-Sepharose for the EGFR) (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, before washing three times in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in 2× SDS-sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. All quantifications for protein levels were carried out with the LICOR Biosciences Odyssey Infrared Imaging software version 2. Kinase-active Abl Inhibits Ligand-induced EGFR Internalization in COS7 Cells—We utilized COS7 cells to examine whether Abl kinases could affect EGFR internalization. To observe the internalization of the endogenous EGFR, cells were serum-starved, stimulated with EGF for 15 min, and EGF-containing EGFR complexes were analyzed by immunostaining for EGF (Fig. 1A). Expression of kinase-active Abl (Abl-PP) inhibited EGFR endocytosis (Fig. 1A, center, arrow). In contrast, EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis proceeded normally in untransfected cells (Fig. 1A, center, arrowhead), vector-transfected cells, and in cells expressing kinase-inactive Abl (Abl-KM) (Fig. 1A, left and right panels). It has been shown that upon EGF stimulation, EGF·EGFR complexes are targeted for degradation (31Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam E. Oved E. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 32Dikic I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1178-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Abl-PP affected the levels of EGFR upon EGF stimulation, we examined the total amount of endogenous EGFR protein in COS7 cells before and after EGF stimulation in the absence or presence of Abl-PP. COS7 cells expressing Abl-PP had higher levels of total EGFR upon addition of EGF at all time points examined (30-90 min) compared with vector-transfected cells, as analyzed by Western blotting for the EGFR (Fig. 1B). These data show that Abl-PP inhibits EGFR endocytosis and leads to an increase in the cellular levels of EGFR after EGF binding. To further examine the role of Abl in EGFR endocytosis, rhodamine-labeled EGF was used to track endogenous EGFR internalization in the presence of wild type and active forms of the Abl kinase. Expression of two different Abl kinase-active mutants, AblP131L and AblPP, resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cells with internalized EGFR (50%) compared with vector-transfected cells (84%) (Fig. 1C). Expression of kinase-active Src (Src527F), previously shown to lead to the accumulation of EGFR at the cell surface (33Bao J. Gur G. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), caused a slight reduction of EGFR endocytosis (Fig. 1C). As expected, expression of Dyn K44A, a known inhibitor of endocytosis (2Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), reduced EGFR internalization to a level (40%) that was comparable with that induced by activated Abl kinase expression. Expression of wild type Abl (Abl-WT) also reduced EGFR internalization (Fig. 1C). The total tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing Abl-WT, as well as AblP131L and Abl-PP, was markedly higher compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in mediating the Abl effect on EGFR endocytosis. To analyze surface levels of EGFR, NR6 cells that are devoid of endogenous EGFR were used in cell-surface biotinylation experiments after retroviral transduction with wild type receptor (EGFR-WT) (Fig. 2). Expression of Abl-PP resulted in a significant increase in surface levels of EGFR after EGF stimulation. Analysis of four independent experiments showed that active Abl kinase effectively inhibits ligand-dependent EGFR endocytosis and that this effect is statistically significant (Fig. 2B). Additionally, we analyzed the rate of EGFR internalization for three independent experiments, and we observed a significant decrease in the surface EGFR after 30 min of EGF treatment in control but not in activated Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). The inhibition of EGFR endocytosis by Abl-PP was also observed by analysis of cell-surface biotinylation in COS7 (supplemental Fig. S1) and 293T cells (data not shown). Thus, oncogenic Abl-PP inhibits EGFR endocytosis in multiple cell lines. Abl Phosphorylates the EGFR—To define the mechanism whereby the activated Abl kinase inhibits EGFR internalization, we first analyzed whether Abl could phosphorylate the EGFR and whether direct EGFR phosphorylation by Abl might regulate receptor internalization. Abl kinases are activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGFR and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) (18Plattner R. Kadiec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 19Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G. Nature. 2006; 439: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Following activation by ligand-bound PDGFR, Abl has been shown to phosphorylate the PDGFR (27Plattner R. Koleske A.J. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2573-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Abl kinases are similarly engaged in bidirectional signaling with the EGFR. Addition of EGF promoted an increase in molecular weight in the band corresponding to endogenous EGFR, which correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Expression of Abl-PP resulted in an increase in the molecular weight of the endogenous EGFR in the absence of EGF (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lane 3), which was similar to that induced by EGF binding. The shift in mobility is suggestive of Abl-dependent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Analysis of the total phosphotyrosine levels showed that the increased EGFR molecular weight was coincident with higher total tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of Abl-PP (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Because the EGFR itself is a tyrosine kinase and can be autophosphorylated, we utilized a kinase-defective EGFR construct (EGFR-KD) to analyze whether Abl phosphorylates the EGFR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-KD increased upon expression of Abl-WT and was further enhanced by expression of activated Abl-PP (Fig. 3B). No tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR-KD was observed in the presence of the kinase-defective Abl-KM. As reported previously, EGFR-KD phosphorylation was greatly enhanced upon Src-527F overexpression (Fig. 3B). The Abl-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR-KD was independent of the endogenous EGFR present in 293T cells as increasing doses of an EGFR-selective inhibitor AG1478 did not affect EGFR-KD tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of Abl-PP (Fig. 3C). Abl Phosphorylates the EGFR Primarily at Tyrosine 1173—The cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR contains a number of tyrosines that upon phosphorylation lead to differential recruitment of signaling partners (34Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), including Abl (19Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G.

https://openalex.org/W2039566040,"The plasma membrane 5-HT transporter (SERT) is the major protagonist in regulating extracellular 5-HT concentration and constitutes the target of drugs used to treat a host of metabolic and psychiatric disorders. The exact mechanisms sustaining SERT function still remain elusive. The present work exploits the properties of the 1C11 neuroectodermal progenitor, which acquires, upon 4 days of differentiation, a functional SERT within an integrated serotonergic phenotype to investigate regulatory mechanisms involved in SERT onset and functions. We show that poly(A) addition precedes SERT mRNA translation on day 2 of the serotonergic program. The newly translated transporter molecules immediately bind cocaine. Day 4 must be awaited to monitor antidepressant recognition and 5-HT uptake. Because external 5-HT reduces both 5-HT transport and SERT antidepressant binding, we identify 5-HT(2B) receptors as key players in controlling the overall 5-HT transport system. In the absence of external 5-HT, 5-HT(2B) receptor coupling to NO production ensures SERT phosphorylation to basal level and maximal 5-HT uptake. In the presence of 5-HT, the 5-HT(2B) receptor-PKC coupling promotes additional phosphorylations of both SERT and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit, impairing the electrochemical gradient necessary to 5-HT uptake. SERT hyperphosphorylation also affects antidepressant recognition. Finally, such 5-HT(2B) receptor-mediated control of SERT activity operates in primary neurons from raphe nuclei. Altogether, our data shed new light on the 5-HT-driven post-translational modifications involved in the control of SERT activity."
https://openalex.org/W2066737433,"We previously demonstrated that type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C) Ptc2 and Ptc3 are required for DNA checkpoint inactivation after DNA double-strand break repair or adaptation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show the conservation of this pathway in mammalian cells. In response to DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates the Chk2 tumour suppressor kinase at threonine 68 (Thr68), allowing Chk2 kinase dimerization and activation by autophosphorylations in the T-loop. The oncogenic protein Wip1, a PP2C phosphatase, binds Chk2 and dephosphorylates phospho-Thr68. Consequently, Wip1 opposes Chk2 activation by ATM after ionizing irradiation of cells. In HCT15 colorectal cancer cells corrected for functional Chk2 activity, Wip1 overexpression suppressed the contribution of Chk2 to the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. These results indicate that Wip1 is one of the phosphatases regulating the activity of Chk2 in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2036693225,"Mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through an unknown gain-of-function mechanism. Mutant SOD1 aggregation may be the toxic property. In fact, proteinaceous inclusions rich in mutant SOD1 have been found in tissues from the familial form of ALS patients and in mutant SOD1 animals, before disease onset. However, very little is known of the constituents and mechanism of formation of aggregates in ALS. We and others have shown that there is a progressive accumulation of detergent-insoluble mutant SOD1 in the spinal cord of G93A SOD1 mice. To investigate the mechanism of SOD1 aggregation, we characterized by proteome technologies SOD1 isoforms in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of spinal cord from G93A SOD1 mice at different stages of the disease. This showed that at symptomatic stages of the disease, part of the insoluble SOD1 is unambiguously mono- and oligoubiquitinated, in spinal cord and not in hippocampus, and that ubiquitin branches at Lys(48), the major signal for proteasome degradation. At presymptomatic stages of the disease, only insoluble unmodified SOD1 is recovered. Partial ubiquitination of SOD1-rich inclusions was also confirmed by immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analysis of lumbar spinal cord sections from symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. On the basis of these results, we propose that ubiquitination occurs only after SOD1 aggregation and that oligoubiquitination may underline alternative mechanisms in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2050590566,"The maintenance of cellular levels of free fatty acids and acyl-CoAs, the activated form of free fatty acids, is extremely important, as imbalances in lipid metabolism have serious consequences for human health. Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesterases (ACOTs) hydrolyze acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and CoASH, and thereby have the potential to regulate intracellular levels of these compounds. We previously identified and characterized a mouse ACOT gene cluster comprised of six genes that apparently arose by gene duplications encoding acyl-CoA thioesterases with localizations in cytosol (ACOT1), mitochondria (ACOT2), and peroxisomes (ACOT3-6). However, the corresponding human gene cluster contains only three genes (ACOT1, ACOT2, and ACOT4) coding for full-length thioesterase proteins, of which only one is peroxisomal (ACOT4). We therefore set out to characterize the human genes, and we show here that the human ACOT4 protein catalyzes the activities of three mouse peroxisomal ACOTs (ACOT3, 4, and 5), being active on succinyl-CoA and medium to long chain acyl-CoAs, while ACOT1 and ACOT2 carry out similar functions to the corresponding mouse genes. These data strongly suggest that the human ACOT4 gene has acquired the functions of three mouse genes by a functional convergent evolution that also provides an explanation for the unexpectedly low number of human genes."
https://openalex.org/W2070198792,"The liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that have been implicated in lipid metabolism and inflammation. LXRs also inhibit the expression of inflammatory genes in macrophages, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Some of these actions are mediated through LXR antagonism of NF-κB activity. The potential for LXRs to positively regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules, however, has not been explored. Here we show that the arginase II (ArgII) gene is a direct target for LXR regulation. ArgII catalyzes the conversion of l-arginine into l-ornithine and urea, leading to the synthesis of polyamines. Expression of ArgII is induced by LXR agonists in macrophage cell lines and primary murine macrophages in a receptor-dependent manner. The ArgII promoter contains a functional LXR response elements that mediates promoter induction by LXR/RXR (retinoid X receptor) in transfection assays. Since ArgII and iNOS utilize a common substrate, induction of ArgII expression has the potential to exert anti-inflammatory effects by shifting arginine metabolism toward polyamine synthesis at the expense of NO production. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that forced expression of ArgII mimics the inhibitory effect of LXR activation on macrophage NO production.

The ability of LXR ligands to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in mice is likely to result, at least in part, from the promotion of the macrophage cholesterol efflux pathway (9Tontonoz P.

Ligand activation of LXRs negatively regulates macrophage inflammatory gene expression. For example, genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), COX-2, and MMP-9 are induced in macrophages exposed to bacterial components or pro-inflammatory cytokines but can be repressed by activation of LXRs (11Joseph S.B.

These actions are observed in macrophages lacking either LXRα or LXRβ but not in Lxrαβ–/–cells, suggesting that both receptors can mediate the anti-inflammatory activity of LXR agonists. Currently, the mechanism by which LXRs repress inflammatory gene expression is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that LXRs inhibit the action of NF-κB on promoters of inflammatory genes encoding factors such as COX-2 and MMP-9. However, the potential for LXR to up-regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules has not been explored.Previous studies have also revealed the existence of cross-talk between Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and LXR (13Castrillo A.

The TLR family of proteins recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns and triggers a potent antimicrobial response through NF-κB and IRF families of transcription factors (14Beutler B.

Viral or bacterial components such as double-stranded RNA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acting through TLR3 or TLR4 antagonize the expression of LXR target genes in macrophages. TLR-LXR cross-talk is mediated by the viral response transcription factor IRF3, which inhibits LXR activity through an undefined mechanism (13Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Vaidya S.A. Haberland M.

This process metabolizes excess nitrogen in the liver and prevents accumulation of the more toxic product ammonia. Two forms of arginase, known as arginase I and II (ArgI and ArgII), are encoded by different genes and are found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively (15Cederbaum S. Yu H. Grody W. Kern R. Yoo P. Iyer R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 81: S38-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ArgI is mainly expressed in the liver, whereas ArgII is primarily expressed in kidney and prostate, and to a lesser extent, in immune cells such as macrophages (16Mori M. Gotoh T. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both ArgI and ArgII convert l-arginine into l-ornithine. In extrahepatic tissues that lack the urea cycle, this process provides the substrate for synthesis of polyamines such as spermine and spermidine (17Iyer R. Yoo P. Kern R. Rozengurt N. Tsoa R.

Corraliza I. Link F. Soler G. Eichmann K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 20Bronte V. Zanovello P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar); however, their precise role in inflammatory signaling is poorly understood. One potential mechanism for arginase involvement in inflammation is through competition with iNOS for the common substrate arginine. Studies have suggested that arginase and iNOS have reciprocal activities that may shift nitrogen metabolism to either polyamine homeostasis or cytotoxic NO production, respectively (16Mori M. Gotoh T. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chang C. Liao J. Kuo L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 342-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, altering the expression of arginase and iNOS has the potential to alter inflammatory signaling within the macrophage. Here we demonstrate that the ArgII gene is a direct target for regulation by LXR in macrophages. We also provide evidence that regulation of ArgII expression contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of LXR in this cell type.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Plasmids—The specific LXR agonists GW3965 and T0901317 were provided by Tim Willson and Jon Collins (GlaxoSmithKline).

Plasmids expressing full-length murine LXRα, an AF-2 domain deletion mutant of LXRα (amino acids 1–435, LXRαAF2), full-length LXRα fused to the VP16 activation domain (LXRα-VP16), full-length LXRβ, and ArgII were subcloned into the pBabe retroviral system and packaged into retrovirus by transfection into Phoenix A cells. RAW cells were infected with retrovirus to produce stably transfected cell lines. Cells were selected using 6 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week.Cell Culture—Macrophage cell lines RAW264.7, RAW-vector, RAW-LXRα, LXRα-ΔAF2, LXRα-VP16, RAW-LXRβ, and RAW-ArgII cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary peritoneal macrophages were obtained from thioglycollate-injected mice as described (24Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific). Macrophages were derived from LXRαβ+/+ and LXRαβ–/– mice (Sv129/C57bl/6 background), provided by David Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern) and were maintained on standard chow under pathogen-free conditions. Wild type mice C57/B6 control mice and IRF3–/– mice on a C57/B6 background were provided by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (University of Tokyo) and Genhong Cheng (UCLA). Macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free, Sigma) before stimulation with LXR ligands and inflammatory products.Enzymatic Activities—iNOS activity was determined as accumulation of nitrite and nitrate in the culture medium by a colorimetric assay with Griess reagent as described (25Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Supernatant of cultured cells was collected after 18–24 h of inflammation. Equal amounts of supernatant and Griess reagent were combined and read on a spectrophotometer at 540 nm. Values were referred to a standard curve. COX-2 activity was measured as PGE2 accumulation in the culture media with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Arginase activity was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously by Corraliza et al. (26Corraliza I. Campo M. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol.

Antisera to LXRα was a gift of Jae Bum Kim (Seoul National University).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Transient Transfections—The following oligonucleotides corresponding to an LXR binding site were used (one strand shown): wild type 5′-GATATAGTTGGCCTCTAGTAACCAGTGCTCTT-3′ and mutant 5′-GATATAGTTGGAATCTAGTAATTAGTGCTCTT-3′. Oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled using Klenow enzyme (Promega). In vitro translation of pCMX-RXRα was generated using a TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system from Promega. Purified bacterially expressed LXRα protein and in vitro translated RXRα were combined with labeled DNA and incubated with 100 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/μl poly(dI:dC). Protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Competition assays using unlabeled wild type and mutant oligonucleotides were performed and used in 20-, 100-, or 200-fold excess. Transient transfections of 293T cells were performed in triplicate using calcium phosphate. 5 × 104 cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected 24 h later. Reporter plasmids (100 ng/well), receptor plasmids (25–50 ng/well), β-galactosidase plasmid (25 ng/well), and empty pCMX plasmids (to a total of 350 ng/well) were transfected overnight. Transfected cells were treated with LXR ligand the following day for 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.RESULTSPrevious work has shown that LXRs down-regulate the expression of inflammatory genes in macrophages (11Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 12Castrillo A. Joseph S.B. Marathe C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10443-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify direct LXR target genes that may contribute to these effects, we performed transcriptional profiling on RAW264.7 cells that overexpressed LXRα or LXRβ (RAW-LXRα or RAW-LXRβ) cells. These studies suggested that ArgII expression was induced in cells expressing LXRs, whereas expression of the related ArgI gene was not changed (data not shown). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression confirmed the induction of ArgII and Abca1 expression by synthetic LXR ligand (T1317, 1 μm) and/or RXR ligand (LG268, 50 nm) in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1A). ArgII was up-regulated in cells treated with LXR ligand, and an additive effect was observed when both LXR and RXR ligands were present. Interestingly, induction of ArgII was more prominent in cells expressing LXRα as compared with those expressing LXRβ. LXR agonist was unable to induce expression of ArgII in RAW264.7 cells expressing a truncated form of LXRα lacking the AF2 activation domain (LXRα-ΔAF2). On the other hand, expression of a constitutively active VP16-LXRα receptor induced expression of ArgII even in the absence of synthetic LXR agonist (GW3965, Fig. 1B). Induction of ArgII expression was observed as early as 6 h after ligand addition, suggestive of a primary effect of this nuclear receptor (Fig. 1C). To confirm that regulation of ArgII by LXR also occurred in primary macrophages, we treated thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with LXR and RXR ligands. As shown in Fig. 1D, LXR ligands also increased ArgII expression in primary macrophages, although the magnitude of this response was smaller than in RAW264.7 cells. We have not observed significant changes in ArgII expression in response to LXR ligands in limited studies of human monocyte-derived macrophages (data not shown).Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of ArgI and ArgII is regulated by Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and endotoxin (LPS) in macrophages (29Hesse M.

Up-regulation of arginase activity under these circumstances is associated with down-regulation of the inflammatory response. We tested the effect of a combination of LPS and LXR agonist on ArgII expression in macrophages obtained from WT and Lxrαβ–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of LXR and RXR agonist induced ArgII protein expression in WT macrophages, whereas this induction was not observed in Lxrαβ–/– macrophages. Expression of ABCA1 is shown as a control for LXR activation. LPS stimulation promoted ArgII expression in both WT and double knockout macrophages. Interestingly, stimulation with LPS in the presence of LXR/RXR agonists further induced ArgII expression in WT macrophages but not in LXRαβ–/– macrophages. Together, these results indicate that the ArgII gene is responsive to the LXR pathway in macrophages.FIGURE 2ArgII protein expression is regulated by LXR in primary mouse macrophages. Thioglycollate-elicited wild type and LXRαβ–/– murine peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with vehicle or GW3965 (1 μm) and LG268 (50 nm) (GW/LG) overnight. Cells were then stimulated with LPS for another 18 h. ArgII and ABCA1 protein were detected by Western blotting. ctrl, control; ns, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we analyzed the DNA sequence of the ArgII promoter for binding sites for LXR/RXR heterodimers. A potential DR4 sequence (direct repeat with a four-nucleotide spacer) was identified 942 bp upstream of the transcription start site in the ArgII promoter (Fig. 3A). We tested the ability of LXRα and RXRα protein to bind to an oligonucleotide containing this element using electromobility shift assays. We observed LXR/RXR heterodimer binding to the ArgII LXRE but not to a mutated version of this element (Fig. 3B, left). Furthermore, the addition of LXRα antisera inhibited binding and resulted in formation of a supershifted complex. Finally, complex formation was competed by an excess of unlabeled ArgII LXRE but not the mutated version (Fig. 3B, right). These data indicate that LXR/RXR heterodimers bind directly to the ArgII promoter.FIGURE 3LXR/RXR heterodimers bind to a DR4 site on the ArgII promoter. A, wild type and mutant LXR DR4 binding sites 942 bp upstream of the ArgII transcription start site. B, an electromobility shift assay was performed using labeled oligonucleotides to either the wild type or the mutant LXR DR4 sites, purified LXRα protein, and in vitro translated RXRα protein. An antibody to LXRα was used, and a supershift is seen. Unlabeled wild type or mutant LXR DR4 oligonucleotides were used as competitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed transient transfection assays to test the functional importance of this element for ArgII promoter regulation. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed containing ArgII promoter sequences from –942 bp to –12 bp (that contain the LXRE) or from –916 bp to –12 bp (in which the LXRE has been deleted at the 5′ end). These constructs were transiently transfected into 293T cells along with expression vectors for LXRα and RXRα. Following transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or LXR agonist GW3965 as indicated. As expected, the empty luciferase vector was not affected by LXR expression or ligand (not shown), whereas a reporter driven by multiple consensus LXREs was highly induced (Fig. 4). The –942-bp ArgII promoter construct containing the LXRE was transactivated by LXRα/RXRα in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4). By contrast, the –916-bp construct lacking the LXRE showed minimal responsiveness to transfection of LXR. These data indicate that the ArgII promoter is a direct target for regulation by LXR/RXR heterodimers.FIGURE 4LXR/RXR heterodimers activate the ArgII promoter. 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild type and mutant LXR DR4 reporter plasmids along with LXR and RXR expression plasmids. Cells were then treated with either vehicle or GW3965 (1 μm) for 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were averaged for each point. DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work has shown that LXR activation inhibits iNOS expression and NO production in macrophages. Both iNOS and ArgII utilize arginine to synthesize either nitric oxide or polyamines, respectively. Given that ArgII and iNOS utilize a common substrate for which they can compete, we investigated whether induction of ArgII by LXR in macrophages might contribute to suppression of NO production. First, we performed gain of function assays in which RAW264.7 cells were engineered to overexpress either LXRα or ArgII (RAW-LXRα or RAW-ArgII, Fig. 5A). These two cell lines and a control RAW-vector cell line were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of GW3965 (1 μm). The control and RAW-LXRα cells produced greater amounts of nitrite in the presence of LPS, indicating that iNOS activity was induced (Fig. 5B). Treating these cells with LXR ligand (GW3965) significantly inhibited iNOS activity. As expected, the effect of ligand was more pronounced in RAW-LXRα cells. Expression of ArgII in RAW cells was sufficient to reduce LPS-stimulated nitrite accumulation to a level similar to that observed in LXR agonist-treated cells. These data suggest that expression of ArgII shifts nitrogen use away from the iNOS pathway and demonstrate that ArgII expression mimics the effects of LXR activation on macrophage NO production.FIGURE 5ArgII expression in RAW cells inhibits NO production. A, RAW264.7 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors to create stable cell lines overexpressing either LXRα or ArgII. Overexpression of ArgII was confirmed by Western blot. B, cells were first treated with GW3965 (1 μm) for 18–24 h and then treated with LPS for 24 h. LPS treatments were either 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml. Nitrite production was detected by colorimetric assay using Griess reagent to determine iNOS activity. DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To rule out the possibility that expression of ArgII in RAW cells led to a global or nonspecific inhibition of inflammatory responses, we compared the effect of ArgII expression on iNOS and COX-2 activity. Similar to the previous results, RAW-ArgII cells produced less nitrite than RAW-control cells in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 6A). However, media levels of the COX-2 product PGE2 were identical between cultures of LPS-treated RAW-vector and RAW-ArgII cells. We further established that reduced NO production in RAW-ArgII cells was not a consequence of decreased iNOS mRNA (not shown) or protein expression (Fig. 6B). iNOS and COX-2 protein were equivalently induced by LPS in RAW-vector and RAW-ArgII cells as determined by Western blotting.FIGURE 6ArgII inhibits nitrite production but does not affect PGE2 production. A, stable RAW-vector and RAW-ArgII cell lines were stimulated with LPS at concentrations of 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml. Nitrite production was detected by colorimetric assay using Griess reagent. PGE2 accumulation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine COX-2 activity. B, iNOS, COX-2, ArgII, and β-actin protein levels were measured by Western blot in RAW-vector or RAW-ArgII stimulated by LPS at concentrations of 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml. ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we addressed whether the ability of ArgII to inhibit NO production in macrophages was dependent on the nature of the inflammatory stimulus. In addition to LPS, ligands for other TLRs are potent inducers of NO production in macrophages (32Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4690) Google Scholar). We examined NO production in control and RAW-ArgII cells in response to treatment with ligands for TLR2 (lipoteichoic acid and PGN), TLR3 (poly(I:C)), TLR9 (CpG), or TLR4 (LPS). Control RAW cells produced greater amounts of nitrite as compared with RAW-ArgII cells in response to every stimulus (Fig. 7A). By contrast, production of PGE2 in response to TLR ligands was equivalent in RAW-vector and RAW-ArgII cells (Fig. 7B). Collectively, the data presented above strongly suggest that the decrease in NO production in RAW-ArgII cells is not due to decreased iNOS protein expression or to inhibition of a specific TLR signaling pathway but rather to competition for limiting substrate and a shift in nitrogen metabolism. Furthermore, these studies suggest that LXR-dependent arginase activity constitutes an anti-inflammatory mechanism in macrophages that functions to limit TLR-stimulated inflammatory signaling.FIGURE"
https://openalex.org/W2132221280,"Abstract Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibiting increased malignant phenotypes. It has also been known that the hepatitis Bx (HBx) protein is strongly associated with HCC development and progression. Although overexpression of both proteins is related to HCC, the relationship between the two has not been well studied. Here we show that HBx up-regulates cyclin D1 and that this process is mediated by the NF-κB2(p52)/BCL-3 complex. Our experiments indicate that HBx up-regulates BCL-3 in the mRNA level, which subsequently results in the up-regulation of the NF-κB2(p52)/BCL-3 complex in the nucleus. Moreover, impaired HBx-mediated BCL-3 up-regulation by small interfering RNA for BCL-3 reduced HBx-mediated cyclin D1 up-regulation. Down-regulation of the HBx protein level by p53 also reduced HBx-mediated cyclin D1 up-regulation. From these results, we conclude that the up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HBx is mediated by the up-regulation of NF-κB2(p52)/BCL-3 in the nucleus. This HBx-mediated-cyclin D1 up-regulation might play an important role in the HBx-mediated HCC development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W1989662265,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) decrease the production of cytokine and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, which are associated with aging-related inflammation and insulin resistance. Recently, the involvement of the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in regulating inflammation has been suggested, but the exact mechanisms for reducing inflammation by HO-1 remains unclear. We found that overexpression of HO-1 and [Ru(CO)(3)Cl(2)](2), a carbon monoxide (CO)-releasing compound, increased not only ERK5 kinase activity, but also its transcriptional activity measured by luciferase assay with the transfection of the Gal4-ERK5 reporter gene. This transcriptional activity is required for coactivation of PPARdelta by ERK5 in C2C12 cells. [Ru(CO)(3)Cl(2)](2) activated PPARdelta transcriptional activity via the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by ERK5 activation was reversed by a dominant negative form of PPARdelta suggesting that ERK5/PPARdelta activation is required for the anti-inflammatory effects of CO and HO-1. Based on these data, we propose a new mechanism by which CO and HO-1 mediate anti-inflammatory effects via activating ERK5/PPARdelta, and ERK5 mediates CO and HO-1-induced PPARdelta activation via its interaction with PPARdelta."
https://openalex.org/W1975479842,"Cardiac myocyte apoptosis during ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is tightly controlled by a complex network of stress-responsive signaling pathways.

In another report, mice with a heterozygous null mutation of p38α MAPK were found to be less susceptible to cardiac myocyte apoptosis during I/R (12Otsu K. Yamashita N. Nishida K. Hirotani S.

NO, which is produced by all three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms in the heart, is another important modulator of cardiac myocyte apoptosis during I/R (13Schulz R. Kelm M. Heusch G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Jones S.P. Bolli R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although toxic concentrations of NO can promote cardiac myocyte apoptosis via the formation of nitrosative stress (15Arstall M.A. Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Kelly R.A. Circ.

Rev. 2002; 7: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a large body of evidence indicates that NO, when produced endogenously or supplied exogenously in lower concentrations, represents an important defense mechanism against I/R injury (14Jones S.P. Bolli R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 40: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For example, pharmacological inhibition of NOS has been shown to promote apoptosis in neonatal cardiac myocytes and in isolated hearts during simulated I/R (17Weiland U. Haendeler J. Ihling C.

Girod W.G. Palazzo A.J. Granger D.N. Grisham M.B. Jourd'Heuil D. Huang P.L. Lefer D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1567-H1573PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zingarelli B. Hake P.W. Yang Z. O'Connor M.

The protective effects appear to be mediated, in part, by soluble guanylyl cyclase activation and cGMP formation, although the mechanisms downstream from cGMP remain incompletely understood (23Agullo L.

PKG I belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family and is composed of three functional domains; the N-terminal domain, which comprises a leucine-isoleucine zipper motif; the regulatory domain that encompasses tandem cGMP-binding sites; and the C-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the MgATP- and peptide-binding pockets (31Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The N terminus (the first 90-100 amino acid residues) of PKG I is encoded by two alternatively spliced exons, thus giving rise to PKG Iα, which is predominantly expressed in cardiac myocytes (29Wollert K.C.

Upon cGMP binding, PKG I undergoes a conformational change that releases the inhibition of the catalytic center by the N terminus to allow phosphorylation of substrate proteins (31Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that cGMP activation of PKG I protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis during I/R injury in vitro and in vivo, at least in part, by inhibiting p38 MAPK activation. This inhibition involves the binding of cGMP-activated PKG I, via its N terminus, to p38 MAPK, thereby interfering with TAB1-mediated p38 MAPK autophosphorylation. Materials—The PKG-selective cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP was purchased from BioLog, the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) was from Biotrend, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture, Adenoviral Infection, and Plasmid Transfection—Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) by Percoll density gradient centrifugation and plated in DMEM/medium 199 (4:1), supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in gelatin-coated culture dishes (Nunc) at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 (29Wollert K.C.

The next morning, the medium was replaced by DMEM/medium 199 supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics only (maintenance medium). Cardiac myocytes were infected with replication-deficient adenoviruses (1×104 viral particles/cell, unless otherwise indicated), as described (28Fiedler B. Lohmann S.M. Smolenski A. Linnemuller S.

For plasmid transfection, HEK293 cells were plated in DMEM, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 2 mmol/liter glutamine in 6-cm plates at a density of 80-90%. HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA of various expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM.

For constructing PKG I-ΔN1-92, a PKG I mutant lacking the N-terminal 92 amino acids, a Kozak consensus sequence, and a new ATG codon were introduced by PCR upstream of Val93 of human PKG Iβ (36Meinecke M.

PKG I-ΔN1-92 cDNA was introduced into a replication-deficient adenovirus using the AdEasy XL adenoviral vector system (Stratagene) and the Adeno-X virus purification kit (BD Bioscience). Similarly, replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding human TAB1 and TAB1β were generated using TAB1 and TAB1β cDNAs that were kindly provided by Dr. Jiahuai Han (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) (9Ge B.

Expression Plasmids—PKG Iα and PKG I-ΔN1-92 cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-PKG Iα was used for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) to create three distinct leucine-isoleucine zipper mutants, LZ1A,2A (Leu12 to Ala and Ile19 to Ala), LZ3P (Leu26 to Pro) and LZ4A,5A (Ile33 to Ala and Leu40 to Ala) (33Surks H.K.

In brief, the cells were switched from maintenance medium to a buffer containing (in mmol/liter) 137 NaCl, 12 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.9 CaCl2, 4 HEPES, 10 2-deoxy-glucose, and 20 sodium lactate (pH 6.2) and were incubated at 37 °C in a hypoxia chamber (Modular Incubator Chamber-101; Billups-Rothenberg) flushed with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 (simulated ischemia). Control cells were cultured in a buffer containing (in mmol/liter) 137 NaCl, 3.8 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.9 CaCl2, 4 HEPES, 10 glucose, and 20 pyruvate (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% room air (normoxia). After 60 min, cardiac myocytes were switched back to maintenance medium and kept in 5% CO2 and 95% room air at 37 °C (simulated reperfusion). Assessment of Apoptotic Cell Death after Simulated I/R in Vitro—Cardiac myocyte apoptosis was assessed by a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science), which measures the formation of histone-associated DNA fragments (29Wollert K.C.

After nuclear counter-staining with Hoechst 33258, the number of TUNELpos nuclei with condensed nuclear chromatin was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM4000 DB) and expressed as the percentage of all Hoechstpos nuclei. In each experiment, approximately 400-500 nuclei were examined per condition. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Standard immunoblotting techniques were employed using primary antibodies against p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-MKK3/6, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2), and phospho-MAPKAPK-2 (all from Cell Signaling), TAB1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC) (41Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

For p38 MAPK immunoprecipitation, cell lysates obtained from pcDNA3-FLAG-p38α MAPK transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with 30 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), followed by immunoblotting using anti-PKG I or anti-TAB1 antibodies. Myocardial tissue and cultured cardiac myocyte lysates were incubated with the anti-TAB1 antibody or with an anti-p38 MAPK antibody (BIOSOURCE), respectively. Thereafter, 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) were added, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-p38 MAPK or anti-PKG I antibodies, respectively.

Eden M. Strelau J. Naguib M. Willenbockel C. Tongers J. Heineke J. Kotlarz D. Xu J. Molkentin J.D. Niessen H.W. Drexler H. Wollert K.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In brief, the mice were anesthetized and ventilated with enflurane (3%). A left thoracotomy was performed, and the LAD was ligated over a PE-10 polyethylene tube (ischemia); after 1 h, blood flow was re-established by removal of the tube (reperfusion). Additional mice underwent a sham operation where the suture around the LAD was not tied into a knot. The area at risk (AAR) and infarct sizes were determined 24 h after reperfusion by Evans blue and 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride staining and planimetry (40Kempf T. Eden M. Strelau J. Naguib M.

Apoptotic cardiac myocytes in the infarct border zone were quantified in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue sections by TUNEL assay (Chemicon) and Hoechst 33258 staining; cardiac myocytes were identified by anti-sarcomeric α-actinin immunostaining (Sigma) (40Kempf T.

The number of TUNELpos cardiac myocyte nuclei were determined in n = 4 transversal sections/heart and expressed as the percentage of all Hoechstpos nuclei. Ten to 15 high power fields (400 × magnification) were examined per left ventricular tissue section. All of the animal procedures were approved by our local state authorities. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. n refers to the number of mice or number of independent cardiac myocyte preparations. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation data are representative of three or more independent experiments. The differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test with Bonferroni correction. A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. cGMP-activated PKG I Protects Cardiac Myocytes from Apoptosis during Simulated I/R—To start exploring whether activation of PKG I can protect cardiac myocytes from apoptosis during I/R, we employed a well established cell culture model of simulated I/R. As shown by TUNEL and Hoechst staining and histone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, simulated ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min promoted apoptosis in neonatal cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1, A-C). We have previously analyzed the time course of the appearance of apoptosis in our cell culture model (40Kempf T. Eden M. Strelau J. Naguib M. Willenbockel C. Tongers J. Heineke J. Kotlarz D. Xu J. Molkentin J.D. Niessen H.W. Drexler H. Wollert K.C. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and have observed that cardiac myocytes undergo apoptosis primarily at the time of reperfusion, which is consistent with other data in the literature (45Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Treatment of cardiac myocytes with the NO donor SNAP (250 μmol/liter) diminished the number of TUNELpos cells and the formation of histone-associated DNA fragments after simulated I/R (Fig. 1, A-C). Because SNAP, via cGMP formation, has been shown to activate PKG I in neonatal cardiac myocytes (28Fiedler B. Lohmann S.M. Smolenski A. Linnemuller S. Pieske B. Schroder F. Molkentin J.D. Drexler H.

Indeed, the protective effects of SNAP were mimicked by 8-pCPT-cGMP (500 μmol/liter), a cell membrane-permeable, cGMP analog acting selectively on PKG I in cardiac myocyte and other cell types (29Wollert K.C.

https://openalex.org/W2079421329,"Abstract Glucosidase II (Glc'ase II) is a glycan-processing enzyme that trims two α1,3-linked Glc residues in succession from the glycoprotein oligosaccharide Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 to give Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Monoglucosylated glycans, such as Glc1-Man9GlcNAc2, generated by this process play a key role in glycoprotein quality control in the ER, because they are primary ligands for the lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). A precise analysis of the substrate specificity of Glc'ase II is expected to further our understanding of the molecular basis to glycoprotein quality control, because Glc'ase II potentially competes with CNX/CRT for the same glycans, Glc1Man7–9GlcNAc2. In this study, a quantitative analysis of the specificity of Glc'ase II using a series of structurally defined synthetic glycans was carried out. In the presence of CRT, Glc'ase II-mediated trimming from Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 stopped at Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, supporting the notion that the glycan structure delivered to the CNX/CRT cycle is Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Unexpectedly, our experiments showed that Glc1Man8(B)GlcNAc2 had nearly the same reactivity as Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, which was markedly greater than that of its positional isomer Glc1Man8(C)GlcNAc2. An analysis with glycoprotein-like probes revealed the stepwise formation of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 from Glc2Man9GlcNAc2, even in the presence of CRT. It was also shown that Glc1Man8(B)GlcNAc2 had even greater reactivity than Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 at the glycoprotein level. Moreover, inhibitory activities by nonglucosylated glycans suggested that Glc'ase II recognized the C arm (Manα1, 2Manα1, 6Man-) of high mannose-type glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2085384522,"Resensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) following prolonged agonist exposure is critical for restoring the responsiveness of the receptor to subsequent challenges by agonist. The 3′-5′ cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and serine 312 in the third intracellular loop of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) were both necessary for efficient recycling and resensitization of the agonist-internalized β1-AR (Gardner, L. A., Delos Santos, N. M., Matta, S. G., Whitt, M. A., and Bahouth, S. W. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21135-21143). Because PKA is compartmentalized near target substrates by interacting with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs), the present study was undertaken to identify the AKAP involved in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β1-AR and in its recycling and resensitization. Here, we report that Ht-31 peptide-mediated disruption of PKA/AKAP interactions prevented the recycling and functional resensitization of heterologously expressed β1-AR in HEK-293 cells and endogenously expressed β1-AR in SK-N-MC cells and neonatal rat cortical neurons. Whereas several endogenous AKAPs were identified in HEK-293 cells, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of AKAP79 prevented the recycling of the β1-AR in this cell line. Co-immunoprecipitations and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy experiments in HEK-293 cells revealed that the β1-AR, AKAP79, and PKA form a ternary complex at the carboxyl terminus of the β1-AR. This complex was involved in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the third intracellular loop of the β1-AR because disruption of PKA/AKAP interactions or small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of AKAP79 both inhibited this response. Thus, AKAP79 provides PKA to phosphorylate the β1-AR and thereby dictate the recycling and resensitization itineraries of the β1-AR. Resensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) following prolonged agonist exposure is critical for restoring the responsiveness of the receptor to subsequent challenges by agonist. The 3′-5′ cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and serine 312 in the third intracellular loop of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) were both necessary for efficient recycling and resensitization of the agonist-internalized β1-AR (Gardner, L. A., Delos Santos, N. M., Matta, S. G., Whitt, M. A., and Bahouth, S. W. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21135-21143). Because PKA is compartmentalized near target substrates by interacting with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs), the present study was undertaken to identify the AKAP involved in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β1-AR and in its recycling and resensitization. Here, we report that Ht-31 peptide-mediated disruption of PKA/AKAP interactions prevented the recycling and functional resensitization of heterologously expressed β1-AR in HEK-293 cells and endogenously expressed β1-AR in SK-N-MC cells and neonatal rat cortical neurons. Whereas several endogenous AKAPs were identified in HEK-293 cells, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of AKAP79 prevented the recycling of the β1-AR in this cell line. Co-immunoprecipitations and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy experiments in HEK-293 cells revealed that the β1-AR, AKAP79, and PKA form a ternary complex at the carboxyl terminus of the β1-AR. This complex was involved in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the third intracellular loop of the β1-AR because disruption of PKA/AKAP interactions or small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of AKAP79 both inhibited this response. Thus, AKAP79 provides PKA to phosphorylate the β1-AR and thereby dictate the recycling and resensitization itineraries of the β1-AR.

Engelhardt S. Eschenhagen T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 896-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Agonist-mediated activation of the β1-AR results in the generation of intracellular cyclic AMP and in the activation of PKA, which in turn phosphorylates numerous intracellular targets that mediate the familiar effects of β-agonists (3Xiao R.P. Zhu W. Zheng M. Chakir K. Bond R. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 358-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As a consequence of their activation, the β1-AR and other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) can undergo desensitization, which is characterized by attenuation of GPCR signaling intensity (4Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms of desensitization are numerous, but appear to be initiated by the phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied GPCR by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK), followed by uncoupling of the GPCR from its cognate G protein by β-arrestins, which culminates in the internalization or sequestration of the GPCR away from its signaling platform (5Lefkowitz R.J.

Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Internalization of the GPCR appears to produce different outcomes depending on the type of GPCR and cell line under study. For β1-AR, β2-AR, and other GPCR, internalization is a prerequisite for resensitization because intracellular trafficking and subsequent recycling of resensitized GPCR promotes their insertion into the cell membrane to maintain agonist responsiveness (1Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J.

For the δ-opioid, other GPCRs, the internalized receptors do not recycle back, instead they are retained intracellularly and later degraded either by lysosomal or proteasomal pathways (10Whistler J.L.

Recently, PKA and its putative substrate, serine at position 312 (Ser312) in the third intracellular loop (3rd IC) of the human β1-AR, were found to be critical determinants of the ability of the β1-AR to recycle and resensitize (1Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKA or mutagenesis of Ser312 to alanine (S312A) prevented the recycling and resensitization of the agonist-internalized β1-AR (1Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PKA-mediated resensitization of the β1-AR is termed “homologous resensitization” because PKA is activated through the β1-AR signaling pathway. Therefore, desensitization and resensitization of the β1-AR are orchestrated through interplay between GRK- and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of this receptor. The involvement of kinases such as GRK, PKA, PKC, and phosphatidylintositol 3-kinase in setting of the trafficking itinerary of GPCR and other cell surface proteins is well established (6Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For example, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator at Ser753 is involved in its recycling, which otherwise is impaired in cystic fibrosis (13Seibert F.S. Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Dulhanty A.M. Mathews C. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2158-2162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Likewise, PKA is involved in vasopressin-mediated translocation of the water-channel forming protein aquaporin-2 from the intracellular compartment into the plasma membrane, as well as in the trafficking of the AMPA receptor and its insertion into neuronal membranes (14Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J.

PKA is assembled as a tetramer composed of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. Eukaryotic cells express four isoforms (RI α, β, and RII α, β) of the R subunit and three isoforms (α, β, γ) of the C subunit (16Chrivia J.C. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RIα and RIIα subunits are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the expression of RIβ and RIIβ is more restricted (16Chrivia J.C. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is a kinase with broad substrate specificity that is involved in numerous biological events (17Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Science. 2005; 301: 690-696Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The fidelity of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of target proteins is regulated by spatial mechanisms that target PKA toward its substrate and by temporal mechanisms involving phosphodiesterases that degrade cyclic AMP to limit the duration of the biological effects of PKA (18Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 19Lynch M.J. Baillie G.S. Mohamed A. Li X. Maisonneuve C. Klussmann E. van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33178-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The PKA holoenzyme is targeted near potential substrates principally via RII subunit association with AKAPs (20Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Each AKAP contains a PKA binding site and a unique subcellular targeting domain that restricts its location within the cell to either unique cellular compartments or specific substrates (20Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Many AKAPs serve as organizing centers for signal transduction either by linking upstream signal generators to down-stream targets or by recruiting multiple signaling enzymes within signaling hubs (18Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 20Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether the effects of PKA on recycling of the β1-AR were dependent on PKA anchoring and identified AKAP79 as the specific AKAP involved in recycling and resensitization of the β1-AR in HEK-293 cells. Cell Cultures—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells and neuroepithelioma SK-N-MC cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK-293 and SK-N-MC cultures were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cortices from 1-day-old rats were dissociated by papain treatment, triturated through Pasteur pipettes, and suspended in media consisting of minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated at a density of 106 cells/ml (21Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 6 h, cells were washed with Neurobasal media with B27 supplement and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. Construction of FLAG-tagged or Myc-tagged β1-AR—To allow rapid assessment of cell surface expression of the β1-AR, the NH2-terminal initiator methionine was replaced either by the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or Myc (EQKLISEEDL) sequences, resulting in N-FLAG/Myc-tagged WT β1-AR. The 8-amino acid FLAG epitope sequence (between parentheses) was inserted at the NH2 terminus of the β1-AR by the polymerase chain reaction using a sense primer 5′-AAGCTT(ATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG)GGCGCGGGGGGCTCGTCCTGGGCG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CATGAATTCTACACCTTGGATTCCGAGGCGAAGCCGGG. The Myc tag sequence (between parentheses) was inserted in the NH2 terminus of the β1-AR using sense primer 5′-AAGCTTA(ATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTG)GGCGCGGGGGGCTCGTCCTGGGCG-3′ and the antisense primer described earlier. The 1.5-kb β1-AR cDNA flanked with HindIII (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites was cloned into the multiple cloning site of mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). To generate the β1-AR-(1-424) construct, the full-length β1-AR cDNA was cut with SmaI and the resulting 1.3-kb cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1. Sequences of the epitope-tagged β1-AR were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Construction of Fluorescently Tagged β1-AR, AKAP79, and RIIα Subunit—The coding sequence of the FLAG-tagged WT β1-AR was amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides to introduce a 5′ HindIII site, followed by the coding sequence and then by a 3′ BamHI site. The amplification primers for the β1-AR were: forward primer (5′-AAGCTTATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGCGCGGGGGTGCTCGTCCTGGGCG) and reverse primer (TGGATCCACCTTGGATTCCGAGGCGAAGCC). The resulting 1.5-kb HindIII-BamHI cDNA was fused in-frame 5′ to the CFP/YFP coding sequence in the pECFP-N1 and pECYFP-N1 vectors (BD Bioscience) to generate NH2-terminal fusions of the β1-AR to CFP and YFP. For AKAP79, the coding sequence of human AKAP79 was amplified by PCR using a forward primer (5′-AAGCTTATGGAAACCACAATTTCAGAA) and a reverse primer (3′-TGAATTCTGTAGAAGATTGTTTATTTT) to generate 1.6-kb HindIII-EcoRI cDNA, which was later fused into the pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. The cloned sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Mouse PKA-RIIα in the pECFP and pEYFP vectors (22Oliveria S.F. Gomez L.L. Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was provided by Mark Dell'Acqua (University of Colorado HSC, Denver, CO). Antibodies, siRNA, Peptides, and Additional Reagents—The antibodies against FLAG (M2) and Myc (9E-10) epitopes were purchased from Sigma and Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), respectively. The monoclonal antibodies to human AKAP79 and to the various subunits of PKA were from BD Bioscience. st-Ht31 and st-Ht31-pro peptides were obtained from Promega Corp. The anti-β1-AR (A-20 and V-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and the anti-rat AKAP150 antibody was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). AKAP79 siRNA (AAgagaucagcagaagguagu) corresponding to nucleotides 48-66 in human AKAP79 or its scrambled control siRNA (AAggcaacaaaggcuaaguca) and human gravin siRNA (cgaggcggcgccagacaccac) corresponding to nucleotides 161-181 or its scrambled control (ggagcgcggcgaccaacccca) were synthesized by Dharmacon Corp. (Lafayette, CO). siRNAs were transfected at a concentration of 50-100 nm into HEK-293 by the Lipofectamine 2000™ transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 2 days, cell extracts were probed for AKAP79 or gravin expression by Northern and Western blots. To determine the effect of the siRNAs on recycling of the WT β1-AR, cells stably expressing the FLAG-tagged β1-AR were transiently transfected with 100 nm of each duplex siRNA for 2 days, before conducting the confocal recycling assay described below. Acid Strip Confocal Recycling Microscopy Protocol— HEK-293 cells stably expressing the FLAG- or Myc-tagged WT β1-AR were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and serum-starved at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The receptors were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, anti-FLAG M2 IgG (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C to promote agonist-mediated receptor internalizaion. Then the cells were chilled in 4 °C Tris-buffered saline to stop endocytosis, and exposed to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 3.5) for 4 min on ice to remove antibody bound to extracellular β1-AR (1Gardner L.A.

Cultures were quickly rinsed in warm DMEM supplemented with HEPES, then incubated with 100 μm of the β-antagonist alprenolol at 37 °C for 10, 20, 30, or 45 min to establish the recycle time. After each time period, the coverslips were rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature (23Snyder E.M. Philpot B.D. Huber K.M. Dong X. Fallon J.R. Bear M.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Analysis of Immunocytochemical Data—Analyses were performed blind to the stimulation history of the culture. Microscope fields had 1-3 cells displaying generally healthy morphology. Six to 10 fields were imaged per culture and n = 10 cultures were processed per condition. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 (100 × 1.4 DIC oil immersion objective). Fluorescein isothiocyanate was excited with the 488-nm argon laser and imaged through the 520-nm long-pass emission filter. Thresholds were set by visual inspection and kept constant for each condition. Z-stacks of images were exported as TIFF files and individual sections were analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 and NIH Image 1.6 software as previously described (1Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of receptors between the membranous and intracellular compartments, a circular boundary was drawn around the inner circumference of all acid/stripped cells to define a 300-nm wide membrane delimited area (24Delos Santos N.M. Gardner L.A. White S.B. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12896-12907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity measurements were calculated in the areas outside and inside the boundary to estimate the membranous versus internal pixels. These measurements were repeated in slides with similar threshold settings in which the radii for each boundary did not differ by ±15%. Pixel intensities in the intracellular boundary (internalized β1-AR) of isoproterenol-treated cells were set arbitrarily as 100% and pixel intensities in the intracellular boundaries of alprenolol-treated cells were calculated as percent of this initial value. In confocal recycling assays, the time constants (τ) for β1-AR recycling were determined by fitting the percent internal β1-AR pixel data to a single exponential decay function from y = yo + Ae-t/τ, where yo and A are constants. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Dual Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells stably expressing the Myc-tagged β1-AR were transiently transfected with AKAP79-GFP. The cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, acid washed, and then exposed to 100 μm alprenolol for 30 min or 1 h. The coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Cy3 conjugated to 9E10 anti-Myc tag antibody and visualized by dual confocal microscopy (GFP, λex = 488 nm, λem = 505-530 BP; Cy3, λex = 543 nm, λem = 560 LP) using LSM-510 multitracking configuration. FRET Microscopy—These experiments were performed on live or fixed cells using sensitized emission and acceptor photobleaching methods, respectively (25Kenworthy A.K. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar, 26Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Double stable cell lines expressing AKAP79-CFP and β1-AR-YFP, AKAP79-YFP and RII PKA-CFP, and β1-AR-YFP and RII PKA-CFP were established. In some cases, HEK-293 cells were transfected with the desired plasmids using Lipofectamine for 24-36 h. For live cell microscopy, transiently transfected or double-stable cells were plated onto glass-bottom Petri dishes (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA) for 24 h and imaged live at room temperature. For fixed cell microscopy, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-covered coverslips for 24 h. The coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, and mounted onto glass slides in Fluoromount G mounting media (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Coverslips were sealed with clear nail polish and imaged within 24 h after fixation. Sensitized Emission FRET Microscopy—FRET was recorded using the three-channel sensitized emission mode (27Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levin B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 28Sorkin A. McClure F. Huang G. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Donor channel (CFP) was acquired using donor excitation (λ = 458 nm) and donor emission (λ = 475-525 nm) with BP filter. Acceptor channel (YFP) was acquired using acceptor excitation (λ = 514 nm) and emission (λ = 530 nm) with LP filter. FRET was acquired using excitation (λ = 458 nm) and emission (λ = 530 nm) with LP filters. Images were taken from donor, acceptor, and FRET samples. Donor and acceptor images were used to evaluate the cross-talk of signals that is caused by image settings and fluorophore properties. The same acquisition parameters were used for donor, acceptor, and FRET samples (28Sorkin A. McClure F. Huang G. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). FRET Calculations—LSM 510 FRET Macro tool was used to calculate FRETN values. FRETN is a measure of FRET that is normalized for the concentrations of donor and acceptor fluorophores and therefore represents a fully corrected measure of FRET (27Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levin B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Quantitative comparisons of different FRET methods has determined that FRETN provides the most accurate measure of FRET efficiencies (29Gu Y. Di W.L. Kelsell D.P. Zicha D. J. Microsc. 2004; 215: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this method the corrected FRET value for each pixel is calculated and then divided by concentration values for donor and acceptor (27Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levin B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). FRETN was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image and in regions of interest (marked by rectangles) using Equation 1. FRETN=FRET1Dfd×Afa∞[bound][total d]×[total a](Eq. 1) The equation indicates the proportional (∞) relationship between FRETN and the concentrations of the interacting and noninteracting species. In the equation [bound] represents the concentration of interacting pairs of donor labeled species and acceptor labeled species. The values for [total d] and [total a] represent the total concentrations (interacting and non-interacting) of the donor and acceptor labeled species, respectively. FRET1 is proportional to the FRET signal from the specimen. Dfd is the donor signal that would take place if no FRET occurred and is therefore proportional to the total concentration of donor. Afa is the acceptor signal that would take place if no FRET occurred and is therefore proportional to the total concentration of acceptor. Donor and acceptor coefficients were determined in the beginning of each experiment and kept the same throughout. Donor, acceptor, and FRET thresholds were set to determine the background value. Threshold values were subtracted from all pixels before FRET calculations. Extreme values were excluded from both, the FRET image as well as data table calculation. FRETN images are presented in pseudocolor mode. Acceptor Photobleaching FRET Microscopy—Changes in the intensity of the donor channel were observed upon complete photobleaching the acceptor (YFP) by a 514-nm argon laser (30Berney C. Danuser G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3992-4010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). During each photobleaching session, we obtained an image set consisting of time-lapse recordings of donor and acceptor channel intensities. FRET was recorded by examining the quenching of CFP during YFP photobleaching. FRET images were analyzed by the LSM FRET tool version 1.5 (AIM software release 3.2) to calculate the FRET efficiencies using selected area averages for donor CFP before and after bleaching: FRETEfficiency = (donor CFPafter bleaching - donor CFPbefore bleaching)/donor CFPafter bleaching. Thresholds were set for donor (CFP), acceptor (YFP), and FRET images at the beginning of data collection and the threshold was kept the same for the entire data analysis. FRET efficiencies (%) are presented as mean ± S.E. from 3 to 10 separate acquisition experiments on 5-10 images per experiment. Effect of Disrupting AKAP-PKA Interactions on the Recycling of the Biotinylated β1-AR in Neuronal Cells—β1-AR recycling in human neuroepithelioma SK-N-MC cells and in neonatal rat cortical neurons was measured by the loss of internalized biotinylated β1-AR. In this assay, the cells were incubated with 50 μm st-Ht31 or st-Ht-31-pro for 30 min at 37 °C to inhibit PKA-AKAP interactions. Then cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating the cells in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) for 20 min, followed by quenching of excess biotinylation reagent with glycine. Biotinylated cells were rewarmed to 37 °C in complete culture medium and exposed to isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C to induce the internalization of the β1-AR, followed by chilling of each culture dish on ice to stop membrane trafficking. The remaining surface biotin was quantitatively cleaved with glutathione cleavage buffer (50 mm glutathione in 75 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.075 n NaOH) twice for 15 min at 4 °C. Cultures were then warmed to 37 °C in complete culture medium containing 10 μm of the β-antagonist alprenolol and 10 μm of each st-Ht31 peptide for 15, 30, and 60 min to allow the internalized β1-AR to recycle back to the cell surface (1Gardner L.A.

After each time period, the cells were quickly chilled on ice and incubated for a second time with glutathione cleavage buffer to ensure complete cleavage of any newly appearing (recycled) surface biotin. Then the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2-pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors). Equal amounts of protein from these cells were mixed with 50 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked ultralink-neutra avidin beads (Pierce Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The resin was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with lysis buffer, and then extracted with 10 μl/100 μg of input protein of 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 40 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-containing 4-12% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 1:250 dilution of the anti-β1-AR antibody and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) using the Super Signal detection reagent (Pier"

IUGR rat liver is characterized by persistent changes in histone 3 lysine 9 and lysine 14 acetylation, which may induce postnatal changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that it would be possible to identify hepatic genes whose epigenetic characteristics and mRNA levels are altered due to IUGR using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with random primed differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One of the isolated sequences identified contained exon 2 of the dual specificity phosphatase-5 gene (DUSP5). IUGR affected hepatic DUSP5 mRNA levels and exon 2 DNA methylation into adulthood in the rat. DUSP5 dephosphorylates Erk1 and Erk2 within the MAPK signaling cascade, which in turn affects serine 612 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (p612 IRS-1). In adult rat liver, IUGR increased Erk1/Erk2 phosphorylation and p612 IRS-1 phosphorylation. Increased serine phosphorylation of hepatic IRS-1 may contribute to the insulin resistance that characterizes these animals. We conclude that intrauterine growth retardation induced by uteroplacental insufficiency 1) affects the hepatic epigenetic characteristics and mRNA of the DUSP-5 and 2) increases hepatic insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation at serine 612 in adult rats."

As the genes for mycothiol biosynthesis have been identified in studies using nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis, attempts were undertaken to generate the corresponding mutants in M. tuberculosis. Inactivation of the mshB gene does not fully block MSH biosynthesis because an alternative deacetylase activity leads to modest GlcN-Ins production and limited MSH synthesis in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Rawat M. Kovacevic S. Billman-Jacobe H. Av-Gay Y. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MshC is essential for MSH biosynthesis in M. smegmatis, which does not require MSH for growth (9Rawat M. Newton G.L. Ko M. Martinez G.J. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mshC gene is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis, indicating that MSH itself is essential for M. tuberculosis (21Sareen D. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Buchmeier N.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the mshD gene in M. smegmatis (22Newton G.L. Ta P. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7309-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and M. tuberculosis (23Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6245-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) does not fully prevent MSH production. In the mshD mutants low levels of MSH are produced by a chemical transacylation reaction of acetyl-CoA with Cys-GlcN-Ins that accumulates at high levels in both mutants. Another thiol, N-formyl-Cys-GlcN-Ins is also produced in the mshD mutants and functions as a poor substitute for mycothiol in some biochemical reactions. The altered thiol status is thought to be responsible for the inability of mshD mutants to survive and grow in the macrophage (24Rengarajan J. Bloom B.R. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8327-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). MshA is essential for synthesis of MSH in M. smegmatis (15Newton G.L. Koledin T. Gorovitz B. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and we have recently shown that the mshA gene is required for growth of M. tuberculosis. 3N. A. Buchmeier and R. C. Fahey, manuscript submitted. Thus, two enzymes of mycothiol biosynthesis, MshA and MshC, have been identified as potentially important TB drug targets, and a third enzyme, MshD, shows significant potential. MshA belongs to the retaining glycosyltransferase family 4 (25Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), a group that includes enzymes such as sucrose-phosphate synthase that catalyze the production of disaccharides and polysaccharides from nucleotide diphosphate and monophosphate sugar donors and sugar phosphate acceptors. MshA mutants in M. smegmatis are devoid of GlcNAc-Ins, a pseudo-disaccharide intermediate in mycothiol biosynthesis (15Newton G.L. Koledin T. Gorovitz B. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This suggests that the substrates for MshA include a nucleotide donor for the GlcNAc moiety and an inositol phosphate acceptor. UDP-GlcNAc is the source of GlcNAc for the unique linkage region of the mycobacterial cell wall (26Mikusova K. Mikus M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The possible inositol acceptors used by MshA will be constrained by the stereochemistry of the inositol moiety of GlcNAc-Ins (27Nicholas G.M. Eckman L.L. Kovac P. Otero-Quintero S. Bewley C.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 2641-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and mycothiol (3Sakuda S. Zhou Z.-Y. Yamada Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1347-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to any myo-inositol monophosphate, except 1d-Ins-1-P in which the phosphate residue blocks the known site for transfer of the GlcNAc moiety. This is the most commonly available inositol monophosphate and is produced from phosphatidyl myo-inositol with phospholipase C. In the present study we elaborate the details of the reaction catalyzed by MshA. We identify the substrates and products of the MshA-catalyzed reaction, describe a simple assay for MshA activity, and show that an additional enzyme, a phosphatase designated MshA2, is required to complete the mycothiol biosynthesis pathway. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Unless otherwise specified the reagents were reagent or higher grade from Fisher. M. smegmatis wild-type strain mc2155 and mshB mutant Myco504 (20Rawat M. Kovacevic S. Billman-Jacobe H. Av-Gay Y. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) from starter cultures were expanded to three 1-liter cultures in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.4% glucose (with 20 μg/ml kanamycin for Myco504), shaken at 250 rpm and 37 °C. The mshA mutant mshA::Tn5 (15Newton G.L. Koledin T. Gorovitz B. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) of M. smegmatis was cultured in the same medium with 20 μg/ml kanamycin. Exponential phase cultures (A600 = 0.7–1.0) were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g at 4 °C). The cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of extraction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 35 μm each of the protease inhibitors Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) and Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma). The cells were extracted at 4 °C with 4 passes through an Aminco French press. The extract was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) and the supernatant dialyzed twice against 100 volumes of extraction buffer. The extract was then centrifuged (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) to remove insoluble protein. The final extract typically contained 10–14 mg/ml protein as determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Determination of MSH, GlcN-Ins, and GlcNAc-Ins—The levels of MSH, GlcN-Ins, and GlcNAc-Ins were determined in exponential (A600 = 0.5–0.8) and stationary phase (A600 = 2.4–3.1) cultures of M. smegmatis mc2155 and mshB mutant strain Myco504 cultured as described above. Triplicate cell pellets were extracted in 50% acetonitrile containing mBBr for HPLC analysis of MSH as previously described (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Triplicate cell pellets were also extracted in 50% acetonitrile without mBBr and processed before (GlcN-Ins determination) or after (GlcNAc-Ins determination) deacetylation with MshB (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MshA Standard Assay Conditions—Unless stated otherwise, MshA assays were performed with the undiluted dialyzed cell extract using 1 mm inositol compounds and 1 mm UDP-Glc-NAc (Sigma) at 37 °C. The extracts produced stable activity (0.3–0.8 nmol/min/mg) for at least 2 weeks when stored at 4 °C. Stock solutions of the inositol compounds and UDP-GlcNAc were made at 20–50 mm in water and stored at –70 °C. UDP-GlcNAc, myo-inositol (Ins), 1d-Ins-1-P, and Ins-2-P were obtained from Sigma. 1dl-Ins-1-P was obtained from Bachem and 1l-Ins-1-P was enzymatically synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate using 1l-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (28Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as described under the supplemental materials. For a standard MshA assay, a preheated (37 °C) 250-μl sample of the extract was added to an inositol compound, followed by UDP-GlcNAc to initiate the reaction. The reaction was sampled four times by removing a 50-μl sample and adding it to 50 μl of preheated (60 °C) acetonitrile. After a 10-min incubation at 60 °C, the sample was chilled on ice and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 3 min). For the GlcN-Ins assay, 7.5 μl of the supernatant was removed for labeling by AccQ-Fluor as described previously (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Anderberg S.J. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30391-30397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To the remaining supernatant, 4 μl of 5 m ammonium formate (adjusted to pH 5 with formic acid) was added to precipitate additional protein and mildly acidify the sample for HPLC. The sample was clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 3 min), the supernatant was dried in a Savant SpeedVac, and the residual material was dissolved in 70 μl of water. A 50-μl sample was injected without dilution for HPLC analysis of UMP, UDP, and UDP-GlcNAc as detailed under the supplemental materials. Incorporation of Radiolabel from [Glucosamine-6-3H]Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine—To identify the direct product of MshA, extracts of M. smegmatis mshB mutant Myco504 (20Rawat M. Kovacevic S. Billman-Jacobe H. Av-Gay Y. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were examined for the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. This extract lacks MshB and should terminate the mycothiol biosynthetic pathway at GlcNAc-Ins. A dialyzed extract of Myco504 was prepared as described above with a protein content of 11 mg/ml. The MshA assay was conducted with 1.5 ml of preheated extract, 1 mm 1dl-Ins-1-P, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 2.5 μCi of uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, [glucosamine-6-3H] uridine disphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NET-434), in a total volume of 1.6 ml. Samples (200 μl) were removed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 150 min and added to 200 μl of acetonitrile preheated to 60 °C. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 60 °C and then iced to precipitate protein. The samples were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min) and the supernatant was removed to a separate microcentrifuge tube. For GlcN-Ins analysis an aliquot (7.5 μl) was removed and reacted with AccQ-Fluor as previously described (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The remainder of the sample was reduced in volume to less than 100 μl using a SpeedVac and diluted to a final volume of 150 μl with water. Each sample was filtered using a Microcon 30 (30 kDa, Amicon) microconcentrator to reduce the protein content. The samples (50 μl) were analyzed using program B for HPLC analysis (supplemental materials) with A260 detection for UDP-GlcNAc, UMP, and UDP. Program B was used for chromatography to identify the products of the MshA-catalyzed reaction using unlabeled reactants to allow use of mass spectral detection. One-min samples (1 ml) were collected into scintillation vials and 8 ml of Scintiverse mixture was added for counting (Beckman model 1701). For GlcNAc-Ins analysis a 20-μl sample of each extract was diluted 2-fold with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and reacted with 5 μg of purified MshB (30Newton G.L. Ko M. Ta P. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C; the sample was mixed with 1 volume of warm acetonitrile and heated at 60 °C for 10 min). The sample was clarified by centrifugation and labeled with AccQ-Fluor as above. The amount of GlcNAc-Ins was determined to be the amount of GlcN-Ins detected after reaction with MshB minus the GlcN-Ins detected in the extracts prior to MshB treatment (≤0.03 μm in all Myco504 samples). Identification of GlcNAc-Ins-3-P—The [3H]glucosamine labeling experiments above indicated the presence of a transient unknown peak (U14), which reached the maximal level in the extract at 20 min. A preparative scale sample of U14 was prepared for MshA analysis with detection of mycothiol intermediates by electrospray negative ion mass detection (ES–). A 1-ml extract of M. smegmatis Myco504 was preheated to 37 °C and incubated for 20 min with 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 1 mm 1dl-Ins-1-P. The entire reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of acetonitrile preheated to 60 °C and incubation for 10 min at 60 °C. The extract was cooled on ice, clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g), and reduced in volume to 200 μl using a SpeedVac. The extract was filtered using a Microcon 30 microconcentrator prior to HPLC. The entire sample was separated on program B chromatography (4 separate injections) and 1-min fractions were collected. The fractions from separate runs were combined and concentrated on a SpeedVac and separately analyzed by mass spectrometry in ES– mode scanning from 200 to 800 daltons. The fractions corresponding to 15 and 16 min were found to contain a m/z 462 component, consistent with GlcNAc-Ins-3-P [M–H]–. The fractions were combined, concentrated, and reinjected in one sample on the same column with the eluent monitored at m/z (single ion resonance) of 259 (Ins-1-P), 300 (GlcNAc-1-P), and 462 (GlcNAc-Ins-3-P). M. smegmatis Uptake and Incorporation of [14C]Inositol—The uptake and metabolism of [14C]inositol by M. smegmatis mc2155 was assayed using exponentially growing cells in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (see above). One ml of 30 mm myo-inositol containing 0.51 μCi of [14C]inositol (myo-[U-14C]inositol, NEC-606, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a 1-liter culture of cells (37 °C) at A600 = 0.91 to give a final inositol concentration in the medium of 30 μm at zero time. Quadruplicate samples (45 ml) were chilled on ice at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min and pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The culture density was A600 = 1.5 at 3 h, the last sampling time. Four 1-ml samples of the medium for each sampling time were mixed with 8 ml of Scintiverse scintillation mixture (Fisher) and counted for 14C content. At each sampling time, two samples were centrifuged and the pellets extracted at 60 °C in 50% acetonitrile, aqueous 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for analysis on HPLC Program A (supplemental materials). Pellets from two additional samples were extracted in 50% acetonitrile, aqueous 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm monobromobimane (mBBr, Molecular Probes) for mycothiol analysis. After centrifugation, the supernatants were removed to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each pellet was washed with 1 ml of 50% acetonitrile/water (60 °C) and the wash was discarded. The pellets were dried to a constant weight in tarred microcentrifuge tubes in a vacuum oven, weighed, and transferred to glass scintillation vials. The pellets were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.1 ml of 3.8 m NaOH to solubilize the pellet and bleach the bimane label. The pellet sample was neutralized with 0.4 ml of 6 m HCl and 16 ml of Scintiverse scintillation mixture was added for counting. [14C]Inositol-labeled thiols were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection of the mBBr derivatives as described by Koledin et al. (14Koledin T. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One-min fractions (1 ml) were collected, mixed with 8 ml of Scintiverse scintillation mixture, and counted for [14C]inositol. Unretained 14C-labeled compounds eluted at 3 min and include mycothiol biosynthesis intermediates such as inositol, GlcNAc-Ins, and GlcN-Ins that do not label with mBBr. The mycothiol-bimane derivative (MSmB) eluted at 20 min; specific activity was estimated from mycothiol content based upon fluorescence quantitation with MSmB standards and counts from the MSmB containing fractions. Substrates for MshA—Previous studies had shown that GlcNAc-Ins is an intermediate in MSH biosynthesis (12Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6958-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that the mshA gene encoding a glycosyltransferase was required for GlcNAc-Ins production in M. smegmatis (15Newton G.L. Koledin T. Gorovitz B. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). With the sequencing of the M. smegmatis genome now complete, its mshA gene can be identified as MSMEG0924. To pursue identification of the substrates of MshA we utilized the assay outlined in Scheme 1 in conjunction with cell-free extracts of M. smegmatis mc2155. Enzymatic reactions in the extract involving MshA, MshB, and possibly other unspecified enzymes generate GlcN-Ins. The amino group of GlcN-Ins was fluorescently labeled by AccQ-Fluor, allowing quantitative determination of GlcN-Ins by HPLC (7Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Anderberg S.J. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. J. Biol.

An extract of M. smegmatis mc2155 was prepared and the crude extract dialyzed to remove mycothiol and its precursors. This extract was used to test UDP-GlcNAc as the donor with various GlcNAc acceptors for production of GlcN-Ins (Fig. 2A). Endogenous MshB sufficed to fully deacetylate GlcNAc-Ins, and addition of supplemental purified MshB did not increase GlcN-Ins values. The results show that no product is generated in the absence of acceptor or with Ins as acceptor. Maximal product formation was found using commercially available 1dl-Ins-1-P as acceptor, whereas 1d-Ins-1-P and Ins-2-P produced only minor amounts of GlcN-Ins. These results suggest that UDP-GlcNAc is a donor and 1l-Ins-1-P is the optimal acceptor in the MshA-catalyzed reaction.FIGURE 2Identification of the GlcNAc acceptor of MshA. Assay for MshA activity with various substrates and different detection methods. Dialyzed, supernatant extracts of M. smegmatis mc2155 were examined with 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc and either no inositol (Δ) or 1 mm Ins (□), 1d-Ins-1-P (▿), Ins-2-P (⋄), or 1dl-Ins-1-P (○): A, assay for GlcN-Ins via derivitization of the amino group with AccQ-Fluor and analysis by HPLC provides the most sensitive and selective analysis of this intermediate; B, a portion of the same samples described in A was analyzed for the production of UDP using HPLC method A (supplemental Fig. S1).

Having confirmed that UDP-GlcNAc was a donor in the MshA-catalyzed reaction, it appeared that determination of UDP production by HPLC would be a viable way to directly measure MshA activity. An HPLC protocol was developed based upon tetrabutylammonium ion-pairing chromatography that separates various nucleotide phosphates, including UDP, as well as sugar phosphates (supplemental materials Fig. S1), and was used to confirm the findings of the GlcN-Ins assay. Sample HPLC analyses of a crude extract reaction mixture are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Fig. 2B shows that the substrate profile, as determined from UDP production on aliquots of the reaction analyzed in Fig. 2A, is qualitatively similar to that of Fig. 2A. However, the UDP assay is inherently less sensitive due to the higher background signal and UV detection. With extracts of mc2155 using 1dl-Ins-1-P as substrate, there is no lag in the production of UDP (Fig. 2B) that is seen in the production of GlcN-Ins (Fig. 2A). Because the expected initial product is GlcNAc-(α1,3)-1l-Ins-1-P, which is alternatively designated GlcNAc-(α-1,1)-1d-Ins-3-P and which we will abbreviate Glc-NAc-Ins-P, subsequent dephosphorylation and deacetylation steps are required to generate GlcN-Ins. A significant lag in GlcN-Ins production (Fig. 2A) is therefore reasonable. A similar UDP assay with extracts of a M. smegmatis mshA mutant strain mshA::Tn5 (15Newton G.L. Koledin T. Gorovitz B. Rawat M. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using 1 mm each of UDP-GlcNAc and 1dl-Ins-1-P gave a specific activity of <3 pmol min–1 mg–1, or <1% that of strain mc2155 (Fig. 2B) after subtraction of the control without 1dl-Ins-1-P. This confirms that the observed reaction is catalyzed by MshA (MSMEG0924) in the crude extract. Optimal Substrate Concentrations for Assay of MshA—To optimize sensitivity in the assay, apparent Km values were determined for UDP-GlcNAc and 1dl-Ins-1-P. The apparent Km value for UDP-GlcNAc was 0.17 ± 0.02 mm (supplemental Fig. S3A) and a Km value of 0.24 ± 0.06 mm was found for 1dl-Ins-1-P (supplemental Fig. S3B). Because the 1d-isomer is almost inactive as a substrate and comprises half of the mixture, the actual apparent Km value for 1l-Ins-1-P is estimated to be 0.12 mm. However, this assumes that the 1d-isomer has no inhibitory effect upon MshA. This was subsequently determined to be the case when it became possible to produce authentic 1l-Ins-1-P from glucose 6-phosphate using inositol-1-phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, kindly provided by Mary Roberts (28Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When the 1l- and 1dl-Ins-1-P substrates were compared at concentrations below the Km value, the former was almost twice as reactive (Fig. 3). After correcting for the background rate without inositol compounds as acceptor, the relative rates calculated at 30 min were: 1l-Ins-1-P, 100 ± 6%; 1dl-Ins-1-P, 52 ± 5%; Ins-2-P, 10 ± 3%; 1d-Ins-P, 9 ± 3%; Ins, 2 ± 6%.

https://openalex.org/W2086211835,"Substrates of the N-end rule pathway include proteins with destabilizing N-terminal residues. Three of them, Asp, Glu, and (oxidized) Cys, function through their conjugation to Arg, one of destabilizing N-terminal residues that are recognized directly by the pathway's ubiquitin ligases. The conjugation of Arg is mediated by arginyltransferase, encoded by <i>ATE1</i>. Through its regulated degradation of specific proteins, the arginylation branch of the N-end rule pathway mediates, in particular, the cardiovascular development, the fidelity of chromosome segregation, and the control of signaling by nitric oxide. We show that mouse <i>ATE1</i> specifies at least six mRNA isoforms, which are produced through alternative splicing, encode enzymatically active arginyltransferases, and are expressed at varying levels in mouse tissues. We also show that the <i>ATE1</i> promoter is bidirectional, mediating the expression of both <i>ATE1</i> and an oppositely oriented, previously uncharacterized gene. In addition, we identified GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78) and protein-disulfide isomerase as putative physiological substrates of arginyltransferase. Purified isoforms of arginyltransferase that contain the alternative first exons differentially arginylate these proteins in extract from <i>ATE1</i><sup>-/-</sup> embryos, suggesting that specific isoforms may have distinct functions. Although the N-end rule pathway is apparently confined to the cytosol and the nucleus, and although GRP78 and protein-disulfide isomerase are located largely in the endoplasmic reticulum, recent evidence suggests that these proteins are also present in the cytosol and other compartments <i>in vivo</i>, where they may become N-end rule substrates."

However, the mechanism of CSN regulatory action on cullins has been debated, since, paradoxically, the CSN has an inhibitory role in vitro, while genetic evidence supports a positive regulatory role in vivo.

Down-regulation of either subunit resulted in disruption of the CSN complex and in Cullin1 hyperneddylation. Functional consequences of CSN down-regulation were decreased protein levels of Skp2, the substrate recognition subunit of SCFSkp2, and stabilization of a Skp2 target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. CSN down-regulation caused an impairment in cell proliferation, which could be partially reversed by suppression of p27Kip1. Moreover, restoring Skp2 levels in CSN-deficient cells recovered cell cycle progression, indicating that loss of Skp2 in these cells plays an important role in their proliferation defect.

Several biochemical functions have been associated with the CSN: the complex may function as a platform that recruits protein kinases (inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate 5/6-kinase, protein kinase D and casein kinase II (7Qian X.

Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, two different ubiquitin isopeptidase activities have been associated with the CSN, one consisting in cleavage of monoubiquitin from Cullin4 (9Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), the other in the depolymerization of polyubiquitin chains. This latter activity depends on the recruitment of a conventional deubiquitinating enzyme of the cystein protease family, called Ubp12 in S. pombe (10Zhou C. Wee S. Rhee E. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 927-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or USP15 in mammalian cells (11Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P.M. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To date, the best characterized biochemical function of the CSN is an intrinsic NEDD8 isopeptidase activity that requires the Zinc protease motif (JAMM motif) of subunit 5 (CSN5) of the complex, as well as the integrity of the whole CSN complex (12Cope G.A. Suh G.S. Aravind L. Schwarz S.E. Zipursky S.L. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 13Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-like peptide NEDD8 is a post-translational modifier of cullins. Cullins assemble with a RING protein and other adaptor proteins to constitute a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the last components in the enzymatic cascade that leads to protein ubiquitination. Ubiquitin ligases are of particular importance in determining the specificity of the ubiquitination process, since they are responsible for direct substrate recognition. A well characterized cullin-based E3 is the SCF (Skp1, CDC53/cullin1, F-box) that marks several important cellular signaling proteins for destruction. The SCF can bind different substrate recognition subunits, such as the F-box protein Skp2, which recruits for ubiquitination a number of cell cycle regulators, among which the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21WAF or cyclins D1 and D3 (14Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. Cell Cycle and Development (Camb.). 2005; 16: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). NEDD8 conjugation is fundamental for cullin activity, as demonstrated by the severe impairment of cullin function upon loss of components of the neddylation pathway. Defects in the NEDD8/RUB conjugation process result in cell cycle arrest in S. pombe and developmental defects in C. elegans and mice (15Jones D. Candido E.P. Dev.

The molecular basis of the strict requirement for cullin neddylation is still debated. Neddylation is currently thought to regulate the assembly of a functional cullin complex by removing the inhibitor CAND1 and promoting interaction of Cullin1 both with the Skp1-F-box protein module (18Zheng J.

The CSN binds to a number of cullins, among which are Cullin1 (13Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Deshaies R.J.

In vitro studies have suggested that CSN-mediated removal of NEDD8 from cullin complexes reduces their ubiquitin ligase activity (9Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R.

These data are in contrast with the observed accumulation of cullin substrates in CSN-deficient organisms (4Pintard L. Kurz T. Glaser S. Willis J.H. Peter M. Bowerman B. Curr.

To resolve this paradox, current models are based on the hypothesis that a cycle of NEDD8 attachment, and removal is necessary for the association of a functional cullin-based complex (27Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Schwechheimer C. Deng X.W.

It has been further proposed that the CSN aids in stabilizing E3 complexes by counteracting proteolytic degradation of some of their components (29Wolf D.A. Zhou C. Wee S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In fission yeast csn-deletion mutants, a decrease in the levels of the Cullin3 adaptor Btb3p and of the Cullin1 adaptor Pop1p was observed (30Wee S. Geyer R.K. Toda T. Wolf D.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similarly, disruption of csn-2 in Neurospora causes a reduction of the levels of the FWD-1 F-box (31He Q. Cheng P. Liu Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1518-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicating that the CSN may promote cullin activity by maintaining adaptor stability. Gene disruption of single CSN subunits has resulted in early embryonic lethality in the mouse, precluding further investigation of the physiological role of the complex in mammalian cells (26Lykke-Andersen K.

In the present work, we have used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference to down-regulate CSN subunits in human cell lines and to study the role of the CSN in regulating SCFSkp2 function and mammalian cell proliferation. Down-regulation of CSN subunits resulted in increased p27Kip1 half-life and impaired cell proliferation. Protein levels of the substrate adaptor Skp2 were suppressed in CSN-deficient cells but could be recovered by proteasome inhibition or by iRNA-mediated Cullin1 suppression. Our data indicate that the CSN is an important regulator of proliferation in human cells and that CSN activity promotes the assembly of a functional SCF complex by regulating the stability of its F-box subunit. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293T and HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). FLAG-tagged Skp2 (from M. Donzelli, IEO, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected in HEK293T cells with the jetPEI™ reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (QBIOgene). Plasmids—The lentivirus vector pTRIP-ΔU3-CMV was provided by P. Charneau (Institut Pasteur, Paris). The green fluorescent protein coding sequence was substituted with the extracellular sequence of the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites to generate the pTCN vector. The oligonucleotides used to generate small hairpin RNA sequences were the following: control, 5′-GATCCCCGAGCATGCGTATGGACGATTCAAGAGATCGTCCATACGCAATGCTCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; siCSN4, 5′-GATCCCCGCAGATCCAATCACTTTGTTTCAAGAGAACAAAGTGATTGGATCTGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; siCSN5.1, 5′-GATCCCCGATGGTGATGCATGCCAGATTCAAGAGATCTGGCATGCATCACCATCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; siCSN5.2, 5′-GATCCCCGCTCAGAGTATCGATGAAATTCAAGAGATTTCATCGATACTCTGAGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′; sip27, 5′-GATCCCCGAGCCAACAGAACAGAAGATTCAAGAGATCTTCTGTTCTGTTGGCTCTTTTTGGAAA-3′. These oligonucleotides were cloned together with the H1 promoter from the pSuper vector (gift of R. Agami) in the EcoRI site of pTCN. All plasmid purifications were carried out using Qiagen plasmid kits. Lentivirus Production and Transduction—2 × 106 HEK293T were plated on 100-mm plates. The following day 10 μgofthe small hairpin (shRNA) vector pTCN (control, iCSN4, or iCSN5), 10 μg of the packaging vector pCMVΔ8.9, and 5 μgof the vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein envelope vector (from P. Charneau) were co-transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. The medium was changed the next day and substituted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). After 24 h supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min. For transduction, 3–5 × 105 HEK293T or HeLa cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transduced with the viral supernatant by spinoculation (30 min at 2000 rpm). To evaluate the efficiency of viral transduction, cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for NGFR expression 4 days after the infection (anti-NGFR murine monoclonal antibody clone 20.4). If less than 95% positive for NGFR expression, transduced cells were purified by positive selection using the CD271 (LNGFR) MicroBead kit (Miltenyi Biotec). All experiments were performed 5–10 days after transduction. Cell Lysate and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and Pefabloc-SC (Roche Applied Science)). Protein content of the supernatant were measured by colorimetric reaction (Bradford, Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the appropriate antibodies, followed by detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Western blotting, Pierce). For protein stability studies transduced cells were treated with 60 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated times and lysed in RIPA buffer. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors was as follows: MG132 (Sigma), 20 μm for 8 h, lactacystin (Sigma), 10 μm for 4 h; or MG262 (Alexis), 1 μm for 4 h. The following antibodies were used for this study: anti-CSN4 (A300-013A) antibody was from Bethyl Laboratories; cyclin D1 (72–13G, sc-450 and M-20, sc-718) and p27 (C-19, sc-528) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-CSN1 (PW 8285), CSN3 (PW 8235), CSN6 (PW 8295), and CSN8 (PW 8290) antibodies were from Affiniti; anti-Cullin1 (71–8700) and p45 SKP2 (32–3300) antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories; anti-NEDD8 (ALX-210-194) and anti-proteasome 20 S subunit C2 (210–295-C100) antibodies were from Alexis Biochemicals; anti β-tubulin (clone TUB2.1, T 4026) antibody was from Sigma; and the anti-CSN5 monoclonal SP282 antibody was described previously (34Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J. Villa A. Rogge L. Pardi R. Nature. 2000; 404: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous Cullin1—Transduced cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-Tris buffer plus Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and N-ethylmaleimide (10 μm, Sigma). The lysates were cleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose, then incubated with anti-Cullin1 antibody for 1 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with gel sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Gel Filtration Chromatography—2 × 106 of transduced cells were lysed by mechanical shearing in hypotonic buffer (Hepes (pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors). Homogenates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 40 min and filtered with 0.45-μm filters (Sigma). 50 μg of proteins were loaded onto a Superose 6 column (SMART System, GE Healthcare) and eluted with Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors). Fractions 8–19 were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the SUPERSCRIPT™ II enzyme (Invitrogen). Real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR was performed according to manufacturer's protocols (PE Applied Biosystem): 10–40 ng of cDNA were amplified in 25 μl final volume with 1.25 μl of the “Assays-on-Demand” oligonucleotides for CSN4, CSN5, SKP2, p27, CUL1, CUL4A, and 18S. Samples were analyzed with the ABI Prism 7300 real-time PCR machine. Relative mRNA levels were normalized to 18S RNA levels. Similar results were obtained with normalization to GAPDH or actin mRNA levels. Proliferation Assay—Metabolic activity of viable cells was measured with the Cell Proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were plated into a flat bottom 96-well plate at a density of 7.5 × 103 cells/100 μl/well, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added at the indicated times after plating, and after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, sample absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA reader. A colorimetric immunoassay (Cell Proliferation ELISA, Roche Applied Science) was used for the quantification of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation during DNA synthesis. Briefly, 7.5 × 103 cells/100 μl/well were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 or 72 h. BrdUrd (10 μm final concentration) was added, and after 4 h cells were incubated with the anti-BrdUrd antibody, following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4, and absorbance of the samples was measured in an ELISA reader at 450 nm. Transient Transfection of Small Interference RNA Oligonucleotides—Lentivirus-transduced cells were transiently transfected with a non relevant siRNA (control) or with a Cullin1 siRNA oligonucleotide (control, no. 1022076; Cul1.5, no. SI02225657; Cul1.6, no. SI 02225664; Cul4A.1, no. SI00356937, Cul4A.2, no. SI00356944, Qiagen). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and transfected with the oligonucleotide (10 nm final concentration) using 6μl of HiPerFect (Qiagen). 48 h later cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Down-regulation of Either CSN4 or CSN5 Causes Cullin1 Hyperneddylation and Disruption of the COP9 Signalosome Complex—To inhibit CSN function in human cells, we have used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference to down-regulate the expression of subunit 4 (CSN4) or subunit 5 (CSN5) of the CSN. CSN5 was chosen because it harbors the deneddylase activity, while loss of CSN4 in Arabidopsis and in Drosophila was shown to be sufficient to disrupt the whole complex, with consequent destabilization of other CSN subunits (35Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 36Staub J.M. Wei N. Deng X.W.

Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4399-4409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293T or HeLa cells were transduced with a dual cassette lentivirus that co-expresses the CSN-targeting shRNA and the extracellular domain of the NGFR, as a marker for transduced cells. Cell populations used in our studies showed 80–95% suppression of the target mRNA and corresponding protein (Fig. 1, A and B). We tested whether down-regulation of CSN4 or CSN5 expression in our experimental system was sufficient to interfere with CSN function, by examining protein neddylation in transduced cells. Down-regulation of CSN4 and CSN5 was accompanied by an increase in neddylated proteins in total cell lysates, compared with cells treated with a control shRNA vector (Fig. 1C, right, and data not shown). Increased neddylation of Cullin1 was shown by the appearance of slower migrating forms in total lysates (Fig. 1C, right) and confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Cullin1 and hybridization with anti-NEDD8 antibodies (Fig. 1C, left). To study the effect of the down-regulation of CSN4 or CSN5 on the assembly of the CSN complex, we performed gel filtration chromatography of homogenates from cells in which we had down-regulated CSN4 (CSN4kd) or CSN5 (CSN5kd) and analyzed expression of CSN subunits in the elution fractions by Western blotting. Equal loading of total proteins on the gel filtration column was confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody directed against the C2 subunit of the 20 S proteasome (Fig. 2). CSN subunits eluted in the same high molecular mass fractions, consistent with their association in the CSN complex (450–500 kDa, Fig. 2). As reported previously, CSN5 eluted also in lower molecular mass fractions corresponding to its predicted mass as a monomer (37.5 kDa, double asterisk in Fig. 2). ShRNA targeting of CSN4 caused decreased expression of the target CSN4 protein, as expected, but also of the other CSN subunits analyzed (Fig. 2, middle column), resulting in a net loss of the entire complex. Protein reduction of other CSN subunits not targeted by the shRNA occurred without changes in the mRNA levels, at least for subunits 5 and 3 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Similarly, targeting of CSN5 caused a reduction of unrelated CSN subunits (Fig. 2, right column). The monomeric form of CSN5 completely disappeared upon treatment with CSN5 shRNA, but was unaffected by CSN4 down-regulation, indicating that CSN5 is stable when not associated with the CSN complex (see asterisks in Fig. 2). C2 protein expression and assembly into the 20 S proteasome were not affected by CSN down-regulation. The analysis of Cullin1 expression in the elution fractions confirmed the enrichment of neddylated Cullin1 in the homogenates of CSN4kd and CSN5kd cells, compared with the control cells (Fig. 2, bottom panel). While a fraction of Cullin1 co-elutes with the CSN, the more neddylated forms of Cullin1 were enriched in fractions 13 and 14, which were devoid of CSN complex. Down-regulation of CSN4 or CSN5 Increases p27Kip1 Protein Stability—Since the neddylation status of Cullin1 affects the ubiquitin ligase activity of the SCF complex, we asked what is the effect of CSN down-regulation on the protein levels of SCF ubiquitination substrates. We observed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 in exponentially growing CSNkd cells (Fig. 3A). The observed increase in p27Kip1 did not result from increased p27Kip1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B), indicating post-transcriptional regulation of protein levels. p27Kip1 levels during cell cycle progression are mainly regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (38Bloom J. Pagano M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To determine whether the accumulation of p27Kip1 in CSNkd cells is due to decreased turnover, we analyzed total lysates from control and CSNkd cells at different time points after addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. While in control cells p27Kip1 was completely degraded in 5 h, 25–50% of the initial amount of the protein was still present in CSN4kd and CSN5kd cells, indicating that p27Kip1 degradation is impaired in these cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Loss of CSN Function Causes a Defect in Cell Proliferation, Which Can Be Partially Reversed by Suppression of p27Kip1 Expression—p27Kip1 is a critical negative regulator of cell division and its abundance is strictly correlated to cell cycle progression (38Bloom J. Pagano M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We therefore tested how CSN down-regulation and the consequent accumulation of p27Kip1 affect cell proliferation. 293T cells were transduced with lentiviral constructs targeting either CSN4 or CSN5. As a measure of cell number and proliferation rate, the metabolic activity of viable cells was determined at different times after plating, by measuring conversion of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 to formazan. As shown in Fig. 4A, CSN4kd and CSN5kd cells showed lower processing of the WST-1 reagent, compared with control transduced cells. Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells (data not shown). Cell proliferation was also evaluated by measuring S phase entry by BrdUrd incorporation at two different times after plating the transduced cells. The fraction of CSN4kd or CSN5kd cells in S phase was reduced at all time points analyzed, compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). To test whether the defect in proliferation observed in CSNkd cells is linked to the accumulation of p27Kip1, we suppressed p27Kip1 levels by lentivirus-mediated delivery of shRNA (Fig. 4C). p27Kip1 down-regulation alone does not affect proliferation of control cells, consistent with previous studies performed with embryonic fibroblasts from p27–/– mice (39Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K.-I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). However, down-regulation of p27Kip1 partially recovered cell proliferation of CSN5kd cells, as measured by the WST-1 assay (Fig. 4D) or by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 4E), indicating that accumulation of p27Kip1 is important in determining the proliferation defect of CSNkd cells. The CSN Controls the Levels of the F-box Protein Skp2—It has been proposed that the CSN may regulate cullin-based ubiquitin ligase activity by affecting the stability of selected components of cullin complexes, such as the substrate adaptor subunit (30Wee S.

Recent experimental data suggest involvement of Hedgehog signaling in vascular remodeling, germ cell migration, and axon guidance. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain elusive.

These findings suggest that Hedgehog signaling directly affects embryonic endothelial and fibroblast cell migration via molecules and pathways known to regulate cell migration in response to a variety of environmental cues. The Hedgehog family of signaling molecules is conserved throughout evolution with three secreted proteins that have been identified in mammals: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), 3The abbreviations used are: Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGCG, epigallocatechin gallate; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Indian Hedgehog, and Desert Hedgehog. Although these proteins differ in their tissue specificity, they all activate the same downstream signaling cascade, including two transmembrane receptors Patched1 and Smoothened, the family of Gli transcription factors, and other molecules involved in the signal transduction such as Fused, Suppressor of Fused, and Costal2 (1Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The Hedgehog pathway plays a crucial role in metazoan embryo patterning (1Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The most intensively investigated aspects of the Hedgehog pathway to this day include the following: establishment of ventral cell identity in the neural tube (2Briscoe J. Ericson J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), establishment of posterior identity in the developing limb bud (3Pearse II, R.V. Tabin C.J. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the roles of the pathway in neoplastic transformation. Inherited or acquired aberrations in components of the Hedgehog cascade result in various phenotypes, including congenital anomalies (e.g. holoprosencephaly and Pallister-Hall syndrome) and various cancers, most frequently medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal cancers, and rhabdomyosarcoma (4Villavicencio E.H.

Recently, observations from different systems have suggested a role for Hedgehog signaling in the control of motility and migration of multiple cell types. Hedgehog has been shown to act as both a stimulant and an inhibitor of axonal migration (6Charron F. Stein E. Jeong J. McMahon A.P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 2003; 113: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Kolpak A. Zhang J. Bao Z.Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3432-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hedgehog signaling blocks migration of neural crest cells in chick but is required for migration of germ and tracheal cells in Drosophila (8Testaz S. Jarov A. Williams K.P. Ling L.E. Koteliansky V.E.

Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5253-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, Hedgehog signaling is essential for yolk sac and embryonic vasculogenesis (11Vokes S.A.

Takenaka H. Kusano K.F. Ii M. Luedemann C. Curry C. Eaton E. Iwakura A. Tsutsumi Y. Hamada H. Kishimoto S. Thorne T. Kishore R. Losordo D.W. Circulation. 2006; 113: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Transfer of naked Shh cDNA into myocardial cells also enhanced the contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells to myocardial neovascularization after acute and chronic myocardial ischemia (14Kusano K.F. Pola R. Murayama T. Curry C. Kawamoto A. Iwakura A. Shintani S. Ii M. Asai J. Tkebuchava T. Thorne T. Takenaka H. Aikawa R. Goukassian D. von Samson P. Hamada H. Yoon Y.S. Silver M. Eaton E. Ma H.

Other studies, however, have failed to show a direct effect on endothelial cells in vitro (15Pola R. Ling L.E. Silver M. Corbley M.J. Kearney M. Blake Pepinsky R. Shapiro R. Taylor F.R. Baker D.P. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), implying that endothelial cell response to Hedgehog may be dependent on their differentiation status, developmental age, and organ origin. To elucidate the direct molecular consequences of Hedgehog signaling in endothelial cells, we studied endothelial cells derived from the mouse embryo yolk sac at the time the Hedgehog signal is secreted from the visceral endoderm. We show that these endothelial cells as well as embryonic mouse fibroblasts respond directly to Hedgehog by transcriptional activation of multiple genes coding for proteins involved in migration and angiogenesis. We further show that Hedgehog signaling enhances in vitro wound healing and that the neuropilin flavoprotein monooxygenase pathway mediates this effect. These findings suggest a molecular pathway mediating direct pro-migratory effect of Hedgehog on embryonic endothelial and fibroblast cells. Reagents—Cyclopamine was kindly provided by Dale R. Gardner (Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory, U. S. Department of Agriculture) and was suspended in 96% ethanol. It was used at 10 μm concentration in all assays. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (E4143; Sigma) was suspended in PBS. Cell Culture—C166 endothelial cell line was isolated from the yolk sac of 12-day-old transgenic mouse embryos expressing multiple copies of the activated allele of the human c-fes proto-oncogene (16Wang S.J. Greer P. Auerbach R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line 293T and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines NIH 3T3 and C3H/10T1/2 Clone 8 were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA; product numbers CRL-11268, CRL-1658, and CCL-226, respectively). The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line BALB/c 3T3 clone A31 was kindly provided by Professor Gera Neufeld (Technion-Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (41965-039; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10270-106; Invitrogen). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated directly from embryonic day 12 to embryonic day 14 HS:ICR mouse embryos and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used up to six passages. Generation of Conditioned Media—Shh-conditioned media were produced as reported previously with few modifications (17Ingram W.J. Wicking C.A. Grimmond S.M. Forrest A.R. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8196-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Shh-N encoding plasmid (Shh-N is active secreted Shh), kindly provided by Philip A. Beachy, or with control pcDNA3.1 plasmid (V79020; Invitrogen) The growth media were collected 3 days post-transfection, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and transferred through a 0.45-μm filter to remove cell debris. The conditioned media potency was routinely checked on NIH 3T3 cells by studying the expression of Shh known transcriptional targets Gli1 and Patched by quantitative real time PCR. When used to stimulate the Hedgehog pathway, the conditioned media were diluted in the maintenance media of the cells in different ratios as indicated in the text. RNA Interference and Retroviral Infections—Virus-mediated RNA interference was accomplished using the pRETRO-SUPER (pRS) construct kindly provided by Reuven Agami (18Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). To generate pRETRO-SUPER targeting mouse neuropilin1 (pRS-Nrp1), pRS was digested with BglII and HindIII, and the annealed oligonucleotides (5′-gatccccGGAATGTTCTGTCGCTATGttcaagagaCATAGCGACAGAACATTCCtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGGAATGTTCTGTCGCTATGtctcttgaaCATAGCGACAGAACATTCCggg-3′) were ligated into the vector. The 19-bp neuropilin1 target sequences are indicated in capitals in the oligonucleotide sequence. To create mouse neuropilin1 control RNA interference, mutations were generated in the target Nrp1 sequences, and the new annealed oligonucleotides (5′-gatccccGTAAGGTTCTATCGCCATCttcaagagaGATGGCGATAGAACCTTACtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGTAAGGTTCTATCGCCATCtctcttgaaGATGGCGATAGAACCTTACggg-3′) were ligated into pRS to generate pRS-CONTROL. 293T cells were transiently transfected with pRS-CONTROL or pRS-Nrp1 retroviral plasmids, in combination with vectors coding for ecotropic retrovirus envelope and the Gag and Pol proteins. Forty eight hours post-transfection, the culture medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral supernatant was used for infection of C166 cells after addition of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (H9268; Sigma). C166 cells were infected for 24 h and allowed to recover for another 24 h with fresh medium. Infected cells were selected with 10 μg/ml puromycin (ant-pr-1; InvivoGen) for a week, and polyclonal puromycin-resistant populations infected by Prs-CONTROL (“Nrp1 CONTROL” line) or pRS-Nrp1 (“Nrp1 knockdown” line) were established. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596-018; Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Reverse-iT 1st strand synthesis kit (AB-0789/B; ABgene) with random decamers following the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative real time PCRs were performed using SYBER Green Master Mix (RT-SN2X-075+; EST Group) with cDNA equivalent to 100 ng of RNA (for each sample) using Applied Biosystems 7900HT prism real time PCR instrument (Taqman; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR amplification included a first step of 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s). Ratio was calculated by dividing each gene expression with that of an internal standard in each sample. Forward and reverse primers were designed in exon-intron junctions in order to avoid amplification from contaminating DNA. For all the reactions primers designed to amplify β2-microglobulin gene were used as an internal control.

Microarray Design, Hybridization, and Analysis—Seven plates of C166 cells with initial confluence of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 were serum-starved for 12 h before initiation of the experiment with control conditioned media diluted 1:10 in media without serum (resulting in media containing 1% serum). One plate was then harvested and served as a base-line sample, whereas the rest of the plates were washed and received fresh control conditioned media or an Shh conditioned media, again diluted 1:10 in media without serum, for an additional 12 or 24 h. RNA was generated from the base-line sample and afterward from the 12- and 24-h time points. Each time point included one control-treated sample and two Shh-treated samples. All experiments were performed using Affymetrix MOE430A oligonucleotide arrays, as described oline. Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare biotinylated target RNA, with minor modifications from the manufacturer's recommendations. Five μg of mRNA was used to generate first strand cDNA by using a T7-linked oligo(dT) primer. After second strand synthesis, in vitro transcription was performed with biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics), resulting in ∼300-fold amplification of RNA. The target cDNA generated from each sample was processed as per the manufacturer's recommendation using an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System. Briefly, spike controls were added to 15 μg of fragmented cRNA before overnight hybridization. Arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, before being scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner. Additionally, quality and amount of starting RNA was confirmed using an agarose gel. After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scanner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on the chip surface. 3′:5′ ratios for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits (1.03–1.14 and 0.78–0.86, respectively), and BioB spike controls were found to be present on all chips, with BioC, BioD, and CreX also present in increasing intensities. When scaled to a target intensity of 150 (using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 array analysis software), scaling factors for all arrays were within acceptable limits (0.63–0.84), as were background Q values and mean intensities (supplemental Table 1). Details of quality control measures can be found online. Genes were filtered using MAS 5 algorithm. A list of 13,482 “valid” probe sets, representing probe sets with signal higher then 100 and detected as present (P) in at least one sample, was obtained (supplemental Table 2; the data are represented to comply with “minimum information about a microarray experiment” standards). The two samples treated with Shh for 24 h were compared with the 24-h control sample. The comparison generated a list of “active genes” in the Shh-treated samples for 24 h. Genes with an increased expression by at least in 1.5-fold compared with control were marked as “Increase” (I, p value 0.0025), or “Marginal Increase” (MI, p value 0.003) if less than 1.5-fold. Similarly, lower expression in the Shh group was labeled as “Decrease” (D, p value 0.0025) or “Marginal Decrease” (MD, p value 0.003). Hierarchical clustering was performed using Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics (Somerville, MA). Calculation of over-represented functional classes were done using Ease (19Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional classifications with an “Ease score” lower than 0.05 were marked as over-represented. Protein Analysis—For the purpose of detecting the Shh-N protein in the cell media, 25 μl from Shh-N or control conditioned media were mixed with Laemmli buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. After electronic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (401385; Schleicher and Schuell), the blots were probed with anti-Shh, 5E1 hybridoma supernatant (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City). Neuropilin1 Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and fresh protease inhibitor mixture (1-836-145; Roche Applied Science). 500 μg of sample lysate were incubated with goat anti-neuropilin1 antibody (c-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immune complexes were further precipitated using agarose-conjugated protein A/G (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with the same anti-neuropilin1 antibody used for immunoprecipitation. The detection of the anti-neuropilin1 antibody heavy chain was used as a conformation for equal addition of the antibody to the samples during precipitation. 293T cells transiently transfected with neuropilin1 expressing vector (kindly provided by Gera Neufeld, Technion-Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel) served as a positive control for the immunoblotting. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Shh-N Protein—Mouse Shh-N cDNA subcloned into a pET11d expression vector, forming a 6 histidine-tagged fusion protein, was kindly provided by Andrew P. McMahon. This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) PlysS (C6020-03; Invitrogen). Transformed bacteria were grown to an A550 of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (I6758; Sigma) for a further 2 h at 30°C. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm imidazole (I5513; Sigma), 1 mg/ml lysozyme (1-243-004; Roche Applied Science) and protease inhibitor mixture). Afterward, the lysate was sonicated (6 times with 10-s bursts), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose slurry (30210; Qiagen) was added to the homogenate (in 1:4 ratio) and mixed gently by shaking at 4 °C for 60 min at 200 rpm. After a series of washes (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20 mm imidazole), the His-Shh-N protein was eluted (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 200 mm imidazole) and dialyzed (against 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT). Finally, glycerol was added to give 20% of the final volume, and the protein was stored at –70 °C. His-Shh-N was pure as characterized by Coomassie Blue staining (B0149; Sigma), and the immunoblot studies done were similar as for the detection of Shh-N in the conditioned media. As reported before (20Kellner K. Lang K. Papadimitriou A. Leser U. Milz S. Schulz M.B. Blunk T. Gopferich A. Tissue Eng. 2002; 8: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a dimeric form of the recombinant protein was formed spontaneously, probably by formation of disulfide bonds, giving an ∼38-kDa protein. His-Shh-N protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) quantification assay (23227; Pierce). The potency of the His-Shh-N protein was checked similar to Shh-N conditioned media. Scratch (Wound) Assay—Migration through a wound introduced in cell monolayer was done similar to previous reports (21Raftopoulou M. Etienne-Manneville S. Self A. Nicholls S. Hall A. Science. 2004; 303: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, C166, NIH 3T3, or MEF cells were grown to confluence and formed a monolayer covering the surface of the entire plate. Cells were serum-starved and treated with Shh or control conditioned media, with or without cyclopamine (10 μm), according to expression studies. After 24 h of treatment, the wound was created in the center of the cell monolayer by the gentle removal of the attached cells with a sterile plastic pipette tip. Debris was removed by PBS wash, and the cells received fresh media with the same treatments as before. The ability of the cells to migrate into the wound area was assessed after 24 h by comparing the 0- and 24-h phase-contrast micrographs of several marked points along the wounded area at each plate. Chemical inhibitors, when used, were applied 30 min before wounding the cells. The percentage of nonrecovered wound area was calculated by dividing the nonrecovered area after 24 h by the initial wound area at zero time. Trypan Blue Viability Assay—C166, treated with control or Shh conditioned media (diluted 1 to 10 in serum free media) for 48 h, were incubated in the presence of 0.4% trypan blue solution (T8154; Sigma) in PBS for 60 s, and the number of viable cells was quantified. The experiments were repeated twice. Statistical Analyses—Student's t test was carried out for comparison of paired mean experimental values. C166, a Mouse Yolk Sac Endothelial Cell Line, Responds to Sonic Hedgehog—The response of the yolk sac-derived endothelial cell line C166 to Hedgehog signal was studied by monitoring the expression of well characterized primary target genes of the pathway, Gli1 and Patched1, using quantitative real time PCR technique. To stimulate the pathway, both Shh and control conditioned media were generated using 293T cells (Fig. 1A). Exposure to Shh induced the expression of Gli1 and Patched1 (Fig. 1B). C166 cells response to Shh was dose-dependent, increased with the length of exposure and with the degree of cell confluence, and was further augmented by serum starvation (Fig. 1B). As reported earlier, the transcriptional response to Shh was rather delayed, occurring at least 24 h after exposure under these conditions (17Ingram W.J. Wicking C.A. Grimmond S.M. Forrest A.R. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8196-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Shh Induces Migration of Embryonic C166 and 3T3 Cells in Vitro—The yolk sac phenotype of Smo–/– embryos suggests a defect in endothelial cell organization and migration (22Byrd N. Becker S. Maye P. Narasimhaiah R. St-Jacques B. Zhang X. McMahon J. McMahon A. Grabel L. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 361-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the functional effects of Shh on C166 cells, we chose the in vitro scratch (wound) assay. This assay is commonly used for testing the effects of pro- and anti-migratory agents on cultured cells (21Raftopoulou M. Etienne-Manneville S. Self A. Nicholls S. Hall A. Science. 2004; 303: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Another advantage of this assay is that it is performed on a confluent cellular layer, a pre-condition for Hedgehog activity in vitro (17Ingram W.J. Wicking C.A. Grimmond S.M. Forrest A.R. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8196-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). C166 cells were grown to confluence and treated with control or Shh-conditioned media for 24 h, in the presence or absence of the specific Hedgehog signaling inhibitor cyclopamine (24Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). After 24 h, a wound was introduced into the cell monolayer, and fresh media, treated as before, were applied again. The migration of the cells into the wound area was assessed after 24 h. Shh significantly enhanced the migration of C166 cells into the wounded area. This effect was eliminated by Hedgehog pathway-specific inhibitor, cyclopamine (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, a known Hedgehog-responsive cell line (23Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the Shh promigratory effect is not restricted to endothelial cells. The Hedgehog signal can also act as a mitogen in some systems (25Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Although the wound assay was performed on confluent cells during serum starvation, we wished to rule out the possibility that the enhanced wound closure by Shh was not the result of a proliferative advantage conferred by Shh. Trypan blue viability counts showed no difference in the number of living cells between plates treated with Shh and control media (living cells counts, at the end of the experiment, were 2.5 × 106 and 2.8 × 106 in control and Shh treatments, respectively (p > 0.05)). These results were confirmed independently by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, the enhanced wound closure induced by Shh was caused by increased cell migration and not by increased cell number. Characterization of the Transcriptional Response of C166 Cells to Shh—To identify the transcriptional response to Shh in C166 cells, an oligonucleotide microarray gene expression analysis was performed 12 and 24 h after exposure (Fig. 3A). These time points were chosen after optimizing the exposure conditions of C166 to Shh according to the parameters studied in Fig. 1. Gli1 and Patched1 expression, as detected by both quantitative real time PCR and the GeneChip hybridization, was increased by treatment with Shh compared with control and served as an internal control for activation of the Hedgehog pathway in the gene expression array (Fig. 3B). Nonsupervised hierarchical clustering performed with Spotfire DecisionSite™ revealed clear differences in the gene expression profiles of samples treated with Shh compared with controls after 24 h. Consistent with the delayed transcriptional activity of Hedgehog signaling (Fig. 1), the difference was less marked after 12 h (not shown), and thus comparisons were made between the 24-h treated samples and their control. Sixty one probe sets (representing 54 genes) changed by at least 1.5-fold between the treated samples and their control. Of the 54 genes, 41 were up-regulated and 13 down-regulated in the Shh-treated samples (Table 1).TABLE 1Genes regulated by Shh after 24 h of treatmentGene nameGene symbolNo. of probesReference sequenceMean Shh versus control at 24 h (FC)Mean Shh versus control at 12 h (FC)Up-regulated genesGLI-Kruppel family member GLIGli1NM_0102969.962.34Patched homolog 1Ptch11BG0710799.534.59Flavoprotein oxidoreductase MICAL2MICAL21BM1180093.751.92NeuropilinNrp3AK002673,AK011144,NM_0087373.021.86Kruppel-like factor 4 (gut)Klf42BG069413,U203442.911.45Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3Igfbp31AV1753892.820.76Solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, taurine), member 6Slc6a61NM_0093202.431.14Calpain 1Capn11BC0261382.391.26TensinTns1BI1010502.321.99Preproenkephalin 1Penk11M132272.261.19T-box18Tbx181NM_0238142.201.39Heat shock protein 1BHspa1b2M125732.121.05Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein RHnrpr1BB8224651.950.87Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C14Akr1c141NM_1340721.931.04Metastasis suppressor 1Mtss11AA2500311.901.31Transglutaminase 2, C polypeptideTgm21BB5501241.891.42Tribbles homolog 2 (Drosophila)Trib22BB354684,BC0271591.891.22Procollagen, type IV, α2Col4a21BC0135601.861.28β-Spectrin 2, nonerythrocyticSpnb21BM2135161.861.07Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IDCamk1d1BG0719311.841.26RIKEN cDNA 9030221M09 gene9030221M09Rik1BF1356411.840.72CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), αCebpa1BC0111181.831.39DNA segment, Chr 10, UCLA1D10Ucla11AK0050261.811.16E26 avian leukemia oncogene 1, 5′ domainEts11BB1517151.801.34Jagged 1Jag11AA8802201.761.14Procollagen, type IV, α1Col4a12AW536690,BF1586381.731.41Twist homolog 2 (Drosophila)Twist21NM_0078551.731.20RIKEN cDNA 2010200I23 gene2010200I23Rik1BB7692021.731.17Catenin-βCatnb1NM_0076141.701.37Glutathione S-transferase, θ1Gstt11BC0122541.681.34Cysteine-rich protein 1Csrp12AF092921,BF1245401.671.18kit ligandKitl1NM_0135981.671.09PRP19/PSO4 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)Prp191BC0040701.660.94Major histocompatibility complex, class I-relatedMr11BB2107291.641.36Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6Igfbp61NM_0083441.631.43Connective tissue growth factorCtgf1NM_0102171.621.24Early growth response 2Egr"
https://openalex.org/W2139352100,"Merozoites of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum expose at their surface a large multiprotein complex, composed of proteolytically processed, noncovalently associated products of at least three genes, msp-1, msp-6, and msp-7. During invasion of erythrocytes, this complex is shed from the surface except for a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored portion originating from MSP-1. The proteolytic cleavage separating the C-terminal portion of MSP-1 is required for successful invasion. Little is known about the structure and function of the abundant and essential multipartite complex. Using heterologously produced MSP-1, MSP-6, and MSP-7 in precursor and with the exception of MSP-7 in processed form, we have studied in vitro the complex formation between the different proteins to identify the interaction partners within the complex. Both MSP-636 and MSP-7 bind only to MSP-1 subunits that are shed, but although MSP-636 contacts just subunit p38, MSP-7 interacts with p83, p30, and p38. The intact C-terminal region of MSP-6 is required for the association with p38 as well as for its multimerization into tetramers. Furthermore, our data suggest that only the processed form and not the precursor form of MSP-1 interacts with MSP-636. MSP-6- as well as MSP-7-specific rabbit antibodies inhibit parasite multiplication in vitro as shown previously for antibodies directed against MSP-1. Our findings raise interesting questions with regard to proteolysis-mediated mechanisms of maturation of the MSP-1-MSP-6-MSP-7 complex and to the mode by which antibodies directed against this complex interfere with parasite multiplication."
https://openalex.org/W2047075413,"The post-translational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by polysialic acid (polySia) represents a remarkable example of dynamic modulation of homo- and heterophilic cell interactions by glycosylation. The synthesis of this unique carbohydrate polymer depends on the polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV. Aiming to understand in more detail the contributions of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV to polySia biosynthesis in vivo, we used mutant mouse lines that differ in the number of functional polysialyltransferase alleles. The 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene method was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the polySia patterns. Similar to the wild-type genotype, long polySia chains (>50 residues) were detected in all genotypes expressing at least one functional polysialyltransferase allele. However, variant allelic combinations resulted in distinct alterations in the total amount of poly-Sia; the relative abundance of long, medium, and short polymers; and the ratio of polysialylated to non-polysialylated NCAM. In ST8SiaII-null mice, 45% of the brain NCAM was non-polysialylated, whereas a single functional allele of ST8SiaII was sufficient to polysialylate approximately 90% of the NCAM pool. Our data reveal a complex polysialylation pattern and show that, under in vivo conditions, the coordinated action of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV is crucial to fine-tune the amount and structure of polySia on NCAM."
https://openalex.org/W1967442487,"Protein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum are critical processes for which our current understanding is far from complete. Here we describe the functional characterization of a new human 27.7-kDa protein (ERp27). We show that ERp27 is a two-domain protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum that is homologous to the non-catalytic b and b′ domains of protein disulfide isomerase. ERp27 was shown to bind Δ-somatostatin, the standard test peptide for protein disulfide isomerase-substrate binding, and this ability was localized to the second domain of ERp27. An alignment of human ERp27 and human protein disulfide isomerase allowed for the putative identification of the peptide binding site of ERp27 indicating conservation of the location of the primary substrate binding site within the protein disulfide isomerase family. NMR studies revealed a significant conformational change in the b′-like domain of ERp27 upon substrate binding, which was not just localized to the substrate binding site. In addition, we report that ERp27 is bound by ERp57 both in vitro and in vivo by a similar mechanism by which ERp57 binds calreticulin.

The first class of enzymes reported to be involved in disulfide bond formation was the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family (7Ferrari D.M. Söling H.-D. Biochem.

Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the founding member of this family, PDI, is sufficient in vitro, when combined with a physiological glutathione redox buffer, to refold reduced protein substrates or to isomerize substrates with incorrect disulfide bonds (13Creighton T.E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7937-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is clear that in vivo there exists a large family of enzymes. There is evidence that the exact make-up of this family is species-dependent, with, as an extreme example, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae having five reported family members (16Norgaard P. Westphal V. Tachibana C. Alsoe L. Holst B. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas humans have at least seventeen (9Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W.

Although the family name suggests that all of the members of the family are able to catalyze isomerization reactions in folding protein substrates, this is not the case. For example, one sub-group of the family, which includes ERp28/29 (17Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Söhling H.D. Eur. J.

Hence they are unable to catalyze any sulfur-based oxidations, reductions, or isomerizations. To date, all of the non-catalytic PDI family members reported consist of two domains, the first having the thioredoxin fold reported for all PDI domains whose structure has been solved; the second domain is all α-helical (18Ma Q.

Here we report a new human PDI family member, which we call ERp27. ERp27 contains two domains that are homologous to the non-catalytic b and b′ domains of human PDI, and both probably have a thioredoxin fold. ERp27 lacks a CXXC active site and hence is unable to catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange, however, it is able to bind the small peptide Δ-somatostatin. The binding site is localized to the second domain of ERp27, and mutations in homologous residues to those involved with peptide binding in human PDI (20Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M.

ERp27 contains a motif Asp-Glu-Trp-Asp located in a loop in the b′-like domain, which is similar to the Glu-Asp-Trp-Asp motif found at the tip of the P-domains of CRT and calnexin (CNX). This motif in CRT forms part of the ERp57 interaction site (22Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids encoding for full-length and mature (Glu26-Leu273) human ERp27 were generated by PCR from IMAGE clone 5207225 using primers that included an in-frame NdeI site 5′ to the first codon of the gene and a BamHI site after a TAA stop codon at the 3′-end. A plasmid encoding for the P-domain of CRT was generated by PCR from a plasmid encoding full-length CRT generously supplied by Prof. S.

The vector encoding full-length human ERp27 (pHIA199) was used as the template to PCR amplify gene fragments encoding putative domain fragments and N- and C-terminal truncations (see Tables 1 and 2 for a full list of constructs), which were also cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pLWRP51. pHIA199 was also used to clone residues Met1-Pro269 into pHIA203 (a modified version of p-EGFPN1 in which synthetic oligonucleotides had been used to add Pro269-Leu273 of ERp27 in-frame C-terminally with GFP). The resulting plasmid encoded ERp27 (Met1-Pro269), GPVAT linker, GFP, and ERp27 (Pro269-Leu273) and retains the ER signal sequence at the N terminus and the ER-retrieval signal at the C terminus of the chimera.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this study other than for recombinant ERp27 expression in E. coliPlasmid typePlasmid nameProtein producedpET23b (modified; 24)pLWRP69wt PDI a domain (Asp18-Ala136), hexa-His-taggedpOLR48wt PDI b domain (Ala136-Ala245) hexa-His-taggedpLWRP65wt PDI b′ domain (Lys230-Pro368) hexa-His-taggedpLWRP64wt mature PDI (Asp18-Leu507) hexa-His-taggedpHIA98wt E. coli thioredoxin (Ser1-Ala108), hexa-His-taggedpKEHS69wt mature ERp57, hexa-His-taggedpKEHS82wt mature ERp57 R280A, hexa-His-taggedpKEHS83wt mature ERp57 F299W, hexa-His-taggedpHIA239wt CRT P-domain (Lys206-Ile305), hexa-His-taggedpHIA199wt ERp27 (Met1-Leu273)pFH1None; CRT signal sequence cloned inpcDNA3.1pFH37ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); CRT P-domain (Lys206-Ile305)pFH56ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M)pFH57ER-targeted EYFP2pHIA334ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273)pHIA338ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273)pHIA335ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp27 (I196W)pHIA339ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp27 (I196W)pHIA336ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp27 (E231A, W232A, D233G)pHIA340ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp27 (E231A, W232A, D233G)pRK7pFH34ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp57pFH38ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp57pFH109ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp57 (R280A)pFH110ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp57 (R280A)pFH36ER-targeted EYFP1 (Q69M); mature ERp57 (F299W)pFH40ER-targeted EYFP2; mature ERp57 (F299W)pEGFP-N1pHIA203GFP-ERp27 (Pro269-Leu273)pHIA216ERp27 (M1-P269); GFP; Erp27 (Pro269-Leu273) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Plasmids used in this study for defining the domain boundaries and mapping the peptide binding site of ERp27Construct typePlasmid nameProtein producedE. coli expressionMultidomainpHIA213ERp27 (Glu26-Leu257)SolublepHIA205ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273)SolublepHIA211ERp27 (Pro34-Leu257)>70% solublepHIA214ERp27 (Pro34-Leu273)>70% solubleDomain 1pHIA204ERp27 (Glu26-Leu141)SolublepHIA206ERp27 (Pro34-Leu141)SolubleDomain 2pHIA230ERp27 (Phe135-Leu257)InsolublepHIA231ERp27 (Phe135-Leu273)InsolublepHIA232ERp27 (Ile138-Leu257)InsolublepHIA229ERp27 (Ile138-Leu273)InsolublepHIA212ERp27 (Leu141-Leu257)<10% solublepHIA207ERp27 (Leu141-Leu273)<10% solubleMutantspHIA222ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), L166WSolublepHIA221ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), M168WSolublepHIA220ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), Y182WSolublepHIA218ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), I196WSolublepHIA219ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), I196ASolublepHIA223ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273), I196LSolublepKEHS323ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273) E231KSolublepKEHS326ERp27 (Glu26-Leu273) E231A, W232A, D233GSoluble Open table in a new tab Bimolecular fluorescence complementation vectors targeted to the ER were made according to the design of Nyfeler and co-workers (26Nyfeler B.

Oligonucleotides encoding for the signal sequence of calreticulin (MLLSVPLLLGLLGLAVA) with a NheI site 5′ and with overhangs complementary to XbaI and NheI were cloned into the XbaI and NcoI sites of pET23b generating pFH1. The YFP fragments Y1 (1-158) and Y2 (159-239) were generated by PCR using the pLP-EYFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) as a template with a (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)2-His-Met linker 3′ to the YFP fragment and cloned into pFH1 using the NcoI and NdeI sites. For the Y1 containing vector the Q69M mutation was introduced to reduce the environmental sensitivity of fluorescence (27Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Constructs expressing mature ERp57, ERp27, and mutants therein along with the P-domain of CRT were subcloned into these vectors using NdeI and BamHI sites. Y1/Y2-ERp27 constructs were then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using NheI and BamHI sites, whereas Y1/Y2-ERp57 constructs were subcloned into pRK7 using XbaI and BamHI sites. pRK7 was used as ERp57 contains an internal NheI site. Point mutations in plasmids were performed as recommended by the manufacturer using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All plasmids generated were sequenced to ensure there were no errors in the cloned genes. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein production was carried out in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Strains were grown in LB media at 37 °C, 200 rpm, and induced at an A600 of 0.3 for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (6,500 rpm for 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 1/10th volume of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) and 1/1000th volume of 10 mg/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by freeze-thawing twice, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm for 20 min). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before being applied to an immobilized metal affinity chromatography column (chelating Sepharose fast flow, Amersham Biosciences), pre-charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated in buffer A. After loading the column was washed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.3 and then in buffer A, before the His-tagged proteins were eluted using 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The eluant was diluted 5× into buffer A and then applied to a Resource Q anion exchanger. PDI, mature and domain constructs, ERp57, and the P-domain of CRT were eluted from the Resource Q column with a linear gradient (0-100% over nine column volumes) while ERp27 was eluted with a tripartite gradient (0-45% over one column volume, 45-70% over seven column volumes, 60-100% over two column volumes; modified subsequently for 15N-labeled protein to 0-40% over one column volume, 40-60% over eight column volumes, and 60-100% over two column volumes) from buffer A to buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Eluted fractions were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing pure protein were pooled and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, using an Amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter device (10-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane filter). The concentration of the protein was determined spectro-photometrically using a calculated absorption coefficients (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar) at 280 nm of 18,450 m-1 cm-1 (ERp27), 6,990 m-1 cm-1 (ERp27 domain 1), 44,930 m-1 cm-1 (ERp57), 45,480 m-1 cm-1 (PDI), and 37,470 m-1 cm-1 (P-domain CRT). The 15N-labeled ERp27 was produced by growing the expressing strain in M9 media using 15N-labeled NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) with protein purification as described for unlabeled protein. Cell Transfections—COS-7 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown on 30-mm diameter Petri dishes with or without glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose medium supplemented with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells seeded 1 day earlier were transfected with the ERp27-GFP plasmid using 0.5-1 μg/plate and the Fugene6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as suggested by the manufacturer. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 20 min, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described earlier (29Kellokumpu S. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Kopito R. Baron R. Science. 1988; 242: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and the Golgi matrix protein, Gm130 (BD Biosciences, Lexington, KY) were used as the ER and Golgi markers, respectively, to allow localization of the expressed ERp27-GFP in transfected cells. Fixed and stained cells were examined using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) and photographed with a charge-coupled device camera. For flow cytometric analysis COS-7 cells were grown as above and transfected with 0.5 μg/plate of each plasmid and 5 μl of Fugene6 transfection reagent. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with PBS and then detached from the plate by incubating them with 200 μl of Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.5 mg/ml Trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS) for 7 min at 37 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1.2 ml of PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. For each sample the yellow fluorescence of 5000 cells was then analyzed using a CyFlow flow cytometer (Partec) with appropriate filter sets. Gating to analyze the average fluorescence intensity of transfected cells was performed using FloMax software (Partec). Transformation with the controls Y1-ERp27 or Y2-ERp57 resulted in transfected cells whose fluorescence intensity overlapped with that of the non-transfected cell population, and therefore the average fluorescence intensity of these controls could not be determined accurately, although it was <1% of that of the Y1-ERp27 plus Y2-ERp57 sample. Biophysical Analysis—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J600 spectrophotometer. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of eight scans, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm, scan speed of 50 nm/min, a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and a time constant of 0.5 s. Protein concentrations used varied between 0.1 and 0.14 mg/ml. The maximal HT voltage was under 750 V in all spectra. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 spectrophotometer using a 1-ml cuvette. All scans were collected at 25 °C as an average of four scans, excitation 280 nm, emission 300-400 nm, slit widths 5 nm, and scan speed 200 nm/min. Protein stocks were diluted at least 200-fold into 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0-6 m guanidinium chloride and equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C before fluorescence spectra were recorded. All spectra were corrected for the blank spectra with no protein added. The Ellman's assay (30Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods in Enzymology.XXV. Academic Press, New York1972: 457-464Google Scholar) was performed by adding 3 μl of 3.4 mg/ml Ellman's reagent to 200 μl of pre-equilibrated protein solution in either 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (native conditions) or 0.2 m phosphate buffer, 6 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7.0 (denaturing conditions). The rate of change in absorbance at 412 nm was measured in a dual-beam spectrophotometer, and a molar extinction coefficient of 12,830 m-1 cm-1 (at pH 7.0) was used for the reaction product. NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer from samples of uniformly 15N-labeled ERp27 (0.34 mm) and domain 1 (0.56 mm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 10% (v/v) D2O. 1H/15N HSQC spectra were collected at 25 °C over 12 and 6 h, respectively, with acquisition times of 125 ms in 1H and 83 ms in 15N and with water suppression using the WATERGATE sequence. Δ-Somatostatin was added to full-length 15N-labeled ERp27 (0.3 mm) at a 5 × molar excess (1.5 mm). For NMR analysis of ERp57-ERp27 complex formation 1H/15N HSQC spectra were collected as described above except that the number of transients collected was increased (total acquisition time, 24 h) to compensate for the lower concentration of 15N-labeled ERp27 protein (0.1 mm in both cases). Unlabeled ERp57 was added at a 1.14× molar excess for domain 1 and a 1.5× molar excess for full-length ERp27. In Vitro Protein Cross-linking—Cross-linking was performed using the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Sigma) and was optimized for different systems by varying protein concentrations, DSG concentration and time of reaction. Proteins were mixed to give a volume of 9 μl in either 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, or phosphate-buffered saline solution (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) and incubated on ice for 10 min. 1 μl of DSG was added and mixed, and the solution was incubated on ice. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 2.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. Peptide Binding by Cross-linking—Cell extracts from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were prepared as described under “Protein Expression and Purification.” Bolton-Hunter 125I labeling of Δ-somatostatin (AGSKNFFWKTFSS) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Cross-linking was performed using DSG as described previously (31Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Oxidase Assay—The method of Ruddock and co-workers (32Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using a fluorescent decapeptide was used to determine the oxidase activity of each of ERp27 in McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 7.0) with 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione and 2 mm reduced glutathione. Identification of a Novel Human PDI Family Member—A data base search for novel human PDI family members identified a previously uncharacterized open reading frame (Q96DN0, ENSG00000139055, FLJ32115, and c12orf46) encoding a putative 27-kDa ER-resident PDI family member, which we named ERp27. The gene is located at 14,958,241-14,982,750 bp on chromosome 12 and has 7 exons. Serial analysis of gene expression (33Lash A.E. Tolstoshev C.M. Wagner L. Schuler G.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Altschul S.F. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) indicates that ERp27 is expressed in humans in a variety of tissue types, including in the spleen, lung, kidney, thymus, and bone marrow and most highly in the pancreas. Unigene (34Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Federhen S. Lash A.E. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Sequeira E. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) cDNA sources include kidney, cervix, breast, placenta, colon, lung, pancreas, thyroid, and marrow. The ERp27 coding region used in these studies was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 5207225. A homologue of human ERp27 can be found in mouse, chimp, dog, cow, rhesus macaque, green puffer fish, and zebrafish; no homologues could be found in other species, including the fully sequenced S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Drosophila melanogaster, although other PDI family members were identified in a large number of organisms using ERp27 as the search. A multiple alignment of the human and mouse ERp27 proteins showed 65.5% identity, which is considerably lower than the identity observed between other PDI family members between these species, e.g. mature mouse and human PDI show 95.1% identity. Analysis of the Domain Structure of ERp27—Analysis of the sequence of ERp27 using PSORT (35Horton P. Naka K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and TargetP (36Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar) indicated that the protein would be targeted by a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence to the secretory pathway, with the mature protein starting at A21 (PSORT) or E26 (TargetP). The C-terminal amino acids are KVEL, which probably acts as an ER retrieval motif (usual consensus KDEL). If the mature protein starts at E26, then it is 248 amino acids long, with a molecular mass of 27.7 kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.6 (ProtParam). The protein contains two cysteine residues but does not contain a CXXC thioredoxin superfamily-active site motif indicating that ERp27 is probably a catalytically redox-inactive member of the PDI family. The protein contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn100. Multiple alignments of human ERp27 and PDI were performed using a wide range of programs. These alignments all showed a considerable degree of consensus and suggested that ERp27 is a homologue of the bb′ domains of human PDI, with short N- and C-terminal extensions (Fig. 1). Because other PDI family members also contain a bb′ domain pair, multiple alignments were done between ERp27 and these proteins. The percentage identity over the bb′ region was found to be higher between human ERp27 and PDI (33.5%) than for the other family members (PDIp, 28.1%; ERp57, 16.5%; ERp72, 14.7%; domain boundaries from Ref. 24Alanen H.I. Salo K.E.H. Pekkala M. Siekkinen H.M. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). No significant homology could be found between ERp27 and the other non-catalytic human PDI family member ERp29. BLAST searches of mammalian sequences, using full-length ERp27 or either domain, revealed only significant hits with mammalian PDI family members, PDI, PDIp, and PDILT. In all cases the first domain of ERp27 corresponded to the b domain, and the second domain of ERp27 to the b′ domain. Putative domain boundaries for the b and b′ domains of ERp27 determined by sequence alignment (allowing for insertions and deletions to fall between the modeled secondary structural elements) were confirmed by making a range of domain constructs of ERp27 (Table 2) with expression in E. coli (data not shown). The full-length mature protein and constructs with deletions at the N terminus to P34 and/or at the C terminus to Leu257 were all partially solubly expressed (>50% soluble expression), suggesting that the N- and C-terminal extensions do exist. Furthermore, a variety of domain 1 constructs based on the hypothetical boundaries were also partially solubly expressed (>50% so"
https://openalex.org/W2164553621,"We have studied adhesion of eosinophils to various forms of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, CD106), an integrin counter-receptor implicated in eosinophil recruitment to the airway in asthma. Full-length 7d-VCAM-1, with seven immunoglobulin-like modules, contains integrin-binding sites in modules 1 and 4. The alternatively spliced six-module protein, 6d-VCAM-1, lacks module 4. In static assays, unactivated purified human blood eosinophils adhered similarly to recombinant soluble human 6d-VCAM-1 and 7d-VCAM-1 coated onto polystyrene microtiter wells. Further experiments, however, revealed differences in recognition of modules 1 and 4. Antibody blocking indicated that eosinophil adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1 or a VCAM-1 construct containing only modules 1–3, 1–3VCAM-1, is mediated by α4β1 (CD49d/29), whereas adhesion to a construct containing modules 4–7, 4–7VCAM-1, is mediated by bothα4β1 andαMβ2 (CD11b/18). Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which block adhesion of eosinophils mediated by αMβ2, blocked adhesion to 4–7VCAM-1 but had no effect on adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1. Consistent with the antibody and pharmacological blocking experiments, eosinophilic leukemic cell lines lacking αMβ2 did not adhere to 4–7VCAM-1 but did adhere to 6d-VCAM-1 or 1–3VCAM-1. Activation of eosinophils by interleukin (IL)-5 enhanced static adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, or 4–7VCAM-1; IL-5-enhanced adhesion to all 3 constructs was blocked by anti-αMβ2. Adhesion of unstimulated eosinophils to 7d-VCAM-1 under flow conditions was inhibited by anti-α4 or anti-αM. IL-5 treatment decreased eosinophil adhesion to 7d-VCAM-1 under flow, and anti-αM had the paradoxical effect of increasing adhesion. These results demonstrate that αMβ2 modulatesα4β1-mediated eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1 under both static and flow conditions. We have studied adhesion of eosinophils to various forms of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, CD106), an integrin counter-receptor implicated in eosinophil recruitment to the airway in asthma. Full-length 7d-VCAM-1, with seven immunoglobulin-like modules, contains integrin-binding sites in modules 1 and 4. The alternatively spliced six-module protein, 6d-VCAM-1, lacks module 4. In static assays, unactivated purified human blood eosinophils adhered similarly to recombinant soluble human 6d-VCAM-1 and 7d-VCAM-1 coated onto polystyrene microtiter wells. Further experiments, however, revealed differences in recognition of modules 1 and 4. Antibody blocking indicated that eosinophil adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1 or a VCAM-1 construct containing only modules 1–3, 1–3VCAM-1, is mediated by α4β1 (CD49d/29), whereas adhesion to a construct containing modules 4–7, 4–7VCAM-1, is mediated by bothα4β1 andαMβ2 (CD11b/18). Inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which block adhesion of eosinophils mediated by αMβ2, blocked adhesion to 4–7VCAM-1 but had no effect on adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1. Consistent with the antibody and pharmacological blocking experiments, eosinophilic leukemic cell lines lacking αMβ2 did not adhere to 4–7VCAM-1 but did adhere to 6d-VCAM-1 or 1–3VCAM-1. Activation of eosinophils by interleukin (IL)-5 enhanced static adhesion to 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, or 4–7VCAM-1; IL-5-enhanced adhesion to all 3 constructs was blocked by anti-αMβ2. Adhesion of unstimulated eosinophils to 7d-VCAM-1 under flow conditions was inhibited by anti-α4 or anti-αM. IL-5 treatment decreased eosinophil adhesion to 7d-VCAM-1 under flow, and anti-αM had the paradoxical effect of increasing adhesion. These results demonstrate that αMβ2 modulatesα4β1-mediated eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1 under both static and flow conditions.

Modules 1 and 4 of human VCAM-1 share 73% sequence identity and contain two disulfide bonds, which is unusual for Ig-like modules (15Osborn L. Vassallo C. Browning B.G. Tizard R. Haskard D.O.

Despite the similarities between modules 1 and 4, studies involving lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines demonstrated that interactions with modules 1 and 4 are regulated differently by conditions such as shear stress, divalent cations, and temperature (19Kilger G.

Such differences in activities between modules 1 and 4 for lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines led us to question whether modules 1 and 4 of VCAM-1 have unique functions in adhesion of primary EOS isolated from human blood. In particular, we speculated that VCAM-1 modules may have different affinities and/or adhesive functions for the three described VCAM-1-interacting integrins of EOS. These investigations led us to the surprising conclusion that αMβ2, an integrin involved in transendothelial migration of EOS (22Jia G.Q. Gonzalo J.A. Hidalgo A. Wagner D. Cybulsky M. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but heretofore not implicated in adhesion to VCAM-1, mediates adhesion of unactivated EOS to module 4 and of IL-5-stimulated EOS to both modules 1 and 4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEOS Isolation—Human EOS were isolated from peripheral blood by anti-CD16 magnetic bead selection (23Hansel T.T.

Purity of EOS was greater than 98% as determined by Diff-Quik staining. Viability was at least 99% as assessed by staining with propidium iodide and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences). The University of Wisconsin Human Subjects Committee approved the study, and informed consent was obtained before participation of volunteers.Cell Lines—The human AML14.3D10 and EoL-3 eosinophilic leukemic cell lines were obtained and cultured as described (25Johansson M.W.

Jurkat T lymphocytic leukemic cells were provided by Laura Kiessling (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI) and grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) 1640 with 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and subcultured by dilution to 1 × 105/ml twice a week.Expression of VCAM-1 Constructs—Total RNA from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing full-length human 6d- or 7d-VCAM-1 (26Chuluyan H.E.

The cDNA products were then amplified by PCR with the reverse transcription primer described above in combination with forward primer, 5′-GTCTCCCGGGTTTAAAATCGAGACCACCCCAG-3′ to generate cDNA encoding extracellular 6d-VCAM-1 or 7d-VCAM-1 lacking the cytosolic tail and transmembrane region (Fig. 1A). The PCR products encoding 6d-VCAM-1 and 7d-VCAM-1 were 1771 and 2041 bp, respectively, and contained an XmaI site at the 5′ end and an SpeI site at the 3′ end. PCR fragments were digested with XmaI and SpeI restriction enzymes and cloned in-frame into the pAcGP67.coco plasmid (pCOCO) (28Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pCOCO plasmid containing the DNA insert encoding extracellular 7d-VCAM-1 was used as a template to generate the 4–7VCAM-1, 1–3VCAM-1, and 1–2VCAM-1 constructs (Fig. 1A). The 4–7VCAM-1 construct was PCR-amplified with the following primer sequences: forward primer, 5′-AGAGCCCGGGTTTACTGTTGAGATCTCCCCTGG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ACGACTAGTTCAGGAGAAAAATAGTCTTTGTTG-3′. The 1–3VCAM-1 construct was PCR-amplified with primer sequences: forward primer, 5′-GTCTCCCGGGTTTAAAATCGAGACCACCCCAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTCAACTAGTAATGGTTTCTCTTGAACAATTAATTCCACC-3′. The 1–2VCAM-1 construct was amplified with primer sequences: forward primer, 5′-GTCTCCCGGGTTTAAAATCGAGACCACCCCAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTAGACTAGTAATTCTTTTACAGCCTGCCTTACTG-3′. The PCR products encoding 4–7VCAM-1, 1–3VCAM-1, and 1–2VCAM-1 were 1176, 886, and 598 bp, respectively, and contained an XmaI site at the 5′ end and SpeI site at the 3′ end. PCR fragments were digested with XmaI and SpeI and cloned inframe into pCOCO digested beforehand with XmaI and XbaI restriction enzymes. Inserts and reading frames for all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs and BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA transfection module (BD Biosciences) were then cotransfected into SF9 insect cells. Viral recombinants (pass 1 virus) were selected from plaques and used to infect new SF9 monolayers to generate pass two recombinant virus. After a third propagation in SF9 cells, pass 3 virus was used to infect High 5 or SF9 insect cells for protein expression. Recombinant proteins contained a signal sequence that was cleaved off during secretion. Sequences retained in the processed protein that were introduced from pCOCO were ADPG, present on the N terminus, and the thrombin cleavage and His-tag sequence LELVPRGSAAGHHHHHH, at the C terminus. Secreted proteins were purified from medium with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, and 4–7VCAM-1 proteins were partly multimerized on non-reduced SDS-PAGE gels, whereas 1–3VCAM-1 and 1–2VCAM-1 were monomeric. For the proteins with a tendency to multimerize, small amounts of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid beads were added to protein solutions to preferentially bind and remove multimers, leaving monomers behind in solution. Recombinant soluble human 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, 4–7VCAM-1, or 1–3VCAM-1 constructs were produced in High 5 insect cells transfected with recombinant baculoviruses. Recombinant soluble human 1–2VCAM-1 was expressed in SF9 insect cells because protein yield was better in comparison to the yield in High 5 cells. Yields of pure monomers were between 5 and 20 mg/liter concentrations of conditioned medium.Other Materials—Several of the mAbs have been described previously (25Johansson M.W. Lye M.H. Barthel S.R.

Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem.Cell Adhesion under Static Conditions—Polystyrene 96-well non-tissue culture-treated plates (BD Biosciences) were coated in triplicate with 100 μl of protein solution in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.0, per well for 3 h at 37 °C, decanted, and then blocked for 20 min at 37 °C with heat-inactivated FBS for EOS or BSA rendered free of fatty acids for cell lines. FBS was heat-inactivated by heating to 56 °C for 30 min, mixed every 10 min, and then rapidly cooled in an ice-water bath. For inhibition experiments, mAbs or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors were added to cells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml mAbs, 100 nm wortmannin, or 10 μm LY294002. Cells were incubated with mAbs for 5 min at 22 °C or with PI3K inhibitors for 15 min at 37 °C before the addition to wells. EOS were suspended in HBSS, 0.2% BSA at 1 × 104 cells/100 μl, and cell lines were suspended in RPMI 1640, 0.2% BSA at 2 × 105 cells/100 μl. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration of HBSS were 1.2 and 0.9 mm and of RPMI were 0.4 and 0.4 mm, respectively. Cells were added to wells in volumes of 100 μl/well for 1 h at 37 °C, after which the wells were washed 3 times with TBS, pH 8.0. For cell lines, wells were fixed by the addition of 100 μlof 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 10 min, stained by the addition of 1% bromphenol blue in 1% acetic acid for 5 min, and washed 3 times with 1% acetic acid, and color was developed by the addition of 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.0. Adherence of EOS was quantified by an assay of EOS peroxidase. Briefly, 100 μl of HBSS was added to wells with 100 μl of a solution containing 0.1% Triton-X100, 1 mm o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm H2O2, and 55 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (30Strath M. Warren D.J. Sanderson C.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 83: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). After 30 min of color development at 22 °C, 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4 was added to quench the reaction. Absorbances for EOS and cell lines were read at 490 and 595 nm, respectively, in an EL microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Percentages of adherent EOS were calculated by dividing the absorbance per experimental well by the absorbance from uncoated wells containing 100% of input EOS and multiplying by 100. Percentages of adherent cell lines were calculated by reference to a parallel experiment in which adherent cells were assayed by both the bromphenol blue method and the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), which can be used to measure both adherent and total cells. Absorbances and signal values were within the linear range of the detector as determined by standard curves for all three methods. Mean absorbances, S.D., or S.E. are indicated and are from experiments performed on at least three separate occasions. For inhibition studies, values are given as percentages of the absorbances obtained in the presence of respective isotype control mAbs.Cell Adhesion under Flow Conditions—The assay for adhesion under flow conditions was based on our experience with platelets (31Cho J. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2006; 107: 3555-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the experience of others with EOS (32Sriramarao P. Norton C.R. Borgstrom P. DiScipio R.G.

Koenderman L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used a parallel plate flow chamber (Glycotech, Rockville, MD). A silicone rubber gasket with a thickness of 0.254 mm and a flow path width of 2.5 mm was placed on polystyrene 3.5-cm-diameter tissue culture Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) previously coated with VCAM-1 constructs at 220 nm. Coating of dishes was done with 1 ml of protein solution in TBS, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 37 °C, then dishes were washed with TBS and blocked with heat-inactivated FBS for 15 min. The inlet of the flow chamber was connected to a buffer reservoir by silicone tubing, and the outlet was connected with a peristaltic pump to draw fluid through the flow chamber. The chamber was pre-perfused with prewarmed TBS. EOS were suspended in HBSS, 0.2% BSA at 2 × 106 cells/ml (35Ulfman L.H. Joosten D.P. van der Linden J.A. Lammers J.W. Zwaginga J.J. Koenderman L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and incubated with or without IL-5 (50 pg/ml final concentration) and with mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 5 min at 22 °C before perfusion and placed in a water bath at 37 °C, and the inlet was connected to the EOS suspension. Perfusion was performed at a shear rate of 150 s–1, a rate previously used for purified EOS (34Patel K.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6209-6216PubMed Google Scholar). This rate corresponds to a shear force of 0.15 newtons·m–2 (= 1.5 dyn/cm2), assuming a viscosity value of 0.001 newtons·sm–2 (= 0.01 poise or dyn·s/cm2) (36Chang R. Physical Chemistry with Applications to Biological Systems. 2nd Ed. Macmillan, New York1981: 72-77Google Scholar). This value is within the range of shear force (1–30 dyn/cm2) considered physiological for post-capillary venules, a relevant location for leukocyte extravasation (32Sriramarao P. Norton C.R.

After perfusion for 2 min, the dish was taken out and washed 3 times with TBS. Perfusions were performed within 4 h of EOS purification, and variables were tested in a randomized order that was different among donors. Adherence of EOS was quantified by the EOS peroxidase assay as described above, except that 1 ml of HBSS and 1 ml of substrate solution were added to each dish. After 30 min of color development, 200 μl of this mixture was transferred to a well in a 96-well plate, and 50 μlof4 m H2SO4 was added to quench the reaction. Absorbance was read as above.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Wells were coated in triplicate with 100 μl of VCAM-1 constructs in TBS, pH 8.0, on polystyrene 96-well non-tissue culture-treated plates (BD Biosciences) for 3 h at 37°C. Subsequent steps were performed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% BSA. Wells were decanted, blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and then incubated for 1 h at 22°C in 100 μl of 1 μg/ml mAb 1.G11B1 or with mAb 2A6.21 diluted 1:50,000 from cell culture supernatant. Wells were washed twice, and 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse diluted 1:5000 was added for 1 h at 22 °C. Wells were washed 3 times followed by the addition of 100 μl of 1 mg/ml Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS, pH 9.0. Absorbances were read at 409 nm in the EL microplate reader.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Integrin Expression—EOS (4–5 × 105) in 0.2 ml of HBSS, 0.2% BSA or cell lines (4–5 × 105) in RPMI, 0.2% BSA were incubated with or without 50 pg/ml IL-5 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), 1 mm MnCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or 100 nm PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 20 min along with primary mAbs. Cells were chilled on ice for 5 min, pelleted, washed with 0.25 ml of HBSS or RPMI, resuspended in 0.25 ml of HBSS or RPMI, and then incubated with secondary mAb for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Primary mAbs were incubated in final concentrations of 2.5 μg/ml, and secondary mAb fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was incubated at 20 μg/ml. After secondary mAb incubation, EOS or cell lines were pelleted, fixed by resuspension in 1% paraformaldehyde, 67.5 mm sodium cacodylate, 113 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, stored at 4 °C in the dark, washed with HBSS or RPMI, and analyzed. Fluorescence measurements were collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences; available through the Flow Cytometry Facility, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison). Data were collected from 10,000 cells per condition using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Fixed cells were gated based on forward and side scatter. The specific geometric mean channel fluorescence (gMCF) is reported. The specific gMCF was obtained by subtracting the gMCF of the isotype control from the gMCF of the experimental sample according to the following equation, where gMF is geometric mean fluorescence: gMCF = [1024 × (log gMF of experimental sample)] – [1024 × (log gMF of isotype control sample)]. A gMCF value equal to 110 is equivalent to a ratio of the gMF experimental sample to gMF isotype control sample equal to 1.3. Subunits or activation states with values less than 110 were considered either not expressed or not recognized by mAbs.Statistics—Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's or Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post test on GraphPad Prism software or by two-tailed t test where appropriate.RESULTSTo learn how EOS interact with modules 1 and 4, we expressed constructs containing the two modules either in combination or separately (Fig. 1A). Soluble recombinant human 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, 4–7VCAM-1, 1–3VCAM-1, and 1–2VCAM-1 constructs migrated with expected molecular masses of ∼66, 76, 45, 34, and 24 kDa, respectively, on non-reduced SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1B). The 1–3VCAM-1 construct migrated as a doublet, which is likely the result of differential N-glycosylation of two sites in module 3. A similar difference in apparent molecular weight was also detected previously in immunoprecipitations of soluble 1–3VCAM-1 from transiently transfected COS cells (38Pepinsky B. Hession C. Chen L.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17820-17826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The coating efficiencies of VCAM-1 constructs on polystyrene microtiter wells were determined by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with two mAbs that recognize different epitopes in recombinant soluble VCAM-1; mAb 1.G11B1 binds an epitope in modules 1–3, and mAb 2A6.21 recognizes an epitope in the C-terminal sequence purification tag introduced into recombinant proteins by the pCOCO expression system based on Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays involving VCAM-1 constructs. The 6d-VCAM-1, 7d-VCAM-1, and 4–7VCAM-1 constructs were equally efficient in coating polystyrene, whereas 1–3VCAM-1 coated ∼3-fold less efficiently on a molar basis, and there was little or no detectable coating of 1–2VCAM-1 (not shown). To achieve equal coatings of 1–3VCAM-1, we calculated the amount required to match the signal generated from the coating of other VCAM-1 constructs. These calculations were then verified by subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (not shown). When layers of VCAM-1 coated on glass coverslips were stained and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, the VCAM-1 layers appeared bright and homogeneous (not shown).In comparat"
https://openalex.org/W2015298548,"The oncogenic kinase Bcr-Abl is thought to cause chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by altering the transcription of specific genes with growth- and survival-promoting functions. Recently, Bcr-Abl has also been shown to activate an important regulator of protein synthesis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which suggests that dysregulated translation may also contribute to CML pathogenesis. In this study, we found that both Bcr-Abl and the rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 complex contribute to the phosphorylation (inactivation) of 4E-BP1, an inhibitor of the eIF4E translation initiation factor. Experiments with rapamycin and the Bcr-Abl inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, in Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines and primary CML cells indicated that Bcr-Abl and mTORC1 induced formation of the translation initiation complex, eIF4F. This was characterized by reduced 4E-BP1 binding and increased eIF4G binding to eIF4E, two events that lead to the assembly of eIF4F. One target transcript is cyclin D3, which is regulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells by both Bcr-Abl and mTORC1 in a translational manner. In addition, the combination of imatinib and rapamycin was found to act synergistically against committed CML progenitors from chronic and blast phase patients. These experiments establish a novel mechanism of action for Bcr-Abl, and they provide insights into the modes of action of imatinib mesylate and rapamycin in treatment of CML. They also suggest that aberrant cap-dependent mRNA translation may be a therapeutic target in Bcr-Abl-driven malignancies."

All of these activities appear to rely on the transient interaction of Hsp70 with short hydrophobic segments of their protein substrates. The cycle of substrate binding and release is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. DnaK, an Hsp70 homolog in Escherichia coli, consists of a 44-kDa NH2-terminal ATPase domain (1Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 2Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J.

Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP and ADP/ATP exchange control the functional properties of the substrate-binding domain (4Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ATP-liganded DnaK (T-state DnaK) exhibits low affinity for substrates and fast rates of binding and release, whereas ADP-liganded (R-state) DnaK is characterized by high substrate affinity and slow kinetics (5Palleros D.R.

Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). DnaK acts in concert with two co-chaperones (Fig. 1). DnaJ, an Hsp40 homolog, stimulates the hydrolysis of ATP and thus promotes the formation of high affinity (ADP·DnaK)·substrate complexes, whereas GrpE facilitates the exchange of ADP for ATP and thus triggers the release of substrate from the cycle (7Liberek K.

A major question in the field of molecular chaperones is how targeted chaperone action is selectively triggered. Protein substrates, such as firefly luciferase, σ32 (9Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), accelerate the DnaJ-stimulated hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP by 1-2 orders of magnitude. DnaJ not only stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK but also associates with unfolded proteins and prevents protein aggregation (13Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 14Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.J. Schirra C. Bujard H. Bukau B.

DnaJ has been suggested to select the chaperone substrates and then to transfer them to DnaK (9Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 14Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.J. Schirra C. Bujard H. Bukau B.

However, no experimental evidence has been reported as yet for this substrate transfer. A plausible mechanism of the targeting action of DnaJ is provided by the concept of a cis-effect of DnaJ on DnaK in ternary (ATP·DnaK)·substrate·DnaJ complexes (11Han W. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19038-19043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Han W. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); the simultaneous binding of DnaK and DnaJ to one and the same polypeptide chain results in a higher effective concentration of DnaJ. During heat shock and other cellular stress, the expression level of DnaK and its co-chaperones is enhanced to cope with the rising amount of misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins (for a recent review, see Ref. 16Wick L.M. Egli T. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2004; 89: 1-45PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, this well known heat shock response is mediated by the transcription factor σ32, which directs RNA polymerase to transcribe the particular set of heat shock genes. Within minutes after onset of the heat shock (temperature ≥42 °C), the cellular concentration of DnaK is increased about 2-fold (17Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 18Liu X. Concentrations of the GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE Molecular Chaperones in Escherichia coli under Normal and Heat Shock Conditions. Universität Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland2002Google Scholar). Recent in vitro experiments with the isolated DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system have indicated that the system also responds directly to heat shock conditions; a mere increase in temperature suffices to increase the fraction of peptide substrate sequestered by DnaK (19Siegenthaler R.K. Grimshaw J.P. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This effect is due to the differential temperature dependence of the activities of the two co-chaperones (20Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At heat shock temperatures, GrpE undergoes a fully reversible conformational transition, which decreases its nucleotide exchange activity (20Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J.

In contrast, DnaK and DnaJ do not show any conformational changes between 15 and 48 °C. Here, we report the kinetics of binding, release, and dynamic sequestering of protein substrates in the DnaK chaperone cycle under normal and heat shock conditions. Our results show that the cis-effect of DnaJ in ternary (ATP·DnaK)·substrate·DnaJ complexes acts as a triage mechanism selectively feeding non-native proteins into the chaperone cycle. DnaJ as nonnative protein sensor and GrpE as thermosensor directly adapt the operational mode of the chaperone system to heat shock conditions. Materials—The H541C mutation was introduced into the gene of wild-type (WT) DnaK in plasmid pTPG9 (a gift from Dr. C. Georgopoulos and Dr. D. Ang, Geneva, Switzerland) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide replacements were verified by DNA sequence analysis. WT DnaK and DnaK H541C were purified as described previously (26Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The concentration of WT DnaK was determined photometrically with the molar absorption coefficient ϵ280 = 14,500 m-1 cm-1 (27Hellebust H. Uhlen M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stock solution of WT DnaK was stored in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) at -80 °C. For fluorescence labeling, 760 μm DnaK H541C in 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, was reacted with a 5-fold molar excess of acrylodan in the presence of 10 mm ATP (to prevent labeling at Cys15 located in the ATPase domain) for 3 h at room temperature. The acryl group of acrylodan served to attach the environmentally sensitive fluorophore covalently to the sulfhydryl group of Cys541. The reaction mixture was filtrated (0.2 μm); acrylodan-labeled DnaK H541C (a-DnaK H541C) was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Fractogel EMD BioSec 650 S from Merck) in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, transferred into assay buffer with a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and stored at -80 °C. Incorporation of a single fluorophore per DnaK H541C molecule was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The concentration of the stock solution was determined with the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. DnaJ and GrpE (gifts from Dr. H.-J. Schönfeld, Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were prepared as reported elsewhere (29Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Zulauf M. Prog.

The concentrations of DnaJ and GrpE were determined photometrically with ϵ277 = 18,100 m-1 cm-1 and ϵ279 = 2,720 m-1 cm-1, respectively. Throughout this report, the indicated protein concentrations refer to the respective protomer. Bacteriophage P1 RepA (the expression strain was a gift from Dr. D. Chattoraj, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was expressed and purified as described (31Abeles A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3548-3555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the stock solution in assay buffer was determined with the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Bovine α-lactalbumin (type III) was purchased from Sigma. For permanent denaturation, α-lactalbumin (850 μm) was dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 m Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.6, containing 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Pierce) as reducing agent and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The sulfhydryl groups of the 8 cysteine residues were reacted with 500 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and the denatured protein was transferred into 3 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, with a PD-10 column and stored at -80 °C. The molecular mass of reduced and carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLA) was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and the concentration (420 μm) of the stock solution was determined with the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptides pp (CALLQSRLLLSAPRRAAATARA) and p4 (CALLQSRLLS), both derivatives of the prepiece of chicken mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, were custom-synthesized by Chiron, Australia, or synthesized by Dr. S. Klauser in our Institute with an ABI 430A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). The concentration of the stock solution of pp in 1 mm dithiothreitol was determined by amino acid analysis. Peptide p4 was acrylodan-labeled and purified as described (19Siegenthaler R.K. Grimshaw J.P. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The concentration of the acrylodan-labeled peptide p4 (a-p4) stock solution in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile was determined photometrically with ϵ380 = 20,000 m-1 cm-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). ATP-Na2 (purity >98%) and ADP-Na2 (purity >90%) were purchased from Fluka. N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine-5′-diphosphate (MABA-ADP; a gift from Dr. J. Reinstein, Max-Planck-Institut für Medizinische Forschung, Heidelberg, Germany) had been synthesized as described (32Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). [2,5′,8-3H]Adenosine-5′-triphosphate ammonium salt (37.0 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Equilibrium Fluorescence Measurements—A PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorimeter LS50B, equipped with a stirrer and a thermostated cuvette holder, was used to record fluorescence emission spectra of a-DnaK H541C. The excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm (band pass 4 nm), and the spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm (band pass 4 nm). The dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) of a-DnaK H541C for RepA, RCMLA, or pp were determined by fluorescence titration. The Kd values were obtained from least squares fits of the fluorescence emission intensity of a-DnaK H541C at 500 nm (F) as a function of substrate concentration to the equation, F=F0+PL⋅(Fmax−F0)/Pt=F0+((Fmax−F0)/(2Pt))((Kd+Lt+Pt)−((Kd+Lt+Pt)2−4Pt⋅Lt)0.5)(Eq. 1) where PL represents the concentration of a-DnaK H541C·substrate complex, Pt is the total concentration of a-DnaK H541C, Lt is the total substrate concentration, F0 is the emission intensity of a-DnaK H541C in the absence of substrate, and Fmax is the emission intensity in the presence of substrate at saturating concentrations. All experiments were performed in assay buffer at a volume of 800 μl in a 1 × 0.4-cm cuvette. Fluorescence intensity and concentration of substrate were linearly corrected for the increasing sample volume during titration. Analogous calculations based on the difference in area between 440 and 600 nm gave virtually the same Kd values. Fast Kinetic Fluorescence Measurements—An SX18 MV stopped-flow apparatus from Applied Photophysics served to record changes in the fluorescence emission intensity of a-DnaK H541C, a-p4, and MABA-ADP. a-DnaK H541C and a-p4 were excited at 370 nm (band pass 4.5 nm), and MABA-ADP was excited at 360 nm (band pass 5.0 nm). The emitted light passed through a high pass filter with a 455-nm cut-off. The temperature of the syringes and the cuvette was controlled with a circulating water bath (±0.5 °C). The solutions were equilibrated for at least 3 min at the respective temperature before starting the reaction by mixing 70 μl of each solution. All experiments were performed in assay buffer. Reaction traces of at least four measurements were averaged. The second-order binding rate constants (k1) and the dissociation rate constants (k-1) of a-DnaK H541C for RepA, RCMLA, or pp were obtained from least squares fits of the observed pseudo-first order rate constant of complex formation (kobs) as a function of substrate concentration to the equation, kobs = k1 × [substrate] + k-1. The dissociation constant of the first step in complex formation (K-1) was calculated as K-1 = k-1/k1. K-1 should not be mistaken for the overall dissociation equilibrium constant Kd, which was determined by fluorescence titration. Single-turnover ATPase Activity—To preform ATP·DnaK complexes, DnaK was incubated with excess radioactively labeled ATP for 10 min at 4 °C. DnaK-bound ATP was separated from free ATP by rapid size exclusion chromatography with a Sephadex G-50 NICK column (Amersham Biosciences) in assay buffer at 4 °C as described (33McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). DnaJ was preincubated in assay buffer in the absence and presence of RepA, RCMLA, or pp for 3 min at the indicated temperatures, and ATP hydrolysis was started by the addition of ATP·DnaK complex to a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was quenched at certain time points by mixing 4 μl of the sample solution with 4 μl of formic acid. ADP was separated from ATP on poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose thin layer plates (Merck) with 1 m formic acid, 0.7 m lithium chloride as eluant. ATP and ADP were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. A least squares fit of the increase in ADP concentration with time to a single-exponential equation gave the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis. Steady-state ATPase Activity—Test tubes containing DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE in assay buffer were preincubated in the absence and presence of RepA, RCMLA, or pp for 3 min at the indicated temperature. ATP hydrolysis was started by the addition of 10 μm (or 100 μm in the case of RepA) radioactively labeled ATP. The final volume of the sample solution was 50 μl. The production of ADP was followed as described above. In all assays, the fraction of ATP hydrolyzed did not exceed 20% of the initial concentration. The extent of spontaneous ATP hydrolysis during the assay was negligible. We determined the kinetics of the following phases in the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone cycle (Fig. 1): (i) binding and release of protein substrates to and from ATP·DnaK by real-time recording of changes in the fluorescence of a-DnaK H541C; (ii) T → R conversion, including the cis-effect of DnaJ on the (ATP·DnaK)·protein complexes; and (iii) R → T conversion, including the thermosensor effect of GrpE. All assays were run at 25, 37, and 45 °C. The concentrations of the chaperones were set at 500 nm DnaK, 100 nm DnaJ, and 200 nm GrpE in accord with the estimated concentration ratios of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE = 5:1:2 in the cell (18Liu X. Concentrations of the GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE Molecular Chaperones in Escherichia coli under Normal and Heat Shock Conditions.

Fluorescence-labeled a-DnaK H541C—To label DnaK with the thiol-reactive, environmentally sensitive fluorophore acrylodan, we introduced an additional cysteine residue in DnaK by amino acid substitution. Because DnaK has only one cysteine residue, which is located in its ATPase domain and is easily blocked with ATP (35Feifel B. Regulation of the Chaperone Action of the Escherichia coli DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE System by Peptide Ligands. Universität Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland1998Google Scholar), any new cysteine residue, if in an accessible position, can be specifically labeled. We tested several positions (i.e. His541 (35Feifel B. Regulation of the Chaperone Action of the Escherichia coli DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE System by Peptide Ligands. Universität Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland1998Google Scholar), Met469 (36Tanaka N. Nakao S. Wadai H. Ikeda S. Chatellier J. Kunugi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on the criteria of fluorescence signal quality, maintained ATPase activity and chaperone efficacy in the luciferase refolding assay, we chose a-DnaK H541C for experimentation (Fig. 2). The molecular activity of a-DnaK H541C (500 nm) was the same as that of WT DnaK for ATP hydrolysis (kcat′ = 0.008 s-1) in the presence of 100 nm DnaJ and 200 nm GrpE under steady-state conditions at 25 °C. In the luciferase refolding assay, the same rate and yield was obtained with a-DnaK H541C as with WT DnaK (not shown). Moreover, the far-UV circular dichroism spectra of a-DnaK H541C and WT DnaK were almost identical (not shown). We compared the complex formation of fluorescence-labeled a-DnaK H541C and peptide pp with the complex formation of WT DnaK and fluorescence-labeled peptide a-pp. The Kd values of a-DnaK H541C for pp in the presence of ATP or ADP were determined by fluorescence titration (Fig. 3A). Binding of pp to a-DnaK H541C resulted in an increase in fluorescence emission intensity and a blue shift in the wavelength of maximum emission. The Kd values calculated from the hyperbolic titration curves (Fig. 3B) were close to the previously determined values of WT DnaK for a-pp (Table 1). The second-order binding rate constant (k1) and the dissociation rate constant (k-1) of ATP·a-DnaK H541C for pp were determined by measuring the observed pseudo-first order rate constant of complex formation (kobs) as a function of pp concentration (Fig. 3C). The progress curves were best described with a double-exponential equation. The kobs value of the first phase (amplitude ∼80% of total) was linearly proportional to the pp concentration (Fig. 3D). The derived values of k1 and k-1 were of the same order of magnitude as those of WT DnaK for a-pp (Table 1). The kobs value of the second, ∼10 times slower phase of complex formation (amplitude ∼20% of total) increased hyperbolically with increasing concentration of pp (not shown), suggesting that the rapid formation of an encounter complex is followed by a slower isomerization step. The similarity of a-DnaK H541C with WT DnaK regarding ATPase activity, performance in the luciferase refolding assay, and far-UV circular dichroism spectra as well as the similar values of the binding parameters of a-DnaK H541C for pp and WT DnaK for a-pp qualify a-DnaK H541C as a suitable means for investigating the interaction of DnaK with protein substrates. For monitoring the T → R and R → T conversions, however, a-DnaK H541C proved unsatisfactory, because the difference in the fluorescence signal between the two states under the chosen conditions was too small for reliable measurements.TABLE 1Rate constants (k1 and k–1) and dissociation equilibrium constants for a-DnaK H541C·pp and WT DnaK·a-pp complexes in the presence of ATP at 25 °CComplexk1 (+ATP)k–1 (+ATP)K–1 (+ATP)Kd (+ATP)Kd (+ADP)m–1 s–1s–1μmμmμma-DnaK H541C·pp880,000aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D1.2aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D1.4aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D1.3bDetermined by fluorescence titration (Fig. 3B)0.09cDetermined by fluorescence titration of 100 nm a-DnaK H541C with pp (0.025–1.0 μm) in the presence of 1 mm ADP (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”)WT DnaK·a-ppdData from Ref. 6450,000aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D1.8aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D4.0aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D2.2aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3D0.06aK–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3Da K–1 = k–1/k1; calculated from the data of Fig. 3Db Determined by fluorescence titration (Fig. 3B)c Determined by fluorescence titration of 100 nm a-DnaK H541C with pp (0.025–1.0 μm) in the presence of 1 mm ADP (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”)d Data from Ref. 6Schmid D.

Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Such protein segments typically reside in the interior of folded proteins and are only exposed in nascent or denatured proteins. Hence, it is difficult to find proteins that are substrates for DnaK under nondenaturing conditions yet do not tend to aggregate. RepA as well as RCMLA were found to fulfill these criteria. RepA, an initiator protein of bacteriophage P1 plasmid replication of 32 kDa, binds to DnaK in its native state (38Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). RCMLA (14 kDa) is a permanently denatured but soluble substrate for DnaK (39Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We followed complex formation of ATP·a-DnaK H541C with RepA, RCMLA, and, for comparison, peptide pp at 25, 37, and 45 °C. The k1, k-1, K-1, and Kd values for the proteins RepA and RCMLA were at all temperatures found to be of the same order of magnitude as the values for peptide pp (Table 2). The k1 and k-1 values for RepA and RCMLA followed an Arrhenius temperature dependence between 25 and 45 °C as found for pp, indicating that neither of these proteins undergoes major structural changes between 25 and 45 °C. The K-1 values of RepA, RCMLA, and pp did not significantly change between 25 °C and 45 °C as described previously for the Kd values of fluorescence-labeled NR peptide (19Siegenthaler R.K.

https://openalex.org/W2004865667,"Neprilysin is a cell surface peptidase that catalytically inactivates neuropeptide substrates and functions as a tumor suppressor via its enzymatic function and multiple protein-protein interactions. We investigated whether neutral endopeptidase could inhibit angiogenesis in vivo utilizing a murine corneal pocket angiogenesis model and found that it reduced fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis by 85% (p < 0.0151515156) but had no effect on that of vascular endothelial growth factor. Treatment with recombinant neprilysin, but not enzymatically inactive neprilysin, resulted in a slight increase in basic fibroblast growth factor electrophoretic mobility from proteolytic cleavage between amino acids Leu-135 and Gly-136, which was inhibited by the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor CGS24592 and heparin. Cleavage kinetics were rapid, comparable with that of other known neprilysin substrates. Functional studies involving neprilysin-expressing vascular endothelial cells demonstrated that neutral endopeptidase inhibition significantly enhanced fibroblast growth factor-mediated endothelial cell growth, capillary array formation, and signaling, whereas exogenous recombinant neprilysin inhibited signaling. Recombinant constructs confirmed that cleavage products neither promoted capillary array formation nor induced signaling. Moreover, mutation of the cleavage site resulted in concomitant loss of cleavage and increased the potency of fibroblast growth factor-2 to induce capillary array formation. These data indicate that neprilysin proteolytically inactivates fibroblast growth factor-2, resulting in negative regulation of angiogenesis.

Neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11, CD10) is a 90-110-kDa cell surface peptidase normally expressed by a variety of tissues, including epithelial cells of the prostate, kidney, intestine, endometrium, adrenal glands, and lung. This enzyme cleaves peptide bonds on the amino side of hydrophobic amino acids and inactivates a variety of physiologically active peptides, including atrial natriuretic factor, substance P, bradykinin, oxytocin, Leu- and Met-enkephalins, neurotensin, bombesin, endothelin-1, and β-amyloid. Loss or a decrease in neprilysin expression has been reported in a variety of malignancies, including renal cancer, invasive bladder cancer, poorly differentiated stomach cancer, small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancers, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer (1Papandreou C.N.

Reduced expression of cell surface peptidases such as neprilysin results in the accumulation of higher peptide concentrations that mediate neoplastic progression (3Nanus D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6307-6309PubMed Google Scholar).Using prostate cancer as a model to study the involvement of neprilysin in malignancy, we have demonstrated the following. 1) Neprilysin protein expression is absent in nearly 50% of primary prostate cancers (2Osman I.

This complex competitively blocks the interaction between focal adhesion kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Sumitomo M. Shen R. Walburg M. Dai J. Geng Y. Navarro D. Boileau G. Papandreou C.N.

Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 5) Neprilysin directly interacts with the PTEN tumor suppressor protein, recruiting endogenous PTEN to the cell membrane, leading to prolonged PTEN protein stability and increased PTEN phosphatase activity and resulting in a constitutive down-regulation of Akt activity (7Sumitomo M.

Taken together, these studies have demonstrated that neprilysin protein functions to suppress and inhibit many processes that contribute to neoplastic progression.Enzymatically active neprilysin is also expressed by vascular endothelial cells of venous and arterial origin (9Llorens-Cortes C. Huang H. Vicart P. Gasc J.M. Paulin D. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14012-14018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neprilysin substrate endothelin-1 has previously been shown to act directly on endothelial cells via the ETB receptor to modulate different stages of neovascularization, including proliferation, migration, invasion, protease production, and morphogenesis, resulting in neovascularization in vivo (10Bagnato A. Spinella F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 44-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we investigated whether neprilysin also functions as an antagonist of angiogenesis. We report here that neprilysin is indeed anti-angiogenic in vivo, significantly inhibiting angiogenesis. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that neprilysin catalytically inactivates the potent angiogenic factor, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). 3The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MTT, methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium; rNEP, recombinant neprilysin; tHBMEC, SV40-transduced human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MTT, methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium; rNEP, recombinant neprilysin; tHBMEC, SV40-transduced human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and growth factor-reduced Matrigel were purchased from BD Biosciences, and recombinant fibroblast growth factor-2 was purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc.Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry—Commercially available recombinant FGF-2 was incubated at a concentration of 5-13 μm with recombinant neprilysin (rNEP; Arris Pharmaceutical, Inc.) at a concentration of 0.4-1.0 μm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer for 1 h at 25°C in the presence or absence of 10 μm the specific neprilysin inhibitor CGS24592 (Novartis Pharmaceutical, Inc.) or 12 units/ml heparin sulfate. Reaction aliquots were analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining or by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; Micromass) in the mass spectroscopy core facility of Weill Medical College.GST-FGF-2 and Maltose-binding Protein-FGF-2 Fusion Proteins—Full-length human FGF-2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Rifkin, New York University Medical Center) was used as template to amplify the entire FGF-2 cDNA, which was then subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pMAL-2Cx (New England Biolabs) vectors using PCR primers containing restriction sites to enable directional cloning. The following amplimers were used: 5′-ACCATGGCAGCCGGGAGCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATATGAATTCTCAGCTCTTAGCAGACATGGAAGAAAG-3′ (antisense) for glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and 5′-ATGGCAGCCGGGAGCATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCCAAGCTTTTAGCTCTTAGCAGACAT-3′ (antisense) for maltose-binding protein fusion proteins, as previously described (13Olsen E. Mohapatra S.S. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1992; 98: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For GST constructs, the PCR product was then purified and digested with EcoRI and BamHI, generating the BamHI-EcoRI fragment corresponding to amino acids 136-155 and a BamHI-BamHI fragment corresponding to amino acids 1-135 of the FGF-2 protein. The restriction fragments were subcloned into pGEX-2T to generate GST fusion proteins with FGF-2 amino acids 1-155 (full-length), 1-135 (N-terminal neprilysin cleavage product), and 136-155 (C-terminal neprilysin cleavage product), and DNA sequencing was performed to confirm their accuracy. For maltose-binding protein constructs, the PCR product was digested with HindIII and XmnI and subcloned into the pMAL-2Cx vector. Fusion proteins of GST and maltose-binding protein with FGF-2 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli BL21 cells using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) or amylase beads (New England Biolabs) as described (14Goodman Jr., O.B.

CGS24592 at a concentration of 0.5-10 nm, phosphoramidon (30 μm; Sigma), or an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle (Me2SO) was added to inhibit neprilysin activity for 2 h, followed by FGF-2 proteins at 0.3-50 nm concentrations.

Studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee of Weill Medical College of Cornell University.Neprilysin Enzyme Assays—Neprilysin enzyme activity determinations were performed as previously described (1Papandreou C.N. Usmani B. Geng Y. Bogenrieder T. Freeman R. Wilk S. Finstad C.L. Reuter V.E. Powell C.T. Scheinberg D. Magill C. Scher H.I. Albino A.P. Nanus D.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) Briefly, subconfluent cells were rinsed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS (3-[3-cholamidopropyl-dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Total neprilysin activity was assayed colorimetrically, and specific activities representing an average of six independent measurements were expressed in units of pmol/μg protein/min.Western Blotting for GST, Total, and Phosphorylated Extracellular-regulated Kinase (ERK)—Subconfluent monolayers of tHBMEC, HUVEC, and LNCaP cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.25% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) following 2-h pretreatment with 10 nm CGS24592 or vehicle and then treated for 20 min with various combinations of FGF-2, GST, or GST-FGF-2 fusion proteins, and rNEP as indicated. Lysates (50 μg each) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 0.5 h, and blotted in 3% bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 using either anti-GST antibody (B14; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-phospho-ERK (197G2; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology) as indicated for 1 h. This was followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse for B14 or donkey anti-rabbit for 197G2; Amersham Biosciences) at 1:4000 dilution for 0.5 h, enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and exposure to Kodak Biomax XAR film. Anti-phospho-ERK blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and reprobed with anti-ERK (C14; 1:1000; Santa Cruz) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Films were scanned using an HP scanner and subjected to densitometric analysis using ImageJ and GraphPad software.RESULTSNeprilysin Cleaves FGF-2 Protein between Residues Leucine 135 and Glycine 136—To test the hypothesis that neprilysin could regulate angiogenesis in vivo, we used the murine corneal pocket assay to study the effect of rNEP on neovascularization induced by either FGF-2 or VEGF. In this assay, hydron pellets containing various concentrations of FGF-2 were implanted in the cornea ∼1 mm from the limbus and neovascularization measured 5 days later. As shown in Fig. 1, rNEP significantly inhibited FGF-2-induced neovascularization (p < 0.01) but had no effect on that of VEGF. These results suggested the possibility that FGF-2 was inactivated catalytically by neprilysin. Basic FGF is a potent proangiogenic, heparin-binding growth factor, with a primary translation product of 155 amino acids. Neprilysin hydrolyzes peptide bonds on the amino side of neutral residues; however, a protein of 155 amino acids is theoretically too large to be a substrate for neprilysin, as previous identified substrates are less than 43 amino acids (19Kenny J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Howell S. Nalbantoglu J. Crine P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To test whether neprilysin could hydrolyze FGF-2, we incubated rNEP with recombinant FGF-2 for 1 h and separated the products on a 14% polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant VEGF was used as control. As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 1, arrow), the molecular weight of FGF-2 protein, but not VEGF protein, was appreciably lower following rNEP incubation. The increased electrophoretic mobility of FGF-2 incubated with rNEP was blocked by the specific neprilysin inhibitor CGS24592 (21Maniara W.M. Cipriano A. Powell M.L. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 706: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), indicating that neprilysin and not a contaminating protease cleaved FGF-2 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). To confirm neprilysin specifically cleaves FGF-2, we performed the same digestion using either immunoprecipitated wild-type neprilysin (WT5) or enzymatically inactive neprilysin (M22) expressed using tetracycline-repressible promoter (4Sumitomo M. Milowsky M.I. Shen R. Navarro D. Dai J. Asano T. Hayakawa M. Nanus D.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3294-3298PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated that an intact enzyme activity is both necessary and sufficient to observe FGF-2 cleavage (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Neprilysin enzymatic activity cleaves FGF-2 protein.

Lane 1, Me2SO vehicle (control); lane 2, 3 μm CGS24592; lane 3, 1 μm rNEP + 12.5 μm FGF-2; lane 4, 1 μm rNEP + 12.5 μm FGF-2 + 3 μm CGS24592. Note that the addition of CGS24592 blocks the faster migration of FGF-2 protein treated with rNEP (lane 4 compared with lane 3). C, lysates from TSU-Pr1-derived WT5 and M22 cells cultured in tetracycline-free medium for 48 h containing 500 μgof total protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with J5 antibody and incubated with 100 ng of FGF-2 for 4 h at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for both FGF-2 and neprilysin. Note the increased electrophoretic mobility seen with wild-type neprilysin (WT5), but not enzymatically deficient neprilysin (M22). D, FGF-2 (12 μm) and neprilysin (400 nm) were incubated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl and aliquots removed at the various times (1-230 min), quenched with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained intact FGF-2 (upper arrow on right) was then quantified densitometrically (NIH ImageJ software) and expressed graphically as the percentage of intact FGF-2, with 100% defined as the intensity of the intact FGF-2 band at time 0, just prior to addition of rNEP. E, recombinant neprilysin was incubated with FGF-2 with (upper panel) or without (lower panel) CGS24592 and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Note the presence of a 2019-Da band, which corresponds to amino acids 136-155 of the FGF-2 protein in the absence of CGS24592.

Note heparin inhibits the faster migration of FGF-2 protein treated with rNEP (lane 2). Lanes 1 and 4 are controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that FGF-2 cleavage occurs rapidly under physiologically relevant conditions, we assessed the kinetics of FGF-2 proteolysis by neprilysin, using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:30 and monitoring reaction progression using SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2D, 50% of FGF-2 was cleaved within the first 5-10 min, indicating rapid reaction kinetics.Next the neprilysin cleavage site on FGF-2 was localized. Fibroblast growth factor-2 and rNEP were combined with or without the neprilysin inhibitor CGS24592 and analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This identified a specific 2019-Da band produced in the absence of CGS24592 that corresponded precisely to a 20-amino acid peptide located at the C terminus of the FGF-2 protein (Fig. 2E). Examination of the FGF-2 amino acid sequence confirmed the potential neprilysin cleavage site between leucine 135 and glycine 136 (22Abraham J.A. Whang J.L. Tumolo A. Mergia A. Fiddes J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 657-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correlation with the three-dimensional structure of FGF-2 (23Kastrup J.S. Eriksson E.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicated that the neprilysin recognition site was located at the outer edge of the FGF-2 protein, suggesting that it could fit into the neprilysin active site (Fig. 2F).Basic FGF is primarily stored in the extracellular matrix and basement membrane associated with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Activity of FGF-2 is controlled in part by a low affinity but high capacity interaction with HSPG. Free FGF-2 may be proteolytically degraded, as suggested by in vitro reactivity of the C-terminal portion of FGF-2 to trypsin and chymotrypsin (24Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 138: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Kajio T. Kawahara K. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that HSPG binding could protect FGF-2 from degradation by neprilysin because leucine 135 and glycine 136 of the FGF-2 protein lie within a basic region where heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides have been reported to complex with FGF-2 (26Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Incubation of rNEP and FGF-2 plus heparin (12 units/ml) showed that heparin completely inhibited the ability of neprilysin to cleave FGF-2 (Fig. 2G, lane 2 compared with lane 3). Together, these data suggest that FGF-2 is a neprilysin substrate and that HSPG protects FGF-2 from neprilysin cleavage.Endogenous Neprilysin Expressed on Human Vascular Endothelial Cells Negatively Regulates FGF-2-induced Angiogenesis—Previous studies indicate that neprilysin is expressed by human vascular endothelial cells (9Llorens-Cortes C.

Investig. 1997; 76: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar) and HUVEC revealed neprilysin enzyme-specific activities of 197 pmol/μg/min and 36 pmol/μg/min, respectively (data not shown). To assess the functional effect of endogenous neprilysin on FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vitro, we used a capillary array formation assay to measure the effects of FGF-2 with and without the neprilysin inhibitor CGS24592 in tHBMEC cells plated on Matrigel-coated plates. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells grown in the presence of FGF-2 and CGS24592 demonstrated significantly more arrays compared with cells grown in FGF-2 alone, CGS24592 alone, or the untreated negative control (p < 0.05). We next assessed endothelial cell growth in tHBMEC treated with 600 pg/ml FGF-2 and with increasing concentrations of CGS24592. Transduced HBMEC incorporated more MTT as a function of CGS24592 concentration, suggesting that inhibition of endogenous neprilysin activity results in increased FGF-2-induced cell growth (p < 0.03, Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained for HUVEC cells (data not shown). These data show that neprilysin expressed on vascular endothelial cells regulates FGF-2-induced angiogenesis.FIGURE 3Endogenous neprilysin inhibition enhances FGF-2-induced angiogenesis. A, transduced human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cells were assayed using a Matrigel capillary array formation assay. Cells were plated on growth factor-reduced Matrigel in the presence (+) or absence (-) of CGS24592 (30 nm) for 2 h followed by the addition of FGF-2 (5 ng/ml) for 4 h as indicated.

Bacterial LPS is recognized by MD-2, which is associated with the extracellular domain of TLR4. Understanding the molecular recognition pattern of MD-2 could lead to efficient inhibitors of the excessive LPS signaling needed for early treatment of sepsis. The effect of the acyl chain variability of lipid A on its biological activity indicates that in addition to electrostatic interactions, the recognition must also involve hydrophobic interactions. We show that the fluorescent hydrophobic probe bis-ANS binds to MD-2 with a dissociation constant in the 10 nanomolar range, both to glycosylated and to nonglycosylated MD-2, and requires its native conformation. The binding site of bis-ANS overlaps with the binding site of LPS and is in the proximity of the single tryptophan residue. Furthermore, photoincorporation of bis-ANS by UV light inhibits the ability of MD-2 to confer the LPS responsiveness to the TLR4-transfected HEK293 cell line. Our results show that the structural pattern recognized by MD-2 is defined by the hydrophobic patch and a pair of separated negative charges."

https://openalex.org/W2094425417,"Glycopeptides and β-lactams are the major antibiotics available for the treatment of infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. Emergence of cross-resistance to these drugs by a single mechanism has been considered as unlikely because they inhibit peptidoglycan polymerization by different mechanisms. The glycopeptides bind to the peptidyl-d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors and block by steric hindrance the essential glycosyltransferase and d,d-transpeptidase activities of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The β-lactams are structural analogues of d-Ala4-d-Ala5 and act as suicide substrates of the d,d-transpeptidase module of the PBPs. Here we have shown that bypass of the PBPs by the recently described β-lactam-insensitive l,d-transpeptidase from Enterococcus faecium (Ldtfm) can lead to high level resistance to glycopeptides and β-lactams. Cross-resistance was selected by glycopeptides alone or serially by β-lactams and glycopeptides. In the corresponding mutants, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was extensively converted to UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide following hydrolysis of d-Ala5, thereby providing the substrate of Ldtfm. Complete elimination of d-Ala5, a residue essential for glycopeptide binding, was possible because Ldtfm uses the energy of the l-Lys3-d-Ala4 peptide bond for cross-link formation in contrast to PBPs, which use the energy of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 bond. This novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance was unrelated to the previously identified replacement of d-Ala5 by d-Ser or d-lactate.

This novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance was unrelated to the previously identified replacement of d-Ala5 by d-Ser or d-lactate. Therapeutic usage of antibiotics has invariably led to emergence of resistance in target pathogens and members of commensal flora submitted to the same selective pressure. This scenario differs greatly between antibiotics with respect to the time period separating initial drug marketing and emergence of resistance (1Walsh C. Nature. 2000; 406: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Detoxification of penicillin was recognized before the first therapeutic usage of the drug (2Rammelkamp C.H. Maxon T. Proc. Soc. Exper. Biol. Med. 1942; 51: 386-389Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and acquisition of resistance was immediately a medical concern (3Abraham E.P. Chain E. Nature. 1940; 146: 837Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In contrast, acquired resistance to glycopeptides was detected for the first time in enterococci 28 years after vancomycin had been launched in 1956 (4Leclercq R. Derlot E. Duval J. Courvalin P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). During this unusually long delay, glycopeptides were considered as “irresistible” antibiotics, and it has been rationalized that this class of drugs remained unharmed because of its unique mode of action (5Reynolds P.E. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1989; 8: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The drugs bind to the peptidyl-d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors at the bacterial cell surface and block the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions by steric hindrance (Fig. 1A). This mode of action implies that acquisition of resistance cannot be easily achieved because modification of the target is limited by the specificity of multiple biosynthetic enzymes (5Reynolds P.E. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1989; 8: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), including the Ddl ligase for synthesis of d-Ala-d-Ala, the MurF ligase for addition of the resulting dipeptide to the nascent cytoplasmic precursor, and the d,d-transpeptidases for peptidoglycan cross-linking in the last step of peptidoglycan polymerization (6van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The latter reaction is catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MS, mass spectrometry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; rp-HPLC, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography; d-Lac, d-lactate or d-lactoyl. 2The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MS, mass spectrometry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; rp-HPLC, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography; d-Lac, d-lactate or d-lactoyl. that cleave the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 bond of a donor stem pentapeptide and link the carboxyl of d-Ala4 to the amino group of the side chain carried by the third residue of an acceptor stem peptide (Fig. 1A).Glycopeptide resistance has emerged in the enterococci (4Leclercq R. Derlot E. Duval J. Courvalin P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar) by acquisition of transposon Tn1546, which mediates production of precursors terminating in d-lactate (d-Lac) instead of d-Ala (7Arthur M. Molinas C. Depardieu F. Courvalin P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 8Arthur M. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The substitution leads to a 1,000-fold reduction in the affinity of vancomycin for its target (9Bugg T.D. Wright G.D. Dutka-Malen S. Arthur M. Courvalin P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10408-10415Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Tn1546 encodes two biosynthetic enzymes for reduction of pyruvate into d-Lac (VanH) and synthesis of the depsipeptide d-Ala-d-Lac (VanA) (8Arthur M. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, elimination of precursors ending in d-Ala is required for resistance. This function is carried out by two Tn1546-encoded d,d-peptidases that hydrolyze d-Ala-d-Ala (VanX) and cytoplasmic precursors containing a stem pentapeptide (VanY) (10Arthur M. Depardieu F. Cabanie L. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Dissemination of Tn1546 and related elements specifying the production of precursors ending in d-Ala-d-Lac is currently responsible for the high incidence of glycopeptide resistance in the enterococci and its emergence in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (11Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMorb. Mortal Wkly. Rep. 2002; 51: 902PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang S. Sievert D.M. Hageman J. Boulton C.M. Tenover F.C. Downes F.P. Shah S. Rudrik J.T. Pupp G.R. Brown W.J. Cardo D. Fridkin S.K. the Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Investigative Team.N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). In addition, low level resistance to vancomycin can result from production of precursors ending in d-Ser (13Billot-Klein D. Gutmann L. Sable S. Guittet E. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2398-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Reynolds P.E. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, substitution of d-Ala by d-2-hydroxybutyrate and d-2-hydroxyvalerate has been obtained in mutants constructed in vitro (15Arthur M. Molinas C. Bugg T.D. Wright G.D. Walsh C.T. Courvalin P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 867-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).In this report, in vitro selection of high level resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium has been reevaluated in the light of our recent characterization of an l,d-transpeptidase (Ldtfm) that specifically cross-links stem tetrapeptides lacking d-Ala5 in a β-lactam-insensitive reaction (Fig. 1B) (16Mainardi J.L. Fourgeaud M. Hugonnet J.E. Dubost L. Brouard J.P. Ouazzani J. Rice L.B. Gutmann L. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38146-38152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because d-Ala5 is essential for glycopeptide binding (17Nieto M. Perkins H.R. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 789-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), peptidoglycan cross-linking by Ldtfm cannot be inhibited by these drugs. Here, we have shown that activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway can also release inhibition of transglycosylation, leading to cross-resistance to glycopeptides and β-lactams following extensive hydrolysis of d-Ala5 from the cytoplasmic precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide by a d,d-carboxypeptidase. Characterization of this novel mechanism of glycopeptide resistance establishes for the first time that the fifth C-terminal residue of the stem peptide is dispensable for peptidoglycan polymerization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Selection of Mutants Resistant to Glycopeptides—All cultures were performed at 37 °C in brain heart infusion agar or broth (Difco Laboratories). A standard procedure was used for selection of mutants resistant to glycopeptides (18Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J.

Briefly, an inoculum of 4 × 109 colony-forming units was prepared in broth and plated on agar containing 2-fold-increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Selection steps that gave negative results were repeated with 1.3-fold-increasing drug concentrations (selection of mutants G3 and G4). Mutants appeared after 3–5 days of incubation with a frequency of ∼10–9 (1–15 colonies/plate). The selection procedure was repeated at each step with a mutant growing in the presence of the highest drug concentration.

Ice-cold formic acid (47 ml, 1.1 m) was rapidly added to the bacterial pellet, and nucleotide precursors were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged (7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 6.0 with ammonium hydroxide and lyophilized.

A methanol gradient (0–20%) was applied between 29 and 47 min, and elution was continued for 20 min with 20% methanol. The relative abundance of the UDP-MurNAc-peptides was estimated by the percent of the integrate area of peaks detected by the absorbance at 262 nm.

Selection led to mutant M512, which is highly resistant to ampicillin, whereas resistance to glycopeptides was not tested. As shown in Fig. 2A, acquisition of high level resistance to ampicillin in M512 (MIC >2,000 μg/ml) led only to a marginal increase (2-fold) in the MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin. Thus, activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway was not sufficient in itself for glycopeptide resistance. Four additional steps of selection with glycopeptides were required to obtain mutant M9 that was cross-resistant to high levels of ampicillin and glycopeptides (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2MICs of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin for derivatives of E. faecium D344S.

Mutant G9 was obtained from D344S by nine serial selection steps on agar containing increasing concentrations of glycopeptides (Fig. 2B). The selection procedure led to 250- and 1,000-fold increases in the MICs of vancomycin (from 4 to 1,000 μg/ml) and teicoplanin (from 0.25 to 250 μg/ml). Even though ampicillin was not used, the selection procedure led also to the acquisition of high level resistance to this antibiotic with a >36,000-fold increase in its MIC (from 0.06 to >2,000 μg/ml). This is the first report of emergence of cross-resistance to β-lactams under the selective pressure of glycopeptides.UDP-MurNAc-Tetrapeptide Is the Main Cytoplasmic Peptidoglycan Precursor of Mutant M9 and G9—To gain insight into the mechanism of resistance, the structure of cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors was determined by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The parental strain D344S produced mainly UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (93%) and small amounts of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide (7%). Activation of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway in mutant M512 led to an increase in the pool of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide from 7 to 60%. The proportion of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was further increased in mutants M9 (>99%) and G9 (92%). Thus, co-production of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was associated with resistance to ampicillin only, whereas extensive elimination of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was associated with cross-resistance to ampicillin and glycopeptides. Strikingly, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was undetectable in M9, indicating that the wild-type precursor is dispensable for peptidoglycan synthesis in this mutant.FIGURE 3MS/MS analysis of peak at m/z 1,079.35 corresponding to UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide. Cytoplasmic nucleotide precursors of mutant M9 were purified, separated by rp-HPLC, and identified by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. Fragmentation of the peak at m/z 1,079.35 gave ions at m/z 675.27 and 490.19 corresponding to the MurNAc-tetrapeptide and lactoyl-tetrapeptide moieties of the molecule. Peak at m/z 401.21 matched the predicted value for loss of the d-alanine residue at the C-terminal position of lactoyl-tetrapeptide (m/z 490.19). Loss of additional l-Lys and d-Glu gave ions at m/z 273.14 and 144.05, respectively. The peaks at m/z 347.19, 258.12, 218.14, and 129.09 matched the expected mass of d-iGlu-l-Lys-d-Ala, d-iGlu-l-Lys, l-Lys-d-Ala, and l-Lys, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Characteristics of E. faecium D344S and derivatives selected on glycopeptide and β-lactam antibioticsStrainMICsaVm vancomycin; Te, teicoplanin; Ap, ampicillin.UDP-MurNAc-peptidesbBacteria were grown to an optical density of 0.35 at 650 nm and treated with bacitracin 200 μg/ml for 5 min to accumulate the precursors.

Open table in a new tab Activation of a Cryptic d,d-Carboxypeptidase Is Responsible for Accumulation of UDP-MurNAc-Tetrapeptide—Membrane extracts of the parental strain D344S contained low d,d-carboxypeptidase activity (Table 1). Inhibition by ampicillin indicated that hydrolysis of pentapeptide was mediated by the d,d-peptidase activity of PBPs (18Mainardi J.L. Morel V. Fourgeaud M. Cremniter J. Blanot D. Legrand R. Frehel C. Arthur M. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35801-35807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutants M512, M9, and G9 produced an additional d,d-carboxypeptidase that was insensitive to inhibition by ampicillin (Table 1). Thus, accumulation of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide in the cytoplasm was due to hydrolysis of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide by a d,d-carboxypeptidase that was not produced by the parental strain D344S. Surprisingly, the d,d-carboxypeptidase activity was not increased in mutant M9 in comparison to M512 despite an increase in the pool of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide (from 60 to >99%).The Mutants M512, M9, and G9 Produce Wild-type Enzymes for the Assembly of UDP-MurNAc-Pentapeptide—The enzymes for incorporation of d-Ala at positions 4 and 5 of the nucleotide precursors (Fig. 1A) (6van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were further investigated to eliminate the possibility that resistance to glycopeptides involved translocation of precursors carrying substitutions at the C-terminal positions of stem peptides. We also examined by the same approach the possibility that accumulation of UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide in the cytoplasm could result from production of modified precursors that would be more sensitive to hydrolysis by d,d-carboxypeptidases than wild-type precursors.DNA sequencing revealed that mutants M512, M9, and G9 harbor wild-type Ddl and MurF ligases for synthesis of the dipeptide d-Ala-d-Ala and its addition onto UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, respectively (Fig. 1). Likewise, no mutation was detected in the aslfm gene encoding the ligase for addition of the side chain d-aspartate residue to peptidoglycan precursors (22Bellais S. Arthur M. Dubost L. Hugonnet J.E. Gutmann L. van Heijenoort J. Legrand R. Brouard J.P. Rice L. Mainardi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11586-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).To confirm the in vivo specificity of these enzymes, the precursor pools of the mutants were thoroughly investigated to look for alternate precursors (data not shown). UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was not detected, indicating that the d-Ala-d-Ala substrate of the MurF ligase was not limiting, as previously found in glycopeptide-dependent enterococci (23Baptista M. Depardieu F. Reynolds P. Courvalin P. Arthur M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Precursors containing a side chain d-iso-aspartyl or d-iso-asparaginyl residue (d-iAsx) were present in both strains. Thus, the pathway for incorporation of d-Asp into the precursors and the subsequent amidation of its α-carboxyl group was not altered in the mutants.Precursors containing d-Lac or d-Ser at the fifth position of stem peptides were not detected. Because the procedures used for the extraction of the precursors did not lead to the hydrolysis of d-alanyl-d-lactate ester bounds (data not shown), these results indicate that glycopeptide resistance in mutants M9 and G9 does not involve replacement of the C-terminal d-Ala residues of nucleotide precursors.Total Bypass of PBPs by Ldtfm in Mutant M9—The peptidoglycan of mutant M9 was analyzed by mass spectrometry to evaluate the contribution of the d,d-transpeptidase activity of PBPs and of the l,d-transpeptidase activity of Ldtfm to the formation of cross-links (Fig. 4). Sequencing of dimers by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 5) indicated that the peptidoglycan manufactured by M9 during growth in the absence of antibiotic exclusively contained l-Lys3→d-iAsx-l-Lys3 cross-links generated by l,d-transpeptidation. This indicates that the donor substrate of the d,d-transpeptidases, which contains a stem pentapeptide, was not present in mutant M9 in agreement with the analysis of cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors (Table 1). In contrast, cross-links were generated by both l,d-transpeptidation and d,d-transpeptidation in mutant M512 grown in the absence of antibiotic (data not shown and Ref. 18Mainardi J.L. Morel V.

https://openalex.org/W2138321088,"Intracellular deposition of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is an increasingly recognized pathological hallmark associated with neurodegeneration and muscle wasting in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), respectively. Previous reports have implicated dysregulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) expression in IBM. Accumulation of full-length betaAPP, its various proteolytic derivatives including Abeta, and phospho-tau into vacuolated inclusions is an early pathogenic event. We previously reported on a statistical tendency favoring fast twitch fiber involvement in IBM, reminiscent of the tissue specific patterns of misfolded protein deposition seen in neurodegenerative diseases. To test this principle, we generated an animal model in which human wild-type (WT) betaAPP expression was limited to postnatal type II skeletal muscle. Hemizygous transgenic mice harboring increased levels of holo betaAPP751 and Abeta in skeletal muscle fibers became significantly weaker with age compared with nontransgenic littermates and exhibited typical myopathic features. A subpopulation of dissociated muscle fibers from transgenic mice exhibited a 2-fold increase in resting calcium and membrane depolarization compared with nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of human betaAPP in fast twitch skeletal muscle of transgenic mice is sufficient for the development of some features characteristic of IBM, including abnormal tau histochemistry. The increase in resting calcium and depolarization are novel findings, suggesting both a mechanism for the weakness and an avenue for therapeutic intervention in IBM."

Iron plays a key role in many biological processes and is therefore an essential nutrient for living organisms. Iron acquisition is challenging for pathogenic bacteria given that in the host, free iron and iron in the form of heme is usually sequestered by high affinity binding proteins such as lactoferrin, transferrin, hemopexin, or serum albumin. The resulting low levels of free iron in tissues and in the blood serum make it difficult for microbes to grow and proliferate, thus contributing to the nonspecific host defense against pathogens. To overcome their iron dependence in this iron-limited environment, pathogenic bacteria have evolved specialized proteins to “steal” heme from the heme proteins of the host and use it as an iron source (1Andrews S.C.

Common to many Gram-negative species, the heme-scavenging HemRSTUV system from Yersinia enterocolitica consists of four interlinked but structurally distinct components culminating with the cytosolic recipient HemS (1Andrews S.C.

However, the mechanisms for heme transport, binding, and release by any of the components of the uptake system are still unexplored. HemS is presently the best studied component of the HemRSTUV system. Essential for Yersinia, HemS was originally thought to be a heme oxygenase and was also presumed to protect the cellular environment from the toxic effects of free heme (7Stojiljkovic I. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 719-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Work on the homologous protein ShuS from Shigella dysenteriae, which shares 64% sequence identity with HemS, showed that ShuS binds one heme per molecule with an affinity in the micromolar range (17Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The determination of the apo-structure of the homologous protein ChuS from Escherichia coli revealed a novel fold composed of two similar domains likely to have evolved through gene duplication and fusion (18Suits M.D. Pal G.P.

In contrast to ShuS, ChuS was argued to be a heme oxygenase and to bind two heme molecules per protein molecule. Recent work on PhuS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that this molecule binds one heme per monomer and is not a heme oxygenase but is responsible for passing heme to a heme oxygenase (19Lansky I.B.

It is therefore most likely that HemS and its homologues are heme transports facilitating transfer of heme from the uptake machinery to enzymes that either utilize heme per se or break heme down. Here we report the crystal structures of apo- and heme-bound HemS. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—HemS from Y. enterocolitica was cloned and crystallized as described previously (20Schneider S. Paoli M. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Care was taken to cleave the His tag off the protein and ensure that no tagged protein was used in crystallization experiments. To crystallize the apo-form, heme-HemS was separated from apo-HemS by ion-exchange chromatography (MonoQ, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm BisTris 2The abbreviations used are: BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. -propane, pH 6.5. Apo-HemS crystals were obtained in 100 mm Bicine, pH 9, 2.45 m ammonium sulfate, and 5% polyethylene glycol 400, with a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml. Purified samples of HemS reconstituted with heme showed a Soret peak at 411 nm, in agreement with the Soret bands previously reported for ShuS at 410 nm (17Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), ChuS at 408 nm (18Suits M.D. Pal G.P. Nakatsu K. Matte A. Cygler M. Jia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16955-16960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and PhuS at 410 nm (19Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. J. Biol.

Collection and Processing of X-ray Diffraction Data, Phase Determination, and Model Refinement—Diffraction data were measured at the synchrotron radiation source European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France (heme-HemS, wavelength 0.984 Å, BM14; apo-HemS, wavelength 0.933 Å, ID14-2) and processed with MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W.

Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar). The structure of the heme-HemS complex was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (23McCoy A.J.

Model building was carried out in COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar), and restrained refinement was carried out with REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). An optimal number of 10 TLS groups (11 for apo-HemS) was determined using the TLSMD web server for the generation of multigroup TLS models (27Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Cryst. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Data processing and model refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The refined models have excellent geometry and no Ramachandran outliers. Surface calculations were carried out using the CCP4 program AREAIMOL (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Structural superpositions were carried out with the CCP4 program LSQKAB (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). All structural figures were prepared using PyMOL (Delano Scientific) unless otherwise stated. Structure of the Heme-HemS Complex—The heme-HemS complex was solved by molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of apo-ChuS (1U9T) (18Suits M.D. Pal G.P. Nakatsu K. Matte A. Cygler M. Jia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16955-16960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and refined against data to 1.7 Å spacing. The porphyrin could be oriented with no ambiguity in well defined density peaks. Although His-196 could be clearly identified as a ligand to the iron, only very weak density at the sixth coordination position was observed. Despite the excellent definition of the map for neighboring side chains such as Arg-102, Met-244, and Ile-255 (supplemental Fig. S1), coordinates for a water or hydroxide could only be refined in the distal pocket at partial occupancy (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We presume that the iron in HemS has a sixth-coordinate water (or hydroxide); the structure shows that as the protein tightly clamps the heme between His-196 and Phe-199 on the proximal side and Arg-102, Phe-246, and Leu-92 on the distal side, the porphyrin is bent, resulting in a marked buckling of the four pyrroles away from planarity, which would make an octahedral, hexa-coordinate geometry highly distorted. Thus, the affinity for the bound water might be low, and an association/dissociation equilibrium in the crystal may cause the disorder indicated by the peaks of very weak difference density. One heme ligand is bound to HemS in the structure of the complex, showing a 1:1 stoichiometry consistent with the biochemical and spectroscopic data on the homologous proteins ShuS (17Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and PhuS (19Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13652-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, data on the protein ChuS from E. coli were interpreted as to indicate that two heme molecules bind to one protein molecule (18Suits M.D. Pal G.P. Nakatsu K. Matte A. Cygler M. Jia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16955-16960Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the case of HemS, no heme binding through dimerization or oligomerization is expected to occur since gel filtration analysis with different protein and salt concentrations showed that HemS is a monomer (supplemental Fig. S2) and does not form dimers, as in the case of PhuS from P. aeruginosa (19Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13652-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or oligomers, as for ShuS from S. dysenteriae (17Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molecular architecture of HemS is characterized by two topologically homologous domains that join, forming a pair of large, stacked central β-sheets (Fig. 1A). The twist of these sheets and the helices that pack at each end of the double sheet create two distinctive pockets (Fig. 1, A and B). Heme is bound at the deeper, more pronounced pocket, and its tetrapyrrole ring is buckled and distorted. The proximal side of the heme, which is the side with the coordinating histidine, is embraced by one α-helix (α7) from a three-helix subdomain (α6, α7, and α8); His-196 stems from the beginning of this helix. Both the distal side and the heme propionate groups are flanked by the extensive, convex face of the twisted β-sheet. Molecular Recognition of Heme by HemS—The structure of the heme-binding pocket is dominated by the large, twisted β-sheet that curves around the heme ligand. All the distal residues and the groups interacting with the propionates are provided by the sheet dome (Fig. 2A). Arg-102 lies on the distal side and packs over the porphyrin plane; its guanidinium group is placed about 4 Å from the iron and makes a salt-bridging interaction with Asp-100. This electrostatic contact is sealed away from the solvent by distal residues Leu-94 and Leu-92, which, together with Ala-90, align to form a barrier burying Arg-102 almost completely in the binding site. Arg-102 is sandwiched between Leu-92 and Ile-255. Phe-246 packs over the propionate-bearing pyrroles and completes a line of four distal residues that starts with Leu-92, Arg-102, and Ile-255. Further hydrophobic packing is provided by Met-244 and Val-253, which slot along the sides of Phe-246 (Fig. 2A). This non-polar cap gives way to a solvent-inaccessible polar and electrostatic region involving the side chains of Arg-209, Gln-316, Tyr-318, Lys-294, and Arg-321. These residues, together with two structural water molecules, engage in a series of interactions that firmly anchor the propionate groups to the interior of the protein (Fig. 2B). On the proximal side, His-196 coordinates the iron and interacts with Asp-194. Phe-199 and Val-195 pack in the vicinity of the imidazole of His-196 and make van der Waals contacts with the heme. HemS homologues, unique to the groups of α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria, share sequence identity and similarity greater than 30 and 40%, respectively (supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Residues that form the heme pocket clearly map onto conserved regions of the sequence (Fig. 1B). Comparison with Other Heme Proteins—A striking feature of the HemS-binding site is Arg-102. Interestingly, a distal arginine is present in lignin peroxidase and other plant peroxidases (29Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: S3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is over 5 Å away from the iron, as opposed to Arg-102 in HemS, which is less than 4 Å from the metal and makes van der Waals contacts with the porphyrin plane. It appears that this arginine-heme interaction is unique to HemS. The extensive network of nine electrostatic contacts (seven direct and two water-mediated) that anchor the propionate groups is likely to provide a significant contribution to the association (Fig. 2B). A similarly large set of polar/electrostatic interactions has been seen in the structure of another heme transport protein, hemopexin (31Paoli M. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Morgan W.T. Smith A. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), in which arginine, histidine, and tyrosine side chains lock the propionate groups into the complex. The only other bacterial heme carrier that has been structurally characterized is the hemophore HasA secreted by Serratia marcescens (32Arnoux P. Haser R. Izadi N. Lecroisey A. Delepierre M. Wandersman C. Czjzek M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). HasA has a totally different fold, and its heme pocket has no features in common with HemS. Conformational Changes upon Heme Binding—The structure of apo-HemS, refined against data to 1.9 Å spacing, reveals that conformational changes take place in response to ligand binding (Fig. 3). To check whether a relationship exists between structural changes and crystal packing, the lattice intermolecular contacts of the apo-HemS structure were carefully examined and compared with those in the heme-HemS complex. Even if the orthorhombic crystals of the apo- and heme-bound states of HemS do not have the same symmetry, their lattice contacts are very similar; in particular, a large area of contact, which appears to govern the packing, is in common between the two crystal forms. This therefore indicates that the structural changes observed in the apo-structure relative to the complex are highly unlikely to be an artifact of crystal packing. Local changes include the side chains of Leu-94 (distal), Phe-104 (equatorial), and Gln-316 (near propionates) that switch to a different rotamer, thus becoming engaged in interactions with the ligand. Many other residues shift closer to the porphyrin (Fig. 3). Overall, it appears that the N- and C-terminal domains close into the binding pocket. Comparison of the apo- and bound forms using a difference distance matrix indeed shows that relatively few changes take place within the individual domains, whereas marked shifts occur in the position of the domains relative to each other. Domain movements can also be evaluated by measuring the distances between the centers of gravity of secondary structure elements (supplemental Table S2). If the molecule was separated into two distinct structural entities, movements up to 4 Å affect the domains almost as rigid-body shifts. Least-squares fitting of all atoms between the two structures gives an root mean square deviation of 1.4 Å and a maximal displacement of main chain atoms of more than 4 Å. Using the secondary structure elements only of the N-domain as a frame of reference (root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å), atomic superpositions show that the whole C-domain and particularly the α6, α7, and α8 helices move toward the N-terminal distal residues and the heme (Fig. 4). A Heme-induced Fit Accompanies the Switch from Open, Apo-State to Closed, Bound State—Upon heme binding, the N- and C-terminal domains pivot to close onto the ligand, effectively acting as a clamp. The HemS structure therefore switches between an apo, open form and a liganded, closed state (Fig. 4). Strikingly, the global shifts also affect β-strands, increasing the twist of the large β-sheet that forms the dome of the binding site. The ligand can bind to the apo-structure without the need of these conformational changes to remove steric barriers. Although part of the heme pocket is preformed, some side chains reshape the pocket to increase the fit of the heme. Most notably, Phe-104 swings close to the edge of the heme interlocking the ligand in the pocket by wedging a heme vinyl group against Ala-90 (Fig. 3). The effect of ligand binding may be best described as an induced fit, as demonstrated for the glucose/hexokinase association almost three decades ago (33Bennett Jr., W.S. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the case of HemS, the heme-induced fit brings about a cleft closure with maximal atomic main chain displacements of over 4 Å, accompanied by the burial of 350 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area in addition to the area buried by the heme. Analysis of temperature factors indicate that the α6, α7, and α8 elements have higher mobility than other parts of the structure (supplemental Fig. S5), thus defining the three-helix subdomain as a flexible region key for the induced-fit binding mechanism. Structure-Function Relationships—In the heme-HemS complex, almost 60% of the solvent-accessible surface area of the ligand is buried (Fig. 1A). In HemS, the heme therefore remains significantly exposed to solvent relative to other heme proteins, which incorporate heme in such a way that 85-99.5% of the accessible area of the prosthetic group is excluded from the solvent. However, in HemS, the heme is a ligand that needs to be released as well as sequestered. The buried area of the heme in HemS is comparable with that in hemopexin (about 70%), and this may be related to the reversible binding required by the transport function of both these molecules. To release its cargo, HemS must reverse the conformational changes observed upon heme binding. Switching from the closed, loaded state to the apo, open form may require the binding of an effector molecule since conditions of extreme pH and high salt are not sufficient to induce heme loss (data not shown). In fact, it has been established that PhuS from P. aeruginosa interacts with the heme oxygenase paHO (19Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13652-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and it is possible that HemS also delivers its cargo to a heme oxygenase. It is proposed that a heme oxygenase enzyme or another effector molecule interacts with HemS and that formation of a complex would trigger the conformational switch required to unlock the heme and unload it to the oxygenase.

Here we apply such a reverse immunological strategy for mapping the cross-reactive neutralizing epitope corresponding to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) b12 specific for HIV-1 gp120. b12 was used to screen a combinatorial phage display random peptide library and nineteen 12mer cysteine-looped peptides were affinity purified. These were used as input for analysis with the predictive algorithm Mapitope. Based on the input panel of peptides and the antigen's atomic structure, Mapitope predicts candidate epitopes on the surface of the antigen. Two major clusters were predicted as candidate b12 epitopes. These could be discriminated by a series of experiments, which included point mutagenesis of selected residues and binding assays. Moreover, the prediction of the b12 epitope was further strengthened by comparison with additional predictions for two competing antibodies, b6 and m14. Finally, support of our prediction was obtained in view of the fact that b12, m14, and b6 were found to compete against mAb 17b binding to gp120. The b12 epitope is predicted to consist of four peptide segments of gp120 (residues V254-T257, D368-F376, E381-Y384, and I420-I424), which lie at the periphery of the CD4 binding site."

To evaluate the role of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in this process, HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells were stably transfected with ILK wild-type or kinase-hyperactive overexpression vectors. Suspension or fibronectin (FN) adhesion cultures were irradiated with X-rays and processed for measurement of apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase activation. Adhesion to FN pronouncedly reduced radiation-induced apoptosis of HL60 cells and vector controls. Intriguingly, overexpressed ILK enhanced apoptosis after irradiation by combined activation of caspase-3 through caspase-8 and -9 in irradiated FN cultures. Irradiation of ILK suspension cultures lacked caspase-8 activation, but showed serial cleavage of caspase-9, -3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. These findings further characterize the cell death-promoting function of ILK in DNA-damaged cells. Moreover, ILK might represent a potential therapeutic target for innovative chemo- and radiooncological approaches in hematological malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2051336896,"Septic shock has an extremely high mortality rate, with approximately 200,000 people dying from sepsis annually in the U.S. The high mortality results in part from severe hypotension secondary to high serum NO concentrations. Reducing NO levels should be beneficial in sepsis, but NOS inhibitors have had a checkered history in animal models, and one such agent increased mortality in a clinical trial. An alternative approach to reduce NO levels in sepsis is to use an NO scavenger, which should leave sufficient free NO for normal physiological functions. Using a well-established model of bacterial sepsis in Drosophila melanogaster, we found that cobinamide, a B(12) analog and an effective NO scavenger in vitro, dramatically improved fly survival. Cobinamide augmented the effect of an antibiotic and was beneficial even in immune-deficient flies. Cobinamide's mechanism of action appeared to be from reducing NO levels and improving cardiac function."

https://openalex.org/W1979564815,"The native conformation of antithrombin III (ATIII) is a poor inhibitor of its coagulation pathway target enzymes because of the partial insertion of its reactive center loop (RCL) in its central A beta-sheet. This study focused on tyrosine 131, which is located at the helix D-sheet A interface, adjacent to the ATIII pentasaccharide and heparin cofactor-binding sites and some 17A away from the RCL insertion. Crystallographic structures show that the Tyr(131) ring is buried in native ATIII and then becomes exposed when pentasaccharide binds to the inhibitor and activates it. This change suggested that Tyr(131) might serve as a switch for ATIII conformational activation. The hypothesis is supported by results from this study, which progressively removed atoms from the Tyr(131) side chain. Rates of heparin-independent Y131L and Y131A factor Xa inhibition were 25 and 29 times faster than for the control and Y131F, suggesting that Tyr(131) ring interactions with neighboring helix D and strand 2A residues shift the uncatalyzed native-to-activated conformational equilibrium toward the RCL-inserted state. Thermal denaturation experiments showed Y131A and Y131L were less stable than the control and Y131F, implying an increased tendency toward A-sheet mobility in these genetically activated molecules. Thus, the tight Tyr(131)-Asn(127)-Leu(130)-Leu(140)-Ser(142) cluster at the helix D-strand 2A interface of native antithrombin contributes significantly to the stability of the ground state conformation, and tyrosine 131 serves as a heparin-responsive molecular switch during the allosteric activation of ATIII anticoagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2036375092,"It has been well established that invasion-promoting membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a multifunctional membrane-tethered enzyme, functions in cancer cells as a mediator of pericellular proteolysis and directly cleaves several cell surface receptors, including CD44. In this report, we confirm that adhesion of diabetogenic T cells promotes the activation of endogenous MT1-MMP. Activated protease then cleaves CD44 in adherent T cells. We have validated that the T cell CD44 receptor is critical for the adhesion of diabetogenic insulin-specific, CD8-positive, K(d)-restricted cells to the matrix as well as for the subsequent transmigration of the adherent T cells through the endothelium and homing of the transmigrated T cells into the pancreatic islets. We have determined that the inhibition of MT1-MMP by low dosages of AG3340 (a subnanomolar range hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs that has been widely tested in cancer patients) inhibited both T cell MT1-MMP activity and MT1-MMP-dependent shedding of CD44, immobilized T cells on the endothelium, repressed the homing of diabetogenic T cells into the pancreatic islets, reduced insulitis and mononuclear cell infiltration, and promoted either the recovery or the rejuvenation of the functional insulin-producing beta cells in diabetic NOD mice with freshly developed type I diabetes (IDDM). We believe our data constitute a mechanistic and substantive rationale for clinical trials of selected MT1-MMP inhibitors in the therapy of IDDM in humans."

Integrase binds to the ends (“att” sites) of each viral long terminal repeat (LTR) through sequence-specific recognition of a conserved 5′-CA within the sequence 5′-GCAGT. In the first of two reactions, integrase cleaves the 3′-ends of the viral DNA, releasing the terminal 5′-GT dinucleotide (3′-processing, 3′-P). In the second reaction, the free 3′-hydroxyl of the conserved adenine provides the nucleophile for insertion of the viral cDNA into a chromosome (strand transfer, ST). Gap repair and ligation between the viral and cellular DNA are performed by cellular factors. (For recent reviews and insights on integration, see Refs. 1Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev.

The conserved adenine, substituted by 5-iododeoxyuracil as a photocross-linker, forms a photocross-link to Lys-159 of integrase (9Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Residue Lys-159 also contacts the phosphate 5′ to the conserved deoxyadenosine (10Wang J.Y. Ling H. Yang W. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis showed that Tyr-143 and probably Gln-148 interact with the 5′-overhang resulting from 3′-P (9Jenkins T.M.

Moreover, disulfide cross-linking revealed proximity of the integrase amino acid residue 148 (Q148C mutant) to the second (cytosine) base and of residue 246 (E246C mutant) to the seventh (adenine) base from the 5′-end of the lower strand of the U5 LTR (see Fig. 1A) (12Gao K.

Chem. 2006; 281: 461-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interactions between the backbone of the viral DNA and integrase have been sparsely examined. Phosphate ethylation interference was used to locate phosphates that are critical for integrase catalysis (14Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specific DNA backbone contacts required for ST near the insertion site were identified. On the cleaved strand of the viral DNA, the phosphate 5′ to the conserved adenine, as well as the two phosphates on the complementary strand that are closest to the cleavage site, were important for ST. The two phosphates at and following the ST site were important within the target DNA (14Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest many stabilizing contacts between integrase, the tip of the viral cDNA LTR, and the target DNA. Additional information is required for higher resolution modeling and structure-based design of integrase inhibitors. Integrase 3′-P and ST can be examined with a simple in vitro assay using recombinant integrase, duplex oligonucleotides derived from the sequence of the last 21 bp of the U5 LTR (Fig. 1A), and a divalent metal cofactor. 3′-P produces a 19-mer product on denaturing sequencing gels as the 5′-GT dinucleotide is cleaved (see Fig. 1D, Ctl + IN lane). In the same assay, ST is achieved by insertion of the processed DNA into another identical duplex, resulting in a ladder of products migrating slower than the substrate DNA in denaturing sequencing gels. Here we present data from experiments using manganese so that our results are comparable with prior studies (7Johnson A.A. Sayer J.M. Yagi H. Kalena G.P. Amin R. Jerina D.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Here we focused on DNA backbone and base modifications surrounding the adenine of the conserved 5′-CA dinucleotide sequence to probe the DNA contacts between integrase and the viral DNA ends. We examined the effect of several DNA backbone modifications on integrase activity. Oligonucleotides containing conformationally constrained sugars attached to the conserved adenine were used to examine the conformational preference for north (north bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and locked nucleic acid [LNA]) or south (south bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) oriented sugars (Fig. 1C, see structures). A simple ribose substitution was also examined for comparison to LNA. Additionally, the effects of anomeric inversion on integrase 3′-P and ST were examined using oligonucleotides containing α-anomers around the 3′-P site (Fig. 2A). Substitution of an α-anomer results in a change in the normal 5′–3′ directionality of DNA. The presence of an α-anomer in DNA does not affect base pairing or duplex stability but can affect sugar puckering (15Aramini J.M. Kalisch B.W. Pon R.T. van de Sande J.H. Germann M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9355-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also used covalent adducts derived from enantiomeric benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxides (BaP DE) attached to either single adenines or guanines to probe the position-specific effects of bulky adducts in the major or minor groove of the viral DNA on integrase 3′-P and ST. The hydrocarbon portion of the guanine N-2 adducts lies in the minor groove of the DNA and extends toward the 5′ or 3′ terminus of the adducted strand for the trans-(S) and trans-(R) adducts, respectively, where S and R refer to the absolute configuration at the point of attachment of the 2-amino group of the hydrocarbon (see Fig. 3, D and E) (7Johnson A.A.

Here we examined the effect of dG minor groove adducts attached to the 3′-processed dinucleotide, and we compared these results to those obtained with BaP DE adducts attached to the exocyclic N-6 amino group of adenines (Fig. 3, A–C). These adenine adducts were used to probe the DNA major groove and DNA unwinding on enzyme/DNA interactions because the trans-(R) and trans-(S) dA adducts intercalate from the major groove toward the 5′- and 3′-ends of the modified strand, respectively (16Khan Q.A.

Finally, we studied integrase inhibition by DKA inhibitors in the presence of BaP DE adducts to probe the drug-binding site at the interface of the DNA and integrase. We discuss these results in the following context: 1) inhibitor binding to the integrase active site; 2) insights into the interactions of integrase with the HIV U5 LTR; and 3) the DNA flexibility that is required for endonuclease cleavage (3′-P) to achieve a proper transition state. Oligonucleotide Synthesis—All oligonucleotides were derived from the sequence of the last 21 bases of the HIV U5 LTR (Fig. 1A), with the exception of substitutions described. Unmodified, abasic site, and ribose-containing oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA). 7-Deazaadenine and 2-aminopurine containing oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co., Inc. (Midland, TX). Synthesis for bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane, LNA, α-anomer, and BaP-modified oligonucleotides is described in the Supplemental Material. All oligonucleotides were further purified on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by mini Quickspin oligo column (Roche Applied Science). The duplex DNA was annealed by addition of an equal concentration of the complementary strand, heating to 95 °C, and slow cooling to room temperature. Integrase Reactions—Recombinant wild-type HIV-1 integrase was purified from Escherichia coli as described (21Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the addition of 10% glycerol to all buffers. Integrase was incubated with DNA substrates for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction conditions were 500 nm integrase, 20 nm duplex DNA, 7.5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading dye (formamide containing 1% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gels. Dried gels were visualized using a 445 SI PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. Schiff Base Cross-linking Assay—The Schiff base cross-linking experiments were performed as described (22Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides containing uracil at position U3 (annealed to unmodified or adducted lower strands) or L7 (annealed to unmodified or adducted upper strands) were 5′-32P-labeled as described above. After annealing, uracil DNA glycolylase was added to create an abasic site at the uracil position. The abasic site leads to the formation of a Schiff base cross-link between the aldehyde group on the ribose and a nearby integrase lysine. The cross-links were stabilized by addition of 100 mm sodium borohydride (final concentration). The cross-linked integrase-DNA products were separated from the substrate DNA by SDS-PAGE using 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). Effect of Sugar Modifications on Integrase Reactions—The sugar conformation of standard B-DNA exists mainly in C-2′-endo conformation (south or s), whereas the less frequent A-form with a C-3′-endo conformation (north or n) is more typical of RNA (Fig. 1B). Oligonucleotides containing conformationally restricted sugar puckers at the site of integrase 3′-P were used to probe the conformational preferences of integrase during catalysis. Integrase recognizes the conserved 5′-CA in the HIV LTR (underlined in Fig. 1A). Adenosine analogs containing bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane (north or south, n or s), LNA, or ribonucleoside sugars were substituted for the conserved deoxyadenosine (Fig. 1C). The three conformationally constrained sugar modifications prevented integrase 3′-P, as indicated by the lack of 19-mer product (Fig. 1D, lanes 5, 6, and 10). The ribonucleoside permitted 3′-P and ST (Fig. 1D, lane 14), suggesting that the presence of the 2′-O functionality in LNA exhibits minimal interference with integrase catalysis. Note that the cleaved ribo-containing oligonucleotides migrated slightly slower in the gel compared with fully deoxyribo-containing oligonucleotides, but a 20-mer band is present between the full-length and cleaved ribo-containing oligonucleotides, and therefore, we presume the altered migration is because of the extra hydroxyl group. These results show that conformational restrictions at the 3′-P site block 3′-P. Effect of Anomeric Inversion on Integrase 3′-P—The phosphodiester backbone conformation was further examined by placement of nucleotides containing α-anomerically inverted nucleotides at and around the site of integrase 3′-P. The normal B-DNA β-anomers connect via 5′–3′-phosphodiester linkages. The presence of a single α-anomer requires 3′–3′ and 5′–5′-internucleotide linkages and a switch in the directionality of the DNA (Fig. 2, A and B) in order to permit Watson-Crick base pairing with an unmodified complementary strand. Substitution of the terminal GT with two α-anomers (Fig. 2, A and B, α1, 3′–3′ linkage) permitted a small amount of 3′-P (84% inhibition). The addition of a third α-anomer extending to the conserved adenine completely blocked 3′-P (Fig. 2, B and C, α2, 3′–3′ linkage). Finally, the presence of a single α-anomer substitution for the conserved adenine also resulted in a complete block of 3′-P (Fig. 2, B and C, α3, 3′–3′ then 5′–5′ linkages). Together with the results obtained using modified sugars, it is clear that the backbone structure around the 3′-P site is critical for catalysis by integrase. Use of BaP DE Adducts as Molecular Probes—We next used two types of BaP DE adducts to study the effects of DNA groove occupancy and intercalation on integrase catalysis. Adducts with 10R and 10S configuration at the point of attachment (Fig. 3, C-10 of the hydrocarbon) to the exocyclic 6-amino group of adenine intercalate on the 5′- or 3′-side of the adducted base, respectively (Figs. 3, A–C, and 4A). The partially saturated ring linked to the adenine protrudes into the major groove and therefore provides major groove bulk that may potentially interact with integrase (Fig. 3, A–C). Adducts in which the hydrocarbon is attached to the exocyclic N-2 of guanine have the aromatic pyrene ring system located in the minor groove (Fig. 3, D and E) extending toward the 5′- or 3′-end of the adducted strand for the S and R stereoisomers, respectively (see Fig. 4A). By convention, the adducts will be referred to by their upper and lower strand positions from the viral DNA end. For example, U3 refers to the 3rd base from the end of the upper strand and U3(S) is the isomer with 10S configuration located at the U3 position. Effect of Intercalating dA Adducts Attached to the Conserved Adenine on Integrase Reactions—The effect of site-specific DNA intercalators on integrase catalysis was probed using oligonucleotides containing a single BaP DE adduct attached to the conserved adenine (Fig. 3, A–C). NMR structures indicate that these adducts provide some bulk in the major groove and that the hydrocarbon stacks mainly with bases on the unadducted strand (see Fig. 3C from Ref. 17Pradhan P. Tirumala S. Liu X. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Yeh H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5870-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Adducted DNAs were examined as full-length (Fig. 4A, upper sequences) and pre-cleaved (Fig. 4A, lower sequences, pc) duplex substrates. We showed previously that the lower strand L4(S) minor groove adduct blocks 3′-P and ST (Fig. 4B) (7Johnson A.A. Sayer J.M. Yagi H. Kalena G.P. Amin R. Jerina D.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7947-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, intercalating BaP DE adducts attached to the conserved adenine (U3) had no affect on 3′-P and a partial inhibition of ST (55 and 60% inhibition, Fig. 4B). A similar effect on ST was observed for precleaved DNA. Complete inhibition of ST by L4(S) adducted DNA, and partial inhibition of ST (58 and 67% inhibition) by the U3 adducted DNAs was observed (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that BaP DE adducts linked to the conserved adenine reduce ST without affecting 3′-P. Importance of Functional Groups on the Conserved Adenine for Integrase Reactions—Because the dA adducts are attached to the adenine exocyclic 6-amino group, the importance of the conserved adenine base was further evaluated through several base modifications (Fig. 5). 2-Aminopurine, lacking the 6-amino group (Fig. 5B), was chosen to evaluate the importance of the point of attachment of the intercalating BaP DE adducts. 2-Aminopurine substitution resulted in no decrease in 3′-P and only a slight decrease in ST (Fig. 5C, 14%). Hence, the exocyclic N-6 group of the conserved adenine is not required for integrase activity. Next, 7-deaza-adenine was chosen because of the possible importance of the adenine N-7 (9Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Fig. 5C shows that replacement of the adenine N-7 with carbon caused no change in integrase 3′-P and ST (Fig. 5C). In contrast, substitution of adenosine with an abasic (tetrahydrofuran) site resulted in a partial (67%) inhibition of 3′-P and complete loss of ST (Fig. 5C). It is important to note that this substitution probably affects the backbone structure as well as base pairing. These results indicate that integrase tolerates modifications on the 2 and 6 positions of the conserved adenine but that removal of the base inhibits integrase activity. Effect of BaP DE Adducts Attached to the Terminal 5′-Adenine of the Lower Strand on Integrase Reactions—We next examined the effect of single BaP DE adducts attached to the 5′-terminal adenine of the unprocessed strand (Fig. 6A). These adducts may not be intercalated because of the terminal position of the base, especially following 3′-P. We found that the BaP DE adducts attached to the 5′-terminal adenine (L1) had no affect on 3′-P. However both the R and S BaP DE adducts inhibited ST (36 and 27% inhibition, respectively; see Fig. 6B). We further examined the pattern of ST by labeling each strand at the 3′-end with 32P to determine ST products specific for each strand of the acceptor duplex (7Johnson A.A. Sayer J.M. Yagi H. Kalena G.P. Amin R. Jerina D.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7947-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both the R and S adducts cause the formation of a strong 25-mer ST product corresponding to ST into the upper strand of the acceptor duplex DNA (Fig. 6C). ST into the lower strand of the acceptor DNA showed several new bands between 34- and 37-mer for the R stereoisomer (Fig. 6D). These results show that presence of a terminal BaP DE adduct does not affect 3′-P but alters the sequence specificity of ST. Effect of Minor Groove BaP DE Adducts Linked to the 3′-Processed Dinucleotide on Integrase Reactions—We next examined the effect of single trans-opened BaP DE dG adducts attached to the guanine (U2) of the cleaved dinucleotide (Fig. 7A). This position was not addressed in our prior study (7Johnson A.A. Sayer J.M. Yagi H. Kalena G.P. Amin R. Jerina D.M. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7947-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to extend our minor groove footprinting through the end of the DNA. The U2 minor groove adducts slightly inhibited 3′-P (Fig. 7, B and C). Because 3′-P presumably releases the terminal dinucleotide, we were surprised to observe a more pronounced inhibition of ST. To test whether the adducted dinucleotide could act as an ST inhibitor, we examined the effects of an adducted dinucleotide (5′-GT containing BaP DE adduct) added to integrase reactions performed with an unadducted (control) DNA substrate. Little inhibition of 3′-P or ST was observed (30% only at 333 μm; data not shown). These results demonstrate that BaP DE adducts on the U2 guanine reduce ST without affecting the efficiency of 3′-P, suggesting the retention of the adducted dinucleotide within the integrase-DNA complex following 3′-P (see “Discussion”). Use of BaP DE Adducts to Study Inhibition of Integrase by the Diketo Acid L-708906—Because diketo acid ST inhibitors have been hypothesized to bind at the enzyme-DNA interface at the end of the viral DNA (1Pommier Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12596-12603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and because the BaP DNA adducts residing near the integrase 3′-P site decreased overall ST, which mimics the effect of DKAs, we examined the effect of these BaP DE adducts on inhibition of integrase by the DKA L-708906 (Fig. 8B). However, L-708906 is an ST-selective inhibitor of integrase with normal DNA (25Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espesath A. Gabryelski L. Schlelf W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8, A–C). We observed a marked inhibition of 3′-P for the U2(S) dG-adducted DNA (Fig. 8, E and F, and Table 1), indicating this adduct increases the ability of L-708906 to act as a 3′-P inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W2090939243,"The highly basic eosinophil major basic protein (MBP), present in the crystalloid core of eosinophil leukocyte granules, has both cytotoxic and cytostimulatory properties and is directly implicated in a number of diseases. The crystal structure of MBP resembles that of the C-type lectin (CTL) superfamily, and recent data showed that MBP binds heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG), with the CTL ligand-binding region as the binding site. MBP is synthesized as a proform (pro-MBP) containing an acidic propiece believed to neutralize the basic MBP domain. Using flow cytometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate here that the MBP domain of pro-MBP binds to heparan sulfate GAG on the cell surface and that this is independent of GAG covalently bound to pro-MBP. Eight basic residues located in the CTL ligand-binding region of MBP were hypothesized previously to mediate GAG binding, but we found that surface binding was not compromised by the substitution of these residues with alanine. However, the analysis of a series of mutants with surface-exposed residues substituted with alanine showed that Ser-166, Arg-168, and Arg-171 are involved in surface binding. A binding site formed by these residues is located in the MBP domain between loop 1 and β-strand 5, outside the CTL ligand-binding region. The binding of a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan may be important in MBP action, and our findings suggest that two regions shown previously to contain the cytotoxic and cytostimulatory properties of MBP are accessible for ligand interaction in cell surface-bound MBP."
https://openalex.org/W2168196888,"Hypertrophic growth of adult myocardium is associated with increased expression of the early response gene c-jun. The purpose of this study was to determine whether eukaryotic initiation factor (elF) 4E (eIF4E) regulates translational efficiency of c-jun mRNA as measured by flux into polysomes. Adult feline cardiomyocytes in primary culture were treated with 0.2 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), and c-jun mRNA was quantified in total, monosome, and polysome fractions by real-time polymerase chain reaction. After 1 h, TPA increased total c-jun mRNA by 10.5-fold. The corresponding flux into polysomes was significantly lower (5-fold). Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of either eIF4E or a nonphosphorylatable mutant (S209/A) did not affect total c-jun mRNA or its flux between monosomes and polysomes. Similar results were obtained following overexpression of the eIF4E kinase Mnk1. Thus, translational efficiency of c-jun mRNA was not affected by changes in activity or amount of eIF4E. In contrast, a kinase-deficient Mnk1 mutant significantly reduced total c-jun mRNA from 9.8-fold to 6.0-fold while flux between monosomes and polysomes remained constant. The decrease in total c-jun mRNA resulted from increased decay of c-jun mRNA incorporated into the polysomes. We conclude that Mnk1 activity stabilizes c-jun mRNA in polysomes independent of eIF4E phosphorylation."
