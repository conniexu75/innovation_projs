https://openalex.org/W2981869278,"Racial bias in health algorithms The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer et al. find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care. Science , this issue p. 447 ; see also p. 421"

MAIT cells recognize microbial small molecules presented by the major histocompatibility complex class Ib molecule MR1. MAIT cells are absent in germ-free mice, and the mechanisms by which microbiota control MAIT cell development are unknown (see the Perspective by Oh and Unutmaz). Legoux et al. show that, in mice, development of MAIT cells within the thymus is governed by the bacterial product 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6- d -ribitylaminouracil, which rapidly traffics from the mucosa to the thymus, where it is captured by MR1 and presented to developing MAIT cells. Constantinides et al. report that MAIT cell induction only occurs during a limited, early-life window and requires exposure to defined microbes that produce riboflavin derivatives. Continual interactions between MAIT cells and commensals in the skin modulates tissue repair functions. Together, these papers highlight how the microbiota can direct immune cell development and subsequent function at mucosal sites by secreting compounds that act like self-antigens.

Using data from more than 7000 sites, Phillips et al. developed global maps of the distribution of earthworm diversity, abundance, and biomass (see the Perspective by Fierer). The patterns differ from those typically found in aboveground taxa; there are peaks of diversity and abundance in the mid-latitude regions and peaks of biomass in the tropics. Climate variables strongly influence these patterns, and changes are likely to have cascading effects on other soil organisms and wider ecosystem functions.

https://openalex.org/W2981536928,"Better vaccines against influenza virus are urgently needed to provide broader protection against diverse strains, subtypes, and types. Such efforts are assisted by the identification of novel broadly neutralizing epitopes targeted by protective antibodies. Influenza vaccine development has largely focused on the hemagglutinin, but the other major surface antigen, the neuraminidase, has reemerged as a potential target for universal vaccines. We describe three human monoclonal antibodies isolated from an H3N2-infected donor that bind with exceptional breadth to multiple different influenza A and B virus neuraminidases. These antibodies neutralize the virus, mediate effector functions, are broadly protective in vivo, and inhibit neuraminidase activity by directly binding to the active site. Structural and functional characterization of these antibodies will inform the development of neuraminidase-based universal vaccines against influenza virus."

Milling of corundum only produces micrometer-scale particles, and direct synthesis from other aluminum oxides that would be likely starting materials, such as γ-Al 2 O 3 , fails because of the high activation barrier for converting the lattice structure of these cubic close-packed oxides. Amrute et al. show that ball milling of boehmite, γ-AlOOH, created ∼13-nanometer-diameter corundum nanoparticles of high purity through a mechanically induced dehydration reaction and by the effect of milling impacts on the surface energy of the particles.

https://openalex.org/W2982214120,ParABS systems facilitate chromosome segregation and plasmid partitioning in bacteria and archaea. ParB protein binds centromeric parS DNA sequences and spreads to flanking DNA. We show that ParB is an enzyme that hydrolyzes cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP). parS DNA stimulates cooperative CTP binding by ParB and CTP hydrolysis. A nucleotide cocrystal structure elucidates the catalytic center of the dimerization-dependent ParB CTPase. Single-molecule imaging and biochemical assays recapitulate features of ParB spreading from parS in the presence but not absence of CTP. These findings suggest that centromeres assemble by self-loading of ParB DNA sliding clamps at parS ParB CTPase is not related to known nucleotide hydrolases and might be a promising target for developing new classes of antibiotics.

We obtained invasive recordings from the primary and nonprimary AC in neurosurgical patients as they listened to multi-talker speech. We found that neural sites in the primary AC responded to individual speakers in the mixture and were relatively unchanged by attention. In contrast, neural sites in the nonprimary AC were less discerning of individual speakers but selectively represented the attended speaker. Moreover, the encoding of the attended speaker in the nonprimary AC was invariant to the degree of acoustic overlap with the unattended speaker.

Finally, this emergent representation of attended speech in the nonprimary AC was linearly predictable from the primary AC responses. Our results reveal the neural computations underlying the hierarchical formation of auditory objects in human AC during multi-talker speech perception. In multi-talker acoustic environments, humans can easily focus their attention on one speaker even in the absence of any spatial separation between the talkers (Cherry, 1953Cherry E.C. Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1953; 25: 975-979Crossref Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). In such scenarios, the spectrotemporal acoustic components of the speakers are highly mixed at a listener’s auditory periphery (Brungart et al., 2001Brungart D.S. Simpson B.D. Ericson M.A. Scott K.R. Informational and energetic masking effects in the perception of multiple simultaneous talkers.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 2001; 110: 2527-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Successful perception of a particular speaker in this condition requires identifying and separating the spectrotemporal features of that speaker from the background and regrouping the acoustic components into a coherent auditory object that is unaffected by the variable acoustic overlap with other speakers (Bizley and Cohen, 2013Bizley J.K.

The required neural computations that underlie this cognitive task in the human auditory system remain speculative, and this task has proved extremely challenging to model algorithmically (Luo and Mesgarani, 2019Luo Y.

Studies on sound encoding in the mammalian auditory pathway have postulated the existence of a hierarchical, feedforward processing framework that starts from the auditory nerve and continues to primary and nonprimary auditory cortex (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007Hickok G.

Processing of complex sounds in the auditory cortex of cat, monkey, and man.Acta Otolaryngol. Suppl. 1997; 532: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Neurons in this ascending auditory pathway have increasingly complex and multi-featured tuning properties (King and Nelken, 2009King A.J. Nelken I.

This encoding hierarchy results in a multidimensional and multiplexed representation of stimulus features in primary auditory areas that can facilitate auditory scene analysis (Patel et al., 2018Patel P. Long L.K. Herrero J.L. Mehta A.D. Mesgarani N.

In parallel, substantial evidence indicates the existence of descending connections throughout the entire auditory pathway (Rasmussen, 1964Rasmussen G.L. Anatomic relationships of the ascending and descending auditory systems.Neurol. Asp. Audit. Vestib. Disord. 1964; 1: 5-19Google Scholar). These task-dependent feedback connections modulate the tuning properties of auditory neurons, which likely support the extraction of target sound sources from the background acoustic scene (Fritz et al., 2003Fritz J.

The interaction between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms is particularly critical when attending to a target speaker in multi-talker acoustic conditions as the target and interfering sound sources overlap substantially in both time and frequency. Previous studies on multi-talker speech perception in the human auditory cortex have confirmed the emergence of a selective and enhanced representation of attended speech in higher auditory areas, such as superior temporal gyrus (STG; Mesgarani and Chang, 2012Mesgarani N.

Additionally, noninvasive studies have shown that attended and unattended talkers are co-represented in early components of neural responses, with distinct responses to the attended speaker appearing in only late response components and in only nonprimary auditory areas (Ding and Simon, 2012Ding N.

Cortical Representations of Speech in a Multi-talker Auditory Scene.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 (0938–17)Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest a progressive and hierarchical emergence of target speech from the mixed sound, how the primary and nonprimary auditory cortical areas represent mixed speech and how they interact to selectively enhance the target speech relative to the acoustic background remains unknown. In addition, whether these auditory cortical areas represent an attended speaker as an auditory object remains unclear (Bizley and Cohen, 2013Bizley J.K. Cohen Y.E. The what, where and how of auditory-object perception.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, Shinn-Cunningham, 2008Shinn-Cunningham B.G. Object-based auditory and visual attention.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2008; 12: 182-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). An auditory object representation implies invariance to the degree of spectrotemporal overlap with unattended speech, similar to the response permanence to partially occluded visual objects (Gibson, 2014Gibson J.J. The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: Classic Edition. Psychology Press, 2014Crossref Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown a selective representation of attended speech in STG (Mesgarani and Chang, 2012Mesgarani N. Chang E.F. Selective cortical representation of attended speaker in multi-talker speech perception.Nature. 2012; 485: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), the difference between the neural responses to masked and unmasked spectrotemporal features of the attended speaker in primary and nonprimary areas is unknown. To shed light on the encoding of mixed speech in primary and nonprimary auditory areas, we recorded from invasive electrodes implanted in patients undergoing neurosurgery as they focused on specific speakers in a multi-talker speech perception task. We used a combination of depth (stereotactic electroencephalogram [EEG]) and surface (subdural electrocorticography) recording techniques to reach both STG and Heschl’s gyrus (HG). These speech-responsive areas (Khalighinejad et al., 2019Khalighinejad B. Herrero J.L. Mehta A.D. Mesgarani N. Adaptation of the human auditory cortex to changing background noise.Nat.

While these regions are heterogeneous and each contain multiple auditory fields (Hamilton et al., 2018Hamilton L.S. Edwards E. Chang E.F.

Biol. 2018; 28: 1860-1871.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Nourski, 2017Nourski K.V. Auditory processing in the human cortex: An intracranial electrophysiology perspective.Laryngoscope Investig. Otolaryngol. 2017; 2: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), HG includes mostly the primary auditory cortex, and STG is considered mostly a nonprimary auditory area (Clarke and Morosan, 2012Clarke S. Morosan P. Architecture, connectivity, and transmitter receptors of human auditory cortex.in: Poeppel D. Overath T. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Human Auditory Cortex. Springer, 2012: 11-38Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, measuring the neural activity from both HG and STG areas allowed us to determine the encoding properties and functional relationship between these regions. Our results revealed significant differences between the representation of multi-talker speech in these two areas, a finding that contributes to a more complete functional and anatomical understanding of speech processing and auditory object formation in the human auditory cortex. Eight subjects participated in this study, with varying amounts of electrode coverage over their left and right auditory cortices. Two subjects had high-density electroencephalography (ECoG) grids implanted over their left temporal lobe with coverage of STG, and one of these subjects also had a stereotactic EEG (sEEG) depth electrode implanted in left HG. Depth electrodes with coverage over the left and right HG, as well as other auditory cortical regions, were implanted in the remaining 6 subjects. Figure 1A shows the electrodes from all subjects displayed on an average brain along with their corresponding measure of effect size (Cohen’s D; Cohen, 2013Cohen J. Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences. Routledge, 2013Crossref Google Scholar) resulting from the comparison of the responses to speech versus silence (STAR Methods). Out of 624 electrodes, 230 were responsive to speech (effect size greater than 0.2), with 67 and 56 of these electrodes located in HG and STG, respectively. Further analyses were restricted to these electrodes in HG and STG (all electrodes are shown in Figure S1A). The subjects listened to stories read by a male speaker and female speaker, hereafter referred to as Spk1 and Spk2, respectively. The stimuli were presented in isolation (single-talker) and mixed together (multi-talker) with no spatial separation between them. The multi-talker condition was split into 4 blocks, and the subjects were instructed to pay attention to either Spk1 or Spk2 at the beginning of each block. The stories were intermittently paused, and the subjects were asked to repeat the last sentence of Spk1/2 in the single-talker condition or to repeat the last sentence of the attended speaker in the multi-talker condition to ensure that the subjects were engaged in the task. The performance for all subjects in the multi-talker condition was high (mean = 90%, STD = 8%, minimum = 80%). Figure 1B shows portions of the stimuli and corresponding neural responses from 2 example electrodes in 1 subject, with one in STG (E1) and the other in HG (E2). By “response” here and in the rest of the manuscript, we are referring to the envelope of the high-gamma band (70–150 Hz; STAR Methods). The left panel shows a stimulus from the multi-talker condition (displayed as the superposition of the 2 speakers for visualization purposes). Qualitatively, the response of the neural site in STG (E1) changes depending on who is being attended, even though the stimulus is identical in both cases. Comparing the multi-talker responses with those obtained in the single-talker condition (middle and right panels) shows that the response of this site to the attended speaker is similar to the response to that speaker in isolation. Conversely, the neural site in HG (E2) responds similarly to the sound mixture irrespective of whether the subject is attending to Spk1 or Spk2. Comparing these responses with those in the single-talker condition suggests that the response of this site is the same as the response to Spk1 alone even when attending to Spk2. This visualization demonstrates the following response types: (1) sites that are modulated by attention to represent the attended speaker, and (2) sites that preferentially respond to a specific speaker even when not attending to that speaker. Motivated by this observation, we examined the extent to which each site was modulated by attention or was more responsive to one of the speakers. To study the preferential response of sites to the speakers across HG and STG, we examined the responses to the speakers in the single-talker condition. To compare the responses, we calculated the distribution of the normalized magnitude of the electrodes’ response to Spk1 and Spk2. Figure 2A shows the response histograms for two example sites in HG. The difference between the medians of the distributions in Figure 2A confirms that these sites respond more strongly to Spk1 (left) or Spk2 (right). We quantified the preference for either speaker (the degree of the difference between the response distributions) by calculating the effect size (Cohen’s D) of the difference. We term this metric the speaker-selectivity index (SSI); positive and negative values indicate a preference for Spk1 and Spk2, respectively. Evaluating the SSI (absolute values) across all electrodes revealed significantly more speaker-selective neural sites in HG than in STG (Figure 2B; unpaired t test, p < 0.001). This difference is also demonstrated by the wider distribution of the SSI in HG (SD of the SSI in HG and STG = 0.2 and 0.07, respectively). Figure S1B shows the spatial distribution of the SSI across the brain. To examine the extent to which the observed preferred response to one speaker over the other can be explained by spectrotemporal tuning properties (Steinschneider et al., 2014Steinschneider M. Nourski K.V. Rhone A.E. Kawasaki H. Oya H. Howard 3rd, M.A. Differential activation of human core, non-core and auditory-related cortex during speech categorization tasks as revealed by intracranial recordings.Front. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 240Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we first calculated the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) of each neural site. A STRF is a linear mapping between a stimulus (spectrogram) and the evoked response to that stimulus (Theunissen et al., 2000Theunissen F.E. Sen K. Doupe A.J. Spectral-temporal receptive fields of nonlinear auditory neurons obtained using natural sounds.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2315-2331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that estimates the spectrotemporal features to which a neural site is tuned. The STRFs were calculated from the responses to the single-talker stimuli. Figure 2C displays the average STRFs from all electrodes that had an SSI either greater than +0.2 or less than −0.2 (selective for Spk1 or Spk2, respectively). To relate these tuning properties to the acoustic features of the speakers, we calculated the average acoustic spectrum of each speaker (labeled Spk1 and Spk2 Acous.; STAR Methods). To directly compare the acoustic spectrum of the speakers with each site’s frequency tuning, we removed the temporal component of the STRFs by obtaining their 1st principal component (PC) along the spectral dimension. Therefore, we will abbreviate STRFs as spectral receptive fields (SRFs). The correlation (Pearson’s r) between the SRFs that are selective for Spk1/2 and the spectral profile of Spk1/2 are 0.72 and 0.67, respectively (p < 0.001 for both; Figure 2D). The correlation between the difference in the SRFs and the difference in the spectral profile of the speakers is 0.82 (p < 0.001). These large correlation values suggest that the observed speaker selectivity of a neural site is largely due to a match between the spectral profile of the speakers and the frequency tuning of that site. To examine the extent to which the SSI of each site could be predicted from its SRF, we used linear regression to map all sites in HG and STG from the SRF to SSI (STAR Methods; Figure S2). Figure 2E shows that speaker selectivity can be predicted for HG and STG electrodes with an accuracy of 0.89 and 0.67, respectively (p < 0.001 for both; Pearson’s r value). The higher speaker preference prediction in HG indicates a more acoustically organized representation of the speakers in this area than that in STG. Together, these results suggest that sites in HG have more diverse spectral tuning properties, which results in an explicit representation of the distinct acoustic features of the two speakers. We showed that cortical areas have varied preferences for particular speakers and that sites in HG are more speaker selective than sites in STG. To determine the degree of attentional modulation of these sites, we compared the multi-talker and single-talker responses to measure how much the neural response to the mixed speech changed to resemble the response to the attended speaker in the single-talker condition (see Figure 1B, electrode e1 for an example). Therefore, we define the attentional modulation index (AMI) of neural sites as follows:AMI=corr(Spk1attend,Spk1alone)–corr(Spk1attend,Spk2alone)+corr(Spk2attend,Spk2alone)−corr(Spk2attend,Spk1alone)where SpkX refers to the response to speaker X either in the single-talker condition (alone) or when they are attended in the multi-talker condition (attend). Larger AMI values indicate more attentional modulation of a neural site. Figure 3A displays the AMI across all neural sites that showed a significant response to speech. Figure 3B compares the AMI between HG, STG, and a null distribution obtained by randomly shuffling the trial order (gray line; STAR Methods). Figure 3B shows that a higher number of sites in STG are modulated by attention than those in HG, with 34 out of 56 sites in STG possessing an AMI significantly above chance (3σ; STAR Methods) compared with only 4 out of 67 sites in HG. This result shows that the representation in STG is more dynamic than that in HG and that the attentional state of the listener changes the representation in STG more than in HG. Notably, the population of HG sites as a whole had a distribution of AMI significantly above that of the null distribution (unpaired t test; p < 0.001), suggesting a weak but significant effect of attention in HG. In addition, Figure 3C shows a linear increase in the AMI with increasing distance from posterior HG (MNI coordinates: x = 35, y = −30 and z = 18; r = 0.4, p < 0.001). This finding reveals a gradient of attentional modulation from posterior HG toward STG. Figure 3D shows the latency of the responses in HG and STG (mean ± SE) with respect to the attended (solid) and unattended (dashed) speakers. These response latencies were obtained by averaging the STRFs across frequency to obtain the temporal response profile for each site. This finding shows that STG responds later than HG and further illustrates the greater suppression of the unattended speaker in STG. To examine the relationship between the speaker selectivity of sites and their degree of attentional modulation, we calculated the joint distribution of the SSI and AMI (Figure 4A), comparing STG (orange) and HG (green). Figure 4B displays the AMI and SSI across all neural sites that showed a significant response to speech. These plots illustrate a fundamental difference between the organization of the neural responses in HG and STG where HG is relatively static and responds preferentially to speaker differences, whereas STG favorably represents the attended speaker. Motivated by the clear difference between the organization of responses to multi-talker speech in HG and STG (Figure 4), we further examined the similarity of the neural responses to speakers from the single to multi-talker conditions. The speech signal varies across both time and frequency; therefore, the spectrotemporal features of an attended speaker variably overlaps with interfering speakers (Figure 1B). Here, we examined how the variable overlap between attended and unattended speakers affected the neural responses in HG and STG. The overlap between two competing speakers is easy to quantify in the time-frequency domain (i.e., the spectrogram); however, the neurons in auditory cortex can have complex and often nonlinear tuning properties, making it difficult to assess the degree of overlap between the features to which they are tuned. To circumvent this problem, we developed a model-independent method to evaluate neural responses as a function of the relative energy of both speakers with respect to the feature to which a neural site is tuned. To accomplish this goal, we superimposed the magnitude of the responses in the multi-talker condition onto the joint distribution of the responses to Spk1 and Spk2 alone. Figure 5A shows an example STG electrode. The top panel shows the responses in the S-T condition to Spk1 (blue) and Spk2 (red). The bottom panel shows the responses in the M-T condition when Spk1 is attended (top) or when Spk2 is attended (bottom). The color in these cases represents the amplitude of the response. Three time points are denoted (a, b, and c). The top-right panel shows the 2D histogram of the joint distribution of the responses to Spk1 (x axis) and Spk2 (y axis) in the S-T condition. The 3 time points (a, b, and c) are marked. In the bottom-right panel, the response amplitude of the M-T condition is superimposed on the S-T histogram (from above). The color corresponds to the response amplitude in the M-T condition. This calculation is performed separately for each attention condition (A1: attend Spk1, and A2: attend Spk2). For this example STG electrode, the representation rotates 90 degrees when the attended speaker changes. This change can be summarized by adding A1 to the transpose of A2 to obtain a single matrix that shows the magnitude of the multi-talker response with respect to the attended and unattended speakers (Figure 5B). The rows of this matrix show the response to the attended speaker as the magnitude of the unattended speaker varies (changing colors). This finding reveals that this site responds as a linear function of the attended speaker. However, there is an effect of energetic masking at the extrema when the magnitude of the unattended speaker is very large relative to the attended speaker (dark lines, left of figure). Alternatively, the columns of the matrix show that this site is almost unaffected by the magnitude of the unattended speaker except when the magnitude of the attended speaker is very small (light colored lines). To summarize the response of this electrode, we took the average across the rows and columns (Figure 5B, next-to-last right panel). In summary, this site responds as a linear function of the features of the attended speaker, meaning that louder features of the attended speaker result in a larger response. At the same time, this site is mostly unaffected by the unattended speaker, meaning that despite the change in the overlap between the features of the unattended and attended speakers, this change in masking is not reflected in the responses. Figure 5B (bottom panels) shows the same analyses of an example electrode in HG. This neural site appears to be unaffected by attention, responding linearly with respect to both speakers. This observation means that this site responds to the acoustic feature to which it is tuned irrespective of whether that feature belongs to the attended or unattended speaker. However, we observed a slight effect of attention at the extrema, which is further illustrated in Figure S6. Figure 5B (right-most panel) illustrates the effect of masking across the population of neural sites in HG and STG. This analysis reveals that (1) STG sites respond to the acoustic features of the attended speaker and are"

The addition of lipid molecules redistributes proteins to the cell surface or to membrane-bound organelles. Working in transgenic mice and in tissue cultured cells, Lu et al. found that nucleotide oligomerization domain–like receptors 1 and 2 (NOD1 and NOD2), two proteins responsible for detecting bacterial products, required lipid modifications for their recruitment to the cell membrane and function. The specific modification, palmitoylation at a cysteine thiol, was mediated by the enzyme ZDHHC5. Loss of ZDHHC5 or removal of key modification residues in NOD1 and NOD2 abolished their function, compromising antibacterial responses. Human variants of NOD2 display altered palmitoylation, which could help to explain many inflammatory conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Science , this issue p. 460"

By introducing a large number of deleterious mutations into many different genetic backgrounds of yeast, Johnson et al. found that, for many mutations, the more fit the background, the larger the deleterious effect of the mutation (see the Perspective by Miller). A more-fit lineage is thus less tolerant to deleterious mutations, whereas less-fit lineages can tolerate more mutations. This observation supports a tendency toward diminishing returns for beneficial mutations, which has been shown to influence patterns of adaptation. Science , this issue p. 490 ; see also p. 418"

Despite decades of calls by the international community to improve international migration statistics, the availability of timely and disaggregated data about long-term and short-term migration at the global level is still very limited. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using non-traditional data sources to fill existing gaps in migration statistics. To this end, we use anonymised and publicly available data provided by Facebook's advertising platform. Facebook's advertising platform classifies its users as ""lived in country X"" if they previously lived in country X, and now live in a different country. Drawing on statistics about Facebook Network users (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and the Audience Network) who have lived abroad and applying a sample bias correction method, we estimate the number of Facebook Network (FN) ""migrants"" in 119 countries of residence and in two time periods by age, gender, and country of previous residence. The correction method estimates the probability of a person being a FN user based on age, sex, and country of current and previous residence. We further estimate the correlation between FN-derived migration estimates and reference official migration statistics. By comparing FN-derived migration estimates in two different time periods, January-February and August-September 2018, we successfully capture the increase in Venezuelan migrants in Colombia and Spain in 2018. FN-derived migration estimates cannot replace official migration statistics, as they are not representative, and the exact methods the FN uses for classifying its users are not known, and might change over time. However, after carefully assessing the validity of the FN-derived estimates by comparing them with data from reliable sources, we conclude that these estimates can be used for trend analysis and early-warning purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2981992400,"Age-related neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a slow, persistent accumulation of aggregated proteins. Although cells can elicit physiological responses to enhance cellular clearance and counteract accumulation, it is unclear how pathogenic proteins evade this process in disease. We find that Parkinson’s disease α-synuclein perturbs the physiological response to lysosomal stress by impeding the SNARE protein ykt6. Cytosolic ykt6 is normally autoinhibited by a unique farnesyl-mediated regulatory mechanism; however, during lysosomal stress, it activates and redistributes into membranes to preferentially promote hydrolase trafficking and enhance cellular clearance. α-Synuclein aberrantly binds and deactivates ykt6 in patient-derived neurons, thereby disabling the lysosomal stress response and facilitating protein accumulation. Activating ykt6 by small-molecule farnesyltransferase inhibitors restores lysosomal activity and reduces α-synuclein in patient-derived neurons and mice. Our findings indicate that α-synuclein creates a permissive environment for aggregate persistence by inhibiting regulated cellular clearance and provide a therapeutic strategy to restore protein homeostasis by harnessing SNARE activity."

https://openalex.org/W2981626399,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease of cattle, which is closely related to human T-cell leukemia viruses. BLV has spread worldwide and causes a serious problem for the cattle industry. The cellular receptor specifically binds with viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), and this attachment mediates cell fusion to lead virus entry. BLV Env reportedly binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/solute carrier family 7 member 1 (SLC7A1), but whether the CAT1/SLC7A1 is an actual receptor for BLV remains unknown. Here, we showed that CAT1 functioned as an infection receptor, interacting with BLV particles. Cells expressing undetectable CAT1 levels were resistant to BLV infection but became highly susceptible upon CAT1 overexpression. CAT1 exhibited specific binding to BLV particles on the cell surface and colocalized with the Env in endomembrane compartments and membrane. Knockdown of CAT1 in permissive cells significantly reduced binding to BLV particles and BLV infection. Expression of CAT1 from various species demonstrated no species specificity for BLV infection, implicating CAT1 as a functional BLV receptor responsible for its broad host range.

SNO-CoA reductases require NADPH, whereas enzymatic reduction of GSNO can involve either NADH or NADPH. Notably, GSNO reductase (GSNOR, Adh5) accounts for most NADH-dependent GSNOR activity, whereas NADPH-dependent GSNOR activity is largely unaccounted for (CBR1 mediates a minor portion). Here, we de novo purified NADPH-coupled GSNOR activity from mammalian tissues and identified aldo-keto reductase family 1 member A1 (AKR1A1), the archetypal mammalian SNO-CoA reductase, as a primary mediator of NADPH-coupled GSNOR activity in these tissues. Kinetic analyses suggested an AKR1A1 substrate preference of SNO-CoA > GSNO. AKR1A1 deletion from murine tissues dramatically lowered NADPH-dependent GSNOR activity. Conversely, GSNOR-deficient mice had increased AKR1A1 activity, revealing potential cross-talk among GSNO-dependent denitrosylases. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis of AKR1A1 identified Arg-312 as a key residue mediating the specific interaction with GSNO; in contrast, substitution of the SNO-CoA–binding residue Lys-127 minimally affected the GSNO-reducing activity of AKR1A1. Together, these findings indicate that AKR1A1 is a multi-LMW-SNO reductase that can distinguish between and metabolize the two major LMW-SNO signaling molecules GSNO and SNO-CoA, allowing for wide-ranging control of protein S-nitrosylation under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Studies have suggested that DHA and DPA are beneficial for maintaining sperm quality. However, their mechanisms of action are still unclear because of the poor understanding of DHA/DPA metabolism in the testis. DHA and DPA are mainly stored as LCPUFA-containing phospholipids and support normal spermatogenesis. Long-chain acyl-conenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (ACSL) 6 is an enzyme that preferentially converts LCPUFA into LCPUFA-CoA. Here, we report that ACSL6 knockout (KO) mice display severe male infertility due to attenuated sperm numbers and function. ACSL6 is highly expressed in differentiating spermatids, and ACSL6 KO mice have reduced LCPUFA-containing phospholipids in their spermatids. Delayed sperm release and apoptosis of differentiated spermatids were observed in these mice. The results of this study indicate that ACSL6 contributes to the local accumulation of DHA- and DPA-containing phospholipids in spermatids to support normal spermatogenesis.-Shishikura, K., Kuroha, S., Matsueda, S., Iseki, H., Matsui, T., Inoue, A., Arita, M.

https://openalex.org/W2981999414,"Biogenesis of F1Fo ATP synthase, the key enzyme of mitochondrial energy provision, depends on transmembrane protein 70 (TMEM70), localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of higher eukaryotes. TMEM70 absence causes severe ATP-synthase deficiency and leads to a neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy in humans. However, the exact biochemical function of TMEM70 remains unknown. Using TMEM70 conditional knockout in mice, we show that absence of TMEM70 impairs the early stage of enzyme biogenesis by preventing incorporation of hydrophobic subunit c into rotor structure of the enzyme. This results in the formation of an incomplete, pathologic enzyme complex consisting of F1 domain and peripheral stalk but lacking Fo proton channel composed of subunits c and a. We demonstrated direct interaction between TMEM70 and subunit c and showed that overexpression of subunit c in TMEM70-/- cells partially rescued TMEM70 defect. Accordingly, TMEM70 knockdown prevented subunit c accumulation otherwise observed in F1-deficient cells. Altogether, we identified TMEM70 as specific ancillary factor for subunit c. The biologic role of TMEM70 is to increase the low efficacy of spontaneous assembly of subunit c oligomer, the key and rate-limiting step of ATP-synthase biogenesis, and thus to reach an adequately high physiologic level of ATP synthase in mammalian tissues.-Kovalčíková, J., Vrbacký, M., Pecina, P., Tauchmannová, K., Nůsková, H., Kaplanová, V., Brázdová, A., Alán, L., Eliáš, J., Čunátová, K., Kořínek, V., Sedlacek, R., Mráček, T., Houštěk, J.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of calcifications in thyroid tissue samples of patients with various thyroid diseases, and to identify their composition according to their localization. Among 50 thyroid samples included, 56% were malignant (papillary carcinoma) and 44% were benign (adenoma, multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, sarcoidosis). Calcifications were found in 95% of samples using polarised light microscopy, whereas only 12% were described in initial pathological reports. Three types were individualised and analyzed by infrared spectrometry (μFTIR): colloid calcifications composed of calcium oxalate, capsular calcifications and psammoma bodies, both composed of calcium phosphate. Of notice, psammoma bodies characterized by FE-SEM were composed of concentric structure suggesting a slow process for crystal deposition. Calcium phosphates were found only in malignant samples whereas calcium oxalate was not associated with a define pathology. Proliferation assessed by KI67 staining was high (33% of positive follicles), and RUNX2, OPN, and CD44 positive staining were detected in thyrocytes with a broad variation between samples. However, thyrocyte proliferation and differentiation markers were not associated with the number of crystals. TRPV5 and CaSR expression was also detected in thyrocytes. mRNA transcripts expression was confirmed in a subgroup of 10 patients, altogether with other calcium transporters such as PMCA1 or Cav1.3.

Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that Twist2 knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In vitro, TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to FGF21 promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with Twist2 promoter DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2981869224,"Introduction India has a higher number of deaths due to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) in children <5 years than any other country. The underlying cause of half of ALRI deaths is household air pollution from burning of solid fuels, according to the World Health Organization. If there is a direct association between duration of exposure and increased ALRI risk, a potential strategy might be to limit the child’s exposure to burning solid fuel. Methods and materials Children born to pregnant women participating in the Global Network for Women and Children's Health Maternal and Newborn Health Registry near Nagpur, India were followed every two weeks from birth to six months to diagnose ALRI. The number of hours per day that the child’s mother spent in front of a burning solid fuel cookstove was recorded. Children of mothers using only clean cookstoves were classified as having zero hours of exposure. Odds Ratios with 95% confidence intervals were obtained from Generalized Estimating Equations logistic models that assessed the relationship of exposure to solid fuels with risk of ≥1 ALRI, adjusted for sex of the child, household smoking, wealth, maternal age, birth weight and parity. Results Between August 2013 and March 2014, 302 of 1,586 children (19%) had ≥1 episode of ALRI. Results from the multivariable analysis indicate that the odds of ALRI significantly increased from 1.2 (95% CI: 0.7–2.2) for <1 hour of exposure to 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4–3.3) for >3 hours of exposure to solid fuel cookstoves compared with no exposure (p<0.01). Additionally, decreasing wealth [middle: 1.2 (0.9, 1.6); poor: 1.4 (1.2–1.7); p<0.001] was associated with ALRIs. Conclusions Our study findings indicate that increasing the time mothers spend cooking near solid fuel cookstoves while children are in the house may be associated with development of ≥1 ALRI in children <6 months."
https://openalex.org/W2981415556,"It is thought that two evolutionary mechanisms gave rise to chromosomal variation in bees: the first one points to polyploidy as the main cause of chromosomal evolution, while the second, Minimum Interaction Theory (MIT), is more frequently used to explain chromosomal changes in Meliponini and suggests that centric fission is responsible for variations in karyotype. However, differences in chromosome number between Meliponini and its sister taxa and in the karyotype patterns of the Melipona genus cannot be explained by MIT, suggesting that other events were involved in chromosomal evolution. Thus, we assembled cytogenetical and molecular information to reconstruct an ancestral chromosome number for Meliponini and its sister group, Bombini, and propose a hypothesis to explain the evolutionary pathways underpinning chromosomal changes in Meliponini. We hypothesize that the common ancestor shared by the Meliponini and Bombini tribes possessed a chromosome number of n = 18. The karyotype with n = 17 chromosomes was maintained in Meliponini, and variations of haploid numbers possibly originated through additional Robertsonian fissions and fusions. Thus, the low chromosome number would not be an ancestral condition, as predicted by MIT. We then conclude that Robertsonian fission and fusions are unlikely to be the cause of chromosomal rearrangements that originated the current karyotypes in Meliponini."

Indeed, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that diabetes was a risk factor for dementia. It was also reported that the intake of dairy products, such as milk, reduces the risk of developing dementia. We found that mice on a short-term high-fat diet (HFD) for 1 wk had reduced cognitive function. Thus, using this acute model, we investigated the effects of milk-derived peptide on cognitive decline induced by HFD. Tyr-Leu-Gly (YLG), a tripeptide derived from αS1-casein, a major bovine milk protein, is released by gastrointestinal proteases. We found that orally administered YLG improved cognitive decline induced by 1-wk HFD intake in the object recognition test. YLG also improved cognitive decline in the object location test. Thus, we found that YLG improved cognitive decline induced by HFD. Next, we examined the effects of YLG on the hippocampus, a brain area essential for cognitive function. HFD intake decreased the number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells, and this decrease was improved by YLG administration. HFD intake decreased nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, whereas YLG increased NGF and ciliary neurotrophic factor, suggesting that these neurotropic factors play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis after YLG administration. In conclusion, we demonstrated that 1-wk HFD reduced cognitive function. Furthermore, we found that YLG, a milk-derived tripeptide, improved cognitive decline in mice on HFD. The HFD reduced neural stem cell proliferation, and YLG improved this reduction. YLG is the first reported milk peptide to improve cognitive decline induced by HFD intake.-Nagai, A., Mizushige, T., Matsumura, S., Inoue, K., Ohinata, K.

Using longitudinal data from a large commercially insured population, we construct a network where a tie between patients is weighted by the number of shared opioid prescribers. Given prior research suggesting that doctor shopping may be a social process, we hypothesize that active doctor shoppers will occupy central structural positions in this network. We show that network prominence, operationalized using PageRank, is associated with more opioid prescriptions, higher predicted risk for dangerous morphine dosage, opioid overdose, and opioid use disorder, controlling for number of prescribers and other variables. Moreover, as a patient’s prominence increases over time, so does their risk for these outcomes, compared to their own average level of risk. Results highlight the importance of co-prescription networks in characterizing high-risk social dynamics."

However, it remains unknown whether these bony structures originate from the same cell lineage and how the hard palate is patterned at the molecular level. Using mice, here we report that deficiency in Shox2 (short stature homeobox 2), a transcriptional regulator whose expression is restricted to the anterior palatal mesenchyme, leads to a defective palatine process of the maxilla but does not affect the palatine. Shox2 overexpression in palatal mesenchyme resulted in a hyperplastic palatine process of the maxilla and a hypoplastic palatine. RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing analyses revealed that Shox2 controls the expression of pattern specification and skeletogenic genes associated with accessible chromatin in the anterior palate. This highlighted a lineage-autonomous function of Shox2 in patterning and osteogenesis of the hard palate. H3K27ac ChIP-Seq and transient transgenic enhancer assays revealed that Shox2 binds distal-acting cis-regulatory elements in an anterior palate–specific manner. Our results suggest that the palatine process of the maxilla and palatine arise from different cell lineages and differ in ossification mechanisms. Shox2 evidently controls osteogenesis of a cell lineage and contributes to the palatine process of the maxilla by interacting with distal cis-regulatory elements to regulate skeletogenic gene expression and to pattern the hard palate. Genome-wide Shox2 occupancy in the developing palate may provide a marker for identifying active anterior palate–specific gene enhancers. During mammalian palatogenesis, cranial neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells undergo osteogenic differentiation and form the hard palate, which is divided into palatine process of the maxilla and the palatine. However, it remains unknown whether these bony structures originate from the same cell lineage and how the hard palate is patterned at the molecular level. Using mice, here we report that deficiency in Shox2 (short stature homeobox 2), a transcriptional regulator whose expression is restricted to the anterior palatal mesenchyme, leads to a defective palatine process of the maxilla but does not affect the palatine. Shox2 overexpression in palatal mesenchyme resulted in a hyperplastic palatine process of the maxilla and a hypoplastic palatine.

Here, we offer new evidence that ORP4L interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the IP3 receptor type 1 (ITPR1) in Jurkat T cells. ORP4L enables IP3 binding to ITPR1; a truncated construct that lacks the ITPR1-binding region retains the ability to increase IP3 production but fails to mediate IP3 and ITPR1 binding. In association with this ability of ORP4L, it enhances Ca2+ release from the ER and subsequent cytosolic and mitochondrial parallel Ca2+ spike oscillations that stimulate mitochondrial energetics and thus maintains cell survival. These data support a novel model in which ORP4L is a cofactor of ITPR1, which increases ITPR1 sensitivity to IP3 and enables ER Ca2+ release.-Cao, X., Chen, J., Li, D., Xie, P., Xu, M., Lin, W., Li, S., Pan, G., Tang, Y., Xu, J., Olkkonen, V.

https://openalex.org/W2982281974,"This study mainly aims to identify the direct cost and economic burden of hypoglycemia for patients with type II diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. A cross-sectional study explored the cost incurred for hypoglycemia among patients admitted to University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). The study covered patients aged 20–79 years hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of ICD-10 hypoglycemia and discharged between January 2010 and September 2015 according to the casemix database. A costing analysis was done through a step-down approach from the perspective of health providers. Cost data were collected for three levels of cost centers with the help of a hospital-costing template. The costing data from UKMMC were used to estimate the national burden of hypoglycemia among type II diabetics for the whole country. Of 244 diabetes patients admitted primarily for hypoglycemia to UKMMC, 52% were female and 88% were over 50 years old. The cost increased with severity. Managing a hypoglycemic case requires five days (median) of inpatient stay on average, with a range of 2–26 days, and costs RM 8,949 (USD 2,289). Of the total cost, 30% related to ward (final cost center), 16% to ICU, and 15% to pharmacy (secondary-level cost center) services. Considering that 3.2% of all admissions were hypoglycemia related, the total annual cost of hypoglycemia care for adult diabetics in Malaysia is estimated at RM 117.4 (USD 30.0) million, which translates to 0.5% of the Ministry of Health budget. Hypoglycemia imposes a substantial economic impact even without the direct and indirect cost incurred by patients and other cost of complications. Diabetic management needs to include proper diabetic care and health education to reduce episodes of hypoglycemia."

Overall, our work highlights the importance of identifying large-scale functional circuit architectures and utilizing them as access points for behavioral disease correction. Aberrant sensory processing is one of the best recognized features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients often describe difficulties “filtering” sensory inputs, and “sensory overload” is frequently encountered in clinical practice (Marco et al., 2011Marco E.J. Hinkley L.B. Hill S.S. Nagarajan S.S. Sensory processing in autism: a review of neurophysiologic findings.Pediatr. Res. 2011; 69: 48R-54RCrossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, Tomchek and Dunn, 2007Tomchek S.D.

Despite this, little is known about the precise nature of sensory processing deficits in ASD: their neurobiology and their contribution to attentional and cognitive abnormalities. Gaining mechanistic insight would thus provide currently unknown points of entry for disease modification to impact attention and overall cognitive function in this disorder. In previous work, we identified a circuit abnormality in a mouse model of ASD, the PTCHD1 knockout (KO) (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PTCHD1 is a sonic hedgehog receptor family protein whose deletion in humans is associated with 1% of all ASD with intellectual disability (Chaudhry et al., 2015Chaudhry A. Noor A. Degagne B. Baker K.

During development, Ptchd1 is selectively enriched in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a shell of GABAergic neurons surrounding the thalamus that provides its major inhibitory input (Halassa and Acsády, 2016Halassa M.M. Acsády L. Thalamic inhibition: diverse sources, diverse scales.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 680-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Pinault, 2004Pinault D.

Our work identified a reduction in small conductance, Ca2+-activated potassium channel (SK) activity (Cueni et al., 2008Cueni L. Canepari M. Luján R. Emmenegger Y. Watanabe M. Bond C.T. Franken P. Adelman J.P. Lüthi A. T-type Ca2+ channels, SK2 channels and SERCAs gate sleep-related oscillations in thalamic dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) within TRN neurons of this model. Pharmacological correction of this deficit in a broad behavioral screen rescued attentional deficits and hyperactivity, but not memory deficits, aggression, and hypotonia (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the ability to rescue certain sensory processing deficits by targeting the TRN is of therapeutic potential, the involvement of multiple brain systems in the KO model raises the possibility that it may be insufficient for clinically relevant behavioral correction. Specifically, although the TRN is a key node for automatic sensory filtering, providing inhibition to refine and filter sensory inputs, TRN activity is under “top-down” control of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M. Schmitt L.I. Halassa M.M. Prefrontal cortex regulates sensory filtering through a basal ganglia-to-thalamus pathway.Neuron. 2019; 103: 445-458.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As such, in a disease state such as that modeled by the KO, it is unclear whether deficits in sensory filtering can be fully explained by TRN abnormalities or also involve failures in its top-down control. This is likely to be even more true in the majority of ASD cases arising from polygenic risk factors that almost certainly impact multiple brain systems (Intaitė et al., 2019Intaitė M. Georgescu A.L. Noreika V. von Saldern M.A. Vogeley K. Falter-Wagner C.M. Adults with autism spectrum condition have atypical perception of ambiguous figures when bottom-up and top-down interactions are incongruous.Autism. 2019; 23: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this study, we adopted a circuit-level approach investigating the nature of noise hypersensitivity in the KO. We focused on auditory-guided behavior, as it allowed us to parametrically adjust noise and signal characteristics. Consistent with prior studies (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we found some abnormalities in auditory processing that are explained by TRN dysfunction. However, we also identified deficits in top-down control of TRN function that were attributed to suboptimal encoding and maintenance of task-relevant information in the PFC. Based on these insights, we devised a combinatorial treatment targeting both prefrontal and thalamic circuits. This treatment fully rescued noise hypersensitivity and restored PFC-dependent control over sensory filtering in the KO. Collectively, these results highlight the benefits of targeting treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders based on a distributed circuit level understanding of behavioral functions. Our previous work had shown that the ASD-linked gene, Ptchd1, is selectively expressed in the TRN at birth (Figure 1A) and by postnatal day 15 (P15), expression is widespread across multiple brain regions, including the PFC (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We had also observed that, although KO mice were able to detect the location of visual flashes on par with wild-type littermates, their task performance was sharply impaired when targets were preceded with spatially incongruent visual distractors (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although these findings are consistent with sensory-related distractibility, the lack of parametric stimulus control in that task made it difficult to precisely link its behavioral results to the more general problem of noise hypersensitivity and map it onto the relevant circuits. To address these issues, we examined the impact of PTCHD1 deletion on auditory thalamic processing and broadband noise filtering in auditory-guided behavior. We chose to focus on the auditory system for two reasons: first, human ASD patients frequently show hypersensitivity to sounds (Baum et al., 2015Baum S.H. Stevenson R.A. Wallace M.T.

Neurobiol. 2015; 134: 140-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Dunn et al., 2006Dunn F.A. Doan T. Sampath A.P. Rieke F.

Briefly, we employed an intersectional strategy based on connectivity and genetic identity to optogenetically tag this TRN subnetwork (Figure 1B). Using multielectrode arrays, we evaluated the responses of these identified neurons in head-fixed mice (Figures 1C and 1D). Because these neurons show preferential responses to broadband stimuli (Cotillon-Williams et al., 2008Cotillon-Williams N. Huetz C. Hennevin E. Edeline J.M.

Schmitt et al., 2016, COSYNE, conference; Vaingankar et al., 2012Vaingankar V. Soto-Sanchez C. Wang X. Sommer F.T. Hirsch J.A. Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus are selective for diverse and complex visual features.Front. Integr. Nuerosci. 2012; 6: 118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we delivered mid-intensity broadband auditory noise (Gaussian white noise, 57 dB; see STAR Methods) to both KO and wild-type controls. Inspection of single-neuron recordings revealed a striking difference between the two groups; although KO audTRN neurons showed significantly higher baseline spike rates compared to control neurons, their firing rate in response to broadband noise was comparable (Figures 1E and 1F). One explanation for these observations is that audTRN neurons in the KO are close to saturation in the absence of sensory input, impeding their ability to increase their firing rate. To test this idea, we measured audTRN responses to increasing levels of broadband noise. We found that the range of their response profile was indeed diminished, with a significantly lower stimulation required to drive half-maximal response (Figures 1G and 1H) but a comparable maximal spike rate (Figure 1I). To determine whether changes in audTRN neural spiking observed in the KO could be explained by altered intrinsic properties, we performed whole-cell recordings of retrobead-identified audTRN neurons in acute slices (Figure S1A; see STAR Methods). Consistent with previous recordings of TRN neurons not identified based on connectivity (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we found reduced repetitive bursting in KO audTRN neurons (Figures S1B–S1D). Previous data indicated that this bursting phenotype involved diminished SK channel conductance (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Given that SK channels have also been shown to determine neural input/output functions (Deister et al., 2009Deister C.A. Chan C.S. Surmeier D.J. Wilson C.J. Calcium-activated SK channels influence voltage-gated ion channels to determine the precision of firing in globus pallidus neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8452-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we wondered whether their diminished conductance could explain enhanced spontaneous spike rates observed in KO audTRN neurons. As such, we measured the input/output function of audTRN neurons in the slice following step current injections (Luque et al., 2017Luque M.A. Beltran-Matas P. Marin M.C. Torres B. Herrero L. Excitability is increased in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of Fmr1 knockout mice.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12: e0185067Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and found that KO neurons showed a leftward shift (Figures S1E–S1G). Fitting of response curves to these observations indicated that audTRN spiking in the KO would saturate at a much lower level of current injection compared with control (Figure S1H) but that maximum firing rates would be similar (control: 56 ± 4.9 Hz; KO: 59 ± 2.9 Hz). To approximate dynamically varying sensory input, we employed a 2-step current injection protocol (Figure S1I). Compared to control neurons, responses to additional current were diminished in audTRN KO neurons despite there being no significant change in absolute firing rates on the second current step (Figures S1J and S1K). These findings support a model in which reduced sensory-driven responses in the KO occur because audTRN neurons are already close to their response maximum in the absence of sensory input. Given that TRN neurons have been reported to engage in feedforward and feedback inhibition of sensory thalamic circuits (Crabtree, 1999Crabtree J.W. Intrathalamic sensory connections mediated by the thalamic reticular nucleus.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 683-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Crabtree, 2018Crabtree J.W. Functional diversity of thalamic reticular subnetworks.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, Cruikshank et al., 2010Cruikshank S.J. Urabe H. Nurmikko A.V. Connors B.W. Pathway-specific feedforward circuits between thalamus and neocortex revealed by selective optical stimulation of axons.Neuron. 2010; 65: 230-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we asked whether the KO’s diminished audTRN sensory responses impacted auditory processing at the level of MGBv (Hackett et al., 2011Hackett T.A. Barkat T.R. O’Brien B.M. Hensch T.K. Polley D.B. Linking topography to tonotopy in the mouse auditory thalamocortical circuit.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2983-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Tsukano et al., 2017Tsukano H. Horie M. Ohga S. Takahashi K. Kubota Y. Hishida R. Takebayashi H. Shibuki K. Reconsidering tonotopic maps in the auditory cortex and lemniscal auditory thalamus in mice.Front. Neural Circuits. 2017; 11: 14PubMed Google Scholar). Recordings of MGBv auditory responses (to appropriately selected stimuli; dynamic random cords [DRCs]; see STAR Methods) revealed that KO MGBv neurons had comparable spontaneous spiking rates to controls (Figures 2A–2C) but that auditory responses of KO MGBv neurons were significantly elevated (Figures 2B and 2C). Critically, KO responses were further elevated and showed degraded temporal precision when noise was added to the stimuli (Figures 2D–2F and S2A). In contrast, control MGBv neurons showed sparser responses and intact temporal precision with similar average firing rate with moderate levels of broadband noise. These results suggest that audTRN dysfunction in the KO produces a hypersensitivity to noise in MGBv neuronal responses. The impact on MGBv-evoked responses in the KO with relative sparing of spontaneous activity suggested that audTRN preferentially influences MGBv-evoked responses. To investigate this idea, we approximated MGBv responses using a simple linear-non-linear model with two steps: linear input integration and non-linear spike generation (Ostojic and Brunel, 2011Ostojic S. Brunel N. From spiking neuron models to linear-nonlinear models.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1001056Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Overath et al., 2015Overath T. McDermott J.H. Zarate J.M. Poeppel D. The cortical analysis of speech-specific temporal structure revealed by responses to sound quilts.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We generated two variants of the model, in which audTRN suppression impacted either the linear step (corresponding to dendritic inhibition) or the non-linear one (corresponding to peri-somatic inhibition) (Jadi et al., 2012Jadi M. Polsky A. Schiller J. Mel B.W. Location-dependent effects of inhibition on local spiking in pyramidal neuron dendrites.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002550Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Miles et al., 1996Miles R. Tóth K. Gulyás A.I. Hájos N. Freund T.F. Differences between somatic and dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus.Neuron. 1996; 16: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The models made different predictions on how audTRN activity suppression would affect MGBv spontaneous versus evoked spike rates (Figures S2B and S2C). To determine which model accurately captured real audTRN/MGBv interactions, we analyzed MGBv spiking data in recordings with optogenetic audTRN suppression (Figure S2D). We found that this manipulation increased evoked MGBv responses without altering spontaneous activity (Figure S2E), supporting a model in which audTRN controls MGBv sensory-input gain (Figures S2B and S2C, model 1). This is consistent with anatomical studies showing that audTRN neurons preferentially innervate MGBv dendrites (Wang et al., 2001Wang S. Bickford M.E. Van Horn S.C. Erisir A. Godwin D.W. Sherman S.M. Synaptic targets of thalamic reticular nucleus terminals in the visual thalamus of the cat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and may explain the selective impact of the KO on evoked, but not spontaneous, MGBv activity. To examine the consequences of neural noise hypersensitivity in the KO for behavior, we employed a recently developed task (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M. Schmitt L.I. Halassa M.M. Prefrontal cortex regulates sensory filtering through a basal ganglia-to-thalamus pathway.Neuron. 2019; 103: 445-458.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that provides a parametric behavioral readout of noise sensitivity by requiring animals to discriminate auditory signals while the level of background noise levels is varied (Figure 2G). On each trial, a mouse was presented with one of the three different tones (20 kHz, 16 kHz, or 24 kHz; 100-ms duration each). Mice were trained to nose-poke following presentation of a 20-kHz tone but to withhold following presentation of either 16-kHz or 24-kHz tones. Both appropriate response types (hits and correct rejections) were rewarded (Figure 2G). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the targets was varied by adding different intensities of broadband background noise. In addition to assessing auditory signal discrimination as a function of background noise, this task provided the ability to engage the executive component of noise filtering by including a noise-predictive cue on some trials (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M. Schmitt L.I. Halassa M.M. Prefrontal cortex regulates sensory filtering through a basal ganglia-to-thalamus pathway.Neuron. 2019; 103: 445-458.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this latter property of the task would allow us to distinguish deficits in automatic noise filtering (uncued trials) from executive controlled noise filtering (cued trials). Using this approach, we found that, when target stimulus SNR was high (i.e., no background noise was added), KO performance was comparable to controls (Figure 2H; SNR = 120). However, KO performance rapidly degraded if background noise was increased (Figure 2H), as expected based on their neural noise hypersensitivity (Figures 2F and S2A). Intriguingly, although control animals showed significant improvement in performance on a subset of low SNR trials if the noise-predicting cue was presented, enhancement was minimal in the KO (Figures 2I and 2J). These findings suggested that KO mice were unable to use cues to anticipate (and suppress) upcoming noise. Given their behavioral deficit on uncued trials, however, it was difficult to determine whether a deficit in automatic noise filtering potentially attributable to the audTRN was sufficient to explain deficits on cued trials or whether it might involve dysfunction in executive control. As such, we designed additional experiments to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Our previous study indicated that deficits in thalamic sensory processing can be targeted by boosting SK channel activity, restoring sensory-evoked thalamic inhibitory responses in KO mice in vivo (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As such, we assessed the impact of the SK channel positive allosteric modulator 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinOne (EBIO) (25 mg/kg) on task performance in KO mice. We found that EBIO injection resulted in near complete restoration of behavioral performance on trials in which no cue was delivered (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, however, this pharmacological approach had only a modest effect on cued trial performance (Figures 3B and 3C). Is the lower effect on cued performance due to incomplete TRN pharmacological rescue or is it evidence for circuit perturbation beyond the TRN? To answer this question, we asked how EBIO delivery impacted neural measures of noise hypersensitivity in the KO. We found that EBIO ameliorated the elevated spontaneous spike rates we had observed in KO audTRN neurons (Figures 3D and 3E). Because sound-evoked responses remained similar (Figure 3E), this resulted in a restoration of audTRN dynamic range. In addition, firing rates in MGBv neurons were normalized (Figure S3A) and temporal response fidelity was improved (Figure S3B). Moreover, EBIO injection restored the ability to decode noise-masked pure tones used in the task based on population responses in the MGBv (Figure 3F). In combination with our behavioral findings, these results indicated that, although EBIO largely normalized intrinsic thalamic circuitry in the context of auditory stimulus processing, this was insufficient for full behavioral rescue in cued noisy discrimination behavior. As such, we posited that the residual behavioral deficits might be due to dysfunction of circuits outside the TRN. Consistent with this notion, we found that PTCHD1 deletion largely limited to the TRN (Wells et al., 2016Wells M.F. Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Feng G. Halassa M.M. Thalamic reticular impairment underlies attention deficit in Ptchd1(Y/-) mice.Nature. 2016; 532: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; see STAR Methods), resulting in animals that showed improvement on cued trials following EBIO injections that was comparable to controls (Figure S3C). Given previous findings showing that the cued component of this task involved stimulus-independent engagement of the audTRN (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M. Schmitt L.I. Halassa M.M. Prefrontal cortex regulates sensory filtering through a basal ganglia-to-thalamus pathway.Neuron. 2019; 103: 445-458.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we next set out to test whether perturbation of executive control could explain residual deficits. Previous studies (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M. Schmitt L.I. Halassa M.M. Prefrontal cortex regulates sensory filtering through a basal ganglia-to-thalamus pathway.Neuron. 2019; 103: 445-458.e10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D.

Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) showed the PFC controls thalamic inhibition following cue onset but prior to target stimulus presentation. By developing a method to directly measure thalamic inhibition in vivo (see STAR Methods), we had been able to measure this anticipatory, PFC-dependent change in thalamic inhibition. Application of this method to the MGBv of both control and KO animals (Figure 3G) showed that EBIO rescued the sound-evoked thalamic inhibitory signal, but not its PFC-dependent engagement (Figures 3H and 3I), consistent with the idea that KO mice have an audTRN-independent deficit in the ability to engage filtering in response to a noise-predictive cue. In a recent study, we had found that executive control of thalamic sensory filtering is implemented via a PFC-to-basal-ganglia-to-thalamus pathway capable of recruiting the sensory TRN (Nakajima et al., 2019Nakajima M.

https://openalex.org/W2981459533,"Introduction Little is known about hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to describe the frequency of HEV infection and associated risk factors in patients with cirrhosis from Argentina. Materials and methods We evaluated HEV seroprevalence (IgG anti-HEV) and acute infections (IgM and RNA) in patients with cirrhosis (n = 140) vs. healthy controls (n = 300). Additionally, we compared the same outcomes in individuals with alcohol-related cirrhosis (n = 43) vs. patients with alcohol use disorder (without cirrhosis, n = 72). Results The overall HEV seroprevalence in the cohort of subjects with cirrhosis was 25% (35/140), compared to 4% in the healthy control group [12/300; OR = 8; (95% CI = 4–15.99); p<0.05]. HEV seropositivity was significantly higher in alcohol-related cirrhosis compared to other causes of cirrhosis [39.5% vs. 12.4%; OR = 4.71; (95% CI = 1.9–11.6); p<0.05] and to healthy controls [OR = 15.7; (95% CI = 6.8–36.4); p = 0.0001]. The HEV seroprevalence in alcoholic-related cirrhosis vs. with alcohol use disorder was 39.5% vs. 12.5% [OR = 4.58; (95% CI = 1.81–11.58); p<0.001]. Conclusion We found a high seroprevalence of HEV in patients with cirrhosis and in individuals with alcohol use disorder. The simultaneous presence of both factors (cirrhosis + alcohol) showed more association to HEV infection. Larger studies with prospective follow up are needed to further clarify this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2981472939,"Using a nationally representative longitudinal cohort, we examine how cognitive aptitude in early adolescence is associated with heterogeneous pathways of marijuana use from age sixteen through young adulthood. We also examine whether this relationship can be explained by the role of cognitive aptitude in the social organization of peer group deviance.Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we identified 5 latent trajectories of frequency of marijuana use between ages 16 and 26: abstainers, dabblers, early heavy quitters, consistent users, and persistent heavy users. Multinomial regression assessed the relationship of cognitive aptitude in early adolescence with these latent trajectories, including the role of peer group substance use in this relationship.A one decile increase in cognitive aptitude in early adolescence is associated with greater relative risk of the dabbler trajectory (RR = 1.048; p < .001) and consistent user trajectory (RR = 1.126; p < .001), but lower relative risk of the early heavy quitter trajectory (RR = 0.917; p < .05) in comparison with the abstainer trajectory. There was no effect for the persistent heavy user trajectory. The inclusion of peer group substance use-either via illegal drugs or smoking-had no effect on these relationships.Adolescents who rate higher in cognitive aptitude during early adolescence may be more likely to enter into consistent but not extreme trajectories of marijuana use as they age into young adulthood. Cognition may not influence patterns of marijuana use over time via the organization of peer groups."
https://openalex.org/W2981818583,"The Adirondack Park in New York State contains a unique and limited distribution of boreal ecosystem types, providing habitat for a number of birds at the southern edge of their range. Species are projected to shift poleward in a warming climate, and the limited boreal forest of the Adirondacks is expected to undergo significant change in response to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Here we expand upon a previous analysis to examine changes in occupancy patterns for eight species of boreal birds over a decade (2007-2016), and we assess the relative contribution of climate and non-climate drivers in determining colonization and extinction rates. Our analysis identifies patterns of declining occupancy for six of eight species, including some declines which appear to have become more pronounced since a prior analysis. Although non-climate drivers such as wetland area, connectivity, and human footprint continue to influence colonization and extinction rates, we find that for most species, occupancy patterns are best described by climate drivers. We modeled both average and annual temperature and precipitation characteristics and find stronger support for species' responses to average climate conditions, rather than interannual climate variability. In general, boreal birds appear most likely to colonize sites that have lower levels of precipitation and a high degree of connectivity, and they tend to persist in sites that are warmer in the breeding season and have low and less variable precipitation in the winter. It is likely that these responses reflect interactions between broader habitat conditions and temperature and precipitation variables. Indirect climate influences as mediated through altered species interactions may also be important in this context. Given climate change predictions for both temperature and precipitation, it is likely that habitat structural changes over the long term may alter these relationships in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2982039582,"VEGF is a critical driver of ocular neovascularization under disease conditions. Current therapeutic strategies rely on intraocular delivery of VEGF-antagonizing reagents, which results in sustained suppression of pathogenic vascularization. Although significant advancement has been achieved in VEGF antagonism, substantial adverse effects have been reported in retrospective clinical studies. To study mechanisms for VEGF antagonism-associated adverse effects in visual system, we intravitreally delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of soluble Fms-related tyrosine kinase-1 (rAAV.sFLT-1), the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor, and analyzed the morphology and functions of retinal tissue. Here, we confirmed that intraocular VEGF antagonism induced retinal degeneration and gliosis. The functional deficit in retinal response to visual stimulation was also demonstrated in rAAV.sFLT-1-treated eyes by electroretinogram. Moreover, high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis suggests that VEGF antagonism activates retinal degeneration, inflammation, and other adverse effects. Taken together, our findings have shed light on pathogenic mechanisms for VEGF antagonism-associated adverse effects and potential therapeutic targets.-Xiao, M., Liu, Y., Wang, L., Liang, J., Wang, T., Zhai, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, S., Liu, W., Luo, X., Wang, F., Sun, X.

https://openalex.org/W2981855221,"Aim It is difficult to determine whether or not end-of-life care is necessary for frail older adults complaining of anorexia without underlying disease, such as cancer or organ failure. The main reason for this is the lack of the specification of the anorexia cause and no understanding of the cause-providing factor and the prognostic factor. This study aimed to clarify the cause of anorexia, and the determinant of the cause and recovery from anorexia. Methods Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on patients with anorexia without an underlying disease who were aged ≥65 years and visited the emergency department of a single tertiary care center between 2016 and 2017. Patient characteristics at hospital visit, the cause of anorexia, and diagnostic modalities were summarized. The diagnosis-providing rate, recovery rate, and the association between them were analyzed. Results Eighty-three patients (mean age 82.3 years; 50.6% male) were investigated. In 67 patients (81%), the causes of anorexia were identified, including 18 patients (22%) with infection, 13 (16%) with benign gastrointestinal diseases, and 7 (8%) with cardiovascular diseases. In 16 patients (19%), the causes of anorexia were not identified despite examinations. The modality that most contributed to diagnosis was plain computed tomography followed by blood tests. The value regarding information in history-taking and physical examinations was limited. Sixty-five patients (78%) recovered. Only 73% of patients with a definite cause recovered; all patients with an unknown cause recovered. Conclusions Older adults with anorexia are not always at the end of life, and efforts to identify the cause are crucial. Moreover, it is vital to realize the limitations associated with the treatment of infections and cardiovascular diseases."

The Amargosa vole (Microtus californicus scirpensis) is an increasingly imperiled rodent constrained to rare wetland habitat in the Mojave Desert. In 2014 and 2016, we trapped and radio-collared 30 voles, 24 were translocated and six remained at donor and recipient marshes as resident control voles. Soft-release was performed followed by remote camera and radio-telemetry monitoring. Although comparative metrics were not statistically significant, the mean maximum known distance moved (MDM) was longer for translocated (82.3 ± 14.6 m) vs. resident-control voles (74.9 ± 17.5 m) and for female (98.4 ± 19.9 m) vs. male (57.8 ± 9.1 m) voles. The mean area occupied (AO) tended to be greater in female (0.15 ± 0.04 ha) vs. male (0.12 ± 0.03 ha) voles, and control voles (0.15 ± 0.05 ha) compared with translocated voles (0.13 ± 0.03 ha). The mean minimum known time alive (MTA) was 38.2 ± 19.4 days for resident-control voles and 47.0 ± 10.6 days for translocated voles. Female survival (55.7 ± 14.3 days) exceeded that of males (31.5 ± 9.4 days) regardless of study group. Activity in bulrush/rushes mix and bulrush vegetation types was strongly and significantly overrepresented compared with salt grass and rushes alone, and habitat selection did not differ between resident and translocated voles. Our results provide ecological and methodological insights for future translocations as part of a strategy of promoting long-term survival of an extremely endangered small mammal in a wild desert environment."
https://openalex.org/W2981634650,"Detailed knowledge of age-related changes in the structure and mineralization of bones is important for interpreting osseous changes in wild mammals caused by exposure to environmental contaminants. This study analyzed mandibular size, microarchitecture and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in harbor seals (n = 93, age range 0.5 months to 25 years) from the German North Sea. Bone microarchitecture and vBMD were assessed using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Significant differences were observed between the analyzed age classes (i) young juveniles (0.5-10 months), (ii) yearlings (12-23 months), and (iii) adults (12-25 years) for several of the variables, indicating an overall increase in cortical and trabecular area, cortical thickness and total and cortical vBMD with age. Furthermore, for juvenile animals (≤ 23 months), significant positive correlations with age were observed for mandible length and perimeter, cortical area, cortical thickness, trabecular separation, and total and cortical vBMD. The findings demonstrate a rapid increase in overall size, cortical dimensions and the degree of mineralization of the harbor seal mandible during the first two years after birth. Negative correlations with age existed for trabecular number and thickness as well as for trabecular bone volume fraction in the juveniles. The findings suggest a reduction in trabecular bone volume fraction with age, due to the bone trabeculae becoming thinner, less numerous and more widely spaced. Given the strong age dependence of most analyzed parameters, it is recommended to standardize samples with respect to age in future studies comparing microarchitecture and mineralization of harbor seal mandibles from different populations or different collection periods."
https://openalex.org/W2981935416,"A tobamovirus was isolated from leaves of Alliaria petiolata plants, showing vein-clearing, interveinal chlorosis, and moderate deformation. Host range experiments revealed a high similarity of isolate ApH both to ribgrass mosaic viruses and turnip vein-clearing viruses. The complete nucleotide sequence of the viral genome was determined. The genomic RNA is composed of 6312 nucleotides and contains four open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 is 3324 nt-long and encodes a polypeptide of about 125.3 kDa. The ORF1 encoded putative replication protein contains an Alphavirus-like methyltransferase domain. ORF2 is 4806 nt-long and encodes a polypeptide of about 182 kDa. The ORF2 encoded putative replication protein contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, catalytic domain. ORF3 encodes the putative cell-to-cell movement protein with a molecular weight of 30.1 kDa. ORF4 overlaps with ORF3 and encodes the coat protein with a size of 17.5 kDa. Sequence comparisons revealed that the ApH isolate has the highest similarity to turnip vein-clearing viruses and should be considered an isolate of Turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV). This is the first report on the occurrence of TVCV in Hungary. In vitro transcripts prepared from the full-length cDNA clone of TVCV-ApH were highly infectious and induced typical symptoms characteristic to the original isolate of the virus. Since infectious clones of TVCV-ApH and crTMV (another isolate of TVCV) markedly differed in respect to recovery phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana, it is feasible to carry out gene exchange or mutational studies to determine viral factors responsible for the symptom recovery phenotype."

But 3 months after our youngest daughter Marie was born, she started to have seizures. After a terrifying ambulance ride and a nerve-wracking week in a children's hospital, Marie was diagnosed with ring chromosome 14 syndrome, an exceedingly rare and debilitating condition caused when the 14th chromosome is fused into a ring. Life for our family was about to switch tracks, and we were along for the ride but no longer in control.

> “When Marie was born our smooth, straight ride … turned into a roller coaster.” 

Marie's seizures had no regard for class schedules or family time. We tried to keep up with our teaching duties, but it was difficult to lecture knowing that our young daughter could have a life-threatening seizure at any moment. Neither of us wanted to give up our academic career—and we didn't want the other to have to, either. But rigid teaching schedules proved untenable, especially when coupled with the other stresses of academic life, and we needed more flexibility.

The reality was that Andrew was tenured, with the associated job security, and Yssa had applied mathematics expertise that made her more marketable outside academia. After discussing our options, we decided that Yssa would forgo her academic appointment. She obtained a part-time research position in industry, which required fewer hours for equivalent pay and allowed her to work from home when needed. She also started a nonprofit organization for families and researchers interested in ring 14. Our lives were still complicated—including multiple therapy sessions each week plus specialized, expensive child care—but it seemed we had found a way forward.

We made this arrangement work for many years. But as our older daughters approached college age, we needed to re-evaluate our situation again. They had matured into fantastic caregivers, and their departure would have a huge impact on their sister and on us. Marie's seizures continued unabated, she was hospitalized regularly, and new concerns were looming as she approached adolescence. Facing numerous surgeries and complex long-term care, we struggled to achieve the elusive work-life balance and needed more support than well-meaning friends could offer.

So, 5 years ago, we moved from Indiana to our native Texas, where most of our extended family resides. We developed a plan to sell the move to Andrew's department head and dean: He'd take a 1-year sabbatical at 50% pay while spending the other half of his time working in an unrelated family business. That way we could give an in absentia appointment a try.

The administrators were understandably skeptical at first, but they agreed to a trial run. The first year of Andrew's “sabbatical” ultimately proved successful, so he resigned from the family business and returned full-time to his faculty role—buoyed by the support of empathetic students, colleagues, and administrators. He spends about 1 week per month on campus and continues to teach, maintain a research lab, and serve on myriad committees. It's often difficult, as Andrew sometimes struggles to arrange online access to meetings and he misses having colleagues down the hall. But so far it has been tenable.

By helping us find a better work-life balance, the arrangement has also allowed Yssa to continue her work, which is now fully focused on running national and international ring 14 nonprofits. Yssa misses many aspects of her prior professional life, most of all the students. However, she finds intellectual stimulation and reward in working with parents and physicians to push medicine forward and help families become their own advocates.

When Marie was born our smooth, straight ride unexpectedly turned into a roller coaster, with many joys but also with some poignant regrets. Ultimately, though, we are fortunate in many ways: wonderful children, a strong marriage, and rewarding work aided by a university that accommodates our whole family's needs.

Demographic data and clinical information of these inpatients were collected. As there was no reference interval of minors, the occurrence of abnormal liver function was estimated by that of adults, temporarily. A new concept (mean-variance induced by drug, MVID) was introduced to analyze the characteristics of total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Effect of MVID of TBil, DBil, ALT and AST in different patients (aged<1 year old and aged ≥ 1 year old) were compared by Mann-Whitney U test.Estimating by reference intervals of adults, 57.4% underage inpatients (108/188) had abnormal liver function. According to the probability distribution curve of MVID, IMP can cause the increase of AST in 24% (0.62-0.38) Chinese underage inpatients, and the increase of ALT in 20% (0.60-0.40) Chinese underage inpatients. And liver protecting drugs can decrease MVID of ALT and AST. There were not statistically significant differences in MVID of TBil, DBil, ALT and AST in different patients (aged<1 year old and aged ≥ 1 year old); P value was 0.711, 0.734, 0.067 and 0.086, respectively.IMP can affect the liver function of 20-24% Chinese underage inpatients mainly by increasing the AST and ALT. IMP may induce hepatocellular injury, but not cholestasis. And liver protecting drugs can reverse the side effects caused by IMP. Age may not affect the effect of IMP on liver function."
