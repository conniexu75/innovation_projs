https://openalex.org/W1967791012,"The authors discovered that circular RNAs are significantly enriched in the mouse brain and can be visualized in situ, near synapses. They observed that many circRNAs change their abundance during synaptogenesis and also following neuronal homeostatic plasticity, suggesting a function for circRNA in regulating synaptic development and plasticity. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have re-emerged as an interesting RNA species. Using deep RNA profiling in different mouse tissues, we observed that circRNAs were substantially enriched in brain and a disproportionate fraction of them were derived from host genes that encode synaptic proteins. Moreover, on the basis of separate profiling of the RNAs localized in neuronal cell bodies and neuropil, circRNAs were, on average, more enriched in the neuropil than their host gene mRNA isoforms. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization, we visualized circRNA punctae in the dendrites of neurons. Consistent with the idea that circRNAs might regulate synaptic function during development, many circRNAs changed their abundance abruptly at a time corresponding to synaptogenesis. In addition, following a homeostatic downscaling of neuronal activity many circRNAs exhibited substantial up- or downregulation. Together, our data indicate that brain circRNAs are positioned to respond to and regulate synaptic function."

Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that dietary changes promptly induce the alteration of abundance of both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in obesity and its related metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, the metabolic roles of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes on such disease states remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of antibiotic-induced depletion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes on dysregulation of energy homeostasis in obesity. Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with the antibiotics (vancomycin [V] and bacitracin [B]), in the drinking water, before diet-induced obesity (DIO) greatly decreased both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the gut as revealed by pyrosequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene. Concomitantly, systemic glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance in DIO were ameliorated via augmentation of GLP-1 secretion (active form; 2.03-fold, total form; 5.09-fold) independently of obesity as compared with untreated DIO controls. Furthermore, there were increases in metabolically beneficial metabolites derived from the gut. Together, our data suggest that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes potentially mediate insulin resistance through modulation of GLP-1 secretion in obesity.—Hwang, I., Park, Y. J., Kim, Y. -R., Kim, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2026678165,"Sarcolipin (SLN) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) in muscle. SLN binding to SERCA uncouples Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis. By this mechanism, SLN promotes the futile cycling of SERCA, contributing to muscle heat production. We recently showed that SLN plays an important role in cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism of how SLN regulates muscle metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we used both SLN knockout (Sln−/−) and skeletal muscle-specific SLN overexpression (SlnOE) mice to explore energy metabolism by pair feeding (fixed calories) and high-fat diet feeding (ad libitum). Our results show that, upon pair feeding, SlnOE mice lost weight compared with the WT, but Sln−/− mice gained weight. Interestingly, when fed with a high-fat diet, SlnOE mice consumed more calories but gained less weight and maintained a normal metabolic profile in comparison with WT and Sln−/− mice. We found that oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation were increased markedly in SlnOE mice. There was also an increase in both mitochondrial number and size in SlnOE muscle, together with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and PPAR γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α), key transcriptional activators of mitochondrial biogenesis and enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. These results, taken together, establish an important role for SLN in muscle metabolism and energy expenditure. On the basis of these data we propose that SLN is a novel target for enhancing whole-body energy expenditure.

We speculate that the resulting farnesyl protrusion toward the cell interior allows oligomerization of the K-Ras4B membrane binding domain in rigid microdomains. Unlike other Ras isoforms, K-Ras4B HVR contains a single farnesyl modification and positively charged polylysine sequence. The high positive charge not only modulates specific HVR binding to anionic phospholipids but farnesyl membrane orientation.

H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4A are modified with farnesyl and palmitoyl lipid groups on their HVRs. Lipidation helps anchor the proteins to the plasma membrane. K-Ras4B lacks palmitoyl groups in its HVR, containing a single farnesyl prenylation. Instead, it has a unique polybasic region, with half of the residues being positively charged Lys. These together with the farnesyl group help localize K-Ras4B to membrane microdomains (12.Welman A. Burger M.M. Hagmann J.

Recent studies have uncovered the mechanism of K-Ras4B enrichment in the plasma membrane that involves continuous sequestration from endomembranes by cytosolic PDEδ (15.Schmick M. Vartak N. Papke B.

It was argued that both H-Ras and K-Ras are in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts/caveolae fractions (24.Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.

We hypothesized that membrane composition may play an important role in HVR interaction with the membrane. The studies show that K-Ras4B can be differentially distributed in the membrane depending on membrane fluidity. The data suggest that K-Ras4B signaling is impacted by association with different microdomains of the membrane. Our studies show that K-Ras4B is distributed between rigid lipid raft and disordered non-raft regions of the plasma membrane. The farnesyl group binds cooperatively to membrane phospholipids depending on membrane fluidity. We observe that the farnesyl group of K-Ras4B inserts into loosely packed bilayers containing unsaturated phospholipids. Conversely, saturated phospholipids that pack tightly into rigid lipid domains are less permissive of farnesyl insertion. Studies of the modeled HVR peptides verify that the farnesyl group spontaneously inserts into the lipid bilayer containing unsaturated phospholipids, but the insertion is restricted by phosphorylation. Our data further point to the farnesyl group being responsible for oligomerization of the protein. We speculate that if the farnesyl group is not inserted into the membrane, it may serve in cooperative binding to other K-Ras4B molecules, thus leading to dimerization. In this case, the protein binds the membrane through electrostatic interactions between its positively charged HVR and the negatively charged membrane phospholipids. In the case of disordered phospholipid domains, the farnesyl group burial in the phospholipids tends to hinder its interactions. The murine alveolar type II lung epithelial E10 cell line was provided as a kind gift by Dr. A. Maciag (NCI-Frederick). Cells were cultured in Connaught Medical Research Laboratories1065 basal medium supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free FCS (Sigma), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were transduced with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged K-Ras4B-G12V cDNA in a tetracycline regulated retroviral expression vector (obtained from Dr. Geoffrey J. Clark, University of Louisville). Individual blasticidin-resistant colonies were isolated by ring cloning. HA-KRas4B-G12V expression was optimized and induced with a final concentration of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Fisher). For immunohistochemistry, cells were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml GM1 (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) for 1 h before fixing. E10 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. GM1 was labeled using the Vybrant Alexa Fluor 594 Lipid Raft Labeling kit (Invitrogen). Samples were subsequently probed with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-HA (Invitrogen) primary antibody overnight at 4 °C for K-Ras4B-G12V labeling. Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed using Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Staining controls were performed with normal rabbit or mouse IgG. The stabilized lipid bilayers called nanodiscs were assembled according to published protocols (27.Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G.

First, membrane scaffold protein (MSP1D1) was expressed as a His6 fusion in BL21DE3-Star cell and purified to homogeneity using Ni2+-His-bind resin (Novagen). Pure fractions of MSP1D1 were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% NaN3). The protein concentration was adjusted to ∼0.4 mm using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device. The following phospholipids were utilized for making nanodiscs: dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS). We also used phosphatidylethanolamine-based lipids for the purpose of immobilization: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE). DPPC was dissolved in chloroform and mixed with DPPE phospholipids (Avanti Lipids) in a 95:5 molar ratio. The mixture was subsequently dried at room temperature using an Eppendorf Vacufuge and resuspended in storage buffer containing a 2-fold molar excess of sodium cholate. MSP1D1 was added to the phospholipid mixture such that the molar ratio of MSP1D1:DPPE:DPPC was 1:5:95. The protein and phospholipid mixture was stored at 37 °C for 1 h. The concentration of sodium cholate in solution was reduced by a 5-fold dilution in storage buffer. The sample was dialyzed extensively against the storage buffer to remove all traces of sodium cholate. DOPC and DOPS nanodiscs were prepared in a similar manner to DPPC nanodiscs. Before immobilization on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor chips the phospholipid nanodiscs were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 0.1 m NaCl. The immobilization was carried out on one flowcell of the CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) to obtain a maximum 6000 response units using the immobilization wizard on the Biacore T100 control software. Ethanolamine was immobilized on the control flowcell of the same sensor chip for referencing purposes. To study the binding of farnesylated and non-farnesylated hypervariable region peptides to the nanodiscs, the peptides were adjusted to the required concentrations in 50 mm Tris-citrate, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Before each run the running buffer was applied to the sensor chip for equilibration. The affinity wizard was used for binding and dissociation tests. All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 10 μl/min and a contact time of 240 s. The regeneration time and dissociation time were set to 30 s and 240 s, respectively. A solution of 2 m NaCl was used to regenerate the sensor chips. After successive rounds of association and dissociation the response was adjusted to baseline using the regeneration procedure. The production of farnesylated HVR domain was done according to our published paper (29.Chavan T.S. Abraham S. Gaponenko V. Application of reductive 13C-methylation of lysines to enhance the sensitivity of conventional NMR methods.Molecules. 2013; 18: 7103-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We attached farnesyl-cysteine methyl ester to HVR peptide using succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), a bifunctional cross-linker. We generated a peptide containing the sequence of HVR from K-Ras4B, KEKMSKDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM, using the CHARMM program (30.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. Charmm: a program for macromolecular energy, minimization, and dynamics calculations.J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13939) Google Scholar). The HVR sequence contains positively charged Lys residues. The initially created 22-residue-long peptide was very stiff but gradually relaxed after solvation and molecular dynamics simulations. Ensembles of conformations in aqueous environment were obtained after a 50-ns production run, and these water-relaxed conformations were used as initial configurations in the lipid bilayer simulations. To simulate the HVR peptide on the lipid bilayer, we modified the C-terminal tail of the peptide via farnesylation at Cys-185 and phosphorylation at Ser-181. The first modification was a replacement of the lipidated side chain, the farnesyl group with the Cys-185 side chain, and the second involved the addition of phosphate (PO43−) group to the Ser-181 side chain. Although the standard CHARMM (30.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. Charmm: a program for macromolecular energy, minimization, and dynamics calculations.J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13939) Google Scholar) program provides parameters for phosphorylated amino acids, no parameters for the farnesylated Cys residue are currently available. Thus, we first created the molecular topology for the farnesyl group using the Avogadro software (31.Hanwell M.D. Curtis D.E. Lonie D.C. Vandermeersch T. Zurek E. Hutchison G.R. Avogadro: an advanced semantic chemical editor, visualization, and analysis platform.J. Cheminform. 2012; 4: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1967668937,"The protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is complexed with the WD repeat protein MEP50 (also known as Wdr77 or androgen coactivator p44) in vertebrates in a tetramer of heterodimers. MEP50 is hypothesized to be required for protein substrate recruitment to the catalytic domain of PRMT5. Here we demonstrate that the cross-dimer MEP50 is paired with its cognate PRMT5 molecule to promote histone methylation. We employed qualitative methylation assays and a novel ultrasensitive continuous assay to measure enzyme kinetics. We demonstrate that neither full-length human PRMT5 nor the Xenopus laevis PRMT5 catalytic domain has appreciable protein methyltransferase activity. We show that histones H4 and H3 bind PRMT5-MEP50 more efficiently compared with histone H2A(1-20) and H4(1-20) peptides. Histone binding is mediated through histone fold interactions as determined by competition experiments and by high density histone peptide array interaction studies. Nucleosomes are not a substrate for PRMT5-MEP50, consistent with the primary mode of interaction via the histone fold of H3-H4, obscured by DNA in the nucleosome. Mutation of a conserved arginine (Arg-42) on the MEP50 insertion loop impaired the PRMT5-MEP50 enzymatic efficiency by increasing its histone substrate Km, comparable with that of Caenorhabditis elegans PRMT5. We show that PRMT5-MEP50 prefers unmethylated substrates, consistent with a distributive model for dimethylation and suggesting discrete biological roles for mono- and dimethylarginine-modified proteins. We propose a model in which MEP50 and PRMT5 simultaneously engage the protein substrate, orienting its targeted arginine to the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1986836235,"The cystine/glutamate transporter, designated as system xc−, is important for maintaining intracellular glutathione levels and extracellular redox balance. The substrate-specific component of system xc−, xCT, is strongly induced by various stimuli, including oxidative stress, whereas it is constitutively expressed only in specific brain regions and immune tissues, such as the thymus and spleen. Although cystine and glutamate are the well established substrates of system xc− and the knockout of xCT leads to alterations of extracellular redox balance, nothing is known about other potential substrates. We thus performed a comparative metabolite analysis of tissues from xCT-deficient and wild-type mice using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although most of the analyzed metabolites did not show significant alterations between xCT-deficient and wild-type mice, cystathionine emerged as being absent specifically in the thymus and spleen of xCT-deficient mice. No expression of either cystathionine β-synthase or cystathionine γ-lyase was observed in the thymus and spleen of mice. In embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type embryos, cystine uptake was significantly inhibited by cystathionine in a concentration-dependent manner. Wild-type cells showed an intracellular accumulation of cystathionine when incubated in cystathionine-containing buffer, which concomitantly stimulated an increased release of glutamate into the extracellular space. By contrast, none of these effects could be observed in xCT-deficient cells. Remarkably, unlike knock-out cells, wild-type cells could be rescued from cystine deprivation-induced cell death by cystathionine supplementation. We thus conclude that cystathionine is a novel physiological substrate of system xc− and that the accumulation of cystathionine in immune tissues is exclusively mediated by system xc−."

To further address this announcement, in September 2014, scientists with varying perspectives came together at Georgetown University to discuss the following questions. (1) What metrics should the NIH use to assess tangible progress on policy changes designed to address the over-reliance on male cells and animals in preclinical research? (2) How effective can education be in reducing the over-reliance on male cells and animals in preclinical research and what educational initiatives sponsored by the NIH would most likely effect change? (3) What criteria should the NIH use to determine rigorously defined exceptions to the future proposal requirement of a balance of male and female cells and animals in preclinical studies? (4) What additional strategies in addition to proposal requirements should NIH use to reduce the overreliance of male cells and animals in preclinical research? The resulting consensus presented herein includes input from researchers not only from diverse disciplines of basic and translational science including biology, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, neuroscience, cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology, but also from recognized experts in publishing, industry, advocacy, science policy, clinical medicine, and population health.

https://openalex.org/W2048912210,"The Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a highly conserved, 19-subunit histone acetyltransferase complex that activates transcription through acetylation and deubiquitination of nucleosomal histones in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because SAGA has been shown to display conformational variability, we applied gradient fixation to stabilize purified SAGA and systematically analyzed this flexibility using single-particle EM. Our two- and three-dimensional studies show that SAGA adopts three major conformations, and mutations of specific subunits affect the distribution among these. We also located the four functional modules of SAGA using electron microscopy-based labeling and transcriptional activator binding analyses and show that the acetyltransferase module is localized in the most mobile region of the complex. We further comprehensively mapped the subunit interconnectivity of SAGA using cross-linking mass spectrometry, revealing that the Spt and Taf subunits form the structural core of the complex. These results provide the necessary restraints for us to generate a model of the spatial arrangement of all SAGA subunits. According to this model, the chromatin-binding domains of SAGA are all clustered in one face of the complex that is highly flexible. Our results relate information of overall SAGA structure with detailed subunit level interactions, improving our understanding of its architecture and flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2083385216,"Abstract The cAMP signaling system regulates various cellular functions, including metabolism, gene expression, and death. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) removes acetyl groups from histones and regulates genomic stability and cell viability. We hypothesized that cAMP modulates SIRT6 activity to regulate apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effects of cAMP signaling on SIRT6 expression and radiation-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. cAMP signaling in H1299 and A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells was activated via the expression of constitutively active Gαs plus treatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), isoproterenol, or forskolin. The expression of sirtuins and signaling molecules were analyzed by Western blotting. Activation of cAMP signaling reduced SIRT6 protein expression in lung cancer cells. cAMP signaling increased the ubiquitination of SIRT6 protein and promoted its degradation. Treatment with MG132 and inhibiting PKA with H89 or with a dominant-negative PKA abolished the cAMP-mediated reduction in SIRT6 levels. Treatment with PGE2 inhibited c-Raf activation by increasing inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser-259 in a PKA-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting downstream MEK-ERK signaling. Inhibiting ERK with inhibitors or with dominant-negative ERKs reduced SIRT6 expression, whereas activation of ERK by constitutively active MEK abolished the SIRT6-depleting effects of PGE2. cAMP signaling also augmented radiation-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. This effect was abolished by exogenous expression of SIRT6. It is concluded that cAMP signaling reduces SIRT6 expression by promoting its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation, a process mediated by the PKA-dependent inhibition of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Reduced SIRT6 expression mediates the augmentation of radiation-induced apoptosis by cAMP signaling in lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092985726,"Translational arrest peptides (APs) are short stretches of polypeptides that induce translational stalling when synthesized on a ribosome. Mechanical pulling forces acting on the nascent chain can weaken or even abolish stalling. APs can therefore be used as in vivo force sensors, making it possible to measure the forces that act on a nascent chain during translation with single-residue resolution. It is also possible to score the relative strengths of APs by subjecting them to a given pulling force and ranking them according to stalling efficiency. Using the latter approach, we now report an extensive mutagenesis scan of a strong mutant variant of the Mannheimia succiniciproducens SecM AP and identify mutations that further increase the stalling efficiency. Combining three such mutations, we designed an AP that withstands the strongest pulling force we are able to generate at present. We further show that diproline stretches in a nascent protein act as very strong APs when translation is carried out in the absence of elongation factor P. Our findings highlight critical residues in APs, show that certain amino acid sequences induce very strong translational arrest and provide a toolbox of APs of varying strengths that can be used for in vivo force measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2002151566,"β-Lactamases are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics. TEM-1 is a prevalent plasmid-encoded β-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria that efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of penicillins and early cephalosporins but not oxyimino-cephalosporins. A previous random mutagenesis study identified a W165Y/E166Y/P167G triple mutant that displays greatly altered substrate specificity with increased activity for the oxyimino-cephalosporin, ceftazidime, and decreased activity toward all other β-lactams tested. Surprisingly, this mutant lacks the conserved Glu-166 residue critical for enzyme function. Ceftazidime contains a large, bulky side chain that does not fit optimally in the wild-type TEM-1 active site. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the substitutions in the mutant expand the binding site in the enzyme. To investigate structural changes and address whether there is an enlargement in the active site, the crystal structure of the triple mutant was solved to 1.44 A. The structure reveals a large conformational change of the active site Ω-loop structure to create additional space for the ceftazidime side chain. The position of the hydroxyl group of Tyr-166 and an observed shift in the pH profile of the triple mutant suggests that Tyr-166 participates in the hydrolytic mechanism of the enzyme. These findings indicate that the highly conserved Glu-166 residue can be substituted in the mechanism of serine β-lactamases. The results reveal that the robustness of the overall β-lactamase fold coupled with the plasticity of an active site loop facilitates the evolution of enzyme specificity and mechanism."

There is also evidence that PtdIns(3,5)P2 may play a role in lysosomal acidification in higher eukaryotes. Nevertheless, these conclusions rely on qualitative assays of lysosome/vacuole pH. For example, quinacrine, an acidotropic fluorescent base, does not accumulate in the vacuoles of fab1Δ yeast.

In this study, we employed several assays that quantitatively assessed the lysosomal and vacuolar pH in PtdIns(3,5)P2-depleted cells. Using ratiometric imaging, we conclude that lysosomes retain a pH < 5 in PIKfyve-inhibited mammalian cells. In addition, quantitative fluorescence microscopy of vacuole-targeted pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant, indicates that fab1Δ vacuoles are as acidic as wild-type yeast. Importantly, we also employed fluorimetry of vacuoles loaded with cDCFDA, a pH-sensitive dye, to show that both wild-type and fab1Δ vacuoles have a pH < 5.0. In comparison, the vacuolar pH of the V-ATPase mutant vph1Δ or vph1Δ fab1Δ double mutant was 6.1. Although the steady-state vacuolar pH is not affected by PtdIns(3,5)P2 depletion, it may have a role in stabilizing the vacuolar pH during salt shock.

In fact, recently, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was suggested to bind to the V0 complex to stabilize the assembly of the V-ATPase and increase its activity during salt stress (29.Li S.C. Diakov T.T. Xu T. Tarsio M.

Some studies have suggested that acidotropic probes like acridine orange accumulate in enlarged lysosomes induced by antagonists of PIKfyve, the mammalian ortholog of Fab1 (30.de Lartigue J.

Others have suggested that LysoTracker, another acidotropic agent, does not accumulate in enlarged lysosomes in PIKfyve-inhibited cells (31.Jefferies H.B. Cooke F.T. Jat P. Boucheron C. Koizumi T.

However, these acidotrophic dyes are not quantitative and do not provide information about the actual pH in PtdIns(3,5)P2-depleted cells. In this study, we measured the lysosomal and vacuolar pH to better understand the role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in lysosome/vacuolar acidification. To determine the vacuolar pH, we employed the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (cDCFDA), and super-ecliptic pHluorin. cDCFDA was used previously to measure the vacuolar pH in Cryptococcus neoformans by fluorimetry (33.Harrison T.S. Chen J. Simons E. Levitz S.M. Determination of the pH of the Cryptococcus neoformans vacuole.Med. Mycol. 2002; 40: 329-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the super-ecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant, can be targeted to the vacuolar lumen to query the pH status of yeast vacuoles (34.Prosser D.C. Whitworth K. Wendland B. Quantitative analysis of endocytosis with cytolasmic pHluorin chimeras.Traffic. 2010; 11: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also utilized ratiometric imaging of lysosomes labeled with FITC-dextran to quantitate the lysosomal pH (35.Steinberg B.E. Huynh K.K. Brodovitch A. Jabs S. Stauber T. Jentsch T.J. Grinstein S. A cation counterflux supports lysosomal acidification.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 1171-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Using these methods, we revealed that yeast vacuoles lacking PtdIns(3,5)P2 were as acidic as wild-type cells. Similarly, both control and PIKfyve-abated mammalian cells exhibited similarly acidic lysosomes. 7-Amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (CMAC), cDCFDA, FITC-dextran, LysoTracker DND-99, fetal bovine serum, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and DMEM were purchased from Life Technologies.

Yeast cultures were grown overnight in synthetic complete (SC) medium (yeast nitrogen base without nitrogen and ammonium sulfate, sodium glutamate, and 2% glucose supplemented with appropriate amino acids) to an A600 of ∼0.6. Cells were washed and resuspended in SC medium buffered to pH 7.5. Vacuoles were labeled with 200 μm quinacrine for 10 min at 26 °C in 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6. Cells were washed and resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, with 2% glucose. For CMAC staining, vacuoles were labeled with 100 μm CMAC in the dark for 15 min at room temperature in SC medium. Cells were washed and resuspended in 25 μl of SC medium. For cDCFDA staining, vacuoles were labeled with 50 μm cDCFDA for 1 h at 26 °C, washed, and resuspended in SC medium, pH 7.5. For osmotic shock, after cDCFDA staining, cells were exposed to 0.9 m NaCl for 10 min followed by fluorimetric measurement immediately after and for every 5 min over a period of 25 min. About 10 ml of yeast cells was continuously grown in SC medium to A600 = 0.6. About 2 million cells were then incubated in 100 μl of yeast calibration medium (50 mm MES, 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm NaN3, and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, pH 7.5) for 4 min without CCCP to obtain the basal fluorescence intensity. Subsequently, individual aliquots of 2 million cells were incubated for 4 min in yeast calibration medium containing 50 μm CCCP and set to pH 4.5–7.5. Fluorescence intensity was measured immediately. When necessary, cells were treated with 1 μm concanamycin A (ConA) for 1 h before calibration. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorimeter (Hitachi F-2500) using an excitation scan between 400 and 520 nm and emission at 535 nm. The samples were measured in triplicate. Importantly, this assay is independent of absolute fluorescence intensity because each sample is internally calibrated; in other words, the basal fluorescence and calibration curves for each condition are all derived from a single population of cells labeled with cDCFDA. GraphPad Prism 6 software was used to calculate a calibration curve as a function of the measured values relative to the pH values of the calibration buffer. The data were then fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve for each sample. Statistical analysis is based on a minimum of three independent experiments. Fluorescence, bright field, or differential interference contrast images of quinacrine, CMAC, and cDCFDA-labeled cells were obtained with a DM5000X Leica epifluorescence microscope. Time lapse imaging was captured using an Olympus IX81 quorum spinning disk microscope with PerkinElmer Volocity software. For ratiometric imaging, images were captured using a DM-IRB Leica epifluorescence microscope with MetaFluor software (MDS Analytical Technologies). The fluorescence intensity of FITC-labeled lysosomes and Mup1-pHluorin-labeled vacuoles was analyzed with ImageJ 1.47v. Yeast culture were grown overnight in synthetic medium deficient in methionine to an A600 of ∼0.5. Methionine was added to the yeast culture at a concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated for 2 h at 26 °C. Cells were then washed and resuspended in SC medium buffered to pH 7.5. Cells were seeded onto concanavalin A-coated glass coverslips for microscopy or ratiometric imaging analysis. Fluorescence intensity was measured until the signal was stable, and then 50 μm CCCP was added to the samples. The cells were allowed 10 min to equilibrate to media at pH 7.5. The fluorescence intensity was again measured until the signal was stable. Statistical analysis is based on 300–500 cells over a minimum of three independent experiments. RAW cells were grown on glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were pulsed with 2 mg/ml FITC-dextran for 1 h and chased for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with 200 nm MF4, 20 nm apilimod, 1 μm concanamycin A, or an equivalent volume of DMSO for 1 h. For time lapse imaging, cells were labeled with 1 μm LysoTracker for 10 min, and then five images/s were captured for 10 s. Live cell images were captured in an environmental chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Ratiometric analysis of lysosomal pH was done as reported previously (35.Steinberg B.E. Huynh K.K. Brodovitch A.

Briefly, resting cells in calibration medium (145 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) were imaged in a Leiden chamber maintained at 37 °C. The cells were rapidly excited by light transmitted through a 485- and a 438-nm excitation filter from an X-Cite 120 lamp (from XFO). The fluorescence ratio of 485/438 nm was measured until the signal was stable. Subsequently, 10 μm nigericin and 5 μm monensin were then added to the calibration media set to different pH values (7.5, 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5). For each calibration point, cells were incubated and imaged for 5 min to obtain a stable 485/438 nm fluorescence ratio. When necessary, cells were treated with concanamycin A before calibration. To quantify lysosomal pH, the fluorescence intensity of 125–400 randomly selected swollen and wild-type lysosomes in 100–300 cells was measured over three independent experiments. Graphpad Prism 6 software was used to calculate a calibration curve as a function of the measured values relative to the pH values of the calibration buffer (the data were fitted to a Boltzmann sigmoidal dose-response curve). RAW cells were incubated for 24 h in inositol-free DMEM (MP Biomedicals) with 10 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H(N)] inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 4 mm l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine (Gibco), 20 mm Hepes (Gibco), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). At the end of the incubation, macrophages were treated with 20 nm apilimod for 1 h. Cells were then treated with 600 μl of 4.5% perchloric acid (v/v) on ice for 15 min, scraped, and pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were washed with 1 ml of ice cold 0.1 m EDTA and resuspended in 50 μl of water. Phospholipids were deacylated with 500 μl of methanol/40% methylamine/1-butanol (45.7% methanol:10.7% methylamine:11.4% 1-butanol (v/v)) for 50 min at 53 °C. Samples were vacuum-dried and washed twice by resuspending them in 300 μl of water and drying. The dried samples were then resuspended in 450 μl of water, extracted with 300 μl of 1-butanol/ethyl ether/ethyl formate (20:4:1), vortexed for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The bottom aqueous layer was collected and extracted twice more. The aqueous layer was vacuum-dried and resuspended in 50 μl of water. Equal counts of 3H were separated by HPLC (Agilent Technologies) through an anion exchange 4.6 × 250-mm column (Phenomenex) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and subjected to a gradient of water (buffer A) and 1 m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8 (adjusted with phosphoric acid) (buffer B) as follows: 0% B for 5 min, 0 to 2% B for 15 min, 2% B for 80 min, 2 to 10% B for 20 min, 10% B for 30 min, 10 to 80% B for 10 min, 80% B for 5 min, and 80 to 0% B for 5 min. The radiolabeled eluate was detected by β-RAM 4 (LabLogic) with a 1:2 ratio of eluate to scintillant (LabLogic) and analyzed using Laura 4 software. Each of the phosphoinositides was normalized against the parent phosphatidylinositol peak. Experimental values are given as the mean of a minimum of three independent experiments and include standard error of the mean (S.E.). The population size is indicated in the text or figure legends. Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t test or using an ANOVA test followed by Tukey's post hoc test as appropriate. Lysosomes depend on their highly acidic milieu for optimal degradative capacity and to drive molecular transport across its membrane. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that establish and maintain lysosomal acidification. The role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in controlling lysosomal acidification in mammalian cells remains unclear. To better address this issue, we employed RAW macrophages as a model cell line given the importance of lysosomes in eliminating pathogens. RAW macrophages were treated for 1 h with 20 nm apilimod, a potent PIKfyve antagonist (38.Cai X. Xu Y. Cheung A.K. Tomlinson R.C. Alcázar-Román A. Murphy L. Billich A. Zhang B. Feng Y. Klumpp M.

Broilers from 1–21 and 22–42 days of age were divided into three treatments related to methionine supplementation as follows: without methionine supplementation (MD), recommended level of methionine (DL1), and excess supplementation of methionine (DL2). The animals were either maintained at a thermal comfort temperature or exposed to heat stress (HS) (38°C for 24 hours, starting on day 20 or day 41 for experiments 1 and 2, respectively). The heat stress increased the body temperature at both ages. Starter period: The HS animals presented increased plasma creatinine content (P<0.0001) and the highest CTSL2 gene expression (P<0.0001). The methionine supplementation increased the IGF-I (P = 0.0144) and GHR (P = 0.0011) gene expression and decreased the CTSL2 (P = 0.0004) and atrogin 1 (P = 0.0012) gene expression. Grower period: Significant effects for the interaction between supplementation and environment were observed for GHR (P = 0.0252) and CTSL2 (P = 0.0011) gene expression. The highest GHR expression was observed in animals that remained in thermal comfort on the DL2 diet, and the lowest expression occurred in the HS animals fed the MD diet. For CTSL2, the HS animals fed the MD diet presented the highest CTSL2 gene expression, and the lowest expression was observed in the animals maintained at thermal comfort on DL1 and DL2 diets. Only methionine supplementation had effect on atrogin-1 gene expression (P<0.0001), with higher methionine content in the diet lower atrogin-1 gene expression was observed. Our results suggest that heat stress induces greater protein degradation and that methionine supplementation could induce protein deposition because methionine increased the expression of genes related to protein synthesis and decreased the expression of genes related to protein breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2013410637,"Mutations in the rhodopsin gene cause retinal degeneration and clinical phenotypes including retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and congenital stationary night blindness. Effective gene therapies have been difficult to develop, however, because generating precise levels of rhodopsin expression is critical; overexpression causes toxicity, and underexpression would result in incomplete rescue. Current gene delivery strategies routinely use cDNA-based vectors for gene targeting; however, inclusion of noncoding components of genomic DNA (gDNA) such as introns may help promote more endogenous regulation of gene expression. Here we test the hypothesis that inclusion of genomic sequences from the rhodopsin gene can improve the efficacy of rhodopsin gene therapy in the rhodopsin knockout (RKO) mouse model of RP. We utilize our compacted DNA nanoparticles (NPs), which have the ability to transfer larger and more complex genetic constructs, to deliver murine rhodopsin cDNA or gDNA. We show functional and structural improvements in RKO eyes for up to 8 months after NP-mediated gDNA but not cDNA delivery. Importantly, in addition to improvements in rod function, we observe significant preservation of cone function at time points when cones in the RKO model are degenerated. These results suggest that inclusion of native expression elements, such as introns, can significantly enhance gene expression and therapeutic efficacy and may become an essential option in the array of available gene delivery tools.— Han, Z., Banworth, M.

https://openalex.org/W2145267271,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of cholesterols and impaired autophagic flux due to the inhibited fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes. We have recently developed β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-threaded biocleavable polyrotaxanes (PRXs), which can release threaded β-CDs in response to intracellular environments as a therapeutic for NPC disease. The biocleavable PRXs exhibited effective cholesterol reduction ability and negligible toxic effect compared with hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD). In this study, we investigated the effect of biocleavable PRX and HP-β-CD on the impaired autophagy in NPC disease. The NPC patient-derived fibroblasts (NPC1 fibroblasts) showed an increase in the number of LC3-positive puncta compared with normal fibroblasts, even in the basal conditions; the HP-β-CD treatment markedly increased the number of LC3-positive puncta and the levels of p62 in NPC1 fibroblasts, indicating that autophagic flux was further perturbed. In sharp contrast, the biocleavable PRX reduced the number of LC3-positive puncta and the levels of p62 in NPC1 fibroblasts through an mTOR-independent mechanism. The mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter gene expression experiments revealed that the biocleavable PRX facilitated the formation of autolysosomes to allow for autophagic protein degradation. Therefore, the β-CD-threaded biocleavable PRXs may be promising therapeutics for ameliorating not only cholesterol accumulation but also autophagy impairment in NPC disease."
https://openalex.org/W2085045067,"Background: Protein kinase A has been shown to be involved in modulating critical functions.Results: Although the activity of PknA is crucial for cell growth, the extracellular domain is expendable.Conclusion: Although the activation of PknA is necessary for its function, this is independent of PknB.Significance: PknA plays an indispensable role and is required for both in vitro and in vivo growth.The essential mycobacterial protein kinases PknA and PknB play crucial roles in modulating cell shape and division. However, the precise in vivo functional aspects of PknA have not been investigated. This study aims to dissect the role of PknA in mediating cell survival in vitro as well as in vivo. We observed aberrant cell shape and severe growth defects when PknA was depleted. Using the mouse infection model, we observe that PknA is essential for survival of the pathogen in the host. Complementation studies affirm the importance of the kinase, juxtamembrane, and transmembrane domains of PknA. Surprisingly, the extracytoplasmic domain is dispensable for cell growth and survival in vitro. We find that phosphorylation of the activation loop at Thr172 of PknA is critical for bacterial growth. PknB has been previously suggested to be the receptor kinase, which activates multiple kinases, including PknA, by trans-phosphorylating their activation loop residues. Using phospho-specific PknA antibodies and conditional pknB mutant, we find that PknA autophosphorylates its activation loop independent of PknB. Fluorescently tagged PknA and PknB show distinctive distribution patterns within the cell, suggesting that although both kinases are known to modulate cell shape and division, their modes of action are likely to be different. This is supported by our findings that expression of kinase-dead PknA versus kinase-dead PknB in mycobacterial cells leads to different cellular phenotypes. Data indicate that although PknA and PknB are expressed as part of the same operon, they appear to be regulating cellular processes through divergent signaling pathways. Background: Protein kinase A has been shown to be involved in modulating critical functions. Results: Although the activity of PknA is crucial for cell growth, the extracellular domain is expendable. Conclusion: Although the activation of PknA is necessary for its function, this is independent of PknB. Significance: PknA plays an indispensable role and is required for both in vitro and in vivo growth. The essential mycobacterial protein kinases PknA and PknB play crucial roles in modulating cell shape and division. However, the precise in vivo functional aspects of PknA have not been investigated. This study aims to dissect the role of PknA in mediating cell survival in vitro as well as in vivo. We observed aberrant cell shape and severe growth defects when PknA was depleted. Using the mouse infection model, we observe that PknA is essential for survival of the pathogen in the host. Complementation studies affirm the importance of the kinase, juxtamembrane, and transmembrane domains of PknA.

The response to environmental change is often manifested through post-translational modifications of the proteome, such as phosphorylation (1.Graves J.D. Krebs E.G.

PknA has been shown to regulate morphological changes associated with cell division, and its overexpression gives rise to elongated and branched structures (19.Kang C.M. Abbott D.W. Park S.T.

PknB and PknH have recently been proposed to be the master regulators that are capable of phosphorylating seven STPKs in their activation loops in vitro, thus controlling their activation status (31.Baer C.E.

Based on the results from in vitro kinase assays, PknB has been suggested to activate four kinases (including PknA), which in turn phosphorylate their target substrates (31.Baer C.E. Iavarone A.T.

The mode of PknA activation in mycobacteria and its dependence on PknB have not been examined thus far. The present study investigates the functional importance of PknA in vivo.

The gene was cloned into NdeI-HindIII sites in pNit vector, BamHI-XbaI sites in pJAM2 vector, and EcoRI-HindIII sites in pMAL-c2X vector to generate pNit-PknA, pJAM-PknA, and pMAL-PknA, respectively. pST-HiA-PknA construct was generated by subcloning pknA along with acetamide promoter from pJAM-PknA, using SspI-HindIII, into ScaI-HindIII sites of pST-Hi vector (32.Parikh A. Kumar D. Chawla Y. Kurthkoti K. Khan S. Varshney U. Nandicoori V.K.

In order to create PknA deletion mutants, amplicons generated using appropriate forward and reverse primers were cloned into NdeI-HindIII sites in pNit vector. PknA point mutations were generated by overlapping PCRs. The integration-proficient shuttle vector pST-HiT with anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible promoter was modified to create pST-CiT vector by replacing the hygromycin resistance gene (hygr) with the chloramphenicol resistance gene (camr) from pVR1 shuttle plasmid. pknB by itself or pknA-pknB together were amplified using specific primers and cloned into pST-CiT vector to generate pCiT-PknB and pCiT-PknA-B. In the presence of ATc, the rescue construct pCiT-PknA-B would express a bicistronic mRNA transcript. To create pCiT-PknAmutant-B constructs, pknAmutant (such as PknAK42M) and the functional pknB gene were cloned into pST-CiT vector. To create pknA deletion mutants (such as PknAKD), a stop codon was introduced to terminate the translation at the designated codon. The veracity of the clones was confirmed through DNA sequencing. The 5′ region of pknA (bp −20 to 750) was amplified from H37Rv genomic DNA, and the amplicon was cloned into the NcoI site in pAZI9479 (23.Forti F. Crosta A. Ghisotti D.

The pAZ-PknA plasmid was electroporated into H37Rv, and the colonies were selected on 7H10 agar plates containing hygromycin (100 μg/ml) and pristinamycin (1.5 μg/ml). Genomic DNA was isolated from potential mutants and screened using specific primers (Fig. 1A) to confirm genuine recombination at the genomic locus. M. smegmatis mc2155 was electroporated with pHiA-PknA construct to create a merodiploid strain mc2155-HiA-PknA. Approximately 1 kb upstream and downstream, flanking sequences of pknA were amplified using appropriate primers and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO vector. pENTR-PknA-U (upstream flank) and pENTR-PknA-D (downstream flank) constructs were digested with HpaI-EcoRI and EcoRI-HindIII, respectively, and the flanks were cloned between the HpaI and HindIII sites in p2Nil vector.

To analyze the growth patterns of mutant cell types, liquid cultures of Rv-pptr-AB and the transformants were grown in 7H9 broth (containing ADC, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.2% glycerol, 1.5 μg/ml pristinamycin, and appropriate antibiotics) to A600 of 0.8. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 80 (PBST) to remove traces of pristinamycin and diluted to A600 of 0.1; the cultures were grown either in the absence or presence of pristinamycin for 6 days; and the absorbance was measured every 24 h. For replica plating experiments, cultures washed with PBS were diluted to A600 of 0.2 in fresh 7H9 broth. 5 μl of each cell suspension was streaked onto 7H10 agar plates containing either 1.5 μg/ml pristinamycin or 1.5 μg/ml ATc.

Set7/9 is a Lys methyltransferase that interacts with Pdx1. Here we tested the hypothesis that Lys methylation of Pdx1 by Set7/9 augments Pdx1 transcriptional activity. Using mass spectrometry and mutational analysis of purified proteins, we found that Set7/9 methylates the N-terminal residues Lys-123 and Lys-131 of Pdx1. Methylation of these residues occurred only in the context of intact, full-length Pdx1, suggesting a specific requirement of secondary and/or tertiary structural elements for catalysis by Set7/9. Immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometric analysis using β cells verified Lys methylation of endogenous Pdx1. Cell-based luciferase reporter assays using wild-type and mutant transgenes revealed a requirement of Pdx1 residue Lys-131, but not Lys-123, for transcriptional augmentation by Set7/9.

To define the role of Set7/9 in β cell function, we generated mutant mice in which the gene encoding Set7/9 was conditionally deleted in β cells (SetΔβ).

Our results suggest a previously unappreciated role for Set7/9-mediated methylation in the maintenance of Pdx1 activity and β cell function. Deficiency of insulin secretion underlies the transition from normoglycemia to hyperglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (1.Ferrannini E. Mari A. Nofrate V. Sosenko J.M. Skyler J.S.

Circulating insulin arises almost exclusively from islet β cells in the pancreas, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing β cell function in health and disease remains incomplete. A key protein that is essential for β cell function is the homeobox transcription factor Pdx1. During mammalian development, Pdx1 is essential for pancreas organogenesis (3.Jonsson J. Carlsson L.

Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In the adult pancreas, Pdx1 is restricted primarily to β cells and is responsible for the regulation of genes that are essential to β cell function, proliferation, and survival (6.Babu D.A. Deering T.G. Mirmira R.G. A feat of metabolic proportions: Pdx1 orchestrates islet development and function in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.Mol. Genet.

Research resource: the pdx1 cistrome of pancreatic islets.Mol. Endocrinol. 2012; 26: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this context, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of Pdx1 action will be crucial in future attempts to restore β cell function in the setting of diabetes. The interaction of Pdx1 with other transcription factors and cofactors appears to be important in modulating Pdx1 activity (positively or negatively) at a given target gene. For example, the formation of a transcriptional complex between Pdx1 and the basic helix-loop-helix factor NeuroD1 in β cells results in the formation of a complex with the gene encoding preproinsulin (Ins1/2) that permits synergistic activation of transcription (8.Babu D.A. Chakrabarti S.K. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. Pdx1 and BETA2/neuroD1 participate in a transcriptional complex that mediates short-range DNA looping at the insulin gene.J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By contrast, interaction of Pdx1 with PCIF1 results in degradation of Pdx1 protein by the proteasome and a consequent reduction in Pdx1 activity (10.Claiborn K.C. Sachdeva M.M. Cannon C.E. Groff D.N. Singer J.D. Stoffers D.A. Pcif1 modulates Pdx1 protein stability and pancreatic β cell function and survival in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3713-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interactions such as these suggest a model in which various aspects of Pdx1 activity, including DNA binding affinity, protein stability, and recruitment of basal transcriptional machinery, are modulated to achieve homeostatic function of the β cell. Our laboratory has reported previously that the lysine methyltransferase Set7/9 interacts with Pdx1 to promote transactivation of an Ins1/2 minienhancer (11.Francis J. Chakrabarti S.K. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. Pdx-1 links histone H3-Lys-4 methylation to RNA polymerase II elongation during activation of insulin transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36244-36253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that contains the classical Pdx1 binding sequence (5′-TAAT-3′) present in elements A3 and A4. Augmentation of transcriptional activity was correlated with an increase in Lys4 methylation of histone 3 (H3) and the conversion of the initiating isoform of RNA polymerase II to its elongating isoform. In recent years, several reports have suggested that the methyltransferase activity of Set7/9 is not only restricted to Lys residues on histones but that it includes Lys residues of other proteins, such as p53, p65, and estrogen receptor α, among others (12.Chuikov S.

These varied methylation events have been shown to alter the activity or half-life of these proteins, emphasizing that Lys methylation (similar to Ser/Thr phosphorylation or Lys acetylation) modulates transcription factor function (16.Keating S.T.

In light of these new perspectives on Lys methylation and Set7/9 action, we asked whether the interactions between Set7/9 and Pdx1 might affect Pdx1 activity independently of effects on histones. In this study, our findings reveal a heretofore unappreciated role for Lys-specific methylation of Pdx1 by Set7/9 in the maintenance of normal β cell function.

Competition EMSAs were performed using an unlabeled Ins E-A probe. EMSA reactions proceeded at room temperature for 15 min. The EMSA buffer and electrophoresis protocol have been described previously (32.German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. The insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide genes contain similar cell-specific promoter elements that bind identical β-cell nuclear complexes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was visualized, and competition EMSAs were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Competition EMSAs were modeled on the basis of single-phase exponential dissociation using the non-linear least squares fit algorithm in Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad), and apparent dissociation constants were determined as described previously (24.Taylor D.G. Babu D. Mirmira R.G.

Samples (proteins from in vitro experiments and from MIN6 cells) were first denatured with 8 m urea, reduced with 10 mm DTT in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide (prepared in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate), digested with trypsin, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The samples in vitro were analyzed using Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro and Surveyor HPLC. Tryptic peptides were injected onto the C18 column. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 3%-40% acetonitrile (in water with 0.1% trifluoracetic acid) developed over 90 min at room temperature, at a flow rate of 60 μl/min, and the effluent was electrosprayed into the LTQ mass spectrometer. Blanks were run prior to the sample run to make sure that there was no significant signal from solvents or the column. The TSKgel columns (ODS-100 V, 3 μm, 1.0 × 50 mm) were used for the Surveyor HPLC system. The trypsin-digested Pdx1 immunoprecipitants from MIN6 cells were pressure-loaded onto a 12-cm multidimensional protein identification technology column as described previously (33.Mosley A.L.

Proteomics. 2011; 10: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed by MS/MS on an LTQ XL mass spectrometer following elution during a 10-step multidimensional protein identification technology run. Protein database searches were performed using SEQUEST® algorithms within Proteome Discoverer (Thermo) against appropriate FASTA sequence databases obtained from UniProt. Database searches included dynamic modification analysis for mono-, di-, and trimethylated Lys residues and Met residue oxidation. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance (followed by a Dunnett's post test) was used for comparisons in which two or more conditions were compared, and two-tailed Student's t test was performed when two conditions were compared. Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad) was used for all statistical analyses. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Recent evidence suggesting that Set7/9 methylates non-histone proteins led us to investigate first whether the interaction between Set7/9 and Pdx1 leads to Lys methylation of Pdx1. We performed methylation reactions in vitro using purified Pdx1 and Set7/9 proteins and [3H]AdoMet. Incorporation of the [3H]methyl group into Pdx1 in this reaction is evidence of protein methylation (11.Francis J. Chakrabarti S.K. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. Pdx-1 links histone H3-Lys-4 methylation to RNA polymerase II elongation during activation of insulin transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36244-36253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, [3H]methyl was incorporated into Pdx1 in a concentration-dependent manner and only in the presence of Set7/9. By contrast, no methylation of bovine serum albumin was observed in the same reaction, suggesting that the methylation is specific for Pdx1 (Fig. 1A). Prior studies have suggested that Lys residues in a broad range of sequence contexts can serve as substrates for Set7/9 (34.Dhayalan A. Kudithipudi S. Rathert P. Jeltsch A. Specificity analysis-based identification of new methylation targets of the SET7/9 protein lysine methyltransferase.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 111-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Within Pdx1, Lys residues occur in both the N-terminal transactivation domain (residues Lys-15, Lys-123, Lys-126, and Lys-131) and the DNA binding homeodomain (residues Lys-147, Lys-163, Lys-191, Lys-200, Lys-202, Lys-203, Lys-207, and Lys-208). To narrow the possible Lys residues that may be methylated by Set7/9, we next performed methylation assays using different truncated mutants of Pdx1, as shown in Fig. 1B. Surprisingly, none of the truncated mutants were methylated by Set7/9 in vitro, suggesting that methylation of Pdx1 requires the structural context of the full-length protein. To identify the methylated Lys residue(s) in the full-length protein, we next performed mass spectrometry of methylated full-length Pdx1. Broad coverage of the peptides confirmed the monomethylation of Pdx1 at two Lys residues in the N-terminal region of the protein (residues Lys-123 and Lys-131) (Fig. 2, A and B). Data from the mass spectrometric analysis was verified using mutated Pdx1 proteins in which residues Lys-123, Lys-126, and Lys-131 in the N-terminal domain were mutated to Arg (K123R, K126R, and K131R). As shown in Fig. 1C, reductions in methylation of Pdx1 clearly occurred in the K123R mutant, but no statistically significant reduction was seen in the K131R mutant. Little residual methylation was observed in the K123R/K131R double mutant. Together, these data suggest that residue Lys-123 appears to be the kinetically preferred site for methylation by Set7/9 in vitro, with evidence of lesser methylation occurring at Lys-131. In prior studies, we showed that Set7/9 augments the transcriptional activity of Pdx1 in the context of a Pdx1 reporter (containing five tandem Pdx1 binding sites). This result has been ascribed previously to Set7/9-mediated methylation of H3 (residue Lys-4) at this reporter (11.Francis J. Chakrabarti S.K. Garmey J.C. Mirmira R.G. Pdx-1 links histone H3-Lys-4 methylation to RNA polymerase II elongation during activation of insulin transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36244-36253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the basis of our results in Fig. 1, we considered the possibility that this transcriptional augmentation by Set7/9 might, instead, be a result of Pdx1 Lys methylation. To test this possibility, we performed reporter gene activity assays using wild-type and mutated Pdx1 in the mouse-derived cell line NIH3T3, which is devoid of endogenous Pdx1. As shown in Fig. 3A, when a cDNA encoding wild-type Pdx1 is cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with a Pdx1 reporter plasmid containing tandem copies of a Pdx1 binding sequence (derived from the rat Ins1 E2/A4/A3 promoter element) driving luciferase (9.Ohneda K.

https://openalex.org/W2040229685,"Depolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane evokes a rapid (phasic) contractile response followed by a sustained (tonic) contraction. We showed previously that the sustained contraction involves genistein-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation upstream of the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROK) pathway leading to phosphorylation of MYPT1 (the myosin-targeting subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP)) and myosin regulatory light chains (LC20). In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that membrane depolarization elicits activation of the Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2). Pyk2 was identified as the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in response to membrane depolarization. The tonic phase of K+-induced contraction was inhibited by the Pyk2 inhibitor sodium salicylate, which abolished the sustained elevation of LC20 phosphorylation. Membrane depolarization induced autophosphorylation (activation) of Pyk2 with a time course that correlated with the sustained contractile response. The Pyk2/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF-431396 inhibited both phasic and tonic components of the contractile response to K+, Pyk2 autophosphorylation, and LC20 phosphorylation but had no effect on the calyculin A (MLCP inhibitor)-induced contraction. Ionomycin, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, elicited a slow, sustained contraction and Pyk2 autophosphorylation, which were blocked by pre-treatment with PF-431396. Furthermore, the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine inhibited peak and sustained K+-induced force and Pyk2 autophosphorylation. Inhibition of Pyk2 abolished the K+-induced translocation of RhoA to the particulate fraction and the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-697 and Thr-855. We conclude that depolarization-induced entry of Ca2+ activates Pyk2 upstream of the RhoA/ROK pathway, leading to MYPT1 phosphorylation and MLCP inhibition. The resulting sustained elevation of LC20 phosphorylation then accounts for the tonic contractile response to membrane depolarization."

In general, CBMs are functionally and structurally autonomous from their associated catalytic domains from which they are separated through flexible linker sequences. Here, we show that a C-terminal CBM46 derived from BhCel5B, a Bacillus halodurans endoglucanase, does not interact with β-glucans independently but, uniquely, acts cooperatively with the catalytic domain of the enzyme in substrate recognition. The structure of BhCBM46 revealed a β-sandwich fold that abuts onto the region of the substrate binding cleft upstream of the active site. BhCBM46 as a discrete entity is unable to bind to β-glucans.

https://openalex.org/W2046951491,"The IL-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway is a critical signaling pathway for colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-δ, a lipid nuclear receptor, up-regulates IL-6. 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1), which is crucial to production of lipid signaling mediators to terminate inflammation, down-regulates PPAR-δ. 15-LOX-1 effects on IL-6/STAT3 signaling and CAC tumorigenesis have not been determined. We report that intestinally targeted transgenic 15-LOX-1 expression in mice inhibited azoxymethane- and dextran sodium sulfate-induced CAC, IL-6 expression, STAT3 phosphorylation, and IL-6/STAT3 downstream target (Notch3 and MUC1) expression. 15-LOX-1 down-regulation was associated with IL-6 up-regulation in human colon cancer mucosa. Reexpression of 15-LOX-1 in human colon cancer cells suppressed IL-6 mRNA expression, STAT3 phosphorylation, IL-6 promoter activity, and PPAR-δ mRNA and protein expression. PPAR-δ overexpression in colonic epithelial cells promoted CAC tumorigenesis in mice and increased IL-6 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas concomitant 15-LOX-1 expression in colonic epithelial cells (15-LOX-1-PPAR-δ-Gut mice) suppressed these effects: the number of tumors per mouse (mean ± sem) was 4.22 ± 0.68 in wild-type littermates, 6.67 ± 0.83 in PPAR-δ-Gut mice (P= 0.026), and 2.25 ± 0.25 in 15-LOX-1-PPAR-δ-Gut mice (P = 0.0006).

https://openalex.org/W2064819020,"β-Catenin is a key component that connects transmembrane cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton at the cell-cell interface. However, the role of the β-catenin/cadherin interaction in smooth muscle has not been well characterized. Here stimulation with acetylcholine promoted the recruitment of β-catenin to N-cadherin in smooth muscle cells/tissues. Knockdown of β-catenin by lentivirus-mediated shRNA attenuated smooth muscle contraction. Nevertheless, myosin light chain phosphorylation at Ser-19 and actin polymerization in response to contractile activation were not reduced by β-catenin knockdown. In addition, the expression of the β-catenin armadillo domain disrupted the recruitment of β-catenin to N-cadherin. Force development, but not myosin light chain phosphorylation and actin polymerization, was reduced by the expression of the β-catenin armadillo domain. Furthermore, actin polymerization and microtubules have been implicated in intracellular trafficking. In this study, the treatment with the inhibitor latrunculin A diminished the interaction of β-catenin with N-cadherin in smooth muscle. In contrast, the exposure of smooth muscle to the microtubule depolymerizer nocodazole did not affect the protein-protein interaction. Together, these findings suggest that smooth muscle contraction is mediated by the recruitment of β-catenin to N-cadherin, which may facilitate intercellular mechanotransduction. The association of β-catenin with N-cadherin is regulated by actin polymerization during contractile activation."
https://openalex.org/W1977166082,"Adult skeletal muscle is a dynamic, remarkably plastic tissue, which allows myofibers to switch from fast/glycolytic to slow/oxidative types and to increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (mFAO) capacity and vascularization in response to exercise training. mFAO is the main muscle energy source during endurance exercise, with carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) being the key regulatory enzyme. Whether increasing muscle mFAO affects skeletal muscle physiology in adulthood actually remains unknown. To investigate this, we used in vivo electrotransfer technology to express in mouse tibialis anterior (TA), a fast/glycolytic muscle, a mutated CPT1 form (CPT1mt) that is active but insensitive to malonyl-CoA, its physiologic inhibitor. In young (2-mo-old) adult mice, muscle CPT1mt expression enhanced mFAO (+40%), but also increased the percentage of oxidative fibers (+28%), glycogen content, and capillary-to-fiber density (+45%). This CPT1mt-induced muscle remodeling, which mimicked exercise-induced oxidative phenotype, led to a greater resistance to muscle fatigue. In the context of aging, characterized by sarcopenia and reduced oxidative capacity, CPT1mt expression in TAs from aged (20-mo-old) mice partially reversed aging-associated sarcopenia and fiber-type transition, and increased muscle capillarity. These findings provide evidence that mFAO regulates muscle phenotype and may be a potential target to combat age-related decline in muscle function.—Hénique, C., Mansouri, A., Vavrova, E., Lenoir, V., Ferry, A., Esnous, C., Ramond, E., Girard, J., Bouillaud, F., Prip-Buus, C., Cohen, I.

https://openalex.org/W2035500992,"The aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii (GltPh) is a model for the structure of the SLC1 family of amino acid transporters. Crystal structures of GltPh provide insight into mechanisms of ion coupling and substrate transport; however, structures have been solved in the absence of a lipid bilayer so they provide limited information regarding interactions that occur between the protein and lipids of the membrane. Here, we investigated the effect of the lipid environment on aspartate transport by reconstituting GltPh into liposomes of defined lipid composition where the primary lipid is phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or its methyl derivatives. We showed that the rate of aspartate transport and the transmembrane orientation of GltPh were influenced by the primary lipid in the liposomes. In PE liposomes, we observed the highest transport rate and showed that 85% of the transporters were orientated right-side out, whereas in trimethyl PE liposomes, 50% of transporters were right-side out, and we observed a 4-fold reduction in transport rate. Differences in orientation can only partially explain the lipid composition effect on transport rate. Crystal structures of GltPh revealed a tyrosine residue (Tyr-33) that we propose interacts with lipid headgroups during the transport cycle. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, we propose that a cation-π interaction between Tyr-33 and the lipid headgroups can influence conformational flexibility of the trimerization domain and thus the rate of transport. These results provide a specific example of how interactions between membrane lipids and membrane-bound proteins can influence function and highlight the importance of the role of the membrane in transporter function."

Kim H.R. Ahn T. Doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-induced regulation of Ca2+ and H+ fluxes through human bax inhibitor-1 reconstituted into membranes.J. Pharm. Sci. 2012; 101: 1314-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), may be important for cancer development and a target for new anti-cancer drugs. Overexpression of hGAAP lowers the Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, whereas inhibiting expression of endogenous hGAAP has the opposite effects (20.de Mattia F. Gubser C. van Dommelen M.M. Visch H.J. Distelmaier F. Postigo A. Luyten T. Parys J.B. de Smedt H. Smith G.L. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. Human Golgi antiapoptotic protein modulates intracellular calcium fluxes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hGAAP also regulates focal adhesion dynamics and cell adhesion and migration and promotes Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane via store-operated Ca2+ entry (21.Saraiva N. Prole D.L. Carrara G. Johnson B.F. Taylor C.W. Parsons M. Smith G.L. hGAAP promotes cell adhesion and migration via the stimulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry and calpain 2.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which hGAAP affects Ca2+ fluxes are not known. hGAAP does not interact with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 2b that mediates Ca2+ uptake into the ER but was reported to interact with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), through which it might affect Ca2+ homeostasis (20.de Mattia F.

Alternatively, GAAP may form an ion channel or exchanger directly. Overexpression of BI-1 reduces the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores (22.Kim H.R. Lee G.H. Ha K.C. Ahn T. Moon J.Y. Lee B.J.

Biol. 2010; 30: 1800-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analyses of the membrane topology of hGAAP, vGAAP, and other TMBIM family members predicted that each protein has either six or seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) (25.Carrara G.

However, topology maps of vGAAP, hGAAP, and hBI-1 deduced using antibody accessibility indicated that for all three proteins, the N and C termini were cytosolic, consistent with six TMDs linked by short interconnecting regions (25.Carrara G.

An epitope tag inserted within the hydrophilic region between the sixth and seventh hydrophobic regions was accessible to antibody, suggesting that the seventh hydrophobic region might form a re-entrant membrane loop near the charged C terminus (25.Carrara G.

While the present work was in progress, a high resolution structure of BsYetJ, a bacterial protein related to hBI-1 and hGAAP (18 and 21% amino acid identity, respectively), was published (28.Chang Y. Bruni R. Kloss B. Assur Z. Kloppmann E. Rost B. Hendrickson W.A. Liu Q. Structural basis for a pH-sensitive calcium leak across membranes.Science. 2014; 344: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This structure revealed seven TMDs, with TMD7 at the core of the structure. Increasing pH (from 6 to 8) caused a substantial lateral movement of TMD2, suggestive of channel gating (28.Chang Y. Bruni R. Kloss B. Assur Z. Kloppmann E. Rost B. Hendrickson W.A. Liu Q. Structural basis for a pH-sensitive calcium leak across membranes.Science. 2014; 344: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The first six of the seven α-helices in BsYetJ match their locations within the topological map of GAAPs (25.Carrara G. Saraiva N. Gubser C. Johnson B.F. Smith G.L. Six-transmembrane topology for Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (GAAP) and Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1) provides model for the transmembrane Bax inhibitor-containing motif (TMBIM) family.J. Biol.

However, the origin of the difference in the apparent organization of TMD7 between vGAAP, hGAAP, and BsYetJ is not clear. It is possible that attaching a hydrophilic tag, such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, at the C terminus of GAAPs induced an aberrant topology, although GAAP tagged in this way retained its function as a regulator of apoptosis, adhesion, and migration (1.Gubser C.

A new inhibitor of apoptosis from vaccinia virus and eukaryotes.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21.Saraiva N. Prole D.L. Carrara G. Johnson B.F. Taylor C.W.

Chem. 2012; 287: 15896-15905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the crystallization conditions used for such a highly hydrophobic protein as BsYetJ might have altered its topology. Alternatively, there may be genuine differences in the membrane topologies of GAAPs/hBI-1 and the distantly related bacterial protein. Here electrophysiological recordings from purified vGAAPs and hBI-1 reconstituted into lipid bilayers demonstrate that these proteins form ion channels and that vGAAP is selective for cations. Mutation of conserved residues toward the C terminus of vGAAP increased the single-channel conductance (E207Q or D219N) and changed the ion selectivity (E207Q). This suggests that these residues are located within the channel pore. Of these mutations, only E207Q reduced the effects of GAAP on cell migration and adhesion. Conversely, mutation of Asp-219, but not of Glu-207, abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of vGAAP. The ancient origins of GAAPs and their striking level of conservation suggest that these findings are likely to be relevant to other GAAPs and members of the TMBIM family. Searches for GAAP orthologues or known ion channels with regions of sequence similarity to GAAP were carried out with BLASTP (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70338) Google Scholar) using full-length or partial GAAP query sequences. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW (30.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

For the generation of sequence conservation plots, ClustalW protein alignments were quantified using Scorecons (31.Valdar W.S. Scoring residue conservation.Proteins. 2002; 48: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) to generate a residue conservation score list. Hydrophobicity profiles were generated using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (32.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol.

U2-OS and HEK 293T cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Plasmid transfections used FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length CMLV GAAP was amplified by PCR with a 3′ HA epitope incorporated within the reverse primer and cloned into vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) using restriction sites BamHI/EcoRI. Single amino acid mutations G152A, E178Q, E207Q, and D219N were inserted into CMLV GAAP-HA using the QuikChange multiple-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a forward primer containing each point mutation flanked with overhangs complementary to adjacent GAAP sequences. U2-OS cells were transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1+ vector or the vector encoding HA-tagged CMLV GAAP or its mutant forms. Transfected cells were selected for their resistance to 500 μg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen). The CMLV GAAP alleles were subcloned into a lentiviral bicistronic expression vector using restriction sites BamHI/EcoRI. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of lentivirus packaging vector, 0.5 μg of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G-expressing vector, and 0.76 μg of lentiviral bicistronic vector coding for the gene of interest and GFP in the first and second cistron, respectively. After 72 h, virions produced in the supernatant were harvested, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min) and filtration (0.45-μm pore size filter). U2-OS cells at 50% confluence were infected with the lentivirus preparation, and GFP-expressing cells were sorted using a MoFloMLS high speed cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). The U2-OS cell line expressing FLAG-tagged Bcl-XL was a gift from Dr. D. L. Veyer (University of Cambridge).

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min), resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The antibody dilutions used were rabbit anti-FLAG (1:1,000; Sigma, F7425), rabbit anti-HA (1:10,000; Sigma, H6908), mouse anti-tubulin (1:10,000; Millipore, 05-829), rabbit anti-YFP/GFP (1:25,000; Abcam, ab290), and anti-SERCA (1:1,000; Calbiochem, 564702).

Animal models have shown that EtOH decreases fracture callus volume, diameter, and biomechanical strength. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and osteopontin (OPN) play important roles in bone remodeling and fracture healing. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reside in bone and are recruited to fracture sites for the healing process. Resident MSC are critical for fracture healing and function as a source of TGF-β1 induced by local OPN, which acts through the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the effect of EtOH on fracture healing are still incompletely understood, and this study investigated the role of EtOH in affecting OPN-dependent TGF-β1 expression in MSC. We have demonstrated that EtOH inhibits OPN-induced TGF-β1 protein expression, decreases MZF1-dependent TGF-β1 transcription and MZF1 transcription, and blocks OPN-induced MZF1 phosphorylation. We also found that PKA signaling enhances OPN-induced TGF-β1 expression. Last, we showed that EtOH exposure reduces the TGF-β1 protein levels in mouse fracture callus. We conclude that EtOH acts in a novel mechanism by interfering directly with the OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 signaling pathway in MSC.

The latter confers critical structural reinforcement to collagen IV scaffolds. Here, hsPxd01 and various truncated variants lacking nonenzymatic domains were recombinantly expressed in HEK cell lines. The N-glycosylation site occupancy and disulfide pattern, the oligomeric structure, and unfolding pathway are reported. The homotrimeric iron protein contains a covalently bound ferric high spin heme per subunit with a standard reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of -233 ± 5 mV at pH 7.0. Despite sequence homology at the active site and biophysical properties similar to human peroxidases, the catalytic efficiency of bromide oxidation (kcat/KM(app)) of full-length hsPxd01 is rather low but increased upon truncation. This is discussed with respect to its structure and proposed biosynthetic function in collagen IV cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W2079780189,"α-Synuclein (aS) aggregation has been amply investigated for its involvement in Parkinson's disease because its amyloid fibrils are the main constituent of Lewy bodies, one of the hallmarks of the disease. aS aggregation was studied here in vitro and in cellular models to correlate aggregation products with toxicity mechanisms. Independent results published elsewhere suggested that aS overexpression and/or aggregation may impair cellular metabolism and cause mitochondrial damage. In this context, we report the characterization of changes in NADH fluorescence properties in vitro and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells upon aS aggregation. The application of the phasor approach to study NADH fluorescence lifetime and emission allowed us to identify changes that correlate with aS aggregation. In particular, the fraction of bound NADH, characterized by longer lifetimes in comparison to free NADH, is increased, and the maximum of the NADH emission is shifted toward shorter wavelengths in the presence of aggregating aS both in vitro and in cells. These data suggest that NADH binds to aggregated aS. NMR experiments in vitro substantiate such binding, which occurs during aggregation. NADH fluorescence is thus useful to detect aS aggregation and by extension the associated oxidative stress.—Plotegher, N., Stringari, C., Jahid, S., Veronesi, M., Girotto, S., Gratton, E., Bubacco, L.

Significance: Our findings open new perspectives on chemical modifiers of Hailey-Hailey disease. The intracellular levels of ions and other micronutrients are closely regulated in eukaryotic cells. This is the case for the trace element manganese (Mn2+), whose regulation is particularly important. This redox active metal is a key cofactor for a wide range of enzymes located in every cellular compartment (1.Crowley J.D. Traynor D.A. Weatherburn D.C. Enzymes and proteins containing manganese: an overview.Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2000; 37: 209-278PubMed Google Scholar). However, at high concentrations Mn2+ is toxic and promotes DNA damage coupled to replication defects in yeast (2.García-Rodríguez N. Díaz de la Loza Mdel C. Andreson B. Monje-Casas F. Rothstein R. Wellinger R.E. Impaired manganese metabolism causes mitotic misregulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18717-18729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In humans, overexposure to Mn2+ results in a neurological syndrome called manganism, whose symptoms resemble those of Parkinson disease (3.Olanow C.W. Manganese-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, Mn2+ has been shown to favor prion misfolding if it displaces copper as the protein co-factor (4.Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J. Consequences of manganese replacement of copper for prion protein function and proteinase resistance.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Hailey-Hailey disease phenotypes have been associated with mutations affecting calcium and/or manganese transport activities of the Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ transporter ATP2C1 (5.Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Vanoevelen J. Van Baelen K. Parys J.B. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. Segaert S. Wuytack F. SPCA1 pumps and Hailey-Hailey disease.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1204-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A representative Hailey-Hailey phenotype caused by alterations in the intracellular Mn2+ flux includes keratinocyte differentiation (6.Yoshida M. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. ATP2C1 is specifically localized in the basal layer of normal epidermis and its depletion triggers keratinocyte differentiation.J. Dermatol. Sci. 2006; 43: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For these reasons, revealing the intracellular mechanisms that regulate Mn2+ homeostasis pathways is of clinical importance. Much of our current understanding of eukaryotic manganese homeostatic mechanisms comes from the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast Mn2+ uptake is provided by the plasma membrane transporter Smf1, a member of the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) 4The abbreviations used are: Nrampnatural resistance-associated macrophage proteinCFWcalcofluor whiteCPYcarboxypeptidase YERendoplasmic reticulumSCSynthetic CompleteYPADyeast peptone adenine dextrose. family (7.Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. A yeast manganese transporter related to the macrophage protein involved in conferring resistance to mycobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Smf2 represents a member of intracellular Nramp Mn2+ transporters essential for the activity of Mn2+-dependent enzymes, which include the mitochondrial Sod2 protein and Golgi-hosted sugar transferases (8.Luk E.E. Culotta V.C. Manganese superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae acquires its metal co-factor through a pathway involving the Nramp metal transporter, Smf2p.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Smf2 localizes to Golgi-like vesicles, and a drop in whole-cell Mn2+ has been observed upon SMF2 deletion (8.Luk E.E. Culotta V.C. Manganese superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae acquires its metal co-factor through a pathway involving the Nramp metal transporter, Smf2p.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, ∼90% of newly synthesized Smf1 and Smf2 are directly targeted to the vacuole for degradation, presumably to limit uptake of toxic Mn2+ amounts (9.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses three functionally distinct homologues of the nramp family of metal transporters.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When Mn2+ becomes limiting, these transporters are delivered to the cell surface (Smf1) and intracellular vesicles (Smf2) to increase Mn2+ uptake (9.Liu X.F. Culotta V.C.

In contrast, in conditions of toxic metal concentrations, the vacuolar degradation of the Nramp transporters is enhanced, and Smf1 is virtually eliminated from the plasma membrane (11.Jensen L.T. Carroll M.C. Hall M.D. Harvey C.J. Beese S.E. Culotta V.C. Down-regulation of a manganese transporter in the face of metal toxicity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mn2+ uptake by manganese-phosphate complexes is facilitated by the high affinity cell surface phosphate transporter Pho84 (12.Jensen L.T. Ajua-Alemanji M. Culotta V.C.

Other factors that influence intracellular Mn2+ homeostasis include the putative Mn2+ transporter Atx2. Atx2 localizes to Golgi-like vesicles, but the mechanism by which Atx2 regulates intracellular Mn2+ levels remains unknown (13.Lin S.J. Culotta V.C.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, the P-type ATPase Spf1 (hATP13A1) has been suggested to regulate Mn2+ transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (14.Cohen Y. Megyeri M. Chen O.C. Condomitti G. Riezman I.

Apart from providing sugar transferases with Mn2+ as cofactor, Pmr1 has another role in Mn2+ detoxification by secretory pathway-mediated excretion (16.Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition to Pmr1, Mn2+ detoxification can be carried out by the vacuolar iron and manganese transporter Ccc1 (19.Li L. Chen O.S. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. CCC1 is a transporter that mediates vacuolar iron storage in yeast.J. Biol.

Membrane fission and fusion are essential processes, allowing the dynamic communication between membrane-bounded organelles in all eukaryotic cells. Lipid vesicles are constantly emerging from one membrane to fuse with another, providing transport shuttles between distinct intracellular compartments. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium (Ca2+) plays a role in the regulation of membrane trafficking. For example, Ca2+ appears to be involved in ER to Golgi transport (20.Beckers C.J. Balch W.E. Calcium and GTP: essential components in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), intra-Golgi transport (21.Porat A. Elazar Z. Regulation of intra-Golgi membrane transport by calcium.J. Biol.

Calcium-dependent fusion among endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as yeast homotypic vacuole fusion (23.Peters C. Mayer A. Ca2+/calmodulin signals the completion of docking and triggers a late step of vacuole fusion.Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although many players involved in the intracellular manganese trafficking network have been characterized in yeast, our understanding of organelle-to-organelle Mn2+ flux is far from complete. Here, we report a Pmr1-independent mechanism for cis-Golgi Mn2+ supply. This supply depends on the ER Mn2+ transporter Spf1 and the Smf2 late endosome/trans-Golgi Mn2+ transport activity and can be counteracted by ATX2 overexpression. In addition, it requires extracellular CaCl2 in order to stimulate vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. Based on our observations we propose a model on intracellular manganese homeostasis that provides mechanisms for intra-organelle ion flux and manganese detoxification. Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Gene deletions were constructed by PCR-based methods using pAG25 (EUROSCARF) and pFA6a-klLEU2MX6 (kindly provided by B.

The chromosomal SMF2 open reading frame under the control of its own promoter was C-terminal-tagged with enhanced GFP (eGFP) by a PCR-based method using the tagging vector pKT209 (pFA6a-link-yEGFP-CaURA3) (24.Sheff M.A. Thorn K.S.

Cells were then washed twice with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, and finally resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were imaged at 25 °C using a microscope (DM-6000B, Leica) at 100× magnification using L5, N3, and TX2 filters and a digital charge-coupled device camera (DFC350, Leica). Images were taken using LAS AF software (Leica) with the same exposure times for Smf2-GFP (1s) and lower exposure times for different marker proteins in the co-localization analysis. Images were assembled in Photoshop (Adobe) with only linear adjustments. Statistical analysis of co-localization was performed by counting at least 100 cells per marker derived from three independent experiments. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. Yeast cells were grown to an A600 of 2.5 in YPAD medium or the same medium supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. In both cases the growth media was supplemented with 20 μm MnCl2 to monitor metal accumulation under manganese toxicity conditions. The cultures were harvested and washed with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), then deionized water, and finally dried. Samples were subjected to acid digestion and applied to an ICP Horiba Jobin Yvon Ultima 2 atomic-emission spectrometer at the Microanalysis Service of University of Seville (Seville, Spain). Manganese and calcium content were measured according to the manufacturer's specifications. Gene expression profiles were determined by using the “3′-expression microarray” technology by Affymetrix platform at the Genomics Unit of CABIMER (Seville, Spain) as described previously (2.García-Rodríguez N. Díaz de la Loza Mdel C. Andreson B. Monje-Casas F. Rothstein R. Wellinger R.E. Impaired manganese metabolism causes mitotic misregulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18717-18729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with the modification that total RNA was isolated from cultures grown on YPAD + 5 mm CaCl2. In a previous work we found that an excess of cytosolic Mn2+ alters mRNA transcription regulation and challenges genome stability (2.García-Rodríguez N. Díaz de la Loza Mdel C. Andreson B. Monje-Casas F. Rothstein R. Wellinger R.E. Impaired manganese metabolism causes mitotic misregulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18717-18729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An example is the transcriptional 42-fold down-regulation of the low-affinity plasma membrane Mn2+ transporter PHO84 (YML123C). Interestingly, upon CaCl2 addition, transcriptional down-regulation of PHO84 was reversed, suggesting that extracellular CaCl2 alters cellular Mn2+ levels (see the supplemental data). To test if this is the case, we first compared the total cellular manganese and calcium levels in wild type and pmr1Δ cells in the presence of extracellular CaCl2 (Fig. 1A). In accordance with previous studies (16.Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mutations in PMR1 suppress oxidative damage in yeast cells lacking superoxide dismutase.Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pmr1Δ cells suffered from a dramatic increase in total manganese and calcium levels. Upon the addition of CaCl2, the cellular calcium content increased with a concurrent decrease in the manganese content (∼8.5-fold). Because Mn2+ interferes with telomerase activity leading to telomere shortening (29.Lue N.F. Bosoy D. Moriarty T.J. Autexier C. Altman B. Leng S. Telomerase can act as a template- and RNA-independent terminal transferase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9778-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) we assayed telomere length variation as an indirect measure for nuclear Mn2+ levels (Fig. 1B). We found that telomere shortening in pmr1Δ mutants was alleviated upon CaCl2 addition, suggesting that the addition of extracellular CaCl2 either competes with Mn2+ uptake or stimulates the removal of toxic Mn2+ from the cytoplasm. Transformation with an SMF1 overexpression vector challenged pmr1Δ viability independently of CaCl2 supplementation (data not shown), indicating that increased Smf1 levels could lead to uncontrolled and toxic Mn2+ uptake. Loss of the Mn2+ importer Smf1 should, therefore, impair Mn2+ uptake and suppress pmr1Δ phenotypes related to cytosolic Mn2+ excess. However, deletion of SMF1 has been shown to be lethal in combination with pmr1Δ (30.Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Cdc1 is required for growth and Mn2+ regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1998; 148: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, left), whereas mutations in PMR1 up-regulate Smf1 protein levels under Mn2+ starvation conditions (11.Jensen L.T. Carroll M.C. Hall M.D. Harvey C.J. Beese S.E. Culotta V.C. Down-regulation of a manganese transporter in the face of metal toxicity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we could recover viable pmr1Δ smf1Δ spores when the tetrads were plated on CaCl2-containing medium (Fig. 1C, right), suggesting that CaCl2 is able to facilitate bypass of Mn2+ toxicity via an alternative mechanism. Numerous studies have reported suppression of other pmr1Δ phenotypes by CaCl2 (31.Antebi A. Fink G.R.

We asked whether other cation transporters contribute to this phenomenon. First, we set up a targeted, genetic screen for synthetic phenotypes of pmr1Δ with deletion of genes involved in Ca2+ or Mn2+ homeostasis. As a read-out, we monitored pmr1Δ-dependent loss-of-viability by the cell wall-perturbing agent calcofluor white (CFW) (34.Ram A.F. Wolters A. Ten Hoopen R. Klis F.M.

Consistent with glycosylation defects, pmr1Δ shows a weakened cell wall exemplified by hypersensitivity to CFW, Congo Red, and hygromycin B and constitutive activation of the cell integrity pathway (36.Bates S.

Notably, CaCl2-mediated recovery of viability was not observed in other mutants affected in protein glycosylation such as anp1Δ, lacking a cis-Golgi α-1,6-mannosyltransferase subunit (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, CFW sensitivity of pmr1Δ pho84Δ, pmr1Δ vcx1, and pmr1Δ ccc1Δ double mutants was suppressed by CaCl2, whereas pmr1Δ spf1Δ and pmr1Δ smf2Δ double mutants failed to grow upon CaCl2 addition (Fig. 2B).

Most living organisms rely primarily on the FoF1 ATP synthase to maintain the non-equilibrium concentration gradient of ATP to ADP and Pi that provides the main source of energy for cellular processes (1Spetzler D.

Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2012: 561-590Google Scholar). The ATP synthase is composed of two rotary motors, Fo and F1, joined by their rotor and stator components (Fig. 1A). To synthesize ATP, the Fo motor translocates H+ or, in some species Na+ ions across the membrane at the expense of a non-equilibrium electrochemical potential as a means to drive rotation of a ring of c subunits relative to subunit a. When viewed from the periplasm of Escherichia coli, protons move into the cytoplasm concurrent with clockwise (CW) 4The abbreviations used are: CWclockwiseCCWcounterclockwiseTMHtransmembrane helixIMVinverted membrane vesicleTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePPCprotonated periplasmic channelACMA9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy acridine. rotation. This rotation forces conformational changes in the catalytic sites of F1 that drive ATP synthesis.

The size of the c-ring is specific to the organism and has, to date, been found to vary from as small as eight copies in bovine mitochondria (3Watt I.N. Montgomery M.G. Runswick M.J. Leslie A.G.

A highly conserved carboxyl group (cAsp-61 in E. coli) located on the outer TMH of subunit c in the middle of the membrane is essential for Fo-dependent ion translocation (5Pogoryelov D. Krah A.

Because the E. coli ATP synthase contains a c10 ring, 10 protons are transferred across the membrane during each revolution that involves a net of three ATPs made or consumed. There is currently no high-resolution structure of Fo that includes subunit a, which is directly involved in Fo-dependent torque generation. Subunit a provides half-channels for ions to access cAsp-61 from the membrane surface and contains an essential and highly conserved arginine residue (aArg-210 in E. coli) that faces cD61 (7Angevine C.M.

The center of TMHs 2–5 provides an aqueous accessible half-channel in subunit a for ions to enter from the periplasm to protonate cAsp-61 during ATP synthesis (17Fillingame R.H. Steed P.R. Half channels mediating H transport and the mechanism of gating in the F sector of Escherichia coli FF ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1837: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cross-linking evidence shows that protonation of this half-channel causes TMHs 4 and 5 to swivel in a manner thought to facilitate proton transfer to cAsp-61 (18Moore K.J. Fillingame R.H. Structural interactions between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 of subunit a and the subunit c-ring of Escherichia coli ATP synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31726-31735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of c-rings demonstrate that the carboxyl side chain equivalent to cAsp-61 in E. coli provides an ion-binding site at each of the subunit c-c interfaces, known as the ion-locked conformation, that stabilizes the ion in the membrane upon dehydration (19Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Structure of the rotor ring of F-Type Na+-ATPase from Ilyobacter tartaricus.Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recent c-ring structures determined at low pH show that the essential carboxylate can adopt an open extended conformation that would facilitate ion loading (20Symersky J. Pagadala V. Osowski D. Krah A. Meier T. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Mueller D.M. Structure of the c(10) ring of the yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase in the open conformation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When a c-subunit completes a rotation, the change from a closed to an open conformation is anticipated to promote the displacement of the ion as the carboxylate rotates into the proximity of aArg-210. The free energy of cellular ATP is directly proportional to the logQ, where Q = [ATP] / [ADP][Pi]. Under steady-state conditions, the cytoplasm of E. coli typically contains 3 mm ATP, 0.4 mm ADP, and 6 mm Pi so that the logQ ≅ 0.1 (21Weber J. Senior A.E. Catalytic mechanism of F1-ATPase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). For the chloroplast FoF1, a logQ ≅ 0.1 results at steady state from a modest ΔpH ≅ 1.5 in contrast to a logQ ≅ −4.9 in the absence of an electrochemical potential (22Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. H+/ATP ratio of proton transport-coupled ATP synthesis and hydrolysis catalysed by CF0F1-liposomes.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rat and mouse skeletal muscles can maintain a logQ ≅ 6.0 (8 mm ATP, 0.008 mm ADP (23Kushmerick M.J. Moerland T.S. Wiseman R.W. Mammalian skeletal muscle fibers distinguished by contents of phosphocreatine, ATP, and Pi.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and 0.8 mm Pi), whereas cat skeletal muscle at rest has a logQ ≅ 0.2 (7.8 mm ATP, 1.3 mm ADP, and 3.8 mm Pi) that drops to −2.3 after exercise (24Kushmerick M.J. Meyer R.A. Brown T.R. Regulation of oxygen consumption in fast- and slow-twitch muscle.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C598-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major unresolved question is how the Fo motor uses the electrochemical gradient to generate enough torque so that the c-ring will undergo CW rotation even when the logQ is high. A Brownian ratchet mechanism has been postulated to power Fo rotation (25Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. ATP synthase: an electrochemical transducer with rotatory mechanics.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 26Oster G. Wang H. Grabe M. How Fo-ATPase generates rotary torque.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two noncolinear ion access half-channels from each side of the membrane, like those identified in subunit a that lead to the cAsp-61 carboxylate, must be present for a Brownian ratchet to function. In addition, rotational diffusion of the c-ring relative to subunit a must be periodically restricted in some manner. Recently, a periodic restriction in rotation lasting 50–175 μs that results from stepping between adjacent c subunits in the c-ring has been observed in single-molecule experiments of E. coli FoF1 incorporated into lipid bilayer nanodiscs (n-FoF1) to stabilize Fo (27Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D. Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli FoF1-ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This 36° stepping, observed as a transient dwell, occurs as the result of an interaction between subunit a and subunit c known as a leash. However, the molecular basis for the interaction responsible for the leash and its relevance to the mechanism of ATP synthesis remains undetermined. Mutations to either cAsp-61 or aArg-210, the only known interaction between these subunits, have been found to decrease the ability to form the leash to only a small extent. Although proton gradient-driven CW rotation in the ATP synthase direction has been observed with single molecules of FoF1 embedded in liposomes (28Diez M. Zimmermann B. Börsch M. König M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Gräber P. Proton-powered subunit rotation in single membrane-bound F0F1-ATP synthase.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and extended lipid bilayers (29Watanabe R. Tabata K.V. Iino R. Ueno H. Iwamoto M. Oiki S. Noji H. Biased Brownian stepping rotation of FoF1-ATP synthase driven by proton motive force.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the time resolution of these experiments was not sufficient to resolve the presence of the leash. Using single-molecule measurements with a time resolution of 10 μs, we now show that, upon formation of the leash, the Fo complex overcomes the force of F1 ATP hydrolysis-driven CCW rotation to rotate the c-ring CW in the ATP synthase direction by as much as one c subunit. Mutational studies indicate that the leash is important for ATP synthase activity and support a mechanism in which residues aGlu-196 and cArg-50 participate in the cytoplasmic proton half-channel to promote leash formation. The results presented here provide a framework for a mechanism in which this Fo-dependent CW rotation results from protonation-dependent conformational changes in subunit a that push the van der Waals surface of TMH 4 against the surface of subunit c.

Subsequently, 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) was added to samples 3 and 4 and incubated for 15 min prior to the addition of 1 μl of 10 mm fluorescein maleimide to all samples. After a 2-h incubation, unreacted fluorescein maleimide was removed by 10 successive concentration/dilution cycles using 7 ml of Pierce spin concentrators with a 150 kDa cutoff. The final sample concentrations were normalized, and 40 μg of protein was loaded onto a premade SDS 8–16% gradient denaturing gel (Bio-Rad). Fluorescent bands were imaged using UV light prior to Coomassie staining. The ATP synthesis activity of IMVs was measured using the ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II luciferin/luciferase system (Roche Diagnostics) as the result of a pH gradient using buffer 1 (pH 8.0) and buffer 2 (pH 4.4), which were each composed of 20 mm succinate, 20 mm Tricine, 50 mm MES, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaP, 5 mm MgSO4, and buffer 3, which was composed of 200 mm Tricine, 158 mm KCl, and 242 mm KOH (pH 8.9). Prior to use, the lyophilized luciferin/luciferase mixture was dissolved in 10 ml of buffer 3 according to the directions of the vendor. Freshly prepared IMVs were suspended in buffer 1 at 52.73 mg of protein/ml as a stock for use in the assays.

The rate of increase of 562 nm luminescence intensity was monitored immediately upon mixing in a Cary Eclipse spectrometer at 28 °C with the photomultiplier tube detector at 800 V and the slit width at 20 nm. The rate of ATP hydrolysis of membrane vesicles was measured in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP using a coupled enzyme assay with pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase as described in Ref. 31Martin J.L.

Rotation measurements of single molecules of n-FoF1 were made as described previously (27Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D.

Transient dwells during transition events were identified using custom programs developed in MATLAB R2013b. The program first ascertained the minimum and maximum intensities for each data set, and transitions were selected for further analysis that changed from within 5% of the minimum at the end of a catalytic dwell to 5% of the maximum values. Earlier studies showed that this rotation is CCW as a function of increasing intensity (32Hornung T. Martin J. Spetzler D. Ishmukhametov R. Frasch W.D. Microsecond resolution of single-molecule rotation catalyzed by molecular motors.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 778: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The rotational position was then calculated from the observed intensity values using the arcsine of the light intensity scattered from a nanorod as determined previously (27Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D.

Ahmad Z. Frasch W.D. Anatomy of F1-ATPase powered rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 3715-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transient dwells during a transition were identified when the net rotation was either CW or less than 1.5° for a period of more than 15 μs, equivalent to ≥3 consecutive data points at 200 kHz. These criteria limited the resolution of CW rotation to a minimum of >3°. To minimize the inclusion of pauses unrelated to transient dwells, transitions were then classified as containing transient dwells when they were observed to have two or more transient dwell events occur. The percentage of transitions that contain transient dwells was then calculated for each data set. To identify the extent of CW rotation during a transient dwell, the start and end points of CW rotation were determined by the identifying the rotational positions at which angular velocity approached zero. We determined changes in the rotational position of individual 78 × 34 nm gold nanorods attached to the c subunit ring of single n-FoF1 molecules powered by ATP hydrolysis using dark field microscopy with a polarizing filter and a bandpass filter to eliminate all but the red light scattered from the nanorod (Fig. 1B). A rotating nanorod may appear to be stationary when its rotation is not eccentric. However, the scattered red light intensity will change in a sinusoidal manner (Fig. 2C) as the nanorod rotates relative to the direction of the polarizer (supplemental Movie 1). To measure rotational position as a function of time during individual 120° F1 ATPase power strokes, the polarizing filter was aligned with each nanorod to minimize the scattered light intensity during one of the three catalytic dwells. During the CCW rotation of the 120° F1 ATPase power stroke subsequent to that dwell, the nanorod will undergo a “transition” in which the light intensity passes from a minimum through a maximum when the nanorod has rotated 90° (27Ishmukhametov R.

Lowry D. Frasch W. Microsecond time scale rotation measurements of single F(1)-ATPase Molecules.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3117-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transitions were collected from 5-s data sets from each molecule at data acquisition rates between 100–200 kHz in 10-kHz increments for a total collection time of 55 s using a single photon-counting avalanche photodiode. The rotational position as a function of time for each transition (Fig. 1D) was determined from the arcsine of the intensity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each data set yielded in excess of 300 transitions that were analyzed in this manner. Fig. 1D shows an example of a transition collected from a single n-FoF1 ATPase molecule during ATPase-driven rotation in the presence of 1 mm MgATP. Under these conditions, the logQ ≅ 5.6 on the basis of estimated MgADP and Pi concentrations of ∼50 μm each (34Noji H. Bald D. Yasuda R. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Purine but not pyrimidine nucleotides support rotation of F(1)-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25480-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two transient dwells (red data), which are evidence of the leash, initially formed after the c-ring had rotated 18° and 55° from the end of the F1 ATPase catalytic dwell. Consequently, the net rotation between transient dwells was 37°, consistent with the CCW advancement of one c subunit in the c10 ring, as reported previously (27Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D. Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli FoF1-ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). During the transient dwells shown in Fig. 1D, Fo was able to rotate the c-ring CW by 10° and 25°, respectively, against the force of ATPase-driven rotation by F1. Examples of successive transitions from single molecules (Fig. 2) show transitions that lack transient dwells as well as those where rotation is halted or where CW rotation occurs. Custom software was written to identify the occurrence of transient dwells during 90° rotational transitions of ATPase-driven n-FoF1 power strokes and to determine the extent of CW rotation when it exceeded 3°. Rotation of the c-ring in the CW direction was observed during 72% of the 225,767 transient dwells examined from 207 molecules, whereas no net rotation was observed during the remaining 28% (Fig. 3, A–G). Of the former, almost all (99.88%) rotated CW ≤36° with an average CW rotation of ∼11°. These results indicate that when the leash between subunit a and the c-ring forms, Fo can force the c-ring to rotate in the ATP synthase direction by as much as one c subunit against the force of F1 ATPase-driven rotation. Fig. 3, H—N, shows the distribution of 5-s data sets for single n-FoF1 molecules as a function of the percentage of transitions in each data set that contain transient dwells. The occurrence of transient dwells increased with the viscosity of the medium because of the time constant for leash formation relative to the velocity of F1 ATPase-driven CCW rotation reported previously (27Ishmukhametov R. Hornung T. Spetzler D. Frasch W.D. Direct observation of stepped proteolipid ring rotation in E. coli FoF1-ATP synthase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3911-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At viscosities of 3.0 and 4.2 centiPoise, transient dwells were present an average of 65 ± 1.5% (all reported errors are S.E.) and 72 ± 0.9%, respectively. The algorithm used here revealed that transient dwells were present an average of 21.7 ± 0.9% of the time in aqueous buffer (0.9 cP), indicating that leash formation is not limited to rotation at high viscosities. It is noteworthy that, although leash formation occurred more frequently at higher viscosities, the fraction of transient dwells that rotated CW and the average extent of CW rotation observed were independent of viscosity (Fig. 3, A–G). Subunit c residues cArg-50 and cAsp-61 and subunit a residues aGlu-196 and aArg-210 were selected as candidates that potentially contribute to the interaction responsible for the formation of the leash in Fo. Although a high-resolution structure of the E. coli c-ring has not been determined, the crystal structures from the c-ring of spinach (35Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G.

LvIA is notable for its ability to selectively block α3β2 versus α6/α3β2β3 or α3β4 nAChRs. The residues in the β2 subunit that contribute to α-CTx LvIA binding to the α3β2 nAChR remain unknown. We therefore performed a mutational study of the α3β2 nAChR in which we assessed the influence of residues that line the β2 subunit on the binding of α-CTx LvIA. Reagents for peptide synthesis were from GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). Reversed-phase HPLC analytical Vydac C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) and preparative C18 Vydac column (10 μm, 22 × 250 mm) were from Grace Vydac (Hesperia, CA). Clones of rat α3, β2, and β4 cDNAs were kindly provided by S. Heinemann (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). A two-step oxidation protocol was used to synthesize α-CTx LvIA as described previously (25.Luo S. Zhangsun D. Schroeder C.I. Zhu X. Hu Y. Wu Y. Weltzin M.M. Eberhard S. Kaas Q. Craik D.J.

Because this protocol worked well, we did not attempt a simpler one-step oxidation approach. In this protocol, linear (see Fig. 1A) and folded (see Fig. 1B) peptides were purified by HPLC on a reversed-phase C18 Vydac column. HPLC elution conditions included a linear gradient of 0–40% solvent B over 40 min. Solvent A was 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Solvent B was 0.05% TFA, 90% acetonitrile in H2O. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Point mutants of nAChR β2 subunit cDNA (see Table 1) were created using PCR and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers that contained the desired point mutation as well as at least 15 bases on either side of the mutation were synthesized. The mutagenic primers were extended and incorporated by PCR. DpnI was then used to digest the methylated, non-mutated parental cDNA. The point mutated DNA was inserted in the pSP65 or pGEMHE vector, which was transformed into DH5α-competent cells.

Open table in a new tab Capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro following linearization of the plasmid containing template DNA encoding the rat α3, β2, and β4 subunits, as well as the various mutant subunits using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX), as described previously (20.Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. A new α-conotoxin which targets α3β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The cRNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Their concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Mature X. laevis frogs were anesthetized by submersion in 0.1% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, and oocytes were surgically removed. Two collagenase treatments lasting 1 h were performed at room temperature to remove follicle cells. RNA transcripts of wild-type α3 subunit with either wild-type β2 or mutant β2 subunit were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1. Fifty nl of this mixture with ∼10 ng of each cRNA was injected into each Xenopus oocyte and incubated at 17 °C. Oocytes were injected within 1 day of harvesting. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed 1–4 days after cRNA injection. All recordings were done at ∼22 °C room temperature. Briefly, oocytes were voltage-clamped at −70 mV and exposed to ACh and peptide in a 30-μl cylindrical oocyte recording chamber, which was gravity-perfused at a rate of 2 ml/min with ND-96 buffer. The ND-96 buffer consisted of 96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1 μm atropine, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.1–7.5. The oocyte was subjected once a minute to a 1-s pulse of 100 μm ACh. Once a stable baseline was achieved, either ND-96 alone or ND-96 containing varying concentrations of the α-CTx LvIA was manually pre-applied in a static bath for 5 min prior to the addition of the agonist ACh pulse. Three to five ACh responses were averaged for the baseline responses of ND-96 after a 5-min incubation just preceding a test response, which was used to normalize evoked responses as a percentage of control response. The percentage of response of the toxin was divided by the pre-toxin baseline value to yield a percentage of response. The dose-response data were fitted to the equation: % of response = 100/(1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH), where nH is the Hill coefficient, using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Each data point of a dose-response curve is the average ± S.E. from at least three oocytes. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Graph-Pad Prism. A molecular model of the interaction between LvIA and the ligand-binding domain of α3β2 nAChR was built by homology using the NMR solution structure of LvIA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier 2mdq) and the crystal structure of the complex between acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) and conotoxin PnIA variant (PDB identifier 2br8) as templates, as described previously (25.Luo S.

All the models of complexes involving β2 subunit mutants were generated by substituting residue side chains using Modeler 9v14 (30.Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10537) Google Scholar). This procedure refines the positions of the substituted side chain atoms as well as of those of the neighbor residues using a conjugate gradient minimization followed by a short molecular dynamics simulation. The molecular models were refined by a 2-ns explicit water molecular dynamics simulation, and the simulations of the T59K, V111I, and F119Q mutants were extended to 10 ns. α-CTx LvIA linear peptide (Fig. 1A) was successfully synthesized with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, in which Cys residues were orthogonally protected using acid-labile S-trityl and acid-stable S-acetamidomethyl groups. The acid-labile groups (trityl) were first removed after cleavage of the assembled peptide chain from the resin. The linear peptide after the initial cleavage was purified by HPLC with a retention time of 27.7 min (Fig. 1C). Ferricyanide was used to close the first disulfide bridge, and iodine oxidation was used to subsequently close the second disulfide bridge. The fully folded peptide of α-CTx LvIA with Cys1–Cys3 and Cys2–Cys4 disulfide bonds (Fig. 1B) was purified again by HPLC, with a retention time of 27.9 min (Fig. 1D). The mass of the α-CTx LvIA matched that of the amidated sequence (calculated average mass, 1679.9 Da; observed, 1679.7). This synthesized fully folded peptide was utilized in all subsequent experiments. Previous studies using molecular modeling of related toxins suggested the nAChR positions that form the ligand-binding pocket of α-conotoxins (23.Luo S. Akondi K.B. Zhangsun D. Wu Y. Zhu X. Hu Y.

The residue positions of the β2 and β4 subunits that were suggested to form the LvIA-binding pocket in a previous modeling study (25.Luo S. Zhangsun D. Schroeder C.I. Zhu X. Hu Y. Wu Y. Weltzin M.M.

We created point mutations of the β2 subunit where residues in this pocket were replaced with those found in the homologous position of the β4 subunit. These mutant receptors were then tested to determine toxin potency differences (Table 1). Seven nAChR β2 mutants were created, including Q34A, T59I, T59K, T59L, K79A, V111I, and F119Q. The concentration-response block by α-CTx LvIA on α3β4 nAChR and wild-type and mutant α3β2 nAChRs was investigated (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The potency at wild-type α3β2 nAChR was 17-fold greater than that at wild-type α3β4 nAChR. Among the seven α3β2 mutants, LvIA had the lowest activity on α3β2[V111I], with an IC50 of 126 nm, which is similar to the 148 nm IC50 on wild-type α3β4. Thus, the β2 subunit mutation V111I reduced the binding of LvIA to α3β2 nAChR by 15-fold. There were no significant differences in LvIA potency on mutants α3β2 Q34A, K79A, or T59I when compared with activity at wild-type α3β2 nAChR (Table 1, Fig. 3).FIGURE 3α-CTx LvIA dose-response curves for wild-type and mutant α3β2 nAChRs. All seven mutant receptors exhibited similar sensitivity for ACh to wild-type α3β2 nAChR. Values are mean ± S.E. from a recording made using 5–9 separate oocytes. Results are summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increased potency of α-CTx LvIA was observed at α3β2[F119Q], α3β2[T59K], and α3β2[T59L] nAChRs. LvIA potently blocked ACh-evoked currents of these nAChRs with IC50 values of 0.58, 0.96, and 2.03 nm, respectively (Table 1). The ratio between the IC50 values of wild-type and mutant α3β2 nAChRs was 15 and 11 for α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K], respectively. The mutation T59L resulted in only a small increase (∼4.3-fold) of LvIA potency. The most LvIA-sensitive mutant, α3β2[F119Q], had a potency 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the least sensitive mutant, α3β2[V111I] (Table 1, Fig. 3B). LvIA is 255-fold less potent at α3β4 than at α3β2[F119Q], and 154-fold less potent at α3β4 than at α3β2[T59K]. Although introducing the β4 residues Lys and Gln at positions 119 and 59, respectively, increased the potency of LvIA for α3β2, this CTx is more potent at wild-type α3β2 than α3β4. A synergistic effect of binding site positions displaying different residues between the two subtypes might explain why LvIA is more active at α3β2 than at α3β4. The α3β2 receptor mutants affected not only the potency of LvIA but also its recovery (Table 2, Fig. 4). α-CTx LvIA (10 nm) blocked wild-type α3β2 nAChRs versus mutant receptors α3β2[F119Q], α3β2[T59K], and α3β2[V111I] to different degrees (Fig. 4). α-CTx LvIA at 10 nm blocked ∼55% current of wild-type α3β2 but produced little or no block of α3β2[V111I] (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, complete block of ACh-evoked currents was obtained with 10 nm α-CTx LvIA on mutant receptors α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K] (Fig. 4, C and D).TABLE 2Recovery time after block by α-CTx LvIAnAChR subtypeT95aTime to 95% recovery after toxin washout.nAChR subtypeT95aTime to 95% recovery after toxin washout.minminα3β2<2α3β2[T59L]6–9α3β2[K79A]<1α3β2[F119Q]10–12α3β2[V111I]<1α3β420–26α3β2[Q34A]2–3α3β2[T59K]≫20b< 3% recovery after 20 min; concentration of α-CTx LvIA was 10 μm.α3β2[T59I]2–3a Time to 95% recovery after toxin washout.b < 3% recovery after 20 min; concentration of α-CTx LvIA was 10 μm. Open table in a new tab We compared the recovery time (>95% initial current) after block by 10 μm toxin for the wild-type and mutant receptors (Table 2). Recovery of wild-type α3β2 nAChR was complete within 2 min after toxin washout. Thus, the t½ was estimated to be <30 s, and this time scale is beyond the resolution of the experimental setup. Similarly the off-rates for α3β2[T59I], α3β2[K79A], α3β2[V111I], and α3β2[Q34A] were also rapid (full recovery in 1–3 min). The recovery time of wild-type α3β4 nAChR was 20–26 min, which is slower than that of α3β2[F119Q] (10–12 min), but much faster than α3β2[T59K]. The three α3β2 mutations, T59K, T59L, and F119Q, affected the off-rates of LvIA significantly, as evidenced by the corresponding receptors having much slower reversible block by LvIA than wild-type α3β2 nAChR or mutants T59I, K79A, V111I, and Q34A. The recovery times of mutants α3β2[T59L] and α3β2[F119Q] were 6–9 and 10–12 min, respectively (Fig. 4C, Table 2), whereas α3β2[T59K] displayed the slowest recovery time, with less than 3% recovery 20 min after washout (Table 2). Even at low concentrations of LvIA (10–100 nm), α3β2[T59K] recovered very slowly from block. At 10 nm LvIA concentration, α3β2[T59K] recovered to 28 ± 3.5% current 20 min after washout, and at 100 nm concentration, only 13 ± 2% current was recovered 20 min after washout (Fig. 4D). A molecular model of the interactions between LvIA and the wild-type α3β2 nAChR showed that the β2 subunit positions considered for mutations are all potentially in contact with the conotoxin with the exception of position 34, as shown in Fig. 5A. LvIA had similar activity at wild-type and α3β2 Q34A nAChR, in agreement with the absence of interaction of this position. The wild-type β2 residue Lys79 can form a surface salt bridge with LvIA Asp11, and this interaction was found to be stable over a 30-ns molecular dynamics simulation (Fig. 5B). The three other substituted positions, i.e. positions 59, 111, and 119, are at least partly buried at the interface with LvIA. The change of activity of LvIA correlated with a change of buried surface solvent-accessible surface area at the interface for mutants of positions 59 and 119 (Fig. 5C). The molecular model did not provide a simple explanation for the decreased activity of LvIA at the V111I mutant, and we propose that this mutation could potentially result in conformational changes that cannot be modeled using short molecular dynamics simulations. The other mutated positions, i.e"

Their structural homology with the class II lipid kinases [type II phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4KII)] suggests that PIP5KI dimerizes, although this has not been formally demonstrated. Neither the hypothetical structural dimerization determinants nor the functional consequences of dimerization have been studied. Here, we used Förster resonance energy transfer, coprecipitation, and ELISA to show that PIP5KIβ forms homo- and heterodimers with PIP5KIγ_i2 in vitro and in live human cells. Dimerization appears to be a general phenomenon for PIP5KI isoenzymes because PIP5KIβ/PIP5KIα heterodimers were also detected by mass spectrometry. Dimerization was independent of actin cytoskeleton remodeling and was also observed using purified proteins. Mutagenesis studies of PIP5KIβ located the dimerization motif at the N terminus, in a region homologous to that implicated in PIP4KII dimerization. PIP5KIβ mutants whose dimerization was impaired showed a severe decrease in PI(4,5)P2 production and plasma membrane delocalization, although their association to lipid monolayers was unaltered. Our results identify dimerization as an integral feature of PIP5K proteins and a central determinant of their enzyme activity."

These compounds have shown to be toxic and mutagenic for procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. For DNA replication fidelity it is therefore of great importance that organisms exhibit effective mechanisms to remove such non-canonical base analogs from DNA precursor pools. In vitro, the molybdoenzymes mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1 and 2 (mARC1 and mARC2) have shown to be capable of reducing N-hydroxylated base analogs and nucleoside analogs to the corresponding canonical nucleobases and nucleosides upon reconstitution with the electron transport proteins cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. By RNAi-mediated down-regulation of mARC in human cell lines the mARC-dependent N-reductive detoxication of HAP in cell metabolism could be demonstrated. For HAPR, on the other hand, the reduction to adenosine seems to be of less significance in the detoxication pathway of human cells as HAPR is primarily metabolized to inosine by direct dehydroxylamination catalyzed by adenosine deaminase. Furthermore, the effect of mARC knockdown on sensitivity of human cells to HAP was examined by flow cytometric quantification of apoptotic cell death and detection of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. mARC2 was shown to protect HeLa cells against the apoptotic effects of the base analog, whereas the involvement of mARC1 in reductive detoxication of HAP does not seem to be pivotal.

N6-hydroxyadenosine (HAPR), 2-amino-HAP, or N4-hydroxycytidine have been shown to possess toxic and mutagenic properties in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells (1Khromov-Borisov N.N.

Nucleoside and nucleobase analog mutagens.Mutat. Res. 1994; 318: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As base analogs, their mutagenicity is attributed to their ability to act alongside the natural substrates in cellular nucleic acid metabolism and their eventual incorporation into DNA (3Freese E. The specific mutagenic effect of base analogues on Phage T4.J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 87-105Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation is best explored for the N-hydroxylated adenine analogs. Just as adenine, HAP is postulated to be activated through the purine salvage pathway via initial conversion by adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase to the corresponding monophosphate (4Kozmin S.G.

Butterbaugh J. Stoll D. Giner-Sorolla A. Studies of 6-N-hydroxylamino-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine in mouse leukemia.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1967; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HAPMP may then be activated by kinases and ribonucleotide reductase resulting in deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dHAPTP), which can be a substrate for DNA polymerases (7Abdul-Masih M.T. Bessman M.J.

Because of its ambivalent base pairing properties, incorporation can provoke mutations in subsequent replication cycles (7Abdul-Masih M.T. Bessman M.J.

In vivo, N-hydroxylated base analogs can be generated from canonical nucleobases in the course of cellular metabolism via different pathways. HAP can be formed by cytochrome P450 catalyzed monooxygenation of adenine (10Clement B. Kunze T. Hepatic microsomal N-hydroxylation of adenine to 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or from oxidative stress (11Simandan T. Sun J. Dix T.A. Oxidation of DNA bases, deoxyribonucleosides and homopolymers by peroxyl radicals.Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that HAPMP can be generated from IMP through de novo purine biosynthesis wherein hydroxylamine is provided instead of aspartate (12Lieberman I. Enzymatic synthesis of adenosine-5′-phosphate from inosine-5′-phosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is conceivable that N-hydroxylated bases analogs could enter nucleotide pools in vivo by natural means, contamination by direct measurement could not be proven, yet (13White R.H. The twists and turns of enzyme function.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2023-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, to ensure accuracy of DNA replication, it is of great importance for organisms to possess precise detoxication and repair mechanisms for protection from exogenous and endogenous base analogs. In Escherichia coli, mechanisms at several levels of the nucleic acid metabolism are described which prevent incorporation of HAP into DNA. Ycbx, a molybdoenzyme from the MOSC family, was found to be involved in detoxifying HAP by reduction to adenine (14Kozmin S.G. Leroy P. Pavlov Y.I. Schaaper R.M. YcbX and yiiM, two novel determinants for resistance of Escherichia coli to N-hydroxylated base analogues.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MOSC domain proteins form a small protein family in eu- and procaryotes with its members being characterized by the requirement of a molybdenum cofactor and a strictly conserved cysteine residue (15Anantharaman V. Aravind L. MOSC domains: ancient, predicted sulfur-carrier domains, present in diverse metal-sulfur cluster biosynthesis proteins including Molybdenum cofactor sulfurases.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 55-61PubMed Google Scholar). If HAP enters nucleotide pools through the salvage pathway anyway, inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) is postulated to prevent incorporation of HAPTP by sanitizing nucleotide pools and cleaving HAPTP or dHAPTP to its respective monophosphate derivate (8Burgis N.E.

Repair systems of the adenine analogs in humans have been studied less extensively. However, it was shown that ITPase plays a critical role in the detoxication pathway in human cells. Furthermore, involvement of endonucleases is suggested, as HAP is able to induce DNA strand breaks in human cell lines (16Waisertreiger I. S.-R. Menezes M.R. Randazzo J. Pavlov Y.I.

Alongside sulfite oxidase, aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidoreductase, mARC is one of four molybdenum-containing enzymes in humans and belongs to the MOSC family (23Mendel R.R. Kruse T.

The human genome codes for two mARC proteins (mARC1 and mARC2), which share a high degree of sequence similarity to each other. It is well accepted that the mARC-containing N-reductive enzyme system plays a major role in the activation of N-hydroxylated prodrugs as amidoximes, N-hydroxyguanidines or sulfhydroxamic acids (18Gruenewald S.

Though its physiological substrates, and therefore its physiological functions, are mostly unknown yet, mARC proteins are assumed to be involved in detoxication of mutagenic and toxic aromatic hydroxylamines like N-hydroxylated DNA-base analogs. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study that describes significant down-regulated expression of human mARC2 in colon tumors of human tissue samples (26Mikula M. Rubel T. Karczmarski J.

Indeed, we have shown previously that in vitro upon reconstitution with their electron transport proteins, both recombinant mARC proteins have the capability to reduce all hitherto examined N-hydroxylated nucleobases and nucleosides to their corresponding canonical compounds (27Krompholz N.

Besides its involvement in metabolic detoxication other functions of mARC have been proposed. mARC has been suggested to be involved in NO metabolism with regulatory functions in the l-arginine-dependent biosynthesis of NO (28Kotthaus J.

Accordingly, it has to be elucidated if functions of the molybdoenzymes are either overlapping or distinct. In this study we determined whether this in vitro observed mARC-mediated N-reduction also acts as a physiological relevant detoxication pathway in human cell systems. By performing siRNA-mediated mARC knockdowns, the role of mARC in the cellular metabolism of exogenous HAP, as a model for N-hydroxylated nucleobase analogs, and HAPR, as a model for N-hydroxylated nucleoside analogs, was examined. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD-stained cells as well as detection of caspase-mediated Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was used to determine the influence of mARC knockdown on HAP-induced apoptotic effects on cells. HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells were purchased from Cell Lines Service (Eppelheim, Germany). HeLa cells were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Holger Kalthoff (Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Division of Molecular Oncology, UKSH Kiel, Germany).

ON-Targetplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting human MOSC2 was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). Trypsin/EDTA and Accutase were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Chalfont St Giles, UK). Complete protease inhibitor mixture was acquired from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Human recombinant adenosine deaminase from E. coli was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HAP was obtained from Apollo Scientific Ltd. (Cheshire, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany), or Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Methanol HPLC grade was purchased from J.T. Baker (Deventer, Netherlands).

Anti-MOSC1 antibody was purchased from Abgent (San Diego, CA), anti-PARP from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and anti-calnexin from Acris Antibodies GmbH (Herford, Germany). HEK-293 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 18 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 20 mm HEPES. Cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2. As described earlier optimal siRNA concentrations were evaluated and knockdown protocols validated (35Plitzko B. Ott G. Reichmann D. Henderson C.J.

HEK-293 cells or HeLa cells were reverse transfected according to the manufacturer's transfection protocol from Invitrogen. Briefly, siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM in 24-well plates and incubated with transfection reagent to form liposome-siRNA complexes. The cells were trypsinized, counted, and suspended in culture medium. The cell suspension was then added to the liposome-siRNA complexes. Negative controls included a non-targeting siRNA control (scrambled siRNA) and transfection reagents without siRNA. Down-regulation of protein expression was attained 3 days after transfection and verified by Western blot analysis. To maintain the ability for active cell division, HeLa cells were trypsinized on day 3 after siRNA transfection and 75,000 cells/well (24 h assay) or 40,000 cells/well (48 h assay) were plated in 24-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 4 h before HAP was added. Stock solutions of HAP were prepared in DMSO and heated slightly to facilitate dissolution. 10-μl aliquots of stock solutions were added to each well, which resulted in various concentrations of HAP and 1% (v/v) DMSO. Cells were cultivated and then assayed after 24 h or 48 h. As positive control for induced apoptosis cells were treated with 100 μm etoposide under the same conditions. For N-reduction studies in HEK-293 the culture medium was removed, and cells were carefully washed and pre-incubated with substrate-free incubation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min. After removing the substrate free incubation buffer, the vital cells were then incubated with HAP-containing incubation buffer (3 mm HAP, 0.5% (v/v) DMSO) at 37 °C for 180 min. After the designated time, the culture supernatant was carefully removed, centrifuged to eliminate cellular debris and analyzed by HPLC. Samples were separated isocratically on a Lichrospher® 60 RP-select B (125 × 4 mm) 5 μm C8 column with a RP-select B 4 mm × 4 mm guard column (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase was composed of 10 mm octylsulfonate, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.0 and 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. Flow-rate was kept at 1 ml/min, and detection was carried out at 262 nm. The retention times were 11.6 ± 0.5 min (HAP) and 15.1 ± 0.5 min (adenine). For metabolism studies in HEK-293, culture medium was removed, and cells were carefully washed and pre-incubated with substrate-free incubation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min. After removing the substrate free incubation buffer, the vital cells were then incubated with HAPR-containing incubation buffer at 37 °C for 120 min. For concurrent inhibition of adenosine deaminase, 10 μl of dipyridamole in ethanol/H2O (2:1) per well was added to the incubation medium. After the designated time, the culture supernatant was carefully removed, centrifuged to eliminate cellular debris and analyzed by HPLC. Samples were separated isocratically on a Lichrospher®60 RP-select B (125 × 4 mm) 5 μm C8 column with a RP-select B 4 mm × 4 mm guard column (Merck kGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The mobile phase was composed of 10 mm octylsulfonate, 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.5, and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile. Flow-rate was kept at 1 ml/min, and detection was carried out at 260 nm. The retention times were 4.1 ± 0.1 (inosine), 9.5 ± 0.5 min (HAPR), and 17.2 ± 0.5 min (adenosine). To harvest cellular protein, cells were detached by scraping and collected by centrifugation. Pellets were then washed with PBS and centrifuged again. PBS was removed, cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture) and were shaken 20 min on ice. After 20 s of sonification, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant contained the total cellular protein extract. Protein concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and incubated for 6 min at 95 °C. Same amounts of protein for each sample of cell lysate were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK). Membranes were then blocked in TBS containing Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) milk powder and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and then washed with TBST. Further they were incubated with HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Suffolk, UK). After washing with TBST, membranes were developed with the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). The protein levels of calnexin or GAPDH were used as loading controls. Apoptotic cell death was quantified using the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I from BD Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Culture medium was collected. For detachment, cells were incubated for 3 min with Accutase, carefully singularized by pipetting and added to the collected culture medium. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min, 600 × g and supernatants discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of binding medium (culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2), transferred to flow cytometer tubes, mixed with 2 μl of Annexin V-PE and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, 3 μl of 7-AAD were added following another 5 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark. Cell suspensions were then analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h using a Gallios 3L flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Cytometer settings and gates were set on the basis of measurements with untreated and treated cells stained with only one dye. Analyses were carried out using Kaluza 1.2. Cells exhibiting high Annexin V-PE staining were regarded as apoptotic. Hoechst staining was used to detect changes in chromatin morphology as a typical characteristic of apoptosis (37Toné S.

A stock solution of Hoechst 33342 was prepared in aqua bidestillata. Aliquots were directly added to the culture medium (0.001% (w/v) Hoechst). After incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, cells were carefully washed twice and left in warm culture medium (without phenol red). Nuclear chromatin was afterward evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Perkin Elmer precisely LS 55, Waltham, MA). The adenosine deaminase catalyzed conversions of HAPR and adenosine were characterized by aerobic incubations at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Incubation mixtures contained 0.05 mg human recombinant adenosine deaminase and various concentrations of HAPR or adenosine in a total volume of 150 μl of MES buffer (20 mm, pH 6.0). After pre-incubation for 3 min at 37 °C, the reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme and terminated after 15 min by addition of 150 μl of methanol. Precipitated proteins were eliminated by centrifugation. Samples were analyzed by HPLC as described above. Statistical analyses were carried out using the SigmaPlot 11 software (Systat Software Inc.). The significance of observed differences was evaluated by Student's unpaired t test or for multiple comparison by Bonferroni test. A probability less than 5% was considered to be significant.

https://openalex.org/W2074296478,"Understanding the influence of synergisms on natural processes is a critical step toward determining the full-extent of anthropogenic stressors. As carbon emissions continue unabated, two major stressors—warming and acidification—threaten marine systems on several scales. Here, we report that a moderate temperature increase (from 30°C to 32°C) is sufficient to slow— even hinder—the ability of dissolved organic matter, a major carbon pool, to self-assemble to form marine microgels, which contribute to the particulate organic matter pool. Moreover, acidification lowers the temperature threshold at which we observe our results. These findings carry implications for the marine carbon cycle, as self-assembled marine microgels generate an estimated global seawater budget of ~1016 g C. We used laser scattering spectroscopy to test the influence of temperature and pH on spontaneous marine gel assembly. The results of independent experiments revealed that at a particular point, both pH and temperature block microgel formation (32°C, pH 8.2), and disperse existing gels (35°C). We then tested the hypothesis that temperature and pH have a synergistic influence on marine gel dispersion. We found that the dispersion temperature decreases concurrently with pH: from 32°C at pH 8.2, to 28°C at pH 7.5. If our laboratory observations can be extrapolated to complex marine environments, our results suggest that a warming–acidification synergism can decrease carbon and nutrient fluxes, disturbing marine trophic and trace element cycles, at rates faster than projected."
https://openalex.org/W2010330265,"Catalytic antibodies have exhibited interesting functions against some infectious viruses such as HIV, rabies virus, and influenza virus in vitro as well as in vivo. In some cases, a catalytic antibody light chain takes on several structures from the standpoint of molecular size (monomer, dimer, etc.) and/or isoelectronic point. In this study, we prepared a monomeric 23D4 light chain by mutating the C-terminal Cys to Ala of the wild-type. The mutated 23D4 molecule took a simple monomeric form, which could hydrolyze synthetic 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide substrates and a plasmid DNA. Because the monomeric 23D4 light chain suppressed the infection of influenza virus A/Hiroshima/37/2001 in an in vitro assay, the corresponding experiments were conducted in vivo, after the virus strain (which was taken from a human patient) was successfully adapted into BALB/cN Sea mice. In the experiments, a mixture of the monomeric 23D4 and the virus was nasally administered 1) with preincubation and 2) without preincubation. As a result, the monomeric 23D4 clearly exhibited the ability to suppress the influenza virus infection in both cases, indicating a potential drug for preventing infection of the influenza A virus."

Here we demonstrate that the asparagine substitution of the aspartate associated with site III found in patients with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism or alternating hemiplegia of childhood causes a dramatic reduction of Na+ affinity in the α1-, α2-, and α3-isoforms of Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas other substitutions of this aspartate are much less disruptive. This is likely due to interference by the amide function of the asparagine side chain with Na+-coordinating residues in site III. Remarkably, the Na+ affinity of site III aspartate to asparagine and alanine mutants is rescued by second-site mutation of a glutamate in the extracellular part of the fourth transmembrane helix, distant to site III. This gain-of-function mutation works without recovery of the lost cooperativity and selectivity of Na+ binding and does not affect the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium or the maximum phosphorylation rate. Hence, the rescue of Na+ affinity is likely intrinsic to the Na+ binding pocket, and the underlying mechanism could be a tightening of Na+ binding at Na+ site II, possibly via movement of transmembrane helix four. The second-site mutation also improves Na+,K+ pump function in intact cells. Rescue of Na+ affinity and Na+ and K+ transport by second-site mutation is unique in the history of Na+,K+-ATPase and points to new possibilities for treatment of neurological patients carrying Na+,K+-ATPase mutations.

Na+,K+-ATPase is a ubiquitous, membrane-bound enzyme responsible for creating vital gradients for Na+ and K+ across cell membranes. This enzyme belongs to the family of P-type ATPases, also including the closely related H+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPases, heavy metal-transporting ATPases, and ATPases with lipid substrates and unknown substrates. The common characteristic of these ATPases is the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate as part of the energy transduction mechanism. For each ATP hydrolyzed by the Na+,K+-ATPase, 3 internal Na+ are exchanged for 2 external K+ in a reaction cycle (Scheme 1) involving sequential binding and release of Na+ and K+ and transition between two major conformational states, the so-called E1 (Na+-selective) and E2 (K+-selective) forms (1.Post R.L.

The three Na+ ions bind cooperatively, and the crystal structure predicts that the first Na+ binds at site III with site I and II being filled consecutively thereafter, the occupation of site II leading to activation of phosphoryl transfer from bound ATP (3.Kanai R.

It is unclear whether this huge effect reported for the neurological disease mutation is unique for the asparagine substituent or for the α3-isoform. In fact the high-resolution (2.8 Å) crystal structures of the pig α1 Na+,K+-ATPase in the E1(Na3)·AlF4−·ADP state (3.Kanai R. Ogawa H. Vilsen B. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Crystal structure of a Na-bound Na,K-ATPase preceding the E1P state.Nature. 2013; 502: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) do not provide an unambiguous answer to the question whether the M8 aspartate (Asp-926/Asp-928 in pig/rat α1, Asp-930 in human α2, and Asp-923 in human α3) is a critical Na+-coordinating residue. Hence, the distance between the closest M8 aspartate side chain oxygen and the Na+ ion at site III differs between the two protomers, A and B, in the asymmetric unit, and also depends on the presence of oligomycin bound to the enzyme (3.Kanai R. Ogawa H. Vilsen B. Cornelius F. Toyoshima C. Crystal structure of a Na-bound Na,K-ATPase preceding the E1P state.Nature. 2013; 502: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the distances being 3.6 and 4.2 Å for the two protomers without oligomycin and 3.3 and 4.2 Å with oligomycin (Fig. 1). The protomers A and B might represent different snapshots of the Na+ binding process with Na+ at slightly different positions. Only the shortest distances of 3.3 and 3.6 Å, corresponding to protomer B, with and without oligomycin, respectively, can be considered sufficiently small to represent direct coordination of the Na+ ion by the aspartate, and even these distances are too large to be compatible with very tight interaction. Furthermore, it is only one of the two oxygen atoms of the M8 aspartate side chain that according to the crystal structure could be directly involved in the binding of Na+, contrary to some of the other aspartates of the Na+ binding sites that contribute both of their side-chain oxygen atoms to Na+ binding (Fig. 1). Hence, it is not immediately clear from the high-resolution crystal structures that mutation of the M8 aspartate should reduce Na+ affinity to the extent observed for the RDP/AHC mutation D923N in α3. Another crystal structure of the Na+-bound pig α1 Na+,K+-ATPase shows a 2.4 Å distance between Na+ at site III and the nearest Asp-926 side-chain oxygen in both protomers (15.Nyblom M. Poulsen H. Gourdon P. Reinhard L. Andersson M. Lindahl E. Fedosova N. Nissen P. Crystal structure of Na+, K+-ATPase in the Na+-bound state.Science. 2013; 342: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but due to its low resolution (4.3 Å), the uncertainty is significant in this case. These ambiguities have led us to seek more information about the role of the aspartate in Na+ binding and the exact reason for the dramatic reduction of Na+ affinity in the α3-D923N mutant by studying the effect of replacing the aspartate with asparagine in other isoforms as well as the effects of other substituents.FIGURE 1Disposition of Na+ binding residues in protomers of Na+,K+-ATPase E1(Na3)·AlF4−·ADP crystal structures.

During the course of this work, we unexpectedly discovered that the reduced affinity for Na+ caused by Asp-928 mutations could be compensated by introduction of a second-site mutation, E314D, of a glutamate located in the extracellular part of transmembrane helix M4, far away from Asp-928. Such a rescuing effect on Na+ binding by second-site mutation has not previously been described for the Na+,K+-ATPase and provides essential insight in the functioning of the Na+ sites. Mutations were introduced by PCR into cDNA encoding either the rat α1-isoform or an ouabain-resistant version of the human α2-isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase (11.Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Einholm A.P.

The cDNA was full-length sequenced before transfection as well as following isolation of stable transfectants, where it had become integrated in the genome. Functional analysis was carried out on the plasma membrane fraction of the cells made leaky by use of either sodium deoxycholate or alamethicin to allow access of ions and ATP from both sides of the membrane.

The various incubation media allowing determination of Na+, K+, ATP, and vanadate concentration dependences are detailed in the figure legends. In each case, the Na+,K+-ATPase activity associated with the expressed exogenous enzyme was calculated by subtracting the ATPase activity measured at 10 mm ouabain (inhibiting all Na+,K+-ATPase activity) from that measured at 10 μm ouabain (inhibiting the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase). The transport activity was evaluated by measuring cellular K+ uptake using the K+ congener 86Rb+ as described previously (11.Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Einholm A.P. Schack V.R. Nielsen H.N. Holm R. Sobrido M.J. Andersen J.P. Clausen T. Vilsen B. Relationship between intracellular Na+ concentration and reduced Na+ affinity in Na+,K+-ATPase mutants causing neurological disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 3186-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In short, COS-1 cells were grown to confluence in culture medium containing 5 μm ouabain and were incubated for 5 or 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in serum-free medium containing 154 mm Na+ and 5.3 mm K+, to which had been added 86Rb+ (0.5 μCi/ml) and 5 μm ouabain (to inhibit the endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase) or 10 mm ouabain (to inhibit all Na+,K+-ATPase). 86Rb+ uptake was terminated by washing the cells with an ice-cold stop solution (11.Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Einholm A.P. Schack V.R. Nielsen H.N. Holm R. Sobrido M.J. Andersen J.P. Clausen T. Vilsen B.

Chem. 2014; 289: 3186-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following incubation in 0.2 m NaOH for 2 h at 4 °C, the cells were scraped off, and the amount of 86Rb+ in the suspension was determined by liquid scintillation counting. K+ uptake was calculated by multiplying the relative 86Rb+ uptake per mg of protein by the K+ concentration in the uptake medium. For direct comparison of the wild type and various mutants, the uptake data were normalized to represent identical expression levels as calculated from the active site concentration determination (see below). Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was determined on the leaky plasma membrane preparation in the presence of oligomycin to inhibit dephosphorylation and thus allow accumulation of phosphoenzyme. For determination of the Na+ concentration dependence of phosphorylation, the enzyme was mixed with [γ-32P]ATP at 0 °C in medium containing various concentrations of Na+ as detailed in the figure legends, followed by acid quenching 10 s later, using manual mixing. For determination of phosphorylation rate by transient kinetic studies, at 25 °C a QFM-5 quenched-flow module (Bio-Logic Instruments, Claix, France) was used for rapid mixing as described previously (20.Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Mutational effects on conformational changes of dephospho- and phospho-forms of the Na+,K+-ATPase.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By varying the flow rate and the volume of the delay line, reaction times between 10 and 250 ms were obtained. Following acid quenching, the precipitated 32P-labeled phosphoenzyme was washed twice by centrifugation, and SDS-PAGE was performed under acid conditions (pH 6.0), ensuring stability of the acyl-phosphoryl bond during electrophoresis. The radioactivity associated with the separated Na+,K+-ATPase band was quantified by phosphor-imaging using a Cyclone storage phosphor system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (10.Einholm A.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Holm R. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. The rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism mutation D923N of the Na+, K+-ATPase α3 isoform disrupts Na+ interaction at the third Na+ site.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26245-26254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To inhibit the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase, the membranes were preincubated with 10 μm ouabain, which was also present during the phosphorylation reaction. For every assay, the level of background phosphorylation was determined in a reaction mix containing a high concentration of K+ (50 mm) instead of Na+, as K+ prevents phosphorylation by reversing the reaction cycle, and the K+ background (only a tiny fraction of the total 32P incorporation) was subtracted before calculation of the phosphorylation level. The active site concentration was obtained as the maximum phosphoenzyme level corresponding to stoichiometric phosphorylation as determined in the presence of saturating Na+ concentration. The results are reported as mean ± S.E. values (shown by error bars in figures, seen only when larger than the size of the symbols). In all cases, the number of independent experiments was ≥3. Data points were fitted by non-linear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.), and the best fits are shown as lines in the figures. For fitting of the Na+ dependence of phosphorylation and ATP dependence of ATPase activity, the Hill equation for binding of an activating ligand (L) was used (Equation 1). A=Amax×Lnk0.5n+Ln(Eq. 1) For fitting of the vanadate dependence of ATPase activity, the Hill equation modified to describe binding of an inhibiting ligand was used. (Equation 2). A=Amax×1−Lnk0.5n+Ln(Eq. 2) where Amax is the maximum level of phosphorylation or ATPase activity (set as 100% in the graphs), K0.5 is the ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect (“apparent affinity”), and n is the Hill coefficient. For fitting of the time dependence of phosphorylation, a mono-exponential “rise to max” function was used (Equation 3). EP=EPmax×1−e−kphos×t(Eq. 3) where EP is the phosphorylation level, EPmax is the maximum phosphorylation level reached at infinite time (set as 100% in the graphs), and kphos is the phosphorylation rate constant. Structural figures were prepared with PyMOL software. We examined the functional properties of a series of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-isoform mutants with alterations to Asp-928 in transmembrane helix M8 (D928N, D928A, D928L, D928E, D928H) as well as the human α2 equivalent of D928N, D930N (henceforth denoted α2-D930N). Furthermore, we studied two double mutations, E314D/D928A and E314D/D928N, and the single mutation E314D, none of which was originally planned (see below). The mutants and the corresponding wild types were expressed in COS-1 cells using the ouabain selection method, which allows stable expression of mutants retaining significant function (16.Price E.M.

The expression levels of the mutants were generally similar to those of the wild types. To trigger the phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase from ATP, all three Na+ binding sites of the E1 form need to be occupied by Na+, binding from the cytoplasmic side (Scheme 1). As seen in Fig. 2A, the Na+ dependence of phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP was examined to determine the apparent Na+ affinity (K0.5). For D928N and α2-D930N, a dramatic reduction of the apparent Na+ affinity (increase of K0.5) was observed corresponding to 78- and 41-fold, respectively, relative to the wild type (Table 1). A much more modest, but still significant reduction of the apparent Na+ affinity was seen for D928A, D928L, D928E, and D928H (5-, 10-, 4-, and 7-fold, respectively). The Na+ activation profiles also allowed extraction of the cooperativity parameter (Hill coefficient), nH, which for the α1 and α2 wild types ranges between 2 and 3, consistent with three Na+ ions being bound cooperatively. All the mutants showed nH values close to 1 (0.8 and 0.9 for D928N and α2-D930N, respectively), indicating the complete loss of cooperativity (Table 1).TABLE 1Functional analysis of mutantsTurnover rateaThe Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined at 37 °C in the presence of 30 mm histidine buffer (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μm ouabain.

Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the sense of smell, its function on a molecular level, the signaling proteins involved in the process and the mechanism of required ion transport. In recent years, the precise role of the ion transporter NKCC1 in olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) chloride accumulation has been a controversial subject. NKCC1 is expressed in OSNs and is involved in chloride accumulation of dissociated neurons, but it had not been shown to play a role in mouse odorant sensation. Here, we present electro-olfactogram recordings (EOG) demonstrating that NKCC1-deficient mice exhibit significant defects in perception of a complex odorant mixture (Henkel100) in both air-phase and submerged approaches. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) and RT-PCR experiments of NKCC1-deficient and wild type mouse transcriptomes, we confirmed the absence of a highly expressed ion transporter that could compensate for NKCC1. Additional histological investigations demonstrated a reduced number of cells in the olfactory epithelium (OE), resulting in a thinner neuronal layer. Therefore, we conclude that NKCC1 is an important transporter involved in chloride ion accumulation in the olfactory epithelium, but it is also involved in OSN neurogenesis. Background: NKCC1 is controversially discussed as the main chloride transporter in olfactory epithelium. Results: Lack of NKCC1 results in impaired odorant detection and a decrease in the number of mature neurons. Conclusion: NKCC1 is involved in chloride accumulation but also reveals an impact in neurogenesis. Significance: This work contributes to the understanding of olfactory epithelium neurogenesis. Olfaction is one of the most crucial senses for vertebrates regarding foraging and social behavior. Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the sense of smell, its function on a molecular level, the signaling proteins involved in the process and the mechanism of required ion transport. In recent years, the precise role of the ion transporter NKCC1 in olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) chloride accumulation has been a controversial subject. NKCC1 is expressed in OSNs and is involved in chloride accumulation of dissociated neurons, but it had not been shown to play a role in mouse odorant sensation. Here, we present electro-olfactogram recordings (EOG) demonstrating that NKCC1-deficient mice exhibit significant defects in perception of a complex odorant mixture (Henkel100) in both air-phase and submerged approaches. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) and RT-PCR experiments of NKCC1-deficient and wild type mouse transcriptomes, we confirmed the absence of a highly expressed ion transporter that could compensate for NKCC1. Additional histological investigations demonstrated a reduced number of cells in the olfactory epithelium (OE), resulting in a thinner neuronal layer. Therefore, we conclude that NKCC1 is an important transporter involved in chloride ion accumulation in the olfactory epithelium, but it is also involved in OSN neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2101705465,"RNase A is the prototype of an extensive family of divergent proteins whose members share a unique disulfide-bonded tertiary structure, conserved catalytic motifs, and the ability to hydrolyze polymeric RNA. Several members of this family maintain independent roles as ribonucleases and modulators of innate immunity. Here we characterize mouse eosinophil-associated RNase (Ear) 11, a divergent member of the eosinophil ribonuclease cluster, and the only known RNase A ribonuclease expressed specifically in response to Th2 cytokine stimulation. Mouse Ear 11 is differentially expressed in somatic tissues at baseline (brain ≪ liver < lung < spleen); systemic stimulation with IL-33 results in 10–5000-fold increased expression in lung and spleen, respectively. Ear 11 is also expressed in response to protective priming of the respiratory mucosa with Lactobacillus plantarum; transcripts are detected both locally in lung as well as systemically in bone marrow and spleen. Mouse Ear 11 is enzymatically active, although substantially less so than mEar 1 and mEar 2; the relative catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of mEar 11 is diminished ∼1000–1500-fold. However, in contrast to RNase 2/EDN and mEar 2, which have been characterized as selective chemoattractants for CD11c+ dendritic cells, mEar 11 has prominent chemoattractant activity for F4/80+CD11c− tissue macrophages. Chemoattractant activity is not dependent on full enzymatic activity, and requires no interaction with the pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Taken together, this work characterizes a divergent RNase A ribonuclease with a unique expression pattern and function, and highlights the versatility of this family in promoting innate immunity.

Taken together, this work characterizes a divergent RNase A ribonuclease with a unique expression pattern and function, and highlights the versatility of this family in promoting innate immunity. The RNase A ribonucleases are a family of vertebrate-specific secretory proteins with multiple, distinct lineages that have undergone extensive structural and functional diversification (reviewed in Refs. 1Dyer K.D.

RNase A ribonucleases and host defense: an evolving story.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 83: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Specifically, these proteins as a family share distinct structural and catalytic elements and all have some degree of enzymatic activity against single-stranded RNA substrates; however, their primary sequences have diverged significantly from one another, and in many cases there is evidence suggesting that diversification has resulted in novel function. In several specific RNase A family lineages (e.g. RNases 2/3, RNases 7/8, the rodent RNases 5, avian leukocyte RNases A1/A2), there is strong evidence suggesting that sequence diversification may relate to constraints promoting innate immunity, also known as host defense (3Rosenberg H.F.

Among the founding members of the larger RNase A family, RNase 2/EDN and RNase 3/ECP emerged as a gene pair from a relatively recent duplication event, which was followed by rapid diversification (12Rosenberg H.F.

Both RNase 2/EDN and RNase 3/ECP have prominent roles in promoting host defense via cytotoxic interactions with bacterial and helminthic pathogens as well as via antiviral activity, albeit characterized to date in experiments carried out primarily in vitro (reviewed in Refs. 14Rosenberg H.F.

Among the 12 characterized members of the Mus musculus mEar cluster, mouse eosinophil-associated RNase 11 (mEar 11) displays a particularly unusual expression pattern. Specifically, Cormier and colleagues (23Cormier S.A. Yuan S. Crosby J.R. Protheroe C.A. Dimina D.M. Hines E.M. Lee N.A. Lee J.J.

We have also detected expression of mEar 11 in lung tissue, likewise in settings of Th2 predominance, in conjunction with elevated levels of the Th2-cell chemoattractants CCL17 and CCL22 in virus-infected mice devoid of type I interferon receptor-mediated signaling (24Garvey T.L.

Given our larger interests in the RNase A family and its role in promoting host defense, here we examine the biology of mEar 11 and reveal the larger extent of its differential expression together with its interactions with other innate immune cells. The mice utilized in this study include wild-type BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice from the Division of Cancer Therapeutics, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, NJ.1638 IL-5 transgenic mice (25Lee N.A.

All protocols were evaluated and approved as per the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and carried out in accordance with the Institute's Animal Care and Use Committee Guidelines. cDNAs for mEars 1, 2, and 11 were generated from mRNA from splenocytes from IL-5 transgenic mice (cDNA synthesis kit, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), amplified with sequence-specific primers that included 5′ restriction sites to facilitate cloning (see below). The bacterial expression vector, pET-24a(+), and amplification products were subjected to restriction digestion with enzymes NdeI and XhoI and purified by gel electrophoresis. The amino terminus identified for mEar 11 was based on homology with those defined experimentally for mEars 1 and 2 (17Larson K.A. Olson E.V. Madden B.J. Gleich G.J. Lee N.A. Lee J.J.

We have shown previously that a short carboxyl tag does not interfere with post-translational folding or enzymatic activity of RNase A ribonucleases (26Rosenberg H.F. Domachowske J.B. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Amplified mEar coding sequences and the pET-24a(+) vector were ligated at a 1:1 molar ratio (T4 DNA ligase; Invitrogen), transformed into One Shot® TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen) and selected on kanamycin-agar plates. Selected clones were confirmed by sequencing. To generate mEar11K35R, lysine 35 (codon AAA) was mutated to arginine (codon AGA) by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Lightning Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit; Agilent Technologies) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to generate, mutagenize, and sequence pET-24a(+) constructs included: generation of mEar 1, 5′-CACCACCACCATATGCAAACCCCTTCCCAGAAGTTTGCCA-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGGTGCTCGAGAAATGTCCCATCCAAGTGAACTGGAACCACT-3′; generation of mEar 2, 5′-CACCACCACCATATGCAAACCCCTTCCCAGTGGTTTGCCA-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGGTGCTCGAGAAATGTCCCATCCAAGTGAACTGGAACCACT-3′; generation of mEar 11, 5′-CTCCTCCTCCATATGTTGACCCCCTCCCGGTGGTT-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCCTCCTCGAGAATATCCCATCCAAGTGAA-3′; sequencing of pET-24(+) constructs, 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGT-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAA-3′; introduction K35R mutation, 5′-GCGGGCCGTTAACAGTTACACAGGAGTGTGTAGAGACATAAATACTTTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGAAAAGTATTTATGTCTCTACACACTCCTGTGTAACTGTTAACGGCCCGC-3′. The pET-24a(+) mEar expression constructs described above were used to transfect One Shot® BL21(DE3) chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen). Kanamycin-resistant clones were screened for effective isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction of recombinant protein, as indicated by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-His6 antibody (AbCam). Selected clones were then grown overnight to stationary phase, and then to A600 = 0.8 in 1 liter in Terrific Broth (Quality Biologicals); protein synthesis was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysed with BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent containing Lysonase (Novagen). The insoluble fraction, which contained recombinant mEars within inclusion bodies, was collected by centrifugation and dissolved overnight in 3.0 ml of reducing buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride with 10 mm Tris base, 30 mm acetic acid, 2 mm EDTA, 80 mm reduced glutathione, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to pH 8.5). Denatured proteins were refolded over the course of 48 h by addition of 200 ml of oxidizing buffer (10 mm Tris base, 40 mm acetic acid, 0.6 ml-arginine, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione, adjusted to pH 8.5) in small aliquots, all maintained at 4 °C. Renatured protein solutions were dialyzed at 4 °C against multiple changes of dialysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 0.5 m NaCl) in 6–8-kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) dialysis tubing. Protein solutions were clarified of all insoluble debris and loaded onto pre-equilibrated 5-ml HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare). Columns were washed with cold 40 mm imidazole containing dialysis buffer, and eluted with 15 ml of elution buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.5 m NaCl, and 2 m imidazole, pH 8.5) in 1.0-ml fractions. Fractions with eluted protein were combined and dialyzed against cold dialysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce) against serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin standards. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated using bacterial-derived mEar11-His6 as antigen in a standard protocol (Spring Valley Laboratories). Antibody was purified from the antiserum using Hi-Trap protein A columns as per the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). The mEar 11 and mEar 11K35R His6-tagged constructs with terminal stop codon were amplified from their respective pET-24a(+) constructs with amplification primers as noted above. Amplification products and the pPinkα-HC yeast expression vector were subjected to restriction digestion with enzymes StuI and KpnI; vector and coding sequences were ligated, downstream of a α-mating factor signal sequence containing Ascomycota Kozak consensus sequence, with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) and used to transfect One Shot® TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen). Clones were isolated and selected for by sequencing with pPinkα-HC-specific primers. Bacterial clones were selected by ampicillin resistance. Ten μg of SpeI-linearized plasmid DNA was used to transfect chemically competent P. pastoris, which was then grown on Pichia Adenine Dropout (PAD) agar (Teknova). Large white colonies were selected and screened by PCR for the presence of the appropriate insert. Positive colonies were used to inoculate 10 ml of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) media, which were shaken at 300 rpm for 36 h at 29 °C in aerated tubes. Yeast clones were collected, re-suspended in 1 ml of YPD, 25% glycerol, and frozen as stocks at −80 °C. Primers used to generate P. pastoris mEar 11 constructs include: 5′-CACCACCACGAGTCCACACTTGACCCCCTCCCGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGGTGGGTACCGTGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTG-3′; primers for sequencing include: F1 5′-GCGACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC-3′, F2 5′-CTACTATTGCCAGCATTGCTGCTAAAGAA-3′, and R 5′-GGCGTGAATTAAGCGGTGAC-3′. Frozen stocks were plated on YPD agar; single colonies were used to inoculate primary YPD cultures and shaken at 300 rpm for 36 h at 29 °C in aerated Falcon tubes. Primary cultures were used to inoculate 1 liter of buffered glycerol-complex medium with 1 ml of antifoam 204 (Sigma) in baffled flasks, shaken at 300 rpm for 20 h at 29 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min and re-suspended in 50 ml of 1% methanol-buffered complex medium and shaken at 300 rpm for 6 days at 29 °C, replacing evaporated methanol every 24 h. Methanol-induced cultures were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Cell-free supernatants were dialyzed (4 °C) against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, with 375 mm NaCl using 6–8 kDa MWCO tubing for 36 h. 20 mm Imidazole and 1.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) were added to dialyzed solution. Slurry was rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 60 min and collected on chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), washed with 20 ml of wash buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 375 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and eluted into 1.0-ml fractions with 10 ml of elution buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 375 mm NaCl, 1.5 m imidazole, pH 8.0. Protein-containing fractions were combined, and dialyzed (4 °C) against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 375 mm NaCl in Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette 3,500 MWCO (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and concentrated with Centrifugal Filter Units 3,500 MWCO (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce) as above. Purified recombinant yeast mEars were tested for endotoxin contamination using E-Toxate Kit (Sigma). Serial dilutions of purified P. pastoris-derived mEar 11 were evaluated in parallel with endotoxin standards of 0.015–400 EU/ml and samples containing an internal control of 4 EU/ml; as anticipated, all samples evaluated were below detectable limits. Assays were performed in 400 μl of 40 mm sodium phosphate solution, pH 7.4, in triplicate as previously described (26Rosenberg H.F. Domachowske J.B. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial-derived recombinant mEars were added to assay solutions at 1.9 (mEar 1), 5.1 (mEar 2), and 160 (mEar 11) nm, respectively, and P. pastoris-derived recombinant mEar 11 and mEar 11K35R, each at 230 ng/ml. Acid-soluble ribonucleotides generated from acid-insoluble tRNA were measured spectrophotometrically at A = 260 nm. Total RNA was extracted from various mouse tissues from both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice using the RNAzol B reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNA samples were purified with the RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase I digestion (Qiagen), then reverse-transcribed to cDNA (Roche Diagnostics) using poly(A) primers. Quantitative PCR was performed using 2× TaqMan Reagent (Life Technologies) with validated sequence-specific primer probes for mEar11 and GAPDH (Life Technologies, catalog numbers 4331182-Mm00519056_s1 and 4308313, respectively). Values for absolute copy numbers for both mEar 11 and GAPDH were interpolated from plasmid standards via methods described previously (27Percopo C.M. Dyer K.D. Karpe K.A. Domachowske J.B.

In specific experiments, mice were treated with 1 μg of recombinant mouse IL-33 (R&D Systems) in 50 μl of PBS by intraperitoneal injection daily for 3 days prior to isolation of lungs and spleen for evaluation of mEar 11 expression and serum Th2 cytokines (28Dyer K.D.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from mice euthanized under isoflurane anesthesia and subjected to repeated instillation and withdrawal of 0.1% BSA in PBS (total 1.4 ml). Cells were isolated by centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min) and re-suspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin) at a density of 3 × 105/ml. One ml of cell suspension was plated into a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were washed with sterile PBS. Adherent cells were re-fed and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At 24 h, cells were provided with 1.0 ml of fresh medium alone or with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) or IL-13 (10 ng/ml). At various time points, cells were lysed directly in wells with RNAzol B, and RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit with on-column DNase I digestion (Qiagen). Gene expression was evaluated as described. This protocol was described in detail in Ref. 29Gabryszewski S.J. Bachar O. Dyer K.D. Percopo C.M. Killoran K.E. Domachowske J.B. Rosenberg H.F.

Briefly, 8-week-old BALB/c mice were anesthetized briefly with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with of 109 colony forming units (cfu) of L. plantarum (BAA-793) in a 50-μl volume of sterile phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA) at day 0. Control mice received diluent (PBS/BSA) alone. This inoculation (= priming) was repeated on day 7. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia at day 28; total RNA was prepared from bone marrow, spleen, and lung tissue using RNAzol B, and gene expression (copies mEar 11/copies GAPDH) was evaluated as described above. Single cell suspensions were generated by chopping spleens into Hanks' buffered saline solution (Life Technologies) with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza) and 10 mm HEPES. Large pieces were pressed through a 40-μm strainer, red blood cells were lysed with dH2O followed by re-equilibration with ×10 PBS. Cells were re-suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% FBS and 10 mm HEPES and enumerated on a hemocytometer. Approximately 4 × 107 cells were harvested from each spleen. Isolated splenic cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640, 1% FBS with 10 mm HEPES to 106 cells/ml. Mouse Ear 11 or mEar 11K35R was re-suspended in assay medium immediately prior to assay at concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.4 μm. RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) was added to specific experiments as indicated to a final concentration of 7.5 units/μl. Control chemoattractant CCL24 was included at 5 ng/μl (600 nm). One hundred μl (105 cells) were added to the top wells inserts and 100 μl of chemoattractant-containing medium added to the bottom wells of transwell plates. Cells were incubated for 150 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Migrated cells were collected from the bottom wells and diluted with 150 μl of 0.1% PBS/BSA. Migrated cells were counted for 30 s at high flow rate on an LSRII (BD Bioscience, East Rutherford, NJ). Chemotactic index was calculated by dividing the number of high-side scatter/high forward scatter (SSChi/FSChi) cells (myeloid gate) migrated in response to chemoattractant divided by the number of SSChi/FSChi cells migrated in response to vehicle control. Experiments were carried out as above, save for the following: isolated splenocytes from both C57BL/6 wild-type and C57BL/6 TLR2−/− mice were first depleted of CD90.2+ T cells and B220+ B cells via immunomagnetic methods as per the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi), then re-suspended at 3 × 105 cells/100 μl and loaded into the upper chamber of the transwell plate. After chemotaxis assay, cells were stained with Ly6G-Brilliant Violet 421 (1:40 dilution), CD11c-FITC (1:25 dilution), and F4/80-APC780 (1:40 dilution) and evaluated for expression of these cell surface antigens within the high side/high forward scatter (SSChi/FSChi) gate as noted above. Expression of TLR2 on C57BL/6 splenocytes was determined using monoclonal anti-TLR2/CD282 clone T2.5 (eBioscience) versus isotype (IgG1κ) control, both at 1:50 dilution. Data points were analyzed for statistical significance using Mann-Whitney U test, Student's t test, or two-way analysis of variance as appropriate.

https://openalex.org/W2042353279,"The ClpB/Hsp104 chaperone solubilizes and reactivates protein aggregates in cooperation with DnaK/Hsp70 and its cofactors. The ClpB/Hsp104 protomer has two AAA+ modules, AAA-1 and AAA-2, and forms a homohexamer. In the hexamer, these modules form a two-tiered ring in which each tier consists of homotypic AAA+ modules. By ATP binding and its hydrolysis at these AAA+ modules, ClpB/Hsp104 exerts the mechanical power required for protein disaggregation. Although ATPase cycle of this chaperone has been studied by several groups, an integrated understanding of this cycle has not been obtained because of the complexity of the mechanism and differences between species. To improve our understanding of the ATPase cycle, we prepared many ordered heterohexamers of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus, in which two subunits having different mutations were cross-linked to each other and arranged alternately and measured their nucleotide binding, ATP hydrolysis, and disaggregation abilities. The results indicated that the ATPase cycle of ClpB proceeded as follows: (i) the 12 AAA+ modules randomly bound ATP, (ii) the binding of four or more ATP to one AAA+ ring was sensed by a conserved Arg residue and converted another AAA+ ring into the ATPase-active form, and (iii) ATP hydrolysis occurred cooperatively in each ring. We also found that cooperative ATP hydrolysis in at least one ring was needed for the disaggregation activity of ClpB."

Therefore, the identification of molecules that regulate Aβ generation and those that cause synaptic damage is crucial for future therapeutic approaches for AD. We demonstrated previously that COPS5 regulates Aβ generation in neuronal cell lines in a RanBP9-dependent manner. Consistent with the data from cell lines, even by 6 months, COPS5 overexpression in APΔE9 mice (APΔE9/COPS5-Tg) significantly increased Aβ40 levels by 32% (p < 0.01) in the cortex and by 28% (p < 0.01) in the hippocampus, whereas the increases for Aβ42 were 37% (p < 0.05) and 34% (p < 0.05), respectively. By 12 months, the increase was even more robust. Aβ40 levels increased by 63% (p < 0.001) in the cortex and by 65% (p < 0.001) in the hippocampus. Similarly, Aβ42 levels were increased by 69% (p < 0.001) in the cortex and by 71% (p < 0.011) in the hippocampus. Increased Aβ levels were translated into an increased amyloid plaque burden both in the cortex (54%, p < 0.01) and hippocampus (64%, p < 0.01). Interestingly, COPS5 overexpression increased RanBP9 levels in the brain, which, in turn, led to increased amyloidogenic processing of APP, as reflected by increased levels of sAPPβ and decreased levels of sAPPα. Furthermore, COPS5 overexpression reduced spinophilin in both the cortex (19%, p < 0.05) and the hippocampus (20%, p < 0.05), leading to significant deficits in learning and memory skills.

We found that two rod-type arrestins, rArr1 and rArr2, are co-expressed in a rod and that a cone-type arrestin, cArr1, is expressed in blue- and UV-sensitive cones; the other cone-type arrestin, cArr2, is expressed in red- and green-sensitive cones. We quantified each arrestin subtype and estimated its concentration in the outer segment of a rod or a cone in the dark; they were ∼0.25 mm (rArr1 plus rArr2) in a rod and 0.6–0.8 mm (cArr1 or cArr2) in a cone. The effect of each arrestin was examined. In contrast to previous studies, both rod and cone arrestins suppressed the activation of transducin in the absence of visual pigment phosphorylation, and all of the arrestins examined (rArr1, rArr2, and cArr2) bound transiently to most probably nonphosphorylated R*.

The activated Tr (Tr*) then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyzes cGMP to close a cGMP-gated cation channel to result in a hyperpolarizing light response. This mechanism, known as the phototransduction cascade, is similar in rods and cones (1.Kawamura S. Tachibanaki S. Rod and cone photoreceptors. Molecular basis of the difference in their physiology.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2008; 150: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); yet rods and cones are different in their light response characteristics as follows: rods are more sensitive to light than cones, and the response of a cone is much briefer than that of a rod (2.Fu Y. Yau K.W. Phototransduction in mouse rods and cones.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 454: 805-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).

In electrophysiological studies, it has been shown that both rods and cones require arrestin for their normal light responses (6.Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J.

In this study, we examined the effect of arrestin on the quench of R* both in rods and cones. We screened the subtypes of arrestins expressed in carp (Cyprinus carpio) retina, examined their cellular localization, quantified their expression levels, and estimated their concentrations in the outer segment (OS) of a rod or a cone in the dark. We also investigated the effect of arrestin on Tr* formation attained by phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated R* in the membranes obtained from purified rods and cones in carp retina (13.Tachibanaki S.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14044-14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using recombinant carp arrestins. Unexpectedly, we found that all subtypes of arrestin examined inhibit Tr activation by R* regardless of visual pigment phosphorylation both in rods and cones. This finding is consistent with a result obtained electrophysiologically in GRK and arrestin double-knock-out mice (14.Burns M.E. Mendez A. Chen C.K. Almuete A. Quillinan N. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A.

C. carpio rods and cones were purified in the dark, and their membranes were prepared as described previously in complete darkness with the aid of an IR converter (NVR 2015, NEC) (13.Tachibanaki S.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14044-14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Measurements of activation of Tr and cone PDE activity were also carried out in complete darkness. Animals were cared for according to the institutional guidelines (approval number, FBS-14-005). The content of visual pigment in purified rods and cones was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (15.Tachibanaki S. Arinobu D. Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Highly effective phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7 of light-activated visual pigment in cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In both of our rod or cone membranes used in this study, GRK and Tr levels were similar to those in the membranes we usually use for biochemical measurements of reactions in the phototransduction cascade, and no detectable protein elution from these membranes was observed in the presence of arrestins and ATP in the dark. All carp arrestins, including rod arrestins, rArr1 (AB794063) and rArr2 (AB794064), and cone arrestins, cArr1 (AB794065) and cArr2 (AB794066), were obtained from carp retinal cDNA library (16.Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Aman Y. Tachibanaki S. Kawamura S. Isolation and characterization of visual pigment kinase-related genes in carp retina: polyphyly in GRK1 subtypes, GRK1A and 1B.Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 1220-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the coding regions of carp rod arrestins, rArr1 or rArr2, was cloned into the NcoI/XhoI sites in pET-16b (Novagen). Each of the coding regions of carp cone arrestins, cArr1 or cArr2, was cloned into the NcoI/XhoI or NcoI/BamHI sites in pTrcHisC (Invitrogen). These recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Expression and purification of arrestins were carried out based on the method described previously (17.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Arrestin: mutagenesis, expression, purification, and functional characterization.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells expressing recombinant arrestins were collected and sonicated in Tris/EGTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, pH 8.0). Rod arrestins, rArr1 and rArr2, were obtained in the soluble fraction, and cone arrestins, cArr1 and cArr2, were mainly found in the insoluble inclusion bodies. Rod arrestins in soluble fractions were first roughly purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation and further purified by heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The fractions containing rod arrestins were mainly eluted at 350 mm NaCl in column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0–500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Cone arrestins in insoluble fractions were solubilized with Tris/EGTA buffer containing 8 m urea, dialyzed against column buffer devoid of NaCl, and then purified by the heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing cone arrestins were eluted at 350 mm NaCl in column buffer. Further purification by Q-Sepharose fast flow column (GE Healthcare) was carried out when necessary. Fractions containing each arrestin were concentrated and buffer-exchanged to potassium gluconate buffer (K-gluc buffer: 115 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) using Vivaspin 20 (GE Healthcare). Recombinant arrestins were used in our biochemical study. In our control studies using endogenous arrestins obtained from purified rods and cones, rod (rArr1 and rArr2) and cone (mainly cArr2) arrestins showed transient binding to rod and cone membranes, respectively, in the absence of visual pigment phosphorylation as our recombinant rod and cone arrestins do (see under “Results”), which indicated that our recombinant arrestins are physiologically functional. The amount of purified recombinant arrestin was quantified with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as a molar standard. Partial sequences of rArr1, rArr2, cArr1, and cArr2 genes corresponding to amino acid residues 353–385, 353–390, 66–102, and 68–110, respectively, were inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI sites in pGEX 5 X-1 vectors (Invitrogen). N-terminal GST fusion peptides of arrestins coded by these vectors were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified using a glutathione resin column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mice were immunized with these partial peptides to raise anti-rArr1, anti-rArr2, anti-cArr1, and anti-cArr2 antiserum. The antisera obtained from anti-rArr1 and anti-rArr2 were slightly cross-reactive with each other. Cross-reactivities between anti-rArr1 and anti-rArr2 antiserum were removed by absorption with recombinant rArr2 and rArr1, respectively. Carp were light-adapted for 3 h before the retinas were removed. The retinas dissected in the light were immediately immersed in 100 mm phosphate buffer (PB: 19 mm NaH2PO4, 81 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 5% (w/v) sucrose and 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and fixed at 4 °C for 2 days (16.Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Aman Y. Tachibanaki S. Kawamura S. Isolation and characterization of visual pigment kinase-related genes in carp retina: polyphyly in GRK1 subtypes, GRK1A and 1B.Mol. Vis. 2005; 11: 1220-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Then they were embedded in 33% (w/v) OCT compound (Sakura Finetec) diluted with PB containing 20% (w/v) sucrose. The 6-μm-thick cryosections were mounted on aminopropylsilane-coated slides and preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum at 25 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS three times, retinas were incubated with mouse anti-rArr1, anti-rArr2, anti-cArr1, or anti-cArr2 antiserum (all at 1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Each type of cone was labeled with specific antiserum raised in rabbit as follows: anti-red/green-sensitive cone opsin antiserum raised against a peptide of CSTSKTEVSSVAPA in red-sensitive cone opsin (AB055656.1); green-sensitive cone opsin1 and -2 (AB110602.2 and AB110603.1, respectively) (1:2000 dilution); anti-blue-sensitive cone opsin antiserum against a peptide of CKQIPEFHEDF in blue-sensitive opsin (AB113668.1) (1:1000 dilution); and anti-UV-sensitive cone opsin antiserum against a peptide of CGYAEDTNKDYR in UV-sensitive opsin (AB113669.1) (1:500 dilution). (Our anti-red/green-sensitive cone opsin antiserum reacts to both red- and green-sensitive cone opsins.) Immunoreactivities against arrestins were detected by anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, and those against rod or cone pigments were detected by anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Texas Red (Vector Laboratories). To determine the expression level of each arrestin in carp rods and cones, we quantified spectrophotometrically the total content of rod pigment and red-sensitive cone pigment in a retinal homogenate. In carp retina, rods are more abundant than cones by ∼50 times (13.Tachibanaki S. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Low amplification and fast visual pigment phosphorylation as mechanisms characterizing cone photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14044-14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), so the visual pigment is mostly rod pigment in a retinal homogenate. In an aliquot of a homogenate, first we spectrophotometrically measured the content of red-sensitive cone pigment with bleaching by >660 nm light (15.Tachibanaki S. Arinobu D. Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Highly effective phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7 of light-activated visual pigment in cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). From our previous estimation of the ratio of the amount of each cone pigment-type (red/green/blue/UV-sensitive pigment = 3:1:1:negligible, see Ref. 13.Tachibanaki S. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Low amplification and fast visual pigment phosphorylation as mechanisms characterizing cone photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14044-14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we estimated the content of green- and blue-sensitive cone pigment in the homogenate. Then, in the same aliquot, we measured the content of rod pigment with bleaching by >420 nm light. Each arrestin subtype was quantified in this homogenate with quantitative immunoblot analysis as described (15.Tachibanaki S. Arinobu D. Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Tsushima S. Kawamura S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this way, we obtained the ratio of the amount of each arrestin to that of the co-localized pigment. Because visual pigment concentration in the OS is assumed to be 3 mm in both rods and cones in general (18.Hárosi F.I. Absorption spectra and linear dichroism of some amphibian photoreceptors.J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 357-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the ratio obtained above gives us the maximum concentration of arrestin in the OS in case that arrestin, which distributes throughout the cell in the dark, all moves to the OS in a light-dependent manner. In this study, the concentration of each arrestin in the OS in rods and cones in the dark was determined to understand the function of arrestin after a light flash given in the dark. Our purified rod or cone consists of the OS and the inner segment (IS) (for example, see Fig. 2, B and C), and arrestin is present in both the OS and the IS. In this section and below, we call our purified rods and cones OS-IS rods and OS-IS cones to help with understanding the procedure of quantification of arrestin in the OS. First, in a preparation of OS-IS rods or OS-IS cones, the total amount of each arrestin was determined with quantitative immunoblot analysis, and also the amount of each visual pigment was quantified spectrophotometrically (15.Tachibanaki S. Arinobu D. Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Highly effective phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7 of light-activated visual pigment in cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Then the fraction of arrestin present in the OS in a single isolated dark-adapted OS-IS cell prepared separately was immunofluorescently quantified (see below). Because the total amount of each arrestin in the preparation of OS-IS rods or cones is known from the above, this immunofluorescently determined fraction gives us the amount of each arrestin in the OS of the OS-IS rods or OS-IS cones. Because visual pigment is present exclusively in the OS and its concentration is assumed to be 3 mm (18.Hárosi F.I. Absorption spectra and linear dichroism of some amphibian photoreceptors.J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 357-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we can estimate the concentration of each arrestin in the OS in the dark from the ratio of the amount of arrestin in the OS to that of visual pigment. Immunofluorescent staining of OS-IS rods and cones was performed as described (19.Arinobu D. Tachibanaki S. Kawamura S. Larger inhibition of visual pigment kinase in cones than in rods.J. Neurochem. 2010; 115: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Carp rods and cones were obtained in the dark with a simplified purification method by using a stepwise Percoll density gradient consisting of 30 and 90% Percoll in the presence of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Both cells were obtained at the interface between the layers of 30 and 90% Percoll. The cells were washed twice with carp Ringer's solution (119.9 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaHCO3, 16 mm glucose, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and then incubated in the same buffer at 4 °C for 12 h in the dark. Then they were mounted on an aminopropylsilane-coated slide glass. Mounted OS-IS rods were permeabilized with 0.01% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and mounted OS-IS cones with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Normal goat serum was added in the permeabilization process to reduce nonspecific absorption of antiserum. After washing with PBS three times, OS-IS rods were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-rArr1 or anti-rArr2 antiserum (both at 1:1000 dilution). OS-IS cones were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-blue-sensitive cone opsin antiserum (1:1000 dilution) plus anti-cArr1 (1:200 dilution), anti-UV-sensitive cone opsin antiserum (1:1000 dilution) plus anti-cArr1 (1:200 dilution), or anti-red/green cone opsin antiserum (1:1000 dilution) plus anti-cArr2 (1:200 dilution). OS-IS rods and cones were then washed with PBS three times and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate to detect arrestin, and with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Texas Red to detect cone pigment subtype. Immunofluorescent signals of arrestins in the OS relative to those in an entire OS-IS cell were quantified to estimate the relative content of an arrestin in the OS in an OS-IS rod or OS-IS cone. In this quantification, signal intensity in each part (entire cell, the OS, or the IS) in an immunofluorescent image was quantified using ImageGauge software (version 4.0, Fuji Film). The amount of Tr* formed was quantified by measuring the amount of GTPγS bound to Tr with a filter binding assay as described previously (20.Tachibanaki S. Yonetsu S. Fukaya S. Koshitani Y. Kawamura S. Low activation and fast inactivation of transducin in carp cones.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41186-41194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rod or cone membranes suspended in K-gluc buffer were preincubated for 30 s in 15 μl of a reaction mixture containing 1 μm visual pigment, 0–60 μm recombinant arrestin or ovalbumin, 100 μm [35S]GTPγS, 100 μm GDP, 0.8 mm EGTA, 10 mm UDP, and when necessary 1 mm ATP. When the effect of arrestin was examined, ovalbumin was used as a control protein. We examined several proteins as a control, and all of them affected the GTPγS binding to Tr to some extent. Among them, ovalbumin was the most ineffective protein, although it inhibited the GTPγS binding to ∼90% of the binding observed in the absence of added proteins. Our rod and cone membrane preparations contain membranes derived from the IS of rods and cones, respectively. Because the size of the IS is larger than that of the OS in our purified cones, metabolic enzyme activities such as ATPase and GTP synthetase are contained. In this case, GDP added to inhibit the nonspecific binding of GTPγS (21.Koshitani Y. Tachibanaki S. Kawamura S. Quantitative aspects of cGMP phosphodiesterase activation in carp rods and cones.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2651-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) can be regenerated to GTP with hydrolysis of ATP when it is present. The product, GTP, is utilized to activate Tr. In this case, in our [35S]GTPγS binding assay we cannot measure the amount of Tr* correctly. For this reason, UDP was added to inhibit GTP synthesis (22.Kimura N. Shimada N. GDP does not mediate but rather inhibits hormonal signal to adenylate cyclase.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2278-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced by added ATP and GDP. UDP also partially inhibited the rate of activation of Tr in rod and cone membranes probably by competitive inhibition with GTPγS, but the maximum binding of GTPγS was unaffected both in rod and cone membranes. After the reaction mixture was illuminated with a light flash bleaching 0.03 and 0.3% of visual pigment in rod and cone membranes, respectively, GTPγS binding time course was measured. To examine the dose dependence of the suppression by an arrestin subtype on Tr activation, light flashes bleaching 0.02 and 1.2% of visual pigment in rod and cone membranes, respectively, were used. The flash intensities in this study were determined to activate similar amounts of Tr* (∼65% of total Tr) in rod and cone membranes; due to a lower production rate of Tr* and shorter lifetimes of R* in cones than in rods, cones require much more intense light than rods to produce a similar amount of Tr* (21.Koshitani Y. Tachibanaki S. Kawamura S. Quantitative aspects of cGMP phosphodiesterase activation in carp rods and cones.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2651-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The binding of [35S]GTPγS was terminated at various time intervals after a light flash by adding 10–20 times volume of a quench solution, K-gluc buffer containing 50 mm NH2OH and 25 mm cold GTP, to the reaction mixture. The timing of addition was strictly controlled using a rapid-quench apparatus (15.Tachibanaki S. Arinobu D. Shimauchi-Matsukawa Y. Tsushima S. Kawamura S. Highly effective phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7 of light-activated visual pigment in cones.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of Tr* produced by a light flash, GTPγS binding in the dark was subtracted. All measurements were carried out at 20 °C throughout. Binding of arrestin to rod or cone membranes was measured based on a binding assay method described previously (23.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Cell-free expression of visual arrestin. Truncation mutagenesis identifies multiple domains involved in rhodopsin interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the study in rod membranes, the membranes were incubated for 10 min in the dark or under bright illumination at room temperature in 40 μl of K-gluc buffer containing 0.625 μm visual pigment, 0.625 mm GTP, and 0.95 mm EGTA in the presence or absence of 1.25 mm ATP, and then 10 μl of K-gluc buffer containing 1 μm arrestin was added. After 2 min of incubation in the dark or light, the membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 124,000 × g for 10 min. The amount of arrestin in the precipitate was quantified by quantitative immunoblot analysis. To estimate nonspecific arrestin binding to rod membranes, liposomes were prepared with lipids extracted from rod membranes with the Bligh and Dyer extraction method (24.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42799) Google Scholar), and arrestin binding to the liposomes containing equivalent amounts of phospholipids in the rod membrane samples (5 nmol of phospholipids) was measured and subtracted. Binding to control liposomes was 0.01–0.02 molecules of arrestin per pigment present when the binding was estimated in terms of per pigment present in rod membranes. Quantification of phospholipids was made as reported previously (25.Morrison W.R. A fast, simple, and reliable method for the microdetermination of phosphorus in biological materials.Anal. Biochem. 1964; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The binding of arrestin to cone membran"

However, the regulation of this enzyme, which is necessary to avoid futile competition between synthesis and degradation, is not understood. Recently, we provided evidence that the efflux of the substrate molecules from the bilayer is the rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of GPLs by some secretory (nonhomeostatic) PLAs. To study whether this is the case with iPLAβ as well, a mass spectrometric assay was employed to determine the rate of hydrolysis of multiple saturated and unsaturated GPL species in parallel using micelles or vesicle bilayers as the macrosubstrate. With micelles, the hydrolysis decreased with increasing acyl chain length independent of unsaturation, and modest discrimination between acyl positional isomers was observed, presumably due to the differences in the structure of the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl-binding sites of the protein. In striking contrast, no significant discrimination between positional isomers was observed with bilayers, and the rate of hydrolysis decreased with the acyl chain length logarithmically and far more than with micelles. These data provide compelling evidence that efflux of the substrate molecule from the bilayer, which also decreases monotonously with acyl chain length, is the rate-determining step in iPLAβ-mediated hydrolysis of GPLs in membranes.

Particularly compelling evidence for this comes from studies in which the synthesis of a GPL class was boosted by overexpression of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme. For instance, overexpression of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in HeLa cells increased PC synthesis by 4–5-fold, but the PC content of the cells did not increase significantly. Instead, a marked increase of glycerophosphocholine, a deacylation product of PC, was detected in the cells and also the medium (4Baburina I. Jackowski S. Cellular responses to excess phospholipid.J.

Overexpression of rat liver CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase accelerates phosphatidylcholine synthesis and degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forcing the synthesis of PE or PS also did not significantly increase the cellular content of these GPLs, but rather it increased their degradation mediated by PLAs (11Lykidis A. Wang J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, when the synthesis of a GPL is inhibited, its degradation decreases in proportion, thus maintaining GPL homeostasis. For example, when the synthesis of PE was inhibited by mutating the rate-limiting enzyme ethanolamine phosphotransferase, the PE content of the cells did not decrease due to reduced degradation (13Polokoff M.A. Wing D.C. Raetz C.R. Isolation of somatic cell mutants defective in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7687-7690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In CHO mutants with a partially inactive choline kinase-α, the rate of PC synthesis was reduced 4-fold, but the PC content was normal (14Nishijima M. Kuge O. Maeda M. Nakano A. Akamatsu Y.

Collectively, those data demonstrate that in mammalian cells GPL synthesis and degradation are strictly coordinated, and they provide strong evidence that the cells contain homeostatic PLA enzyme(s) that selectively degrade the GPL species that are present in excess. glycerophospholipid phospholipase small unilamellar vesicle large unilamellar vesicle lysophosphatidylcholine Ca2+-independent phospholipase A sphingomyelin bromoenol lactone sn-1–16:0/ sn-2-Cn-phosphatidylcholine (n = 6–24) sn-1-Cn/sn-2–16:0-phosphatidylcholine (n = 6–24) phosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidic acid phosphatidylglycerol selective reaction monitoring.

However, select members of the Ca2+-independent PLA (iPLA) subfamily, particularly iPLAβ and iPLAδ, have been implicated in this process (17Balsinde J.

Acta. 2005; 1736: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For instance, it was shown that the activity of iPLAβ increased 2-fold in CHO cells when PC synthesis was boosted by overexpressing CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (5Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Regulation of phosphatidylcholine homeostasis by calcium-independent phospholipase A2.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and that treatment of cells with bromoenol lactone, an inhibitor of iPLAβ, suppressed PC degradation (4Baburina I. Jackowski S. Cellular responses to excess phospholipid.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently found that knockdown of iPLAβ in HeLa cells markedly inhibits the turnover of the major GPL classes as studied by heavy isotope-labeled precursors. 3M. Hermansson, S. M. Hänninen, K. Hokynar, and P. Somerharju, unpublished data. Notably, for efficient homeostasis, the catalytic activity of iPLAβ should be regulated, because an alteration in its expression is obviously too slow to avoid energy-wasting compositional fluctuations (21Somerharju P. Virtanen J.A. Cheng K.H. Hermansson M. The superlattice model of lateral organization of membranes and its implications on membrane lipid homeostasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In essence this means that iPLAβ must be able to sense the GPL composition of a membrane to “know” whether a particular GPL is present in excess or not. Although the activity of iPLAβ might be regulated indirectly, i.e. by other homeostatic proteins (22Ben-Tekaya H. Kahn R.A. Hauri H.P. ADP ribosylation factors 1 and 4 and group VIA phospholipase A(2) regulate morphology and intraorganellar traffic in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 4130-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that such a regulation plays a role in GPL homeostasis. Thus, the simplest and the most attractive model is that the membrane GPL composition directly modulates the activity of this enzyme, like it regulates the activity of biosynthetic enzymes such as CT (23Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B.

Nishijima M. Control of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis through phosphatidylserine-mediated inhibition of phosphatidylserine synthase I in Chinese hamster ovary cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. Control of phosphatidylserine synthase II activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23844-23849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, we have recently provided evidence that the activity of some secretory, nonhomeostatic PLAs correlates with the upward movement of the GPL substrate from the membrane bilayer (efflux propensity) (27Haimi P. Hermansson M. Batchu K.C. Virtanen J.A. Somerharju P. Substrate efflux propensity plays a key role in the specificity of secretory A-type phospholipases.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This finding is intriguing, because efflux propensity has been predicted to change abruptly at particular membrane GPL compositions (21Somerharju P. Virtanen J.A. Cheng K.H. Hermansson M. The superlattice model of lateral organization of membranes and its implications on membrane lipid homeostasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To study whether substrate efflux propensity regulates the activity of the homeostatic iPLAβ as well, we employed a high throughput mass spectrometry-based assay that allowed us to study the hydrolysis of numerous GPL species simultaneously. The key result is that, when using vesicle bilayers as the macrosubstrate, the rate of iPLAβ-mediated hydrolysis decreased strongly and monotonously with increasing substrate hydrophobicity, thus strongly suggesting that the activity of iPLAβ is by and large determined by the ease of efflux of its substrate from the bilayer. Because efflux of a GPL is predicted to increase strongly when it is present in excess (i.e. over its optimal concentration), these data strongly support the role of iPLAβ in GPL homeostasis of mammalian cells. l-α-1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-[1-14C]PC (58 μCi/μmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and unlabeled GPLs, lyso-PCs, and sphingomyelins (SM) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and d3-methyl iodide was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA).

The sn-1–16:0/sn-2-Cn-PC and sn-1-Cn/sn-2–16:0-PC species were synthesized by acylating sn-1–16:0-LPC with the anhydride of a Cn-fatty acid or sn-1-Cn-LPC with the anhydride of 16:0-fatty acid, respectively. d9-Labeled PC species were synthesized from their corresponding phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) by methylation with d3-methyl iodide as described earlier (28Patel K.M.

The product was digested with KpnI and AgeI and ligated into the pMT expression vector (Invitrogen) that contains the Drosophila metallothionein-inducible promoter and a C-terminal His6 tag. Next, the sequence coding for a C-terminal His10 tag was appended to the iPLAβ sequence by PCR using pMT-iPLAβ-His6 as template. The forward primer was 5′-GTCGGTCCGCCACCATGCAGTTCTTTGGCCGC-3′ containing the RsrII cleavage site, and the reverse was 5′-CTGGTACCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGATGATGTTCGAAACGACCTTCGATGGGTGAGAGCAGCAGCT-3′ containing the BstBI and KpnI cleavage sites. The RsrII- and KpnI-digested PCR product was ligated into pFastBac1-vector (pFB1, Gibco Life Technologies) resulting in pFB1-iPLAβ-His10. Replacing the BstBI-KpnI fragment of pFB1-iPLAβ-His10 by the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-CGAATGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTCGAGAAAGGAGGAGGAAGCGGAGGAGGAAGCGGAGGAGGAAGCTGGAGCCACCCGCAGTTTGAAAAATAGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CTATTTTTAAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAGCTTCCTCCTCCGCTTCCTCCTCCGCTTCCTCTCCTTTCTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCATT-3′ resulted in the pFB1-iPLAβ-Strep vector. The inserted sequences and the reading frames of the constructs were verified by sequencing. The Bac-to-Bac baculoviral expression system (Gibco Life Technologies) was then utilized for bacmid preparation and CellFectin-mediated transfection of Sf9 cells to produce the recombinant baculovirus. To express the iPLAβ-StrepIII protein, Sf9 cell suspension (500 ml, ∼106 cells/ml) was infected with the recombinant baculovirus at the multiplicity of 1. After incubation for 72 h at 26 °C, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 50 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were then lysed by sonication (six times for 1 min with 30-s intervals, 40% duty cycle) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h to pellet the membranes. The supernatant was collected and poured into a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) containing buffer W (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) equilibrated Strep-Tactin Superflow resin. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of buffer W, and iPLAβ-StrepIII was eluted five times with 1 ml of buffer E (= buffer W + 2.5 mm desthiobiotin). To prepare tag-free iPLAβ, the Strep-Tactin column fractions with high PLA activity were pooled and incubated with the Factor Xa protease (Thermo Scientific) at a Factor Xa to protein ratio of 1:100 for 2 h at 20 °C. After inhibiting any further proteolysis with 1 mm PMSF, the sample was applied to a DG-10 desalting column (Bio-Rad) to exchange the incubation buffer for buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The sample was then loaded onto a buffer A-equilibrated HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare) ion-exchange column (1 ml bed volume) coupled to an AKTA-FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The elution was performed with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A at a rate of 1 ml/min with detection at 280 nm. Fractions were pooled based on the elution profile, concentrated on an ultrafiltration device (Amicon Ultra-30k, Millipore), and assayed for PLA activity. The fractions with the highest activity were pooled and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 60% (v/v) glycerol. To assess their iPLAβ content, the transfected cells were pelleted, washed with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA), and left on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 3 min at 800 × g at 4 °C, and 20 μg of supernatant protein was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and treated with 5% defatted dry milk in 50 mm Tris-buffered NaCl (150 mm) containing 0.1% Tween 20. The recombinant iPLAβ was detected with an anti-iPLAβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100 dilution) or a Streptactin HRP-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad, 1:10,000 dilution). After treatment with ECL Plus detection reagent kit (GE Healthcare), the blot was scanned with Starion FLA-9000 image scanner (Fujifilm) and visualized using Image Reader FLA-9000 software. HeLa cells were grown on eight 14-cm dishes until ∼80% confluent (30Kainu V. Hermansson M. Somerharju P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 3676-3687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After rinsing with ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped off and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 3 min. After resuspending in 1 ml of a lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 500 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were broken with a Dounce homogenizer followed by 10 passes through a 27-gauge needle. The intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C to pellet the microsomes. After suspending the microsomes in 1 ml of a buffer constituting 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 m sucrose, any aggregates present were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the microsomes was transferred to a Kimax tube, and lipids were extracted (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and after determination of the GPL content (29Bartlett E.M. Lewis D.H. Spectrophotometric determination of phosphate esters in the presence and absence of orthophosphate.Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the extract was stored at −20 °C. PLA activity of the recombinant iPLAβ was determined using a radioactivity assay. The macrosubstrate was prepared by mixing 10,000 cpm of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-[1-14C]PC, unlabeled 16:0/18:1-PC, and 16:0/18:1-PA (250/25 nmol) in chloroform followed by removal of the solvent under a N2 stream and then under high vacuum for 1 h followed by addition of 0.5 ml of assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100) and vortexing for 2 min at room temperature. To start the reaction, an aliquot of purified iPLAβ was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of 50 μl were removed at intervals and mixed with 2 ml of ice-cold methanol to stop the reaction, and the lipids were extracted according to Ref. 31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, except that 0.1 m HCl was used to maximize lipid recovery. The extract was analyzed on TLC using hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v) as the eluent, and radiolabeled PC, LPC, and fatty acid were detected with Starion FLA-9000 image scanner (FujiFilm), visualized using ImageReader FLA-9000 software, and quantified with the MultiGauge analysis software. A mixture of synthetic GPLs or total microsomal lipids, 16:0/18:1-PA and 21:00-SM as an internal standard, were mixed in chloroform and dried under a N2 stream and then under high vacuum for 1 h. Butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mol %) was included as an antioxidant when the mixture contained unsaturated GPLs. To prepare small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), the dried lipids were dissolved in 20 μl of ethanol and injected into 0.5 ml of the assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm ATP) using a constant-speed Hamilton syringe. To prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), lipids dried in a glass tube were overlaid with 1 ml of the assay buffer and placed in a water bath at 4 °C for 1 min and then in a water bath at 50 °C for 1 min. This cooling-heating cycle was repeated four times. The lipid suspension was vortexed for 1 min at room temperature, then extruded 10 times through two stacked 1.2-μm polycarbonate membranes, and then 10 times through two 0.4-μm membranes using the Lipex extruder (Vancouver, Canada) pressurized with argon. The SUV or LUV bilayers were incubated in the presence of purified iPLAβ at 37 °C; 50-μl aliquots were removed at intervals and mixed with 2 ml of ice-cold methanol to stop the reaction. After addition of 0.8 ml of water and 4 ml of chloroform, vortexing, and removal of the upper phase, the lower phase was washed three times with the theoretical upper phase (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and taken to dryness under a N2 stream. The residue was reconstituted in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and stored at −20 °C. To study the hydrolysis in micelles, a lipid mixture was dried as above and dispersed in the assay buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, and the assay was conducted as above. Spontaneous intermembrane translocation of 18:1/18:1 GPLs with varying headgroups was measured as described previously (32Jones J.D. Thompson T.E. Mechanism of spontaneous, concentration-dependent phospholipid transfer between bilayers.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, negatively charged donor vesicles consisting of an equimolar mixture of 18:1/18:1-PC, -PE, -PS, -PG, -PA, -PI (1335 nmol GPL), d9-labeled 22:1/22:1-PC donor marker (15 nmol) + tetra-18:1 cardiolipin (150 nmol), and uncharged acceptor vesicles consisting of 16:0/18:1-PC were both prepared in a buffer constituting 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA by probe sonication in an ice-water bath. The donor and acceptor vesicles (1.5 and 7.5 μmol of total GPL, respectively) were coincubated at 37 °C; aliquots were withdrawn at intervals and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) minicolumn to trap the negatively charged donor vesicles. To quantify the 18:1/18:1 GPLs transferred to the acceptor vesicles (in the flow-through), a standard for each GPL class was added before lipid extraction and mass spectrometric analysis. After addition of NH4OH (4% final concentration), the lipid sample was infused at 6 μl/min to a Micromass Quattro Micro triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated as described previously (33Hermansson M. Uphoff A. Käkelä R. Somerharju P. Automated quantitative analysis of complex lipidomes by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). GPL species were detected using headgroup-specific precursor or neutral-loss scanning (34Heikinheimo L. Somerharju P. Translocation of phosphatidylthreonine and -serine to mitochondria diminishes exponentially with increasing molecular hydrophobicity.Traffic. 2002; 3: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The spectra were exported to Microsoft Excel, and the individual GPL species were quantified using LIMSA software (35Haimi P. Uphoff A. Hermansson M. Somerharju P. Software tools for analysis of mass spectrometric lipidome data.Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 8324-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the individual lipid species were plotted against time, and the relative rate constants of hydrolysis were obtained by fitting a first order exponential decay model to the data. The maximum hydrolyzable fraction at t∞ was constrained to 1.0 with micelles, to 0.67 with SUVs, and"

Results: The energetics and multistep kinetics of the ZPI-protein Z interaction were characterized with fluorescently labeled K239C ZPI. Conclusion: Ionic and hydrophobic interactions mediate ZPI-protein Z binding, and conserved ZPI Lys-239 promotes protein Z dissociation. Significance: The studies establish the thermodynamic and kinetic basis for catalytic activation of ZPI by protein Z. The anticoagulant serpin, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), circulates in blood as a tight complex with its cofactor, protein Z (PZ), enabling it to function as a rapid inhibitor of membrane-associated factor Xa. Here, we show that N,N′-dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-3-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD)-fluorophore-labeled K239C ZPI is a sensitive, moderately perturbing reporter of the ZPI-PZ interaction and utilize the labeled ZPI to characterize in-depth the thermodynamics and kinetics of wild-type and variant ZPI-PZ interactions. NBD-labeled K239C ZPI bound PZ with ∼3 n m KD and ∼400% fluorescence enhancement at physiologic pH and ionic strength. The NBD-ZPI-PZ interaction was markedly sensitive to ionic strength and pH but minimally affected by temperature, consistent with the importance of charged interactions. NBD-ZPI-PZ affinity was reduced ∼5-fold by physiologic calcium levels to resemble NBD-ZPI affinity for γ-carboxyglutamic acid/EGF1-domainless PZ. Competitive binding studies with ZPI variants revealed that in addition to previously identified Asp-293 and Tyr-240 hot spot residues, Met-71, Asp-74, and Asp-238 made significant contributions to PZ binding, whereas Lys-239 antagonized binding. Rapid kinetic studies indicated a multistep binding mechanism with diffusion-limited association and slow complex dissociation. ZPI complexation with factor Xa or cleavage decreased ZPI-PZ affinity 2–7-fold by increasing the rate of PZ dissociation. A catalytic role for PZ was supported by the correlation between a decreased rate of PZ dissociation from the K239A ZPI-PZ complex and an impaired ability of PZ to catalyze the K239A ZPI-factor Xa reaction. Together, these results reveal the energetic basis of the ZPI-PZ interaction and suggest an important role for ZPI Lys-239 in PZ catalytic action."

One hallmark of cancer is its hyperproliferative nature, which is characterized by uncontrollable DNA synthesis. This feature provides an important focal point for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, ∼20% of all anti-cancer drugs are classified as anti-metabolites that affect DNA synthesis (1.Parker W.B. Enzymology of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in the treatment of cancer.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 2880-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Widely used anti-cancer agents include the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and fludarabine, which target enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerases, that are essential for DNA replication (2.Crawford S. Is it time for a new paradigm for systemic cancer treatment? Lessons from a century of cancer chemotherapy.Front. Pharmacol. 2013; 4: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The basis for their pharmacological effects rely heavily on modifications to the (deoxy)ribose moiety (Fig. 1A) (3.Berdis A.J. DNA polymerases as therapeutic targets.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8253-8260Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these cases, sugar modifications allow the corresponding deoxynucleoside triphosphates to function as non-obligate chain terminators of DNA synthesis, which accounts for much of their anti-cancer activity (4.Tiwari K.N.

However, there are several technological problems associated with easily identifying which transporter(s) is responsible for their uptake. Much of this challenge arises from the existence of two distinct families of nucleoside transporters. These include equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) 2The abbreviations used are: ENTequilibrative nucleoside transporterCNTconcentrative nucleoside transporterPIpropidium iodideNBMPRnitrobenzylthioinosine. and concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs). An additional level of complexity is the number of isoforms in each family. For example, humans possess four different ENT isoforms (designated hENT1–hENT4) and three distinct CNT isoforms (designated hCNT1–hCNT3). Each hENT isoform catalyzes the bidirectional transport of nucleosides following a concentration gradient and displays distinct transport activities for pyrimidine and purine (deoxy) nucleosides (14.Molina-Arcas M.

Because nucleoside transporters play key roles in the uptake of anti-cancer nucleoside analogs, an important goal is to develop chemical entities that can accurately and easily measure their activities at the cellular and organismal level. Most contemporary approaches use isotopically labeled nucleosides to quantify cellular uptake. This reliance has several logistical problems, such as special requirements for synthesis (21.Wiebe L.I. Knaus E.E. Morin K.W. Radiolabelled pyrimidine nucleosides to monitor the expression of HSV-1 thymidine kinase in gene therapy.Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 1065-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the use of discontinuous time-based assays (22.Thampy K.G. Barnes Jr., E.M. Adenosine transport by primary cultures of neurons from chick embryo brain.J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to monitor the influx and/or efflux of a nucleoside. Finally, the use of radiolabeled nucleosides has obvious limitations in measuring nucleoside transport activity and tissue distribution in humans. To combat these deficiencies, we recently developed a metal-containing nucleoside analog, designated Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside, which contains iridium embedded within a bis-cyclometalated scaffold attached to a deoxyriboside (Fig. 1A) (23.Maity A. Choi J.-S. Teets T.S. Deligonul N. Berdis A.J. Gray T.G. Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes with deoxyribose substituents.Chemistry. 2013; 19: 15924-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This cyclometalated complex of iridium(III) was chosen due to its high stability in aqueous environments present in a living cell (24.Patra M. Gasser G. Organometallic compounds: an opportunity for chemical biology?.Chembiochem. 2012; 13: 1232-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, iridium complexes are high yielding phosphorescent compounds that can be rationally tuned to emit visible light across a range of wavelengths (25.Shavaleev N.M. Monti F. Costa R.D. Scopelliti R. Bolink H.J. Ortí E. Accorsi G. Armaroli N. Baranoff E. Grätzel M. Nazeeruddin M.K. Bright blue phosphorescence from cationic bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) isocyanide complexes.Inorg. Chem. 2012; 51: 2263-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At face value, the size of the iridium complex attached to the deoxyribose moiety appears to be very large and would prohibit its utilization as a substrate for any nucleoside transporter. However, modeling studies provided in Fig. 1B demonstrate that the three-dimensional structure of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside is compact and spherical, possessing an overall volume (596.3 A3) that is only ∼2.5-fold larger than deoxyadenosine (228.5 A3). Based on these features, the goal here is to further establish that Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside functions as a bona fide substrate for a nucleoside transporter. Here we provide further biochemical evidence that this novel metal-containing nucleoside indeed enters cells and displays both therapeutic and diagnostic activity against cancer cells. Cell-based studies demonstrate that Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside produces cytotoxic effects against an adherent cancer cell line, KB3-1. In addition, the metal-containing nucleoside rapidly enters cells primarily through the activity of a specific nucleoside transporter, hENT1. Co-localization and cell fractionation studies demonstrate that Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside accumulates in the nucleus and mitochondria of cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The localization of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside in these organelles coincides with their ability to produce anti-cancer effects by affecting DNA synthesis and the stability of mitochondria. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. KB3-1 and KB-V1 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Michael Gottesman (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and dermal fibroblast cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), antibiotic and antifungal agents, amphotericin, propidium iodide, PrestoBlue, DAPI, Alexa Fluor 588, and an apoptosis assay kit containing Alexa Fluor 488-labeled annexin V that is used for cell culture studies were from Invitrogen. l-Mimosine was purchased from MP BioMedicals, LLC. Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside was synthesized and purified as described previously (23.Maity A. Choi J.-S. Teets T.S. Deligonul N. Berdis A.J. Gray T.G. Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes with deoxyribose substituents.Chemistry. 2013; 19: 15924-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified air and 5% CO2. The epidermal carcinoma cell line KB3-1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (USA Scientific), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 μg/ml gentamycin. The doubling time was ∼24 h. KB-V1 cells were grown and maintained under the same conditions with the addition of 100 nm vinblastine. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultivated using vascular cell basal medium supplemented with an endothelial cell growth kit containing VEGF (ATCC). Dermal fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) with 10% fetal bovine serum (USA Scientific), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 μg/ml gentamycin. The cytotoxicity of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside was quantified using a PrestoBlue assay according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and then incubated for 24 h after plating to ensure adhesion. Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside was added to wells in a dose-dependent manner (1–100 μm) and treated for variable time periods (24–72 h). In all cases, the final concentration of the co-solvent, DMSO, was maintained at 0.1%. After the desired end point, the original medium was replaced with 90 μl of fresh medium and 10 μl of PrestoBlue reagent. The fluorescence of each sample was measured using a microplate reader (excitation/emission = 560/590 nm). Raw data were normalized to 100% viability (0.1% DMSO control), and IC50 values were obtained through a fit of the data to Equation 1, y=100%/1+IC50/Compound(Eq. 1) Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) and Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside (10 or 50 μm) for variable time periods (24–72 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 5 μm annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate. Cells were treated with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, followed by flow cytometry analysis. In dual parameter studies, cells treated with PI were also treated with an additional 400 μl of 1× annexin-binding buffer. In either case, cells were analyzed using band pass filters with wavelengths of 525/40 nm and 620/30 nm with a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter XL). For experiments interrogating nuclear morphology, KB3-1 cells were grown overnight in 12-well cell culture dishes using an initial density of 100,000 cells/ml. Cells were then treated with variable concentrations of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside for time periods ranging from 4 to 24 h. Images were obtained using an EVOSfl Advanced microscope using DAPI stain (excitation/emission = 360/447 nm). Detection of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside was achieved using excitation and emission wavelengths of 312 and 510 nm, respectively. Cell cycle analysis using PI staining was performed by treating KB3-1 cells (200,000 cells/ml) with variable concentrations of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside in the presence or absence of NBMPR for time periods varying from 1 to 2 days. After the appropriate time, cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed with 1× PBS. The cells were then fixed with methanol and stored at −20 °C overnight. Cell pellets were dislodged using a 0.5-ml solution of 10 μg/ml PI and 2 mg/ml of RNase A in saponin-based permeabilization and wash buffer and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to flow cytometry analysis. Experiments using l-mimosine to induce cell cycle arrest were performed using similar approaches. In this case, KB3-1 cells were first pretreated for 24 h with 400 μm l-mimosine, a compound that causes cell cycle arrest between late S phase and early G1 phase. Uptake of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside into KB3-1 cells was visualized by microscope imaging. Cells were plated on 35-mm dish glass bottom microwell dishes and preincubated in the absence or presence of NBMPR. After 24 h, cells were co-cultivated with Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside for 1–2 days. At the appropriate times, cells were washed twice with PBS and exposed to fresh medium in the presence of 1 μg/ml DAPI, Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (1:2,000), and/or 10 nm MitoPT-TMRE for up to 15 min. After this time, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed twice more with 1× PBS. Images were obtained using an EVOSfl Advanced microscope. Quantification of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside uptake into KB3-1 cells was performed using a microplate assay as described previously (23.Maity A. Choi J.-S. Teets T.S. Deligonul N. Berdis A.J. Gray T.G. Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes with deoxyribose substituents.Chemistry. 2013; 19: 15924-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated overnight onto 12-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well. The cells were then preincubated with DMSO, NBMPR, or dipyridamole for 24 h prior to treatment with variable concentrations of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside for 1 or 2 days. Cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and then washed twice with 1× PBS. Cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS and then measured using a fluorescence plate reader (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 480 nm). KB3-1 cells were cultured in 6-well culture plates to 60–70% confluence in growth medium without antibiotics. After washing with PBS, cells were treated with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) containing targeting hENT1 siRNA (s4694, Ambion, Foster City, CA) at a final concentration of 125 pmol in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The sense and antisense siRNA oligonucleotides used to generate siRNA sequence specifically targeting hENT1 (NM_001078174) are as follows: 5′-AUCGUGCUCAUUAAUUCATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UGAAUUAAUGAGCACGAUCTT-3′ (antisense). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator for 6 h. After changing growth medium, cells were treated with variable concentrations of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside. At 24 h post-treatment, cells were harvested, and lysates were separated using SDS-PAGE. Western blotting of antibodies specific for hENT1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-actin (mouse monoclonal IgG) were detected using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Western blots were developed using the chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate for detection (Lumi-light Western blotting substrate, Roche Applied Science). Sample preparation was performed using the Abcam cell fractionation kit (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and protocols established by the manufacturer. Briefly, KB3-1 cells were harvested and washed in buffer A (supplied by manufacturer). Cell density was measured via manual counting using trypan blue staining and a hematocytometer. 50 μl of buffer B (supplied by the manufacturer) was added to the cell suspension, and the solution was incubated for 7 min on a shaker with gentle agitation at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was transferred to a fresh tube for subsequent quantitative analyses. Enrichment of mitochondria was similarly performed by resuspending the aforementioned cell pellet in 50 μl of buffer C (supplied by the manufacturer). This solution was incubated for 10 min on a shaker with gentle agitation at room temperature and then centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature. The supernatant containing the mitochondrial fraction was transferred to a fresh tube for subsequent analyses. Enrichment of the nuclear fraction was accomplished by resuspending the cell pellet in 50 μl of buffer D (supplied by the manufacturer). The solution was again incubated for 10 min on a shaker with gentle agitation at room temperature and then centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature. The supernatant contains the nuclear fractions. Quantification of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside present in each fraction (cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus) was measured using a fluorescent plate reader (Spectramax M4, Molecular Devices) at the optimal excitation (340 nm) and emission (480 nm) wavelengths as described previously (23.Maity A. Choi J.-S. Teets T.S. Deligonul N. Berdis A.J. Gray T.G. Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes with deoxyribose substituents.Chemistry. 2013; 19: 15924-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ability of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside to produce cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effects was tested against two isogenic human epidermal carcinoma cell lines, KB3-1 (multidrug resistance-negative) and KB-V1 (multidrug resistance-positive). Both types of cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0–100 μm) of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside for time intervals of up to 3 days. At 24-h intervals, cell viability and proliferation were measured using the PrestoBlue assay kit. Cell viability is expressed as the optical density ratio of cells treated with Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside compared with cells treated with 0.1% DMSO. The cytotoxic effects of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside against KB3-1 cells are both time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 2A). The time dependence is evident as the IC50 value of Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside decreases from 56 μm at 24 h to 30 μm after 48 h, and this value further decreases to 15 μm after 72 h post-treatment (Table 1). Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside displays significantly weaker antiproliferative effects against the multidrug resistance-positive cell line, KB-V1 (Fig. 2B). The reduced efficacy against KB-V1 cells suggests that Ir(III)-PPY nucleoside first enters the cell through active transport and is then exported out of the cell by P-glycoprotein activity (26.Hopper-Borge E.

EKLF or KLF1 is a transcription factor that plays an essential role during erythropoiesis (1.Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Defective haematopoiesis in fetal liver resulting from inactivation of the EKLF gene.Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2.Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Lethal β-thalassaemia in mice lacking the erythroid CACCC-transcription factor EKLF.Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Its expression and activity is restricted to the hematopoietic organs in a strictly controlled manner. EKLF plays crucial functions during all important stages of erythropoiesis through a wide variety of mechanisms, which include gene activation and repression, regulation of chromatin configuration, transcriptional initiation, and elongation, as well as localization of gene loci to transcription factories in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 3.Yien Y.Y. Bieker J.J. EKLF/KLF1, a tissue-restricted integrator of transcriptional control, chromatin remodeling, and lineage determination.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). EKLF consists of two domains: an N-terminal proline-rich transactivation domain and a C-terminal highly conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The EKLF binding site motif (5′-CCMCRCCCN-3′) is found in the regulatory regions of many erythroid genes. EKLF activates genes essential for all categories of red blood cell functions including the β-globin, transmembrane, and cytoskeletal protein genes. Heme biosynthesis and blood group antigen activation is also dependent on EKLF. At the later stages of terminal maturation of erythrocytes, EKLF activates genes controlling enucleation and cell cycle exit (reviewed in Ref. 4.Siatecka M. Bieker J.J. The multifunctional role of EKLF/KLF1 during erythropoiesis.Blood. 2011; 118: 2044-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). EKLF function is modulated by post-transcriptional modifications, which leads to various downstream effects, including altered interactions with other proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3.Yien Y.Y. Bieker J.J. EKLF/KLF1, a tissue-restricted integrator of transcriptional control, chromatin remodeling, and lineage determination.Mol.

KLF1 directly coordinates almost all aspects of terminal erythroid differentiation.IUBMB Life. 2010; 62: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although EKLF has been primarily characterized as a transcriptional activator, it can also act as a repressor. It interacts with corepressors Sin3A and components of the NuRD complex (7.Chen X. Bieker J.J. Stage-specific repression by the EKLF transcriptional activator.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10416-10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8.Siatecka M. Xue L. Bieker J.J. Sumoylation of EKLF promotes transcriptional repression and is involved in inhibition of megakaryopoiesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8547-8560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which EKLF mediates transcriptional repression are incompletely understood, but one possibility is that its interaction with or sumoylation by PIAS family proteins might play an important role. Mammalian PIAS family proteins were identified in yeast two-hybrid screens and initially characterized as negative regulators of STAT-mediated signaling (9.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Specific inhibition of Stat3 signal transduction by PIAS3.Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). This family of proteins consists of four members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy. PIAS proteins have a SUMO E3 ligase activity and are implicated in regulation of many transcription factors by promoting protein sumoylation (10.Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. PIAS proteins: pleiotropic interactors associated with SUMO.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11.Schmidt D. Müller S. PIAS/SUMO: new partners in transcriptional regulation.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2561-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar12.Sharrocks A.D. PIAS proteins and transcriptional regulation: more than just SUMO E3 ligases?.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the effect of PIAS proteins on substrate function can also be uncoupled from their SUMO ligase activity; hence, the role of PIAS proteins extends beyond promoting protein sumoylation (12.Sharrocks A.D. PIAS proteins and transcriptional regulation: more than just SUMO E3 ligases?.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PIAS family of proteins can exert regulation of transcription through several mechanisms including blocking the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, recruitment of transcriptional corepressors, coactivators, and sequestration of transcription factors in distinct subcellular or subnuclear compartments (13.Shuai K. Liu B. Regulation of gene-activation pathways by PIAS proteins in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). PIAS1 can also serve as an epigenetic regulator that controls repression of the myeloerythroid program (14.Liu B. Yee K.M. Tahk S. Mackie R. Hsu C. Shuai K. PIAS1 SUMO ligase regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and as an epigenetic modifier critical for T-cell differentiation (15.Liu B. Tahk S. Yee K.M. Fan G. Shuai K. The ligase PIAS1 restricts natural regulatory T cell differentiation by epigenetic repression.Science. 2010; 330: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study we have focused on interactions between EKLF and PIAS family proteins and their outcome for red blood cell development. EKLF coordinates expression of numerous genes during both proliferation and differentiation stages. The timing of their expression is particularly crucial, because some of them have to be appropriately repressed. Currently, the information about transcriptional repression mediated by EKLF is still unsatisfactory. Here, we continue our experiments where we established that PIAS1 serves as a E3 ligase in the process of EKLF sumoylation that was linked to repression during megakaryopoiesis (8.Siatecka M. Xue L. Bieker J.J. Sumoylation of EKLF promotes transcriptional repression and is involved in inhibition of megakaryopoiesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8547-8560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Presently we examine the SUMO-independent negative regulation by PIAS on a subset of EKLF target genes during erythropoiesis. Specifically, we focus our experiments on regulation of β-globin gene expression. Using gain and loss of function experiments, we show an inverse correlation between the amount of PIAS3 in cells and their ability to undergo differentiation and efficient hemoglobinization. We find that PIAS3 represses EKLF activity at the β-globin promoter in the proliferating, undifferentiated stage of erythroid cells that later, in the course of differentiation, is released. Our results support the interaction between EKLF and PIAS3 as a novel mode of regulation of erythroid lineage gene expression. 293T, Cos 7, and MEL 2The abbreviations used are: MELmurine erythroleukemiaZnFzinc fingerAHSPα-hemoglobin stabilizing proteinHDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatin A. cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and K562 cells were maintained in RPMI medium.

K562 cells were used to examine the expression and subcellular localization of the EKLF-GFP fusion along with Flag-tagged PIAS3 WT or PIAS3ΔLXXLL constructs. Cells were cotransfected using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (Life Technologies). After 36 h, cells were cytospun onto slides and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde (in PBS) and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific sites were then blocked by incubation with PBS containing 3% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti-Flag M2 antibodies F3165 (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary Cy3 goat anti-mouse antibodies (catalog no. 115-165-062; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with DAPI. GFP, Cy3, and DAPI cells were visualized on a Leica SP5 DM confocal microscope to identify cell nuclei. Lentiviral vectors containing shRNAs targeting mouse PIAS3 mRNA were purchased from Sigma: NM_018812 protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 MISSION shRNA Plasmid DNA; TRC numbers #1 TRCN0000081998, #5 TRCN0000082002, #6 TRCN0000321624, and #9 TRCN0000321693. Lentiviral supernatants were produced in Phoenix cells by transient transfection with FuGENE 6 (Promega). After 24 h, the medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 4 mm sodium butyrate for an additional 24 h, and the cells were incubated at 32 °C. Lentiviral particles were collected every 24 h for 2 days and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. Transduction of 25 × 104 MEL cells was carried out by spinoculation (1000 × g) for 120 min in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) at 30 °C. After 48 h, the infected MEL cells were subjected to a second round of infection and subsequently to selection by addition of 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). After 4 days, samples were prepared for mRNA and protein analysis. For control experiments, cells were infected either with empty viral vector, vector expressing a scrambled shRNA, or pLKO.3G (Addgene), which contains an enhanced GFP gene. After selection with puromycin for 4 days, the infected cells were resuspended in fresh medium containing 1.8% DMSO for differentiation. Cells were collected at the indicated times for benzidine staining. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (19.Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Kim S.I. Boyer M.E. Imbalzano A.N. Bieker J.J. Bresnick E.H. Chromatin domain activation via GATA-1 utilization of a small subset of dispersed GATA motifs within a broad chromosomal region.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17065-17070Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEL cells were pretreated with 1.8% DMSO for 5 days to induce differentiation followed by cross-linking with 1.0% formaldehyde. Chromatin was sonicated using a Sonics Vibra Cell 500 for ten 40-s pulses at 21% amplitude with 1-min intervals. The antibodies, against mouse IgG (catalog no. 557273; BD Pharmingen), EKLF (catalog no. 61233; Active Motif), and PIAS3 (E-3) (catalog no. sc-48339; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were prebound to Magnetic Protein G Dynabeads (catalog no. 10004D; Life Technologies), and immunoprecipitations were performed with lysates (200 μg) containing fragmented DNA overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated genomic DNA was amplified by PCR with the following primers that span the mouse β-globin major proximal promoter: forward βmaj, GACAAACATTATTAGAGGGAGTACCC; and reverse βmaj, AGGTGCACCATGATGTATGTTTATGG. EKLF undergoes several post-translational modifications that include phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, and we have shown that EKLF is also sumoylated at a single lysine residue (8.Siatecka M. Xue L. Bieker J.J. Sumoylation of EKLF promotes transcriptional repression and is involved in inhibition of megakaryopoiesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8547-8560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). During the course of our experiments, we established that PIAS1 is able to efficiently sumoylate EKLF. However, we also observed that the presence of PIAS1 repressed EKLF transcriptional activity in a SUMO-independent manner. For our present studies, we addressed the biological significance of this observation by performing luciferase reporter gene assays in the human erythroid cell line K562, which expresses little to no endogenous EKLF (23.Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. Role of erythroid Kruppel-like factor in human γ- to β-globin gene switching.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24.Bieker J.J. Isolation, genomic structure, and expression of human erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of K562 cells with the β-globin promoter-luciferase reporter and either WT EKLF or sumoylation-deficient EKLF (EKLF-K74R) expression plasmids resulted in activation of the reporter (Fig. 1A). However, addition of PIAS1 resulted in strong inhibition of activation by either EKLF or the EKLF-K74R mutant (Fig. 1A). This suggests that PIAS1 repression of EKLF activity is independent of its activity as an E3 ligase. This observation was further confirmed by testing other PIAS family members as well, because previously we observed that PIAS3 and PIASy do not function as E3 ligases for EKLF sumoylation (8.Siatecka M. Xue L. Bieker J.J. Sumoylation of EKLF promotes transcriptional repression and is involved in inhibition of megakaryopoiesis.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8547-8560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All three tested PIAS members exhibited a strong repressive activity (Fig. 1B), and this occurs irrespective of their ability to serve as an EKLF SUMO E3 ligase. This repression is dose-dependent as demonstrated for PIAS3 (Fig. 1C), and we used PIAS3 for subsequent experiments to be sure that the repressive and E3 ligase activity of PIAS proteins toward EKLF remains uncoupled. Next, we examined the interaction between exogenous Flag-tagged PIAS3 and EKLF proteins in 293T cells (EKLF null cells) using cotransfection/coimmunoprecipitation assays. First, we used anti-EKLF antibodies (6B3), and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against Flag (Fig. 2A). Flag-PIAS3 was only detected in 293T cells that were cotransfected with both proteins. Second, we observed a similar result by utilizing anti-Flag antibodies for immunoprecipitation and anti-EKLF antibodies to detect precipitated proteins (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that EKLF and PIAS3 do in fact interact in cells. The endogenous interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays using MEL and E13.5 fetal liver cells, where EKLF and PIAS3 are endogenously expressed. In both cases the anti-PIAS3 antibody coprecipitates EKLF (Fig. 2C). We then addressed the importance of the individual domains of both EKLF and PIAS3 for their interaction using coimmunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells. We first analyzed the role of the proline-rich transactivation domain and the zinc finger (ZnF; tagged with GFP) DNA-binding domain from EKLF. After immunoprecipitation of PIAS3 with anti-Flag antibody, we find that both the proline-rich (Fig. 3A) and ZnF (Fig. 3B) domains are able to interact, indicating that regions across the entire EKLF protein are involved in the interaction with PIAS3. Full-length EKLF was used as a positive control (Fig. 3A). PIAS proteins consist of multiple domains: SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS), PINIT, RING finger-like, acidic with the SIM (SUMO interacting motif), and C-terminal serine/threonine rich domains, as depicted in Fig. 3 (10.Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. PIAS proteins: pleiotropic interactors associated with SUMO.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is known that regions of PIAS that are involved in interactions with different transcription factors vary considerably with no obvious hot spots for interactions (13.Shuai K. Liu B. Regulation of gene-activation pathways by PIAS proteins in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested different combinations of domain deletions to determine which domains are involved in interactions with EKLF. The results of several immunoprecipitation assays conducted by cotransfection of EKLF and PIAS3 deletion mutants in 293T cells allowed us to conclude that the middle region of PIAS3, spanning the PINIT and RING domains, contributes to the binding to EKLF (Fig. 3C and data not shown). EKLF is a crucial transcription factor activating expression of many erythroid genes throughout all stages of erythropoiesis. Therefore, we next examined several erythroid genes and tested whether their activation is affected by the presence of PIAS proteins in a similar manner as seen with β-globin gene expression. We utilized luciferase reporter gene assays in K562 cells. We studied a number of luciferase reporters driven by promoters of EKLF target genes. Based on the results, we were able to divide EKLF targets into two groups: a group whose activation is repressed by the presence of PIAS3 and a second group that is superactivated by PIAS3. We classify β-globin and α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) promoters into the first group, because the levels of activation of these reporters are dramatically reduced upon addition of PIAS protein (Fig. 4A). The second group includes p21, p18, and basic Krüppel-like factor 1b (BKLF(1b)) promoters, because they display superactivation over the single effect caused by either of EKLF or PIAS3 alone (Fig. 4B). These data show that not all EKLF target promoters behave equivalently in the presence of the PIAS3 protein. Given the fact that the β-globin promoter is the most well characterized EKLF activation target, we focused on the mechanism of its repression by PIAS3 for the rest of our analyses. After establishing that PIAS3 directly interacts with EKLF, we became interested in exploring its mechanism of repression. We first determined whether PIAS3 blocks the ability of EKLF to bind to DNA, as observed with the STAT3 protein (9.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Specific inhibition of Stat3 signal transduction by PIAS3.Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Protein extracts containing overexpressed PIAS3 or EKLF after transfection of Cos7 cells were generated, and complexes between EKLF and radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide comprising the EKLF binding site from β-globin promoter were resolved by an in vitro gel shift assay (Fig. 5). Specificity of the formed protein-DNA complexes was confirmed using anti-EKLF antibodies, which prevent complex formation. Using these conditions, we tested whether the addition of increasing amounts of extract containing PIAS3 would disrupt the complex formed between EKLF and its cognate DNA-binding site. However, the presence of PIAS3 has no effect on the ability of EKLF to bind DNA (Fig. 5), suggesting that PIAS3 repression of EKLF activation does not involve interference with the DNA binding activity of EKLF. We did not detect any EKLF-PIAS3 supershift in these assays, possibly because the EKLF-PIAS3 complex is not stable under these conditions, similar to PIASy-STAT1 (25.Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. A transcriptional corepressor of Stat1 with an essential LXXLL signature motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PIAS proteins contain a conserved LXXLL motif located in the N-terminal SAP domain (Fig. 6A) that is required for a variety of interactions with other proteins. A number of nuclear receptor coactivators also contain a similar LXXLL motif (26.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. A signature motif in transcriptional co-activators mediates binding to nuclear receptors.Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 27.Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. The transcriptional co-activator p/CIP binds CBP and mediates nuclear-receptor function.Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Furthermore this signature is also implicated in repression, because the motif in PIASy imposes transrepression activity on STAT1 (25.Liu B. Gross M. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. A transcriptional corepressor of Stat1 with an essential LXXLL signature motif.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hen"
https://openalex.org/W1978753089,"The ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) superfamily of DNA-binding proteins is dispersed widely in procaryotes. The dimeric RHH fold is generated by interlocking of two monomers into a 2-fold symmetrical structure that comprises four α-helices enwrapping a pair of antiparallel β-strands (ribbon). Residues in the ribbon region are the principal determinants of DNA binding, whereas the RHH hydrophobic core is assembled from amino acids in both the α-helices and ribbon element. The ParG protein encoded by multiresistance plasmid TP228 is a RHH protein that functions dually as a centromere binding factor during segrosome assembly and as a transcriptional repressor. Here we identify residues in the α-helices of ParG that are critical for DNA segregation and in organization of the protein hydrophobic core. A key hydrophobic aromatic amino acid at one position was functionally substitutable by other aromatic residues, but not by non-aromatic hydrophobic amino acids. Nevertheless, intramolecular suppression of the latter by complementary change of a residue that approaches nearby from the partner monomer fully restored activity in vivo and in vitro. The interactions involved in assembling the ParG core may be highly malleable and suggest that RHH proteins are tractable platforms for the rational design of diverse DNA binding factors useful for synthetic biology and other purposes."
