https://openalex.org/W3020695284,"We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000–5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections."
https://openalex.org/W3018334611,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly on a global scale. Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1–3. Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus. Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two hospitals in Wuhan indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols, although the infectivity of the virus RNA was not established in this study."

This study was conducted to assess the pattern of fuel used for cooking in households as well as to determine the association between the types of fuel used with respect to socio-demographic characteristics and health status of women. A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted between August 2016 and September 2018 in four rural areas and one semi-urban area of Udupi district, Karnataka, India. The study comprised 587 families including 632 women. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the type of fuel as well as self-reported health conditions. Overall, 72.5% of the families used biomass, where 67.2% families were currently using both biomass and liquefied petroleum gas while only biomass was used in 5.3% of the families for cooking. Among women, being ever exposed to biomass fuel was significantly associated with their age, literacy level, occupation and socio-economic status (p < 0.001). Those who were exposed to biomass fuel showed a significant association with self-reported ophthalmic (AOR = 3.85; 95% CI: 1.79–8.29), respiratory (OR = 5.04; 95% CI: 2.52–10.07), cardiovascular (OR = 6.07; 95% CI: 1.88–19.67), dermatological symptoms /conditions (AOR = 3.67; 95% CI: 1.07–12.55) and history of adverse obstetric outcomes (AOR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.08–5.57). A positive trend was observed between cumulative exposure to biomass in hour-years and various self-reported health symptoms/conditions (p < 0.001). It was observed that more than two-thirds of women using biomass fuel for cooking were positively associated with self-reported health symptoms. Further longitudinal studies are essential to determine the level of harmful air pollutants in household environment and its association with various health conditions among women in this region."

Metabolic need drives feeding via the action of peripheral and central signals converging onto brain areas involved in food seeking and consumption (Burnett et al., 2016Burnett C.J. Li C. Webber E.

For example, periods of caloric deficit can drive compensatory eating through the release of hormones, including leptin and insulin, recruiting mesolimbic and hypothalamic brain circuitry (Hambly and Speakman, 2015Hambly C.

This physiological response ensures the refill of energy stores, but it can lead to difficulties in sustaining reductions in body weight following diets based solely on caloric restriction or fasting (Hall and Kahan, 2018Hall K.D.

Conversely, eating can occur in the absence of immediate metabolic need, such as when faced with highly palatable and energy-dense foods. With these foods readily available in many societies, eating despite satiety is considered a key factor underlying weight gain and obesity (Berridge, 2009Berridge K.C. ‘Liking’ and ‘wanting’ food rewards: brain substrates and roles in eating disorders.Physiol.

The current means to limit excess feeding and obesity are few and often fail to support the long-term maintenance of reduced body weight (Hall and Kahan, 2018Hall K.D. Kahan S.

Thus, a better understanding of mechanisms that regulate brain circuits involved in eating and overeating will be crucial to identify novel treatments. Hypothalamic nuclei are well described for their role in feeding regulation and energy homeostasis (Varela and Horvath, 2012Varela L. Horvath T.L.

The lateral hypothalamic area (LH) controls food intake via the activity of a heterogeneous cell population expressing orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides and classical neurotransmitters (Arrigoni et al., 2019Arrigoni E.

For example, LH neurons expressing either γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glutamatergic markers have been found to support or suppress food intake, respectively (Jennings et al., 2013Jennings J.H.

A major source of inhibitory control over LH arises from medium spiny neurons that express the dopamine D1 receptor (D1-MSNs) and whose cell bodies are located in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) (O’Connor et al., 2015O’Connor E.C.

Acute inhibition of NAcSh activity, achieved by the blockade of glutamate transmission or the stimulation of GABAA receptors elicits robust food intake (Maldonado-Irizarry et al., 1995Maldonado-Irizarry C.S.

Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated in part via a disinhibition of LH (Stratford and Kelley, 1999Stratford T.R. Kelley A.E.

Consistent with these pharmacological manipulations, it is found through in vivo electrophysiological recordings that accumbal D1-MSN activity is reduced during feeding (Krause et al., 2010Krause M. German P.W. Taha S.A. Fields H.L. A pause in nucleus accumbens neuron firing is required to initiate and maintain feeding.J.

Accumbal D1R Neurons Projecting to Lateral Hypothalamus Authorize Feeding.Neuron. 2015; 88: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and brief electrical stimulation of NAcSh or optogenetic activation of D1-MSN projections to LH is sufficient to abruptly stop food intake (O’Connor et al., 2015O’Connor E.C.

These findings support a model in which the reduced activity of NAcSh D1-MSNs disinhibits LH neurons to authorize food intake (O’Connor et al., 2015O’Connor E.C. Kremer Y. Lefort S. Harada M. Pascoli V. Rohner C. Lüscher C. Accumbal D1R Neurons Projecting to Lateral Hypothalamus Authorize Feeding.Neuron. 2015; 88: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). While the moment-to-moment control over food intake mediated by the activity of NAcSh D1-MSN-to-LH projections is relatively well established, little is known about long-lasting adaptive changes. An appealing hypothesis would be the contribution of synaptic plasticity in this circuit. Plasticity mechanisms could provide a powerful way to regulate feeding over a longer timescale wherein reduced synaptic strength of the NAcSh-to-LH pathway would be predicted to promote food intake, while, conversely, increased synaptic strength would tightly constrain feeding. Synaptic plasticity of inhibitory transmission at accumbal D1-MSN projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral pallidum (VP) have been described (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C.Y. House D.R.C. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C. Cocaine disinhibits dopamine neurons by potentiation of GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area.Science. 2013; 341: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Creed et al., 2016Creed M.

Convergence of Reinforcing and Anhedonic Cocaine Effects in the Ventral Pallidum.Neuron. 2016; 92: 214-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but whether this plasticity is also present at the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse is not known. Notably, a prior study reported the persistent reduction of feeding after deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the NAcSh, together with a decreased firing rate of LH neurons (Wei et al., 2015Wei N. Wang Y. Wang X. He Z. Zhang M. Zhang X. Pan Y. Zhang J. Qin Z. Zhang K. The different effects of high-frequency stimulation of the nucleus accumbens shell and core on food consumption are possibly associated with different neural responses in the lateral hypothalamic area.Neuroscience. 2015; 301: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), suggesting that long-term changes in synaptic transmission in the NAcSh-to-LH pathway had occurred. We therefore sought to characterize plasticity at NAcSh-to-LH synapses and understand its relevance for feeding control. Herein, synaptic transmission was assessed using electrophysiological recordings in ex vivo brain slices of mice, taking advantage of optogenetic and genetic tools to stimulate and record from identified NAcSh and LH neuronal populations. Unlike D1-MSN-to-VP or -VTA synapses (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C.Y. House D.R.C. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C.

Convergence of Reinforcing and Anhedonic Cocaine Effects in the Ventral Pallidum.Neuron. 2016; 92: 214-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), inhibitory plasticity induced by high-frequency stimulation or adenylyl cyclase activation at D1-MSN-to-LH synapses was absent in naive ad libitum-fed animals. Neural tracing studies identified D1-MSN-to-LH projections as largely non-overlapping with D1-MSN-to-VP or -VTA projections, providing an anatomical basis for this observation. Instead, after manipulations leading to increased feeding (i.e., acute food deprivation, exposure to high-calorie food), adenylyl cyclase activation caused the potentiation of inhibitory transmission at this synapse, revealing a depression during overeating. Endocannabinoid signaling was identified as the mechanism underlying the depression in synaptic transmission, as the blockade of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) was sufficient to prevent compensatory feeding following acute food restriction, weight gain following high-fat diet exposure, and the associated plasticity. Conversely, CB1R activation induced an inhibitory depression at D1-MSN-to-LH synapses in ad libitum-fed animals and was sufficient to increase feeding in this condition when infused locally into LH. Finally, in vivo high-frequency stimulation of D1-MSN terminals in the LH reduced consumption in food-restricted mice. Our results support a model in which increased feeding is promoted through endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic depression of accumbal D1-MSN-to-LH synapses. In naive mice, accumbal D1-MSN-to-VP and -VTA synapses undergo a form of inhibitory long-term potentiation (i-LTP) in response to the activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (FSK; Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C.Y. House D.R.C. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C.

Convergence of Reinforcing and Anhedonic Cocaine Effects in the Ventral Pallidum.Neuron. 2016; 92: 214-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We assessed whether NAcSh D1-MSN-to-LH synapses were susceptible to i-LTP induced by the same protocol. Adult male and female D1cre mice were injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express a floxed channelrhodopsin-2 construct (AAV5-DIO-EF1A-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP) in the NAcSh (Figures 1A and 1B ). Approximately 1 month later, acute brain slices were prepared to record from LH neurons using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at NAcSh D1-MSN-to-LH synapses were elicited with brief, blue light pulses. FSK (10 μM) could not induce i-LTP at the NAcSh D1-MSN-to-LH synapse (Figure 1C). However, in the same preparation but recording instead from VP neurons while optogenetically stimulating D1-MSN terminals, the application of FSK reliably induced i-LTP from all of the cells recorded (Figures 1D–1F). Hence, these data indicate that in naive ad libitum-fed mice, i-LTP of the NAcSh D1-MSN-to-LH synapse is absent, and this finding is distinct from other major target nuclei of accumbal D1-MSNs (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C.

At some synapses, plasticity is activity dependent and only revealed after exposure to a specific stimulus (Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013Wamsteeker Cusulin J.I. Füzesi T. Inoue W. Bains J.S. Glucocorticoid feedback uncovers retrograde opioid signaling at hypothalamic synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Inoue et al., 2013Inoue W.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the NAcSh-to-LH pathway in controlling food intake, we wondered whether a change in synaptic transmission would be revealed following exposure to a manipulation that would drive increased feeding or overeating. To this end, D1Cre mice transfected with floxed-ChR2 in the NAcSh were subject to acute food restriction (AFR) overnight and sacrificed the following morning to assess plasticity at the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse ex vivo. As expected, AFR led to a significant reduction in body weight as compared to ad libitum-fed controls (Figure 1G). Consistent with the previous experiment, the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse did not show any plasticity upon bath application of FSK onto slices from control animals. Instead, in slice from food-restricted mice, FSK application now led to a robust potentiation of inhibitory transmission at the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse (Figures 1H and 1I). FSK-induced i-LTP was absent 1 week after AFR at a time when body weight loss had recovered (Figure S1), indicating that synaptic depression of D1-MSN-to-LH synapses is present only in situations that favor overeating (i.e., after AFR). Previous studies have found that inhibitory plasticity at D1R-MSN projection terminals requires the presynaptic activation of protein kinase A and D1 receptors to induce i-LTP (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C.Y. House D.R.C. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C.

Specifically, at D1-MSN projections to the VP or VTA, the presynaptic expression locus was confirmed by a change in the variance of inhibitory currents (1/CV2; Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C.

Likewise, in our recordings, the variance of inhibitory currents also increased after FSK application in AFR mice (Figure 1J), again pointing to a presynaptic expression locus. Overeating can also occur in the absence of any immediate metabolic need—for example, when exposed to highly palatable and calorically dense foods, particularly those rich in fats or sugars (Morton et al., 2014Morton G.J. Meek T.H. Schwartz M.W. Neurobiology of food intake in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Would increased feeding of energy dense, high-fat diet recruit plasticity at the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse? To answer this question, D1cre mice transfected with floxed-ChR2 in the NAcSh were provided exclusively with a high-fat diet in their home cage. Control D1cre mice received normal chow. Three days of feeding was sufficient to produce increased weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet as compared to chow-fed controls (Figure 1K). After 3 days of feeding, acute brain slices of LH were prepared for ex vivo recordings as per previous experiments. As expected, chow-fed control mice did not demonstrate potentiation of the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse upon FSK application. On the contrary, in LH slices from high-fat-fed mice, the amplitude of IPSCs at this synapse was significantly increased following FSK application (Figures 1L and 1M). The IPSC variance changed at cells recorded from high-fat diet-exposed mice (Figure 1N), suggesting that high-fat food exposure also changed the release probability at D1-MSN-to-LH synapses. These data show that divergent stimuli (food-restriction or high-fat diet) that both favor overeating lead to plasticity at the D1-MSN-to-LH synapse. Accumbal MSNs provide dense inhibition to various downstream nuclei, including the VP, LH, and VTA, with each target ascribed distinct behavioral functions (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C.

To address this question, a dual retrograde tracing strategy was applied using region-specific injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) coupled to Alexa fluorophors in Drd1a-tdTomato mice to allow the reliable identification of D1-MSNs. The first cohort of mice (n = 5) was injected in the LH and VP with equal volumes of CTB-647 or CTB-488, respectively (Figure 2A). Eleven days after the injections, coronal slices containing NAcSh from four points along its rostro-caudal axis were prepared (Figure 2B). Although we cannot exclude that damaged fibers of passage may uptake CTB, a careful histological analysis shows minimal injection lesions in the LH (Figure S2), which is in line with only a few cells that showed overlapping expression of both CTB tracers. Slices were imaged via confocal microscopy (2× [320 × 320 μm] images per section) and analyzed for the expression of the 2 CTB tracers, together with tdTomato (Figure 2C). A total of 1,559 CTB-labeled neurons were identified from all of the NAcSh images (Figure 2D). NAcSh-to-LH projectors comprised 69.2% ± 3.8% of all CTB-labeled cells, while 34.4% ± 3.9% of cells were identified as NAcSh-to-VP projectors. Only 3.6% ± 1.0% of labeled cells expressed both CTB fluorophores, suggesting little overlap between NAcSh-to-LH and -VP projectors (Figure 2D). Analysis of CTB and tdTomato colocalization confirmed prior reports that accumbal projections to VP comprise both D1- and non-D1- (i.e., D2-) expressing MSNs in roughly equal proportions (45.6% ± 6.94% were identified as D1-MSNs; Figure 2E) (Creed et al., 2016Creed M.

https://openalex.org/W3019772733,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α), a regulator of metabolic change, is required for the survival and differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). Its role in MSC immunoregulatory activity, however, has not been completely elucidated. In the present study, we evaluate the role of HIF1α on MSC immunosuppressive potential. We show that HIF1α silencing in MSC decreases their inhibitory potential on Th1 and Th17 cell generation and limits their capacity to generate regulatory T cells. This reduced immunosuppressive potential of MSC is associated with a metabolic switch from glycolysis to OXPHOS and a reduced capacity to express or produce some immunosuppressive mediators including Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM), IL-6, and nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, using the Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity murine model (DTH), we confirm, in vivo, the critical role of HIF1α on MSC immunosuppressive effect. Indeed, we show that HIF1α silencing impairs MSC capacity to reduce inflammation and inhibit the generation of pro-inflammatory T cells. This study reveals the pivotal role of HIF1α on MSC immunosuppressive activity through the regulation of their metabolic status and identifies HIF1α as a novel mediator of MSC immunotherapeutic potential."

Here we examined the physiological relevance of fatty acid synthesis in T. gondii by focusing on the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and malonyl-CoA-[acyl carrier protein] transacylase (FabD), which are located in the apicoplast to drive de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. Our results disclosed unexpected metabolic resilience of T. gondii tachyzoites, revealing that they can tolerate CRISPR/Cas9–assisted genetic deletions of three pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits or FabD. All mutants were fully viable in prolonged cultures, albeit with impaired growth and concurrent loss of the apicoplast. Even more surprisingly, these mutants displayed normal virulence in mice, suggesting an expendable role of the FAS2 pathway in vivo. Metabolic labeling of the Δpdh-e1α mutant showed reduced incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into fatty acids with medium chain lengths (C14:0 and C16:0), revealing that FAS2 activity was indeed compromised. Moreover, supplementation of exogenous C14:0 or C16:0 significantly reversed the growth defect in the Δpdh-e1α mutant, indicating salvage of these fatty acids. Together, these results demonstrate that the FAS2 pathway is dispensable during the lytic cycle of Toxoplasma because of its remarkable flexibility in acquiring fatty acids.

Very little is known about how phosphorylation of tyrosine residues influences the structure, aggregation, and microtubule- and lipid-binding properties of Tau. Here, we sought to determine the relative contributions of phosphorylation of one or several of the five tyrosine residues in Tau (Tyr-18, -29, -197, -310, and -394) to the regulation of its biophysical, aggregation, and functional properties. We used a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro phosphorylation by c-Abl kinase to generate Tau species phosphorylated at all five tyrosine residues, all tyrosine residues except Tyr-310 or Tyr-394 (pTau-Y310F and pTau-Y394F, respectively) and Tau phosphorylated only at Tyr-310 or Tyr-394 (4F/pTyr-310 or 4F/pTyr-394). We observed that phosphorylation of all five tyrosine residues, multiple N-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr-18, -29, and -197), or specific phosphorylation only at residue Tyr-310 abolishes Tau aggregation and inhibits its microtubule- and lipid-binding properties.

Analyses using the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network, gene ontology enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway databases indicated that the lncRNA Arrl1 decreases neurite outgrowth after neuronal injury. shRNA-mediated Arrl1 silencing increased axon regeneration both in vitro and in vivo and improved functional recovery of the sciatic nerve. Moreover, inhibiting an identified target gene of Arrl1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (Cdkn2b), markedly promoted neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons. We also found that Arrl1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA that sponges a Cdkn2b repressor, microRNA-761 (miR-761), and thereby up-regulates Cdkn2b expression during neuron regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W3020298702,"Endophytic bacteria, which are common in plant tissues, may help to control plant pathogens and enhance plant growth. Camellia oleifera, an oil-producing plant, is widely grown in warm, subtropical, hilly regions in China. However, C. oleifera is strongly negatively affected by C. oleifera anthracnose, which is caused by Colletetrichum fructicola. To find a suitable biocontrol agent for C. oleifera anthracnose, 41 endophytes were isolated from the stems, leaves, and roots of C. oleifera. Bacterial cultures were identified based on analyses of 16S rDNA sequences; most strains belonged to the genus Bacillus. The antagonistic effects of these strains on C. fructicola were tested in vitro. In total, 16 strains inhibited C. fructicola growth, with B. subtilis strain 1-L-29 being the most efficient. Strain 1-L-29 demonstrated antagonistic activity against C. siamense, C. asianum, Fusarium proliferatum, Agaricodochium camellia, and Pseudomonas syringae. In addition, this strain produced indole acetic acid, solubilized phosphate, grew on N-free media, and produced siderophores. To facilitate further microecological studies of this strain, a rifampicin-resistant, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled strain, 1-L-29gfpr, was created using protoplast transformation. This plasmid had good segregational stability. Strain 1-L-29gfpr was re-introduced into C. oleifera and successfully colonized root, stem, and leaf tissues. This strain remained at a stable concentration in the root more than 20 d after inoculation. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that strain 1-L-29gfpr thoroughly colonized the root surfaces of C. fructicola as well as the root vascular tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana."

Good health policy and outcomes are intimately linked to a research-active culture, particularly in NCD. In this study we present the results of a comprehensive analysis of NCD research with particular a focus on cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in 10 key countries that represent a spectrum across MENA between 1991 and 2018. Methods The study uses a well validated bibliometric approach to undertake a quantitative analysis of research output in the ten leading countries in biomedical research in the MENA region on the basis of articles and reviews in the Web of Science database. We used filters for each of the three NCDs and biomedical research to identify relevant papers in the WoS. The countries selected for the analyses were based on the volume of research outputs during the period of analysis and stability, included Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Results A total of 495,108 biomedical papers were found in 12,341 journals for the ten MENA countries (here we consider Turkey in the context of MENA). For all three NCDs, Turkey's output is consistently the highest. Iran has had considerable growth in research output to occupy second place across all three NCDs. It appears that, relative to their wealth (measured by GDP), some MENA countries, particularly Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are substantially under-investing in biomedical research. In terms of investment on particular NCDs, we note the relatively greater commitment on cancer research compared with diabetes or cardiovascular disease in most MENA countries, despite cardiovascular disease causing the greatest health-related burden. When considering the citation impact of research outputs, there have been marked rises in citation scores in Qatar, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates and Oman. However, Turkey, which has the largest biomedical research output in the Middle East has the lowest citation scores overall. The level of intra-regional collaboration in NCD research is highly variable. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the dominant research collaborators across the MENA region. However, Turkey and Iran, which are amongst the leading research-active countries in the area, show little evidence of collaboration. With respect to international collaboration, the United States and United Kingdom are the dominant research partners across the region followed by Germany and France. Conclusion The increase in research activity in NCDs across the MENA region countries during the time period of analysis may signal both an increasing focus on NCDs which reflects general global trends, and greater investment in research in some countries. However, there are several risks to the sustainability of these improvements that have been identified in particular countries within the region. For example, a lack of suitably trained researchers, low political commitment and poor financial support, and minimal international collaboration which is essential for wider global impact."

Total isoflavone content was higher at the seed stage in large-seeded soybeans, while it increased after 7 days of germination in small-seeded soybeans, particularly in response to light conditions, under which they had high TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activities. In large-seeded soybeans, the germination environment did not significantly affect TFC or DPPH inhibition, whereas TPC and ABTS inhibition were high under dark germination conditions. Extracts of sprouts exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activities. Nitric oxide production was slightly lower in small-seeded and large-seeded soybeans germinated under light and dark conditions, respectively. Our findings indicate that germinated soybeans improved nutritionally, and that enhancement of bioactivity under different germination environments could contribute to the selection of appropriate soybean cultivars."

This study examined socio-demographic characteristics that were associated with stigmatising attitudes among the general population towards people who inject drugs, and people living with blood borne viruses or sexually transmissible infections. Questions were included in the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (total sample = 1,001). Attitudes towards each of the target populations were measured by 5-item stigma scales. Bivariate analyses and multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with stigmatising attitudes. Knowing a person affected by a stigmatised attribute was associated with reduced stigmatising attitudes, while voting for a conservative political party was associated with increased stigmatising attitudes. Age, gender, education, income, and marital status were each related to some stigmatising attitudes. Results also highlight differences between attitudes towards a stigmatised behaviour (i.e., injecting drug use) and stigmatised conditions (i.e., blood borne viruses and sexually transmissible infections). Identifying socio-demographic characteristics that are associated with stigmatising attitudes may have global implications for informing stigma reduction interventions, in order to promote positive health outcomes for affected communities."

Multiple vaccines are under development to prevent these epidemics and avoid the associated morbidity and mortality. Assessing the potential impact of these vaccines on morbidity and mortality of Ebola is essential for devising prevention strategies. A mean-field compartmental stochastic model was developed for this purpose and validated by simulating the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic. We assessed the impacts of prophylactic vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) both alone and in combination with the vaccination of the general population (entire susceptible population other than HCW). The model simulated 8,706 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 478–21,942) cases and 3,575 (95%CI: 179–9,031) deaths in Sierra Leone, in line with WHO-reported statistics for the 2014 epidemic (8,704 cases and 3,587 deaths). Relative to this base case, the model then estimated that prophylactic vaccination of only 10% of HCW will avert 12% (95% CI: 6%-14%) of overall cases and deaths, while vaccination of 30% of HCW will avert 34% of overall cases (95% CI: 30%-64%) and deaths (95% CI: 30%-65%). Prophylactic vaccination of 1% and 5% of the general population in addition to vaccinating 30% of HCW was estimated to result in reduction in cases by 44% (95% CI: 39%-61%) and 72% (95% CI: 68%-84%) respectively, and deaths by 45% (95% CI: 40%-61%) and 74% (95% CI: 70%-85%) respectively. Prophylactic vaccination of even small proportions of HCW is estimated to significantly reduce incidence of Ebola and associated mortality. The effect is greatly enhanced by the additional vaccination even of small percentages of the general population. These findings could be used to inform the planning of prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3017521086,"Urban residents can benefit from spending time in outdoor spaces and engaging with nature-related activities. Such engagement can improve health and well-being, support community cohesion, and improve environmentally-friendly behaviours. However, engagement with nature may not be equal amongst different members of society. We investigated individual variation in engagement with nature in Singapore, a high-density city in tropical Southeast Asia. Through a survey of 1000 residents, we analysed relationships between demographic factors such as age, income, and sex, and the frequency of visitation to different ecosystem types, and the frequency of engagement with different nature-related activities. Parks and neighbourhood open spaces were among the most commonly-visited outdoor spaces, with nature reserves and other natural areas being visited less frequently. Common activities included sitting outdoors, art and photography, and running, while hiking and nature recreation were less frequent. In contrast with previous studies, we found relatively small differences among different groups of the population in their preferred types of outdoor activities. Older people, those with lower incomes, and without degrees were less likely to visit most types of outdoor space and engage with most types of nature-related activities. In the case of nature reserves, the distance from the visitor’s home had a significantly negative influence on the frequency of visitation. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of engagement with nature are not equally enjoyed by all demographic groups, and that some groups lack engagement across the board. Strategies to increase nature engagement in tropical cities could include increasing the local availability and accessibility of different types of outdoor space, and education and public outreach programmes to encourage participation."

The Chk1/2 inhibitor AZD7762 is used to abrogate radiation therapy (RT)-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in multiple cell lines and, we find that this therapeutic combination promotes increased micronuclei formation in vitro and subsequently drives increased type I interferon signaling and cytotoxic T-cell activation. In vivo studies using B16-F10 melanoma cancer cells implanted in C57/BL6 mice demonstrate improved rates of tumor control at the abscopal (unirradiated) site, located outside of the radiation field, only in the AZD7762 + RT group, with a corresponding reduction in mean tumor volume, increase in the CD8 T-cell population, and immune activated gene signaling. Our results demonstrate that targeted inhibition of cell cycle checkpoint activation following ionizing radiation drives increased production of immunogenic micronuclei, leading to systemic tumor response with potential future clinical benefit."

Ddl is activated by the monovalent cation (MVC) K+, but despite its clinical relevance and decades of research, how this activation occurs has not been elucidated.

We found that TtDdl is a type II MVC-activated enzyme, retaining activity in the absence of MVCs. However, the efficiency of TtDdl increased ∼20-fold in the presence of activating MVCs, and it was maximally activated by K+ and Rb+ ions. A strict dependence on ionic radius of the MVC was observed, with Li+ and Na+ providing little to no TtDdl activation. To understand the mechanism of MVC activation, we solved crystal structures of TtDdl representing distinct catalytic stages in complex with K+, Rb+, or Cs+. Comparison of these structures with apo TtDdl revealed no evident conformational change on MVC binding. Of note, the identified MVC binding site is structurally conserved within the ATP-grasp superfamily. We propose that MVCs activate Ddl by altering the charge distribution of its active site.

To understand the mechanism of MVC activation, we solved crystal structures of TtDdl representing distinct catalytic stages in complex with K+, Rb+, or Cs+. Comparison of these structures with apo TtDdl revealed no evident conformational change on MVC binding. Of note, the identified MVC binding site is structurally conserved within the ATP-grasp superfamily. We propose that MVCs activate Ddl by altering the charge distribution of its active site. These findings provide insight into the catalytic mechanism of ATP-grasp enzymes. The ATP-grasp superfamily includes more than 20 enzymes, with many having been structurally characterized (Table S1). The defining feature of this superfamily is the ATP-grasp fold, which binds ATP between two α+β domains. In addition to ATP, the catalytic mechanism of ATP-grasp enzymes generally utilizes separate carboxylate and nucleophilic substrates, with the reaction considered to proceed through formation of an acylphosphate intermediate (Fig. 1A). Although utilization of ATP is common in members of the superfamily, the composition of additional substrates varies, resulting in a wide range of biomolecular products. These enzymes are therefore involved in a diverse range of biological pathways in all domains of life, such as the oxidative stress response (GSH synthetase), gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism (carboxylases), purine biosynthesis (Pur synthetases), antibiotic biosynthesis (l-amino acid ligases), and cell wall biosynthesis (d-alanine–d-alanine ligase) (Table S1). Therefore, the role of ATP-grasp enzymes in these various pathways has been extensively studied, with many investigated for their promise as drug targets and for molecular biosynthesis. d-alanine–d-alanine ligase (Ddl), one of the first characterized ATP-grasp enzymes, catalyzes the energy-dependent conjugation of two d-alanine molecules to form the d-alanyl–d-alanine dipeptide and is essential for cell wall biosynthesis. Because of this important role, Ddl has been primarily investigated as an antibiotic drug target and has been identified as the primary target of the second-line anti-tuberculosis agent d-cycloserine (DCS). Ddl has also been investigated for in vitro biosynthesis of d-amino acid dipeptides (1Sato M. Kirimura K. Kino K. d-amino acid dipeptide production utilizing d-alanine-d-alanine ligases with novel substrate specificity.J. Biosci.

The Ddl enzyme from Thermus thermophilus (TtDdl) has been used previously as a model to investigate the reaction mechanism of these enzymes and was employed in this study (3Kitamura Y. Ebihara A.

The enzymatic activity of TtDdl requires formation of a dimer, with a single monomer consisting of an N-terminal domain (Met1–Gly104), a central domain (Ala105–Leu192), and a C-terminal domain (Ser193–Thr319) (Fig. 2). Each subunit possesses a single ATP-binding site, formed by the ATP-grasp fold, and two d-Ala–binding sites. ATP and the two d-Ala substrates bind in adjacent sites at the center of the Ddl monomer to facilitate formation of the d-alanyl–d-alanine dipeptide (d-Ala–d-Ala). Studies of Ddl from other bacterial species have identified that the first d-Ala site has higher affinity for d-Ala than the second (4Liu S. Chang J.S. Herberg J.T. Horng M.-M. Tomich P.K. Lin A.H.

The catalytic mechanism of Ddl is also accompanied by cumulative conformational changes induced by substrate binding. For TtDdl, this involves three loop regions: loop 1 (aa 155–161, the P-loop), loop 2 (aa 217–234, the Ω -loop), and loop 3 (aa 289–293) (Fig. 2). The catalytic mechanism of Ddl is proposed to proceed with an ordered ter-ter mechanism through two half-reactions and involves formation of two reaction intermediates: an acylphosphate intermediate and a tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 1B). In the first half-reaction, ATP and two Mg2+ bind and facilitate closure of the P-loop (3Kitamura Y. Ebihara A. Agari Y. Shinkai A. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S. Structure of d-alanine-d-alanine ligase from Thermus thermophilus HB8: cumulative conformational change and enzyme–ligand interactions.Acta Crystallogr.

Subsequently, the first d-Ala (d-Ala1) binds adjacent to ATP, inducing closure of the Ω-loop. Here, the carboxylate of d-Ala1 attacks the γ-phosphate of ATP (1), leading to formation of the acylphosphate intermediate d-Ala–phosphate (2). In the second half-reaction, a second d-Ala (d-Ala2) then enters the active site. The primary amine of d-Ala2 must be in its deprotonated form (NH2) to react with d-Ala–phosphate. The mechanism by which this deprotonation occurs remains unclear for Ddl (8Fan C. Moews P.C. Walsh C.T. Knox J.R. Vancomycin resistance: structure of d-alanine: d-alanine ligase at 2.3 Å resolution.Science. 1994; 266 (7939684): 439-44310.1126/science.7939684Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Shi Y.

The deprotonated d-Ala2 then attacks the phosphorylated carbonyl carbon of d-Ala1 (3), resulting in formation of a tetrahedral intermediate, d-Ala–d-Ala–phosphate (4). This coincides with closure of loop 3 and formation of a “fully closed” complex (3Kitamura Y. Ebihara A. Agari Y. Shinkai A. Hirotsu K. Kuramitsu S.

The tetrahedral intermediate then collapses to form the d-Ala–d-Ala dipeptide and Pi (5). Following collapse, Pi is released first from TtDdl, followed by d-Ala–d-Ala and ADP (8Fan C. Moews P.C.

Chem. 1990; 265 (2188969): 8993-8998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been determined that Ddl is activated by the monovalent cation (MVC) potassium (K+) (12Neuhaus F.C. The enzymatic synthesis of d-alanyl-d-alanine I: purification and properties of d-alanyl-d-alanine synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237 (14479179): 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For over 60 years, K+ has been included for the kinetic analysis of Ddl with little insight into how MVCs activate the enzyme. As a result, the mechanism by which this activation occurs remains unknown (Fig. 1B). Activation of enzymes by MVCs is categorized into one of two general mechanisms, referred to as type I or type II activation (13Gohara D.W. Di Cera E. Molecular mechanisms of enzyme activation by monovalent cations.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27462078): 20840-2084810.1074/jbc.R116.737833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Di Cera E.

Type I activation involves direct interaction of the MVC with the substrate, and so the MVC is required for enzyme activity. For type II activation, the MVC is not essential for enzyme activity. In this case, the MVC binds at an allosteric site, causing an increase in substrate binding affinity and/or enzyme activity. Ddl has been determined previously to be a type II activated enzyme. The pioneering kinetic study of Ddl by Neuhaus (12Neuhaus F.C. The enzymatic synthesis of d-alanyl-d-alanine I: purification and properties of d-alanyl-d-alanine synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237 (14479179): 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the MVC K+ was required for optimal activity of Enterococcus faecalis Ddl, characterized by a 1.4-fold increase in kcat, and a 3-fold decrease in the Km for the d-Ala substrate in the presence of 10 mm KCl. NH4+ has also been shown to be a less potent activator than K+, whereas Na+ did not affect enzyme activity. Similar observations of K+ activation were later reported by Prosser and De Carvalho (6Prosser G.A. de Carvalho L.P.S. Kinetic mechanism and inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosisd-alanine:d-alanine ligase by the antibiotic d-cycloserine.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (23286234): 1150-116610.1111/febs.12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ddl. Kinetic studies of other ATP-grasp enzymes have also reported activation by MVCs (Table S1). Similar to Ddl, the mechanism for MVC activation of other ATP-grasp enzymes is poorly understood, largely because the location of MVC binding remains unknown. Therefore, it has yet to be determined whether this superfamily shares the same mechanism for MVC activation or whether unique mechanisms exist. Historically, a kinetics approach has been used to identify activation of enzymes by MVCs; however, this does not provide full details of the activation mechanism. Recent advances in structural and spectroscopic techniques have allowed a more complete understanding of these mechanisms (13Gohara D.W. Di Cera E. Molecular mechanisms of enzyme activation by monovalent cations.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (27462078): 20840-2084810.1074/jbc.R116.737833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Shisler K.A. Hutcheson R.U. Horitani M. Duschene K.S. Crain A.V.

By exploiting the unique anomalous scattering properties of heavy metal MVCs, such as Rb+ and Cs+, MVC binding sites can be identified through cocrystallization with the enzyme of interest. This also allows direct comparison of enzyme structure in the absence and presence of MVCs, providing insight into the mechanism of activation. In this study we have investigated the MVC activation of TtDdl using a combination of steady-state kinetic analysis and X-ray crystallography. This combined approach revealed that TtDdl is activated by the larger MVCs K+, NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+ and allowed the identification of an MVC binding site within the active site of TtDdl. Based on these findings, we proposed a mechanism for MVC activation of Ddl. Comparison with members of the ATP-grasp superfamily revealed that this previously unidentified site is structurally conserved in many ATP-grasp enzymes. The broader significance of this discovery with respect to MVC activation of other enzymes in the ATP-grasp superfamily is also addressed. A kinetics analysis of TtDdl was completed to determine the effect of K+ and other MVCs on catalysis. Although K+ has been shown previously shown to activate Ddl from other species, this had not been determined for TtDdl. For this purpose, a colorimetric antimony–phosphomolybdate assay was used to monitor production of Pi from the enzymatic activity of TtDdl. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined for the ATP and d-Ala1/d-Ala2 substrates in a low-MVC reaction buffer (Table 1, see “Experimental procedures”). These were determined as 16.2 μm, 1250 μm, and 4020 μm, respectively. To investigate the effect of K+ on TtDdl activity, the kinetic parameters were also determined in the presence of 10, 50, and 100 mm KCl (Table 1). For Km ATP and kcat, a slight decrease was observed in the presence of 50 mm and 100 mm KCl. In contrast, Km d-Ala2 decreased 10-fold in the presence of 10 mm KCl and up to 20-fold for 50 and 100 mm KCl. A similar decrease was also reflected in Km d-Ala1. This reduction in d-Ala Km is consistent with previous observations (5Neuhaus F.C. The enzymatic synthesis of d-alanyl-d-alanine ii. kinetic studies on d-alanyl-d-alanine synthetase.J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237 (13938148): 3128-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Prosser G.A. de Carvalho L.P.S.

To compare the effect of these MVCs on TtDdl activity, kcat/Km d-ala2 was used as a measure of enzyme efficiency. As addition of KCl showed little to no effect on kcat, this translated to a ∼20-fold more efficient enzyme at 50 mm KCl. This indicates that TtDdl is a more efficient enzyme in the presence of K+ and, therefore, that it activated by this MVC.Table 1Effect of KCl on TtDdl catalysisConditionaAll kinetic parameters reported were determined from two experiments, each with three technical replicates unless stated otherwise.

Open table in a new tab In the case of MVC-activated enzymes, a preference for Na+ or K+ is commonly observed, with MVCs of similar ionic radii often able to substitute with a comparable effect. Therefore, the effects of LiCl, NaCl, NH4Cl, RbCl, and CsCl salts on TtDdl activity were also determined at an intermediate concentration of 50 mm (Fig. 3 and Table S2). The smaller MVCs Li+ and Na+ produced a small effect, with an apparent 1.5-fold increase in TtDdl efficiency compared with the low-MVC condition. In contrast, larger MVCs showed a 10- to 20-fold increase in efficiency. This confirms that activation of TtDdl is not the result of an ionic strength effect. Interestingly, substrate inhibition by d-Ala was observed in the presence of the activating MVCs K+, NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+ (Fig. S2). This has not been reported previously for Ddl. We predict that this may be due to nonproductive binding of d-Ala2, a result of the low Km d-Ala2, which was determined to be decreased ∼10-fold compared with Ddl from other species. The order of MVC activation was thus determined as K+≈ Rb+ > NH4+≈ Cs+ > Na+ ≈ Li+ ≈ low MVC. Therefore, this kinetics analysis demonstrated that K+ and the larger MVCs NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+ activate TtDdl. After determining that TtDdl is activated by MVCs we aimed to identify catalytically relevant binding sites by X-ray crystallography. An approach to identify such sites is crystallization of the target protein in the presence of MVCs (16Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. The structure of the potassium channel: molecular basis of K+ conduction and selectivity.Science. 1998; 280 (9525859): 69-7710.1126/science.280.5360.69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5529) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the larger electron density and anomalous scattering properties of Rb+ and Cs+ were exploited. Cocrystals of TtDdl complexed with Mg2+-ATP, d-Ala–d-Ala, and Rb+ or Mg2+-ATP, d-Ala–d-Ala, and Cs+ were grown as described under “Experimental procedures.” Datasets for both conditions were collected at 13,000 eV at the Australian Synchrotron, and the structures were solved to 1.90 Å and 2.30 Å (17McPhillips T.M. McPhillips S.E. Chiu H.-J. Cohen A.E. Deacon A.M. Ellis P.J. Garman E. Gonzalez A. Sauter N.K. Phizackerley R.P. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Blu-Ice and the Distributed Control System: software for data acquisition and instrument control at macromolecular crystallography beamlines.J.

Additional datasets were collected at 15,250 eV and 8,500 eV for the Rb+- and Cs+-bound structures, respectively, to obtain a strong anomalous signal. Anomalous difference Fourier maps were used to identify MVC binding sites. In total, two separate MVC sites were identified per TtDdl monomer for Rb+ and Cs+ (Fig. 4A). Anomalous peak heights and atomic parameters for each site are detailed in Table S4. Site 1 is located at the edge of the dimerization interface, coordinated by Trp133 and solvent (Fig. S3). This is distant from the active site and unlikely to be responsible for the activating effect. This conclusion is supported by the low occupancies for Rb+ modeled at this site, despite a high concentration of 150 mm RbCl in the crystallization condition. In contrast, site 2, referred to here as the K+ cleft, is in close proximity to the active site (Fig. 4B). The K+ cleft is defined by the side chains of Glu282, Asn284, Met114, Lys116, and Glu87 and the backbone of Leu283 and Cys113. Rb+ and Cs+ share the same coordination sphere of seven coordinating interactions (Fig. 4, C and D). This includes the carboxylate of Glu282, the amide of Asn284, the backbone carbonyl O of Cys113 and Leu283, and three ordered waters, arranged in a capped trigonal prismatic geometry. Notably Glu282 also coordinates to both Mg2+ that bridge the triphosphate group of ATP. This suggests an important role of Glu282 in Ddl catalysis, supported by a previous site-directed mutagenesis study of Escherichia coli Ddl that reported a ∼500-fold decrease in activity for an equivalent Glu282→Gln mutant (9Shi Y. Walsh C.T. Active-site mapping of Escherichia colid-Ala-d-Ala ligase by structure-based mutagenesis.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7893688): 2768-277610.1021/bi00009a005Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additionally, multiple sequence alignments and structural superposition of TtDdl to other Ddl enzymes also reveals that the residues forming the K+ cleft are highly conserved (Fig. S4). Together, this provides strong evidence that MVC binding at the K+ cleft is responsible for activation of TtDdl. Having identified the MVC binding site of TtDdl, we further investigated the influence of K+ at separate stages of the Ddl reaction mechanism. The mechanism of MVC activation for type II activated enzymes commonly involves conformational change in the vicinity of the MVC binding site. As TtDdl is a type II activated enzyme, K+-induced conformational change was investigated by capturing TtDdl at different stages of the catalytic cycle. By completing crystallization experiments (see “Experimental procedures”), five structures of TtDdl representing four different stages of Ddl catalysis were solved: Apo TtDdl (PDB code 6U1C); TtDdl in complex with ADP, Pi, and K+ (PDB code 6U1H); TtDdl in complex with ADP, the phosphorylated form of d-cycloserine (DCSP), and K+ (PDB code 6U1I); TtDdl in complex with ADP, Pi, d-Ala–d-Ala, and K+ (PDB code 6U1J); and TtDdl in complex with ADP, CO32−, d-Ala–d-Ala, and K+ (PDB code 6U1K) (Fig. S5). The high resolution (1.67 Å) of the latter structure allowed clear identification of K+ bound at the K+ cleft. The mean K+-O bond length of 2.91 Å across all of these structures is consistent with a reported value of 2.91 ± 0.179 Å for [7]K+ (18Gagné O.C. Hawthorne F.C. Bond-length distributions for ions bonded to oxygen: alkali and alkaline-earth metals.Acta Crystallogr. B Struct. Sci. Cryst. Eng. Mater. 2016; 72 (27484381): 602-62510.1107/S2052520616008507Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A complete summary of these atomic parameters for each modeled cation is reported in Table S5. In each of these structures, K+ shared the same coordination sphere described for Rb+ and Cs+ (Fig. 5A and Fig. S6). Flexibility in coordinating residues of the K+ cleft was also observed, being dependent on the ionic radius of the bound MVC. Accommodation of the bulkier Cs+ produced the greatest effect, possibly explaining the reduced potency compared with activation by K+ and Rb+. As the activating effect of these MVCs was associated with the d-Ala substrate, the possibility of conformational change at the K+ cleft or within the d-Ala pocket was considered. To identify whether K+ binding at the K+ cleft induces conformational change, the captured states of K+-bound TtDdl were superposed with apo TtDdl (Fig. 5B). Overall, minimal conformational change was observed for the coordinating residues of the K+ cleft. The only observable difference was rotation of Glu282 from the apo to K+ bound enzyme, which is consistent with ordering of the side chain following binding of ATP and Mg2+. Therefore, this suggests that MVC activation of TtDdl is not elicited through conformational change at the K+ cleft. As the activating effect of K+ was associated with the d-Ala substrates, the d-Ala1 binding pocket was similarly compared (Fig. 5C). Again, no conformational change was observed in the residues forming the d-Ala1 binding pocket. Notably, the key residues Glu13 and Arg268, which facilitate hydrogen bond–mediated substrate recognition, remain in the same conformation in the apo and ligand-bound forms of TtDdl. The only considerable difference is in the conformation of the P-loop; however, this is accounted for by the absence of a nucleotide substrate in the structure of apo TtDdl. This structural analysis shows that K+ binding at the K+ cleft does not result in rearrangement of active-site residues and suggests that activation of TtDdl occurs through a mechanism that does not involve significant conformational change. Enzymes of the ATP-grasp superfamily share high conservation in their nucleotide binding sites and in the first step of catalysis, which involves formation of an acylphosphate intermediate (Fig. 1A). As summarized in Table S1, some ATP-grasp enzymes have been determined to be activated by MVCs. Therefore, we predicted that MVCs may also activate other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily by a similar mechanism. Structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography for many of these enzymes, allowing direct comparison with the K+ cleft of TtDdl. Initially, examples of ATP-grasp enzymes with an MVC bound at this position were considered. In all, two cases were identified, with the first of these being carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) (19Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. The structure of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase determined to 2.1 Å resolution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55 (10089390): 8-2410.1107/S0907444998006234Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Superposition of the carboxyphosphate domain of E. coli CPS with TtDdl revealed that the K+ cleft of TtDdl overlays with a bound K+ (K+3) of CPS (Fig. 6, A and B). Closer inspection of this site reveals high conservation between the two enzymes, with the only major difference being substitution of Met114 in TtDdl to Glu126 of CPS, resulting in an additional interaction with the bound K+. The second case identified was for the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase (20Chou C.Y. Tong L. Structural and biochemical studies on the regulation of biotin carboxylase by substrate inhibition and dimerization.J. Biol.

A previous study investigating BC catalysis required CsCl in the crystallization condition for an Arg16→Glu16 mutant. In this structure, Cs+ is clearly bound at the same position as the K+ cleft of TtDdl (Fig. 6C). Compared with TtDdl, Met114 is substituted for Gly in BC. Additionally, structural comparison with WT E. coli BC shows that the Arg16→Glu16 mutation does not affect the conformation of this site (Fig. S7). Together, these examples demonstrate that MVC binding at this position is also possible for ATP-grasp enzymes other than Ddl. Following this, the K+ cleft of TtDdl was compared with the analogous position in other ATP-grasp enzymes. A total of 25 different ATP-grasp enzymes were compared by structural superposition to TtDdl (PDB code 6U1H) (Figs. S8 and S9 and Table S6). This revealed that the K+ cleft is structurally conserved for most of these ATP-grasp enzymes and for the d-amino acid ligases VanA and VanG, complete conservation of the K+ cleft was observed. Overall, the Glu282 and Asn284 positions showed high conservation, being conserved in 80% and 56% of the ATP-grasp enzymes analyzed, respectively. Although the Met114 residue was poorly conserved, most substitutions at this position project away from the K+ cleft and do not block the MVC binding site. Of all the enzymes analyzed, kinase and thiokinase members showed the least conservation in the primary and secondary structure of the K+ cleft (Fig. S8 and Table S6). One plausible explanation for this is differences in the catalytic mechanism for these enzymes compared with Ddl, which rely on phosphorylation of a catalytic histidine residue rather than a carboxylate substrate. Overall, the K+ cleft of Ddl was observed to be structurally conserved in ATP-grasp enzymes, particularly for Glu282, with most of these enzymes catalyzing reactions that proceed through formation of an acylphosphate intermediate. This suggests that other enzymes of the ATP-grasp superfamily may share the same type II mechanism for MVC activation as proposed for Ddl. The structural and kinetic evaluation of TtDdl with MVCs has provided important insight into the mechanism of MVC activation. These experiments support a type II mechanism of activation. A marked reduction was observed in the Km for both d-Ala substrates in the presence of the larger MVCs K+, NH4+, Rb+, and Cs+; however, no significant conformational change at the active site of TtDdl is evident. Although the major effect involves the d-Ala substrates, MVCs were identified to bind closer in proximity to the nucleotide binding pocket, forming an extensive coordination network with the bound Mg2+ and ATP. Enzyme catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions require a divalent metal as an essential cofactor (21Cowan J.A. Metal activation of enzymes in nucleic acid biochemistry.Chem. Rev. 1998; 98 (11848925): 1067-108810.1021/cr960436qCrossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). For TtDdl, this is facilitated by two Mg2+ that act as Lewis acids, balancing the buildup of negative charge on the triphosphate leaving group of ATP. This promotes nucleophilic attack by d-Ala1 to form the acylphosphate intermediate d-Ala–phosphate. The proposed Mg2+–ATP complex for TtDdl in the absence of an activating MVC is depicted in Fig. 7. Mg1 coordinates the carboxylate side chains of Asp270 and Glu282 and the oxyanions of the α/γ Pi. The carboxylate side chain of Glu282 also acts as a bidentate ligand for Mg2, which coordinates the oxyanions of the β/γ Pi (Fig. 7A). We propose that, when an activating MVC is bound at the K+ cleft, the charge distribution of this coordination network is altered (Fig. 7B). This may occur through the MVC attenuating the negative charge of the Glu282 carboxylate anion balanced by bidentate coordination of Mg2. This would increase the Lewis acidity of Mg2, allowing it to stabilize additional negative charge from the β/γ Pi. This reduces electrostatic repulsion with the carboxylate of d-Ala1, increasing the binding affinity of d-Ala1 and resulting in an increased rate of d-Ala–phosphate formation. The complex of TtDdl with DCSP shown in Fig. 7, C and E, mimics the binding mode of d-Ala–phosphate and demonstrates how MVC binding at the K+ cleft could also modulate the Lewis acidity of Mg1 and Mg2 prior to nucleophilic attack by d-Ala2. This model is consistent with the ordered nature of the Ddl catalytic mechanism. If the binding affinity of d-Ala1 is increased, then this would result in faster d-Ala–phosphate formation. As d-Ala–phosphate formation is increased, d-Ala2 can more readily react with d-Ala–phosphate to form the tetrahedral intermediate and, upon collapse, d-Ala–d-Ala. This explains the observed decrease in Km for both d-Ala substrates. The fact that a similar effect is not observed in kcat supports product release being the rate-limiting step, consistent with previous isotope exchange experiments utilizing d-Ala–d-Ala and d-Ala–d-X ligases (11Mullins L.S. Zawadzke L.E. Walsh C.T. Raushel F.M. Kinetic evidence for the formation of d-alanyl phosphate in the mechanism of d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase.J. Biol.

The high conservation observed in the K+ cleft suggests that this mechanism of MVC activation applies generally for Ddl enzymes (Fig. S4). Furthermore, the structural conservation of the K+ cleft and the key coordinating Glu residue between the ATP-grasp enzymes suggests that this mechanism of activation may apply more broadly across the superfamily. This discovery of structural conservation at the K+ cleft within the functionally diverse members of the ATP-grasp superfamily provides a basis for further investigation of MVC activation. Several ATP-grasp enzymes require MVCs for maximal activity; however, for many, the effect of MVCs has yet to be elucidated (Table S1). As the functions of ATP-grasp enzymes are so diverse, understanding the role of MVCs would provide insight into many catalytic schemes. This is particularly relevant for ATP-grasp enzymes that show promise as drug targets and for enzyme-catalyzed chemical synthesis. Members of the ATP-grasp superfamily that have been investigated as drug targets include Ddl, biotin carboxylase, tubulin tyrosine ligase, and the purine biosynthesis enzyme PurK (23Neuhaus F.C.

In this study, we demonstrate that the presence of activating MVCs has a substantial effect on the efficiency of Ddl, likely by altering the charge distribution at the active site. If this is found to apply to other ATP-grasp enzymes, we predict that using K+ concentrations that more closely reflect physiological conditions will allow more accurate characterization of inhibitors in vitro. More recently, l-amino acid ligases (LALs) have also been investigated for the industrial production of a range of products, including antibiotics and peptides for use in healthcare and consumable products (28Tabata K.

Despite many ATP-grasp enzymes having high similarity to Ddl, to our knowledge, activation of LALs by MVCs has not been investigated. Investigating activation by MVCs may lead to improvements in activity and broaden substrate specificity of LALs. Such examples demonstrate the importance of further characterizing MVC activation for the ATP-grasp superfamily. Through structural investigation of T. thermophilus Ddl, we identified the site responsible for MVC activation, the K+ cleft, providing the first mechanistic insight into K+ activation of Ddl. Type II MVC activation of TtDdl was also confirmed, with activation being dependent on the ionic radius. For the group I MVCs Li+–Cs+, the smaller Li+ and Na+ showed little to no activation. In contrast, maximal activation was observed for the larger K+ and Rb+. Crystal structures of TtDdl captured at distinct stages of the catalytic mechanism revealed minimal conformational change in the presence of K+, suggesting that a conformational change is not responsible for the activating effect. We propose that activation occurs through K+ altering the charge distribution within the active site, increasing the binding affinity for the carboxylate substrate d-Ala1 and promoting formation of the acylphosphate intermediate. Structural comparison of TtDdl with other ATP-grasp enzymes revealed that the K+ cleft is structurally conserved, suggesting that the same mechanism of activation may be applicable to other ATP-grasp enzymes. Therefore, we recommend that future studies of ATP-grasp enzymes consider activation by MVCs."

We have developed a smartphone app, the first of its kind in Norway, where a referring physician can write a short medical history and take clinical and dermatoscopic photographs with a smartphone, which is then sent to and evaluated by a dermatologist. In the period from June 1st, 2017, to September 1st, 2019, clinical information and photographs of rash and skin lesions from 171 patients were sent by 40 primary care and nursing home physicians via the smartphone app to four dermatologists for diagnosis and therapeutic advice. A wide range of dermatological conditions were diagnosed, most commonly chronic ulcers (17%), eczema (15%) and pigmented lesions (13%). Assessed later by a dermatologist, referral for regular consultations with a specialist was avoided in 119 patients (70%). Sixteen patients (9%) were recommended a regular consultation with a dermatologist; information for prioritization in the specialist healthcare service was then provided. In 36 patients (21%), further measures by the referring physician were recommended. Our experience indicates that many ordinary consultations on rash, ulcers and skin lesions in the specialist healthcare services can be avoided when using the smartphone app."
https://openalex.org/W3019727209,"Studies have indicated that programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression may have utility as a predictive biomarker in patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). Different immunohistochemical (IHC) assays are in development to assess PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs).In this post hoc analysis of the single-arm, phase 1/2 Study 1108 (NCT01693562), PD-L1 expression was evaluated from tumor samples obtained prior to second-line treatment with durvalumab in patients with advanced/metastatic UC using the VENTANA (SP263) IHC Assay. The primary objective was to determine whether the TC ≥ 25%/IC ≥ 25% algorithm (i.e., cutoff of ≥ 25% TC or ≥ 25% IC with PD-L1 staining at any intensity above background) was optimal for predicting response to durvalumab. PD-L1 expression data were available from 188 patients.After a median follow-up of 15.8 and 14.6 months, higher PD-L1 expression was associated with longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively, with significant separation in survival curves for PD-L1-high and-low expressing patients for the TC ≥ 25%/IC ≥ 25% cutoff (median OS: 19.8 vs 4.8 months; hazard ratio: 0.46; 90% confidence interval: 0.33, 0.639). OS was also prolonged for PD-L1-high compared with-low patients when samples were categorized using TC/IC combined positive score ≥ 10 and IC≥ 5% cutoffs. In multivariate analysis, IC but not TC PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with OS, PFS, and objective response rate (P < 0.001 for each), although interaction analysis showed similar directionality of benefit for ICs and TCs.These findings support the utility of a combined TC/IC algorithm for predicting response to durvalumab in patients with UC, with the TC≥ 25%/IC≥ 25% cutoff optimal when used with the VENTANA (SP263) IHC Assay."
https://openalex.org/W3017805663,"Purpose To determine the effect of decorin on oxidative stress and apoptosis of human lens epithelial (HLE) cells under high glucose condition. Methods HLE cell line (HLEB3) was incubated in normal glucose (5.5 mM) or high glucose (60 mM) medium. Decorin (50 nM) was applied 2 hours before high glucose medium was added. Apoptosis detection was executed by flow cytometry and western blotting (analysis of bcl-2 and bax). Oxidative stress level was measured by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, the expression of p22phox of HLE cells and human lens anterior capsules were detected by western blotting. Small interfering RNA transfection to p22phox and p38 MAPK was also carried out on HLEB3. Results High glucose caused HLE cells oxidative stress and apoptosis exhibiting the increase of apoptotic cells and ROS production and decrease of bcl-2/bax ratio, GSH/GSSG ration and SOD activity. P22phox and phospho-p38 MAPK were upregulated in high glucose treated HLEB3 cells. Knocking down p22phox or p38 by siRNAs can reduce high glucose induced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress level. Silencing p22phox by siRNA can downregulate the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Decorin can inhibit the apoptosis, oxidative stress level and the induction of p22phox and phospho-p38 of HLEB3 induced by high glucose. Furthermore, the expression of p22phox and p38 were found significantly increased in lens anterior capsules of diabetic cataract patients compared to that of normal age-related cataract patients. Conclusions Results showed that p22phox-p38 pathway may be participated in high glucose induced lens epithelial cell injury, decorin may inhibit the high glucose induced apoptosis and oxidative stress injury by suppressing this pathway in part."
https://openalex.org/W3018710909,"Spontaneous testicular teratomas (STTs) derived from primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the mouse embryonic testes predominantly develop in the 129 family inbred strain. Ter (spontaneous mutation) is a single nucleotide polymorphism that generates a premature stop codon of Dead end1 (Dnd1) and increases the incidence of STTs in the 129 genetic background. We previously found that DND1 interacts with NANOS2 or NANOS3 and that these complexes play a vital role in male embryonic germ cells and adult spermatogonia. However, the following are unclear: (a) whether DND1 works with NANOS2 or NANOS3 to regulate teratoma incidence, and (b) whether Ter simply causes Dnd1 loss or produces a short mutant DND1 protein. In the current study, we newly established a conventional Dnd1-knockout mouse line and found that these mice showed phenotypes similar to those of Ter mutant mice in spermatogenesis, oogenesis, and teratoma incidence, with a slight difference in spermiogenesis. In addition, we found that the amount of DND1 in Dnd1+/Ter embryos decreased to half of that in wild-type embryos, while the expression of the short mutant DND1 was not detected. We also found that double mutants for Dnd1 and Nanos2 or Nanos3 showed synergistic increase in the incidence of STTs. These data support the idea that Ter causes Dnd1 loss, leading to an increase in STT incidence, and that DND1 acts with NANOS2 and NANOS3 to regulate the development of teratoma from PGCs in the 129 genetic background. Thus, our results clarify the role of Dnd1 in the development of STTs and provide a novel insight into its pathogenic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3020427030,"Crop diseases are responsible for considerable yield losses worldwide and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. To implement efficient disease control measures, detection of the pathogens and understanding pathogen spatio-temporal dynamics is crucial and requires the use of molecular detection tools, especially to distinguish different pathogens causing more or less similar symptoms. We report here the design a new molecular diagnostic tool able to simultaneously detect five bacterial taxa causing important diseases on rice in Africa: (1) Pseudomonas fuscovaginae, (2) Xanthomonas oryzae, (3) Burkholderia glumae and Burkholderia gladioli, (4) Sphingomonas and (5) Pantoea species. This new detection tool consists of a multiplex PCR, which is cost effective and easily applicable. Validation of the method is presented through its application on a global collection of bacterial strains. Moreover, sensitivity assessment for the detection of all five bacteria is reported to be at 0.5 ng DNA by μl. As a proof of concept, we applied the new molecular detection method to a set of 256 rice leaves collected from 16 fields in two irrigated areas in western Burkina Faso. Our results show high levels of Sphingomonas spp. (up to 100% of tested samples in one field), with significant variation in the incidence between the two sampled sites. Xanthomonas oryzae incidence levels were mostly congruent with bacterial leaf streak (BLS) and bacterial leaf blight (BLB) symptom observations in the field. Low levels of Pantoea spp. were found while none of the 256 analysed samples was positive for Burkholderia or Pseudomonas fuscovaginae. Finally, many samples (up to 37.5% in one studied field) were positive for more than one bacterium (co-infection). Documenting co-infection levels are important because of their drastic consequences on epidemiology, evolution of pathogen populations and yield losses. The newly designed multiplex PCR for multiple bacterial pathogens of rice is a significant improvement for disease monitoring in the field, thus contributing to efficient disease control and food safety."

Chemother. 2018; 73 (29048485): 134-14210.1093/jac/dkx354Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A major characteristic feature of fungi is the presence of a highly ordered carbohydrate cell wall that provides protection against chemical and mechanical stresses. The cell wall is a dynamic, interlaced, and only partially defined polysaccharide structure that is essential for survival (19Gastebois A. Clavaud C. Aimanianda V. Latgé J.P. Aspergillus fumigatus: Cell wall polysaccharides, their biosynthesis and organization.Future Microbiol. 2009; 4 (19492968): 583-59510.2217/fmb.09.29Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and is considered an attractive source of novel antifungal targets because of its absence in humans. The A. fumigatus cell wall predominantly consists of a central core of fibrils composed of branched β-1,3 glucan crosslinked to chitin. Polysaccharides such as β-1,3–1,4-glucan and galactomannan are covalently bound to this complex, whereas those contained in the surrounding cement include α-1–3 glucan. Cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling is a highly organized and complex process, although many of the key steps remain to be fully elucidated (19Gastebois A. Clavaud C. Aimanianda V. Latgé J.P. Aspergillus fumigatus: Cell wall polysaccharides, their biosynthesis and organization.Future Microbiol. 2009; 4 (19492968): 583-59510.2217/fmb.09.29Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Polysaccharide synthesis of β-1,3 glucan and chitin occur at the fungal cell membrane using intracellular sugar nucleotide donors as substrates. Chitin is an integral structural component of the cell wall in A. fumigatus, contributing to rigidity, and consists of a linear polymer of β(1–4)–linked N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Chitin synthesis remains an attractive drug target; however, targeting the entire chitin synthase family is not a viable option because of predicted differences in structure and the membrane-bound location of the eight proteins (20Tada R. Latgé J.-P. Aimanianda V. Undressing the fungal cell wall/cell membrane—the antifungal drug targets.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2013; 19 (23278542): 3738-374710.2174/1381612811319200012Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An alternative target to chitin synthases is biosynthesis of the sugar nucleotide substrate UDP-GlcNAc that is also utilized for the synthesis of GPI anchors and N- and O-linked glycans (21Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P.S. Yu M. Hegde S.S. Magnet S. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. Structure and functions of the GNAT superfamily of acetyltransferases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433 (15581578): 212-22610.1016/j.abb.2004.09.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Four highly conserved enzymes in UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis form the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (22Selitrennikoff C.P. Allin D. Sonneborn D.R. Chitin biosynthesis during Blastocladiella zoospore germination: Evidence that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is post translationally activated during cell differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73 (1061155): 534-53810.1073/pnas.73.2.534Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is believed to represent the only endogenous source of UDP-GlcNAc within fungal cells (23Milewski S. Gabriel I. Olchowy J. Enzymes of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis in yeast.Yeast. 2006; 23 (16408321): 1-1410.1002/yea.1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Approximately 2–5% of glucose that enters the cell is directed into this pathway where it is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) and subsequently converted to fructose-6-phosphate (Fruc-6P). Four enzymes catalyze the remaining steps of this pathway. Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (Gfa1) converts Fruc-6P to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P). This undergoes acetylation by glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (Gna1) to GlcNAc-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P). The next step involves isomerization by phospho-acetyl-glucosamine mutase (Agm1) to yield GlcNAc-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1P) before uridylation by GlcNAc-1P-uridyltransferase (Uap1) to produce UDP-GlcNAc. This pathway is highly regulated in filamentous fungi, yeast, and higher eukaryotes (23Milewski S. Gabriel I. Olchowy J. Enzymes of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis in yeast.Yeast. 2006; 23 (16408321): 1-1410.1002/yea.1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Three of the enzymes (Gfa1, Agm1, and Uap1) have been genetically validated in A. fumigatus as essential for growth under in vitro laboratory conditions (24Fang W. Du T. Raimi O.G.

Gna1 (EC 2.3.1.4) is a member of the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily and is present in yeast such as Candida spp. (e.g. Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida auris) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have demonstrated that deletion of GNA1 is lethal (27Mio T. Yamada-Okabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Saccharomyces cerevisiae GNA1, an essential gene encoding a novel acetyltransferase involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine synthesis.J. Biol.

In C. albicans GNA1 is essential for in vitro viability and attenuated virulence in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis (28Becker J.M. Kauffman S.J. Hauser M. Huang L. Lin M. Sillaots S.

Inactivation of the murine GNA1 homologue is lethal as it is implicated in mitotic membrane fusion events and this further reinforces a critical role for this enzyme in higher eukaryotes (30Boehmelt G. Fialka I. Brothers G. McGinley M.D. Patterson S.D. Mo R. Hui C.C. Chung S. Huber L.A. Mak T.W. Iscove N.N. Cloning and characterization of the murine glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase EMeg32.

Although evolutionarily and structurally distinct from higher eukaryotic organisms, the GNA1 orthologues recently identified in parasitic protozoan apicomplexans have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets (31Cova M. López-Gutiérrez B. Artigas-Jerónimo S. González-Diáz A. Bandini G. Maere S. Carretero-Paulet L. Izquierdo L. The Apicomplexa-specific glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase gene family encodes a key enzyme for glycoconjugate synthesis with potential as therapeutic target.Sci.

To date, Gna1 in A. fumigatus is unexplored as an antifungal drug target using a combination of genetic and chemical methods. Inhibitors that chemically phenocopy a GNA1 deletion have not been reported in any organism, and the high degree of sequence homology between eukaryotic GNA1 family members likely precludes fungal selectivity. Here, we report a multidisciplinary approach providing genetic, chemical, and structural evidence supporting A. fumigatus Gna1 as an antifungal target and describe a fragment that exploits a previously unidentified pocket selective for the fungal enzyme. To investigate the requirement for Gna1 in A. fumigatus UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis, we deleted GNA1 by homologous recombination. A Δgna1 strain was constructed by replacing the coding sequence with a pyrG selection marker (Fig. S1). Transformants were evaluated by phenotypic and PCR screening before verification by Southern blotting (Fig. S1). Using a similar approach, GNA1 (with an N-terminal His tag) was re-introduced into the Δgna1 mutant (Fig. S1). Although suitable for initial in vitro studies, it was imperative that the reconstituted strain restored pyrG prototrophy as pyrG− A. fumigatus strains are highly attenuated in murine models of aspergillosis (32D'Enfert C. Diaquin M. Delit A. Wuscher N. Debeaupuis J.P. Huerre M. Latge J.P. Attenuated virulence of uridine-uracil auxotrophs of Aspergillus fumigatus.Infect.

To address this, the pyrG− strain was targeted with random integration of A. fumigatus pyrG into the chromosome to generate a pyrG+ reconstituted strain (Fig. S1). In vitro growth of A. fumigatus Δgna1 was completely inhibited in glucose (Glc)-supplemented media and restored to comparable levels upon replacement of glucose with GlcNAc, the product of the Gna1 enzyme (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates that GNA1 is essential for viability of A. fumigatus in standard in vitro laboratory media rich in glucose and concurs with previous work in yeast (27Mio T. Yamada-Okabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Saccharomyces cerevisiae GNA1, an essential gene encoding a novel acetyltransferase involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine synthesis.J. Biol.

We considered the physiological relevance of these Glc and GlcNAc concentrations because failure to correlate with physiological nutritional availability may incorrectly assign a gene as essential for growth. The glucose concentration used is 20-fold greater than the mean physiological human blood glucose level (110 mm versus ∼5.5 mm) and in lung alveoli glucose concentrations are further reduced (∼0.1 mm) (33Williams V. del Poeta M. Role of glucose in the expression of cryptococcus neoformans antiphagocytic protein 1, App1.Eukaryot. Cell. 2011; 10 (21239626): 293-30110.1128/EC.00252-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Specific human physiological levels of GlcNAc are unspecified in the literature but regarded as low and subject to fluctuation. We initially investigated rescue of Δgna1 on solid media supplemented with Glc (0.1 mm) and a simulated range of physiological GlcNAc concentrations, above and below previously reported levels (29Mio T. Kokado M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Reduced virulence of Candida albicans mutants lacking the GNA1 gene encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase.Microbiology. 2000; 146 (10878139): 1753-175810.1099/00221287-146-7-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The Δgna1 growth phenotype in the presence of low GlcNAc levels (1.5 μm) was characterized by a complete loss of hyphae and melanin pigment. High GlcNAc levels (150 μm, 100-fold increase) partially restored hyphal development, but colonies were still strikingly devoid of pigmentation and overall radial growth was less than the parental and reconstituted strain. We describe these characteristics as a terminal phenotype. To dissect the interplay between exogenous Glc and GlcNAc, we developed a checkerboard assay to assess 285 different nutritional combinations of these to explore possible concentrations encountered by A. fumigatus in the human host environment (Fig. 1B). Heat map analysis demonstrated that loss of GNA1 is associated with a terminal phenotype defective in conidial pigmentation and hyphal growth across a range of estimated physiological concentrations. The observed Δgna1 terminal phenotype is unlikely to be a result of a Gna1 scaffolding effect as metabolic supplementation with GlcNAc is restorative, indicating that disruption of Gna1 enzymatic function is sufficient to elicit the observed reduction in fungal viability. Taken together, these experiments show that disruption of gna1 leads to a terminal phenotype that is rescued by exogenous GlcNAc. Next, we investigated whether rescue of GNA1 with exogenous GlcNAc induces a cell wall stress response. A. fumigatus harbors cell wall integrity pathways that are activated under conditions of stress by signaling pathways such as the mitogen activated protein kinase cascades (34Jain R. Valiante V. Remme N. Docimo T. Heinekamp T. Hertweck C. Gershenzon J. Haas H. Brakhage A.A. The MAP kinase MpkA controls cell wall integrity, oxidative stress response, gliotoxin production and iron adaptation in Aspergillus fumigatus.Mol.

As the terminal phenotype did not yield sufficient growth for comparative analyses, this experiment was performed using a GlcNAc concentration of 90 mm to rescue growth. At concentrations of ≤104 viable conidia, the Δgna1 mutant displayed increased sensitivity to agents compromising the cell wall and membrane, suggesting the presence of cell wall defects and/or loss of membrane integrity (Fig. 1A). Calcofluor White interacts with chitin, leading to disruption of chitin polymer assembly and impairing the corresponding linkages to other cell wall components (35Ram A.F.J. Arentshorst M. Damveld R.A. vanKuyk P.A. Klis F.M. van den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. The cell wall stress response in Aspergillus niger involves increased expression of the glutamine: Fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase-encoding gene (gfaA) and increased deposition of chitin in the cell wall.Microbiology. 2004; 150 (15470111): 3315-332610.1099/mic.0.27249-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Increased susceptibility to Congo Red suggests a reduction of β-1,3 and β-1,6 glucans. Increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) reflects a compromised membrane that may be because of differences in the chitin layer. Finally, we investigated whether loss of A. fumigatus GNA1 enhanced the effects glucan synthesis inhibition by the echinocandin caspofungin (Fig. 1A). Exposure to caspofungin induced a terminal phenotype in the Δgna1 mutant (≥104 conidia) and was fungicidal at lower concentrations. This provides evidence of synergistic in vitro activity of a β-glucan synthase inhibitor together with the Δgna1 mutant. To probe the effects of Glc on germination, parental and Δgna1 mutant germlings were examined by light microscopy (Fig. 1C). Under conditions tested the Δgna1 mutant was nonviable (Fig. 1A) and examination of the conidia demonstrated a subset that was enlarged and highly disorganized with evidence of multiple, rudimentary germ-tubes whose development was prematurely arrested (Fig. 1C). Despite macroscopically comparable phenotypes, the Δgna1 mutant conidia incubated in the presence of 90 mm GlcNAc also displayed abnormalities compared with the parental strain (Fig. 1C). Although hyphae were evident at 24 h, there was also evidence of conidial enlargement and a lack of polarized hyphal growth with some Δgna1 germ tubes unable to branch (Fig. 1C). We hypothesize that this subpopulation of abnormal conidia accounts for the significant reduction in viability of the A. fumigatus Δgna1 strain (Fig. 1C′). GlcNAc is unable to completely rescue this phenotype. This suggests a possible cell wall phenotype because of reduced flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Defects in the cell surface architecture of the parental and Δgna1 mutant strains were also revealed by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM analysis demonstrated that the Δgna1 mutant grown under terminal phenotype conditions (0.1 mm Glc and 1.5 μm GlcNAc) displayed conidiophore collapse (Fig. 1D). The vesicular head was grossly abnormal with the presence of “naked” phialides and no obvious conidia compared with the parental strain (Fig. 1D). TEM analysis revealed a disorganized cell wall ultrastructure for the Δgna1 mutant, with a less-defined chitin layer and a more dispersed outer mannoprotein layer (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that loss of GNA1 is associated with a defective and potentially more porous cell wall and provides a molecular basis for the observed synergy with caspofungin. Taken together, these data show that the Δgna1 strain displays a cell wall phenotype. Ascertaining the physiological implications of GNA1 loss by translating in vitro phenotypic characterizations into in vivo infection models is an important step in providing genetic validation as an antifungal target. In particular, it is critical to determine whether in vivo GlcNAc scavenging systems could compensate for GNA1 loss. Nonvertebrate mini-host model systems such as the greater wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) represent a rapid initial screening strategy (36Slater J.L. Gregson L. Denning D.W. Warn P.A. Pathogenicity of Aspergillus fumigatus mutants assessed in Galleria mellonella matches that in mice.Med. Mycol. 2011; 49 (20950221): S107-S11310.3109/13693786.2010.523852Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Larval inoculation resulted in a mean survival time of 3 days for the parental and reconstituted strains whereas the Δgna1 mutant was avirulent with a survival profile indistinguishable from the PBS control group (Fig. 2A). A disadvantage of G. mellonella is that it fails to represent the natural inhalation route of Aspergillus. To recapitulate inhalational acquisition of A. fumigatus and provide insight into the physiological interplay of alveolar glucose and GlcNAc levels in circumventing GNA1 loss, we used an established neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (37Sheppard D.C.

https://openalex.org/W3018278303,"The plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates the activity of diverse ion channels to include the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC. Whether PIP2 regulation of ENaC is due to a direct phospholipid-protein interaction, remains obscure. To date, possible interaction of PIP2 with ENaC primarily has been tested indirectly through assays of channel function. A fragment-based biochemical analysis approach is used here to directly quantify possible PIP2-ENaC interactions. We find using the CIBN-CRY2 optogenetic dimerization system that the phosphoryl group positioned at carbon 5 of PIP2 is necessary for interaction with ENaC. Previous studies have implicated conserved basic residues in the cytosolic portions of β- and γ-ENaC subunits as being important for PIP2-ENaC interactions. To test this, we used synthetic peptides of these regions of β- and γ-ENaC. Steady-state intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that phosphoinositides change the local conformation of the N terminus of β-ENaC, and two sites of γ-ENaC adjacent to the plasma membrane, suggesting direct interactions of PIP2 with these three regions. Microscale thermophoresis elaborated PIP2 interactions with the N termini of β- (Kd ∼5.2 μm) and γ-ENaC (Kd ∼13 μm). A weaker interaction site within the carboxyl terminus of γ-ENaC (Kd ∼800 μm) was also observed. These results support that PIP2 regulates ENaC activity by directly interacting with at least three distinct regions within the cytoplasmic domains of the channel that contain conserved basic residues. These interactions are probably electrostatic in nature, and are likely to bear a key structural role in support of channel activity."

https://openalex.org/W3019321181,"Background Patient registry is a valuable source for identification of deliberate self-harm (DSH) incidents on a population basis; however, little research has provided sufficient details that could inform best utilization of this complicated data source for DSH research and statistics. In this study we want to use data from the Norwegian Patient Register to delineate a diagnostic coding system to identify medically treated DSH incidents, to profile general characteristics of these incidents, and to estimate incidence rate of DSHs in the national population of Norway. Methods We obtained all records of patient contacts to somatic hospitals and emergency centers due to external causes from 2008 through 2013. For each contact, we retrieved clinical data on primary and comorbid diagnoses, urgency of contact, etc., alongside with personal general information. After careful mining, the data were further processed following a multi-step analytic strategy. Descriptive analysis was used to profile DSH incidents and to estimate incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Findings From 1 459 384 eligible incident contacts for emergency injury treatment, we identified 13 533 incidents that had a recorded diagnosis of DSH, i.e., with a supplemental code of X6n. Upon delineation of these recorded DSHs, we devised a diagnostic coding system to identify all possible DSH incidents. This yielded a total of 38 433 incidents to be considered as likely incidents of DSH (adjusted incidents)–a number that is 2.84 times higher than that of the recorded DSH incidents during the study period. While the proposed diagnostic system captured more incidents by males and old adults, the adjusted DSHs remained more common in females than males, and occurred most frequently within young people of 18–21 years. These incidents imply about 6400 DSH incidents from 5100 persons per year and correspond to a yearly cumulative incidence rate of 121.0 (95% CI: 113.4–128.2) per 100000 population over 10 years old with particularly high rates in teenage girls of 15–19 years old (296.1/100000) and females and males of 20–24 years old (282.5 and 178.8/100000, respectively). Conclusion The insightful details of data processing and the rich findings from this study underscore the importance of patient registry in studying and reporting DSH incidents on a population level."
https://openalex.org/W3018981591,"Background Despite the progress made so far in reducing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), Nigeria still contributes significantly to the global burden of new pediatric HIV infections. The elimination target for MTCT has not been reached and the decline in new infections among all Global Plan countries from 2009 to 2015 was lowest in Nigeria. This qualitative study explores the barriers to uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) intervention in Kano, the second most populous state in Nigeria. Methods Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted among twelve stakeholders who were purposively selected based on their knowledge and involvement in PMTCT program activities in the state. The KII guide explored the status and challenges of PMTCT uptake in Kano state. Qualitative data analysis was managed using NVIVO 11 software and themes were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results We found that the key barriers to uptake of PMTCT identified by stakeholders cut across the domains of the socio-ecological model. These include—fear of stigma associated with being seen accessing HIV related services, low male partner involvement, socio-cultural beliefs about the dangers of hospital-based delivery, poor attitude of health workers, distance/cost to facilities, issues with availability of HIV test kits and poor organization of health services. Conclusion The implementation of effective PMTCT programs would require innovative strategies that leverage improvement of Antenatal care (ANC) uptake as an entry point for PMTCT. In addition, sustaining engagement in care requires creating a supportive stigma-free environment in the community as well as spousal support to ensure women can navigate the socio-cultural barriers that limit access to health services."

Of the 16,528 participants in KNHANES-V, 8,918 were adults aged≥ 50 years who had completed the survey questions on sleep duration and osteoarthritis, and had diagnostic X-ray results. We evaluated the association between sleep duration as the primary predictor for osteoarthritis involving the hip, knee, and spinal joints. A complex sample logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for the covariates.Proportions of participants with total daily sleep duration of ≤6 hours, 7-8 hours, and ≥9 hours were 47.1%, 45.2, and 7.7%, respectively. The rate of osteoarthritis diagnoses in the ≤6 hours, 7-8 hours, and ≥9 hours of sleep duration groups was 24.1%, 17.6%, and 21.8%, respectively (p <0.0001). The odds ratios (OR) were significantly higher in the ≤6 hours of sleep group than in the 7-8 hours of sleep group (OR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.39; p = 0.02), but no significant difference in the ≥9 hours of sleep group was found after adjusting the confounding variables. When we compared knee joint pain (Numeric Rating Scale 0 versus 1-10) in participants with grade 2-4 Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification after adjusting these same confounding variables, the ≤6 hours of sleep group (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58) and the ≥9 hours of sleep group (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03-1.95) showed significantly higher ORs.This study confirmed the significant association between sleep duration and osteoarthritis in adults aged ≥50 years. Participants' positive for both radiological (KL grade ≥2) and symptomatic osteoarthritis showed a strong association between knee joint pain and not enough sleep duration."
https://openalex.org/W3019666467,"Background Proinflammatory interleukin-33 (IL-33) binds to its receptor ST2L and is involved in inflammation and the malignant behavior of cancer cells. However, the role of IL-33-ST2L and the IL-33 decoy receptor sST2 in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer is unclear. Because we previously reported that sST2 derived from colon cancer cells profoundly influences malignant tumor growth, we hypothesized that sST2 released from pancreatic cancer cells also modulates IL-33-ST2L signaling in the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor growth. Methods ST2 (ST2L and sST2) expression in mouse pancreatic cancer Panc02 cells was downregulated by shRNAs. mRNA expression levels of IL-33, ST2, cytokines and chemokines in the cells and tumor tissues were examined using real-time PCR. sST2 secretion and the amount of CXCL3 in tumor tissues were measured using ELISA. Tumor growth was investigated after injection of the cells into the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice. MPO+, F4/80+ and CD20+ cells in tumor tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry. Results Some but not all human and mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines preferentially expressed sST2. Then, we investigated the role of sST2 in orthotopic tumor growth of sST2-expressing mouse pancreatic cancer Panc02 cells in immunocompetent mice. shRNA-mediated knockdown of sST2 expression in the cells suppressed orthotopic tumor growth, which was partially recovered by overexpression of shRNA-resistant sST2 mRNA but was not evident in IL-33 knockout mice. This was associated with decreases in Cxcl3 expression, vessel density and accumulation of cancer-associated neutrophils but not cancer-associated macrophages. Administration of SB225002, an inhibitor of the CXCL3 receptor CXCR2, induced similar effects. Conclusions Cancer cell-derived sST2 enhances tumor growth through upregulation of CXCL3 via inhibition of IL-33-ST2L signaling in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that the sST2 and the CXCL3-CXCR2 axis could be therapeutic targets."

Only a few studies have reported on the host factors required for intracellular CHIKV trafficking. Here, we conducted an imaging-based siRNA screen to identify human host factors for intracellular trafficking that are involved in CHIKV infection, examined their interactions with CHIKV proteins, and investigated the contributions of these proteins to CHIKV infection. The results of the siRNA screen revealed that host endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are recruited during CHIKV infection. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that both structural and nonstructural CHIKV proteins interact with hepatocyte growth factor–regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), a component of the ESCRT-0 complex. We also observed that HGS co-localizes with the E2 protein of CHIKV and with dsRNA, a marker of the replicated CHIKV genome. Results from gene knockdown analyses indicated that, along with other ESCRT factors, HGS facilitates both genome replication and post-translational steps during CHIKV infection. Moreover, we show that ESCRT factors are also required for infections with other alphaviruses. We conclude that during CHIKV infection, several ESCRT factors are recruited via HGS and are involved in viral genome replication and post-translational processing of viral proteins.

Effective control measures for CHIKF are desired; however, no commercial vaccines or effective antiviral treatments currently exist. To develop new treatment strategies for CHIKV infection, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIKV infection is required. The genome of CHIKV is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA composed of two open reading frames, encoding both nonstructural and structural polyproteins. The nonstructural proteins (nsPs), consisting of nsP1–4, are required for transcription and replication of viral RNA (12Solignat M. Gay B. Higgs S. Briant L. Devaux C. Replication cycle of chikungunya: a re-emerging arbovirus.Virology. 2009; 393 (19732931): 183-19710.1016/j.virol.2009.07.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 13Rupp J.C. Sokoloski K.J.

The structural proteins (sPs), comprising the capsid (C) and envelope glycoproteins (E2 and E1), are the main constituents of virus particles and facilitate receptor binding and cellular entry (12Solignat M. Gay B. Higgs S. Briant L. Devaux C. Replication cycle of chikungunya: a re-emerging arbovirus.Virology. 2009; 393 (19732931): 183-19710.1016/j.virol.2009.07.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Voss J.E. Vaney M.C.

The CHIKV replication cycle begins with cellular attachment and entry via endocytosis (15van Duijl-Richter M.K. Hoornweg T.E. Rodenhuis-Zybert I.A. Smit J.M. Early events in chikungunya virus infection—from virus cell binding to membrane fusion.Viruses. 2015; 7 (26198242): 3647-367410.3390/v7072792Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The post-entry steps of CHIKV have not been fully characterized, but genome replication may take place both at the plasma membrane and type I cytopathic vacuoles (CPV-I), based on data obtained with other alphaviruses (e.g. Semliki Forest virus (SFV)) (16Spuul P.

Colocalization of SFV nsPs and newly synthesized viral RNAs is initially observed in spherule structures near the plasma membrane (16Spuul P. Balistreri G. Kääriäinen L. Ahola T.

A variety of enveloped viruses can exploit the cellular endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) in their infection steps (26Votteler J. Sundquist W.I. Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 (24034610): 232-24110.1016/j.chom.2013.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the ESCRT pathway, which is highly conserved across Eukarya, ubiquitinated proteins are sorted into the multivesicular bodies by deforming the membrane inward. A series of four distinct complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III) and VPS4 proteins are sequentially recruited for membrane deformation (27Henne W.M. Buchkovich N.J. Emr S.D. The ESCRT pathway.Dev.

Because HIV-1 was initially reported to engage the ESCRT pathway to acquire its envelope and pinch off viral particles during the budding step, other enveloped viruses have been shown to employ this pathway for their budding steps (26Votteler J. Sundquist W.I. Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 (24034610): 232-24110.1016/j.chom.2013.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Whereas VPS4 is required for the budding of a variety of viruses, SFV was shown to bud from cells independent of both VPS4 and ubiquitin, suggesting a possible ESCRT-independent budding process (28Taylor G.M. Hanson P.I. Kielian M. Ubiquitin depletion and dominant-negative VPS4 inhibit rhabdovirus budding without affecting alphavirus budding.J.

However, the putative roles of ESCRT factors in infection of other alphaviruses have not been examined. The molecular mechanisms of viral trafficking by ESCRT factors remain to be elucidated. Herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus (DENV), and Japanese encephalitis virus utilize ESCRT factors, whereas their late assembly domains (L domains) known to serve as a viral motif to recruit ESCRT factors are still undiscovered (29Barouch-Bentov R.

Unique requirement for ESCRT factors in flavivirus particle formation on the endoplasmic reticulum.Cell Rep. 2016; 16 (27545892): 2339-234710.1016/j.celrep.2016.07.068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among viruses, even within the same families, interactions between viruses and ESCRT factors appear different (26Votteler J. Sundquist W.I. Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 (24034610): 232-24110.1016/j.chom.2013.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the role of ESCRT factors in viral infection differs from virus to virus. Genome-wide screens using CHIKV-infected cells have identified a variety of host factors required for CHIKV infection; however, host trafficking factors have not been fully characterized (37Zhang R.

In this study, we have identified components of the ESCRT machinery required for CHIKV infection through siRNA screens. Subsequently, we have characterized the interaction of the identified ESCRT factors with CHIKV and a role for ESCRT factors in CHIKV infection. Our findings clearly demonstrated the importance of the host ESCRT trafficking machinery in the CHIKV replication cycle. To identify the trafficking genes required for CHIKV infection, we performed imaging-based siRNA screens. siRNAs against 73 trafficking genes belonging to the RAB, RHO, ARF/SAR, GOLGIN, and ESCRT families were selected for the screen. HEK293T cells were reverse-transfected with siRNA, cultured for 48 h, and then infected with CHIKV. The CHIKV infection rate was determined by dividing the number of CHIKV-positive cells by total cells. Three different siRNAs targeting the same gene product were examined independently. The heatmap was obtained by the relative cell count and relative infection rate in the presence of each siRNA (Fig. 1 and Table S1). For the siRNA screen, siRNA treatment was considered as a positive effect if the relative CHIKV infection rate of each siRNA treatment was <60% of control siRNA treatments and the relative cell count numbers of each siRNA treatment were >80% those of control siRNA treatments. Then we selected the gene as a hit if at least two of the three siRNAs targeting the same gene product had positive effects, to exclude potential off-target effects of each siRNA. As a result of the siRNA screen, we found 18 hits, including RAB (2 of 23), ARF/SAR (3 of 13), and ESCRT (13 of 29) genes, highlighted in red (Fig. 1). ARF3 and ARF4 in the ARF/SAR family were validated as hits, consistent with a previous report demonstrating the requirement of ARFs in CHIKV replication (39Zhang N. Zhang L. Key components of COPI and COPII machineries are required for chikungunya virus replication.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2017; 493 (28962860): 1190-119610.1016/j.bbrc.2017.09.142Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Strikingly, 13 of 29 of the investigated ESCRT genes were related to the CHIKV infection, and those genes belonged to multiple ESCRT complexes, including ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and VPS4. Moreover, siRNAs against some ESCRT genes, such as VPS37D and VPS4B, had great effects on CHIKV infection without the reduction of cell numbers. These results suggested that a series of ESCRT factors are involved in CHIKV infection. Because budding of SFV was considered independent of the ESCRT pathway, interactions between ESCRT factors and CHIKV infection have not been examined previously (28Taylor G.M. Hanson P.I. Kielian M. Ubiquitin depletion and dominant-negative VPS4 inhibit rhabdovirus budding without affecting alphavirus budding.J. Virol. 2007; 81 (17913808): 13631-1363910.1128/JVI.01688-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused our investigations on the ESCRT factors and examined their specific roles in CHIKV infection. To identify the ESCRT partners physically interacting with CHIKV proteins, we exogenously introduced HA-tagged host factors and FLAG-tagged CHIKV proteins and thereafter performed anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Following the co-IP experiments with anti-HA antibody, precipitated CHIKV proteins combined with HA-tagged ESCRT proteins were detected with anti-FLAG antibody. We selected eight ESCRT-related factors in these studies. HGS, also known as Hrs, and STAM1 belong to the ESCRT-0 complex and act as a sorting machinery that recognizes ubiquitinated receptors (27Henne W.M. Buchkovich N.J. Emr S.D. The ESCRT pathway.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21 (21763610): 77-9110.1016/j.devcel.2011.05.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). TSG101 (ESCRT-I) and ESCRT-associated proteins (ALIX and NEDD4 (E3 ubiquitin protein ligase)) are reported to bind to viral L domains (26Votteler J. Sundquist W.I. Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14 (24034610): 232-24110.1016/j.chom.2013.08.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). VPS37D (ESCRT-I), CHMP4B (ESCRT-III), and VPS4B (VPS4 proteins) were considered as potential interactors with CHIKV proteins, because siRNA treatments against them markedly reduced CHIKV infection rates with little reduction of the relative cell count in the siRNA screen (Fig. 1). In addition, we also examined the arrestin domain–containing protein ARRDC1, which can recruit ESCRT factors at the plasma membrane in an L domain–dependent viral budding process (40Rauch S. Martin-Serrano J. Multiple interactions between the ESCRT machinery and arrestin-related proteins: implications for PPXY-dependent budding.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21191027): 3546-355610.1128/JVI.02045-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A total of seven CHIKV proteins were examined (C, E1, E2, and nsP1–4). Immunoblot analyses of IP fractions showed that HGS strongly interacted with E1, E2, and nsP4 (Fig. 2, A and B). The co-IP results of nsP3 fractions were excluded, because exogenously expressed FLAG-nsP3 was nonspecifically precipitated with anti-HA antibody (data not shown). The obtained results were confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation with FLAG-tagged CHIKV proteins and detection of HA-tagged ESCRT proteins with anti-HA antibody. Co-IP results showed that HGS interacted with E1, E2, and nsP4 (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, specific bands for NEDD4 were detected in the nsP1, nsP3, and nsP4 fractions, and TSG101 bands were detected in the nsP3 and nsP4 fractions (Fig. 2D). We excluded the results of VPS37D and CHMP4B fractions, because exogenously expressed HA-VPS37D and CHMP4B were nonspecifically precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). These results showed that HGS interacted with both sPs and nsPs of CHIKV, suggesting that HGS may have a critical role in multiple steps of CHIKV infection. Then we examined the interaction of HGS and CHIKV E2 in CHIKV-infected cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with either HA-HGS– or HA-STAM1–expressing plasmid and thereafter inoculated with CHIKV. HA-tagged HGS but not STAM1 was recovered from the immunoprecipitates of CHIKV-infected cells with anti-CHIKV E2 antibody (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that CHIKV E2 interacts with HGS in CHIKV-infected cells. To further characterize the interactions of HGS with CHIKV proteins, we searched the HGS region responsible for binding to CHIKV proteins using truncated HGS mutants lacking amino acid residues 1–277, 278–527, or 528–777 (Δ1–277, Δ278–527, or Δ528–777, respectively). HA-tagged truncated HGS mutants were immunoprecipitated, followed by detection of CHIKV proteins. The IP fractions indicated that HGS Δ278–527 had markedly reduced binding ability to CHIKV E1, E2, and nsP4 compared with full-length HGS protein (WT), Δ1–277, and Δ528–777 (Fig. 3B). The reciprocal experiments confirmed that HGS Δ278–527 also failed to bind to CHIKV E1, E2, and nsP4 (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that the amino acid residues 278–527 of HGS play an important role in binding to CHIKV sPs and nsPs. Next, we examined the interactions of HGS and CHIKV in CHIKV-infected cells by confocal microscopy. As commercially available antibodies failed to visualize endogenous HGS in Huh-7 cells, probably due to the low level of endogenous HGS protein that has been reported previously (41Chou S.F. Tsai M.L. Huang J.Y. Chang Y.S. Shih C. The dual role of an ESCRT-0 component HGS in HBV transcription and naked capsid secretion.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26431433): e100512310.1371/journal.ppat.1005123Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we generated Huh-7 cells stably expressing HGS (HGS-Huh-7 cells). We then confirmed that the distribution of HGS was similar to the distribution of endogenous HGS in HeLa cells, as shown in the previous report (42Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Hrs, a tyrosine kinase substrate with a conserved double zinc finger domain, is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (9252367): 20538-2054410.1074/jbc.272.33.20538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); the dotlike signals of HGS were detected in the cytoplasm of mock-infected HGS-Huh-7 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, the morphology and growth activity of HGS-Huh-7 cells was similar to the parent HGS cells. Using HGS-Huh-7 cells, we first examined the localization of HGS and CHIKV E2 at 12 h post-infection (hpi) of CHIKV. As shown in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 4A, colocalization of HGS and CHIKV E2 was observed in the cytoplasm of CHIKV-infected HGS-Huh-7 cells. Next, we examined colocalization of the HGS and CHIKV replication site. To achieve this, we applied anti-dsRNA antibody, as dsRNA is exclusively expressed in the CHIKV replication site in CHIKV-infected cells (43Remenyi R. Gao Y. Hughes R.E. Curd A. Zothner C. Peckham M. Merits A. Harris M. Persistent replication of a chikungunya virus replicon in human cells is associated with presence of stable cytoplasmic granules containing nonstructural protein 3.J. Virol. 2018; 92 (29875241): e00477-1810.1128/JVI.00477-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Colocalization of HGS and dsRNA in the cytoplasm of CHIKV-infected cells was confirmed (middle and bottom panels, Fig. 4B). Taken together, the ESCRT protein, HGS, colocalized with CHIKV structural protein and replication sites in CHIKV-infected cells. Thus, we next examined CH"

Single-species recovery thus becomes a focus (often with socio-political implications), whereas a more economical approach would be the transition to multi-targeted management (= MTM). This challenge is best represented in Midwestern North America where biodiversity has been impacted by 300+ years of chronic anthropogenic disturbance such that native tall-grass prairie is now supplanted by an agroecosystem. Here, we develop an MTM with a population genetic metric to collaboratively manage three Illinois upland gamebirds: common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus; pheasant), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus; quail), and threatened-endangered (T&E) greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus; prairie chicken). We first genotyped our study pheasant at 19 microsatellite DNA loci and identified three captive breeding stocks (N = 143; IL Department of Natural Resources) as being significantly bottlenecked, with relatedness >1st-cousin (μR = 0.158). ‘Wild’ (non-stocked) pheasant [N = 543; 14 Pheasant-Habitat-Areas (PHAs)] were also bottlenecked, significantly interrelated (μR = 0.150) and differentiated (μFST = 0.047), yet distinct from propagation stock. PHAs that encompassed significantly with larger areas also reflected greater effective population sizes (μNE = 43; P<0.007). We juxtaposed these data against previously published results for prairie chicken and quail, and found population genetic structure driven by drift, habitat/climate impacts, and gender-biased selection via hunter-harvest. Each species (hunter-harvested or T&E) is independently managed, yet their composite population genetic baseline provides the quantitative criteria needed for an upland game bird MTM. Its implementation would require agricultural plots to be rehabilitated/reclaimed using a land-sharing/sparing portfolio that differs markedly from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), where sequestered land decreases as agricultural prices escalate. Cost-savings for an MTM would accrue by synchronizing single-species management with a dwindling hunter-harvest program, and by eliminating propagation/stocking programs. This would sustain not only native grasslands and their resident species, but also accelerate conservation at the wildlife-agroecosystem interface."

Methods We conducted a double-blind randomized study in University Hospital Centre in France. We included women presenting either perineal tears or an episiotomy after vaginal delivery (instrumental assisted or not). The participants were randomly assigned to RF or not at day 1 and day 2 postpartum. The primary outcome was pain evaluated as visual analog scale (VAS) score >4 at rest on day 2 after the treatment. Secondary outcomes included discomfort and pain while walking and seating two days after treatment, type of pain two days after treatment and analgesics intake two days after treatment, sexual intercourse retake and painful of intercourse were also assessed by phone call 30 days after delivery. We performed univariate analysis and multivariable regressions adjusting on the value of the outcome at baseline to improve precision of the estimated intervention effect. Results Between June 1, 2017 and October 8, 2017, the RF group included 29 women compared with 31 women in the group without RF. There was no significant difference on VAS >4 between the two groups (13.8% vs. 9.7% p = 0.69; difference = 4.1%, 95%CI -12.2%- 20.4%); consumption of paracetamol was lower in the RF group (978.3 mg (sd = 804.5) vs 1703.7 mg (sd = 1381.6), p = 0.035; difference = -725.3 mg, 95%CI -1359.6 - -91.3). Multivariate analysis showed no association between RF and pain. Nevertheless, we found an association between RF and discomfort while walking (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07–0.90; p = 0.03). Conclusion VAS>4 at day 2 was not different in the experimental and the control groups but RF was associated with less perineal discomfort while walking and lower consumption of paracetamol after delivery.

https://openalex.org/W3020059057,"Chaperonins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones found in all domains of life. They form ring-shaped complexes that assist in the folding of substrate proteins in an ATP-dependent reaction cycle. Key to the folding cycle is the transient encapsulation of substrate proteins by the chaperonin. Here we present a structural and functional characterization of the chaperonin gp146 (ɸEL) from the phage EL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ɸEL, an evolutionarily distant homolog of bacterial GroEL, is active in ATP hydrolysis and prevents the aggregation of denatured protein in a nucleotide-dependent manner. However, ɸEL failed to refold the encapsulation-dependent model substrate rhodanese and did not interact with E. coli GroES, the lid-shaped co-chaperone of GroEL. ɸEL forms tetradecameric double-ring complexes, which dissociate into single rings in the presence of ATP. Crystal structures of ɸEL (at 3.54 and 4.03 Å) in presence of ATP•BeFx revealed two distinct single-ring conformational states, both with open access to the ring cavity. One state showed uniform ATP-bound subunit conformations (symmetric state), whereas the second combined distinct ATP- and ADP-bound subunit conformations (asymmetric state). Cryo-electron microscopy of apo-ɸEL revealed a double-ring structure composed of rings in the asymmetric state (3.45 Å resolution). We propose that the phage chaperonin undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational switching between double- and single rings and functions in aggregation prevention without substrate protein encapsulation. Thus, ɸEL may represent an evolutionarily more ancient chaperonin prior to acquisition of the encapsulation mechanism."

Due to their plasticity and ability to adapt to the local microenvironment in a tissue-dependent manner, macrophages display polar functional phenotypes characterized by their cell surface markers and their cytokine profiles. We found accumulation of hemoglobin-scavenging cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163)(+) macrophages in laser-induced CNV lesions and higher expression of CD163(+) monocytes in the peripheral blood on day 7 post injury in mice. In comparison, CD80(+) macrophages did not differ with laser-injury in young or aged mice and did not significantly change in the peripheral blood of CNV mice. We examined the percentages of CD163(+), CD206(+), and CD80(+) monocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with wet AMD, patients with dry AMD, and in age-matched individuals without AMD as controls. Percentages of peripheral blood CD163(+) monocytes in both dry AMD (P < .001) and wet AMD (P < .05) were higher than in age-matched non-AMD controls, while there was no difference between the groups in the percentages of peripheral CD206(+) and CD80(+) monocytes. Further, serum level of soluble CD163 (sCD163) was elevated only in patients with wet AMD (P < .05). An examination of 40 cytokine levels across the study groups revealed that anti-VEGF treated patients with wet AMD, who showed no exudative signs on the day of blood drawing had a cytokine profile that was similar to that of non-AMD individuals. These results indicate that CD163 could be further evaluated for its potential as a useful marker of disease activity in patients with neovascular AMD. Future studies will address the origin and potential mechanistic role of CD163(+) macrophages in wet AMD pathologies of angiogenesis and leakage of blood components."
https://openalex.org/W3017836125,"Emerging evidence suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis affects a variety of complex behaviors, including social, emotional, and depressive-like behaviors. Peyer's patches (PPs), a well-characterized gut-associated lymphoid tissue, are the entry site for luminal antigens and the initiation site for antigen-specific immune responses. However, few studies have explored the composition of lymphoid tissue-resident commensal bacteria (LRCs) in stress-associated disorders. Male C57BL/6 mice exposed to chronic social stress were analyzed for microbiome on the interior of PPs and changes in inflammation. Susceptible mice (SUS) exhibited a composition of bacteria inside PPs that was distinct from that of control (CON) and resilient (RES) mice, including an increase in Candidatus Arthromitus (SFB) and a decrease in Lactobacillus. The CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells were significantly reduced in SUS mice. Relative mRNA levels of IL-2 were significantly reduced in SUS mice, and the mRNA levels of Bcl-6, IFN-γ, IL-6, and the IgA protein levels in the ileum were significantly increased. Moreover, in the prefrontal cortex of SUS mice, IL-6 and TNF-α were increased, whereas IL-10 was decreased. The correlational analyses revealed that social interaction ratio was negatively correlated with SFB and positively associated with Lactobacillus and four other candidate protective organisms. These results pointed the possibility that the changes in the LRCs induced by chronic social defeat stress were ultimately associated with the inflammation of the brain and exacerbation of depressive-like behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3018113734,"The field of angiogenesis research provides deep understanding regarding this important process, which plays fundamental roles in tissue development and different abnormalities. In vitro models offer the advantages of low-cost high-throughput research of angiogenesis while sparing animal lives, and enabling the use of human cells. Nevertheless, prevailing in vitro models lack stability and are limited to a few days' assays. This study, therefore, examines the hypothesis that closely mimicking the vascular microenvironment can more reliably support longer angiogenesis processes in vitro. To this end, porcine arterial extracellular matrix (paECM)— a key component of blood vessels—was isolated and processed into a thermally induced hydrogel and characterized in terms of composition, structure, and mechanical properties, thus confirming the preservation of important characteristics of arterial extracellular matrix. This unique hydrogel was further tailored into a three-dimensional model of angiogenesis using endothelial cells and supporting cells, in a configuration that allows high-throughput quantitative analysis of cell viability and proliferation, cell migration, and apoptosis, thus revealing the advantages of paECM over frequently used biomaterials. Markedly, when applied with well-known effectors of angiogenesis, the model measures reflected the expected response, hence validating its efficacy and establishing its potential as a promising tool for the research of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3018718316,"Objective Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is characterised by intermittent hypoxemia, sympathetic activation and widespread endothelial dysfunction, sharing pathophysiologic features with the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We sought to determine whether coexisting SDB would adversely impact the outcomes of women with gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE), and healthy matched controls. Study design Women diagnosed with GH or PE along with BMI- and gestation-matched normotensive controls underwent polysomnography in late pregnancy to establish the presence or absence of SDB (RDI ≥ 5). Clinical outcomes of hypertensive disease severity were compared between groups, and venous blood samples were taken in the third trimester and at delivery to examine for any impact of SDB on the anti-angiogenic markers of PE. Results Data was available for 17 women with PE, 24 women with GH and 44 controls. SDB was diagnosed in 41% of the PE group, 63% of the GH group and 39% of the control group. Women with PE and co-existing SDB did not have worse outcomes in terms of gestation at diagnosis of PE (SDB = 29.1 (25.9, 32.1) weeks vs. no SDB = 32.0 (29.0, 33.9), p = n.s.) and days between diagnosis of PE and delivery (SDB = 20.0 (4.0, 35.0) days vs. no SDB = 10.5 (9.0, 14.0), p = n.s.). There were also no differences in severity of hypertension, antihypertensive treatment and biochemical, haematological and anti-angiogenic markers of PE between SDB and no SDB groups. Similar results were observed among women with GH. Healthy control women with SDB were no more likely to develop a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in the later stages of pregnancy (SDB = 5.9% vs. no SDB = 7.4%, p = n.s.). Increasing the threshold for diagnosis of SDB to RDI ≥ 15 did not unmask a worse prognosis. Conclusion The presence of SDB during pregnancy did not worsen the disease course of GH or PE, and was not associated with high blood pressure or anti-angiogenic markers of hypertensive disease amongst healthy pregnant women. Given the numerous reports of the relationship between SDB and diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, it appears more work is required to distinguish causal, versus confounding, pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3019652976,"In marine environments, tropical and subtropical habitats are considered to be inherently less productive than more temperate systems. As such, foraging site fidelity among vertebrate predators occupying low-latitude marine systems is generally low as a response to an increased unpredictability of resources. We investigated the foraging movements of Masked Boobies breeding on Middle Cay, Jamaica using GPS loggers to examine if the presence of a nearby bathymetric feature influenced foraging site fidelity in a tropical system, the Caribbean Sea. According to the movements of tracked individuals, this population of boobies shows a high degree of spatial fidelity in foraging site selection, concentrated on the northern edge of Pedro Bank. We suggest this feature as an important location for marine conservation in the region and demonstrate its utility to foraging boobies via habitat modeling using a maximum entropy approach of relevant habitat variables. Finally, we place this study into the global context of Masked Booby foraging by examining the published literature of relevant tracking studies for population-level similarity in foraging metrics. According to hierarchical clustering of foraging effort, Masked Boobies demonstrate a density-dependent response to foraging effort regardless of colony origin or oceanic basin consistent with the principles of Ashmole's Halo."
https://openalex.org/W3020439402,"Background Rabies is a vaccine-preventable neglected tropical viral zoonosis. It occurs worldwide, creating a very heavy burden in many developing countries, including Nepal. Dogs are the principle vector for the transmission of this disease in urban areas. Vaccination is the most important preventive measure in areas where dogs are the principle source of infection. This study was conducted with the aim of detecting virus-neutralising antibodies and associated factors against rabies in vaccinated household dogs of Kathmandu valley. Methods Blood samples were collected from 110 vaccinated pet dogs in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur districts of Nepal. The samples were taken to the laboratory of the National Zoonosis and Food Hygiene Research Center where serum was separated. An indirect immune-enzymatic assay (PlateliaTM Rabies II kit ad usum Veterinarium, Biorad, China) was used for the detection of rabies virus anti-glycoprotein antibodies in the dog serum samples following the manufacturer’s recommendations and instructions. Optical density values for unknown samples were compared with the positive sera titers in quantification tests obtained after a direct reading on the standard curve. Results were expressed as equivalent units per ml (EU/ml). Findings Of the total samples, 89.09% exceeded the required seroconversion level (≥ 0.5 EU/ml); another 9.09% did not reach the seroconversion level (0.125–0.5 EU/ml); and 1.81% had undetectable seroconversion levels (<0.125 EU/ml) suggesting that the animal had not seroconverted according to the PLATELIA™ RABIES II test. Only one factor, the condition under which the dog was kept, was significantly associated with the antibody titer level. No association was found for any of the other factors included in the study. Interpretation Vaccination is the most effective measure for prevention and control of rabies. The locally manufactured brand of vaccine, which is available in Nepal, is potent enough to generate a sufficient amount of protective antibodies, equal to international brands."
https://openalex.org/W3020504002,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most predominant cause of HCC. Concerns arise for the presence of additional risk factors, as there is still a large proportion of patients without HBV or HCV infection. Previous studies have reported that higher intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced consumption of red/processed meat might play a protective role in HCC etiology, though the nationwide proof is limited. Hence, we studied multiple risk factors including food habit, lifestyle, and clinical implications of HCC patients in Bangladeshi. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data, as well as data on food habits, were collected in this study. Our results indicated that a high intake of rice (AOR 4.28, 95% CI 1.48 to 14.07, p = 0.011), low intake of fruits (AOR = 4.41 95% CI 1.48–15.46; p = 0.012), leafy vegetables (AOR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.32–6.08; p = 0.008), and fish (AOR = 4.64 95% CI 2.18–10.23; p<0.001) increased the HCC risk. Moreover, a high intake of eggs (AOR = 2.07 95% CI 0.98–4.43; p = 0.058) also showed an increased risk. Roti, non-leafy vegetables, red meat, and tea were found to have no association with HCC risk. This study revealed that food habit patterns and lifestyle may have a profound effect on HCC development among Bangladeshi patients in addition to well established risk factors."

This study was designed to investigate ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc)-mediated attenuation of obesity and hyperglycemia in a mouse model. About 60% HFD-fed mice were treated intragastrically with CO-EtOAc for last 6 weeks, and body weight, blood biochemical parameters as well as hepatic inflammation response were investigated. Our results showed that CO-EtOAc treatment significantly reduced the formation of hepatic lipid droplets, body weight gain, blood glucose, and improved serum biochemical parameters in HFD-induced obese and insulin resistant mice. We further explored the molecular mechanism underlying the blood glucose modulating effect of CO-EtOAc using L6 myotubes model. We conclude that CO-EtOAc effectively increases the glycogen content and glucose uptake by stimulating the membrane translocation of glucose transporter 4. In addition, CO-EtOAc depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane and decreases the mitochondrial oxygen consumption, which may result in AMPK activation and the consequent mitochondrial fission. This study shows that CO-EtOAc prevents the development of obesity in mice fed with HFD and is also capable of stimulating glucose uptake. The possible mechanism might be due to the effects of CO-EtOAc on activation of AMPK and promotion of mitochondrial fission."
https://openalex.org/W3019030237,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an animal welfare and public health concern due to its ability to parasite livestock and potentially contaminate pork products. To reduce Salmonella shedding and the risk of pork contamination, antibiotic therapy is used and can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Here we hypothesized that immune system education by the microbiota can play a role in intestinal resilience to infection. We used amoxicillin (15mg/Kg) to modulate the intestinal microbiome of 10 piglets, paired with same age pigs that received a placebo (n = 10) from 0 to 14 days of age. Animals were euthanized at 4-weeks old. Each pig donated colon sections for ex vivo culture (n = 20 explants/pig). Explants were inoculated with S. Typhimurium, PBS or LPS (n = 6 explants/pig/group, plus technical controls). The gut bacteriome was characterized by sequencing of the 16S rRNA at 7, 21 days of age, and upon in vitro culture. Explants response to infection was profiled through high-throughput mRNA sequencing. In vivo antibiotic treatment led to β-diversity differences between groups at all times (P<0.05), while α-diversity did not differ between amoxicillin and placebo groups on day 21 and at euthanasia (P<0.03 on day 7). Explant microbiomes were not different from in vivo. In vitro challenge with S. Typhimurium led to lower necrosis scores in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs, when compared to explants placebo-treated pigs (P<0.05). This was coupled with the activation of immune-related pathways in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs (IL-2 production, NO production, BCR activation), when compared to placebo-treated pigs. In addition, several DNA repair and intestinal wound healing pathways were also only activated in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs. Taken together, these findings suggest that immune education by the amoxicillin-disturbed microbiota may have contributed to mitigate intestinal lesions following pathogen exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3019366701,"Addressing malnutrition is one of the key components of HIV care among people living with HIV. Since 2010, a nutritional program has been implemented to address malnutrition amongst HIV patients in Ethiopia, with patients enrolled in the program for 3 months (for mild acute malnutrition) and 6 months (for severe acute malnutrition). However, utilisation and effectiveness of the nutritional programs remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine individual level determinants and contextual factors influencing the effectiveness of the nutritional program in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.The study employed a mixed-methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative research methods. In the quantitative phase of the study, records from 1757 adult patients, including socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and nutritional program outcomes were retrieved from three selected hospitals in the Tigray region, Ethiopia. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the individual demographic and socioeconomic, clinical and immunological, and anthropometric and nutritional determinants of nutritional outcomes. The qualitative study included 33 individual interviews with adult patients, health providers, and program managers. Interview data were analysed using a framework analysis approach.Amongst study participants, 55.3% (95% CI = 53.2‒57.4) recovered from malnutrition, 19% (95% CI, 17.3‒20.7) did not complete the program, and 21% (95% CI = 19.7‒23.4) completed the program but failed to recover from malnutrition. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, those who were: living in urban areas (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.05‒1.97), employed (AOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.01‒1.93), attending Shul (AOR = 4.6, 95% CI = 3.15‒6.71) and Lemlem Karl (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.69‒3.71) hospitals, in clinical stages II (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.59‒3.91) and III (AOR = 1.46(1.02‒2.07), on ART for less than six months (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.09‒2.39), anaemic (AOR = 1.77, 95% = 1.29‒2.41), and diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition at enrolment (AOR = 6.43, 95% CI = 4.69‒8.3); were less likely to complete the program. Results for those who completed the program indicated that urban residence, (AOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.4‒2.91), attending Shul (AOR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.04‒4.19) and Lemlem Karl (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.05‒2.11) hospitals, having bedridden functional status (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.15‒0.83), advanced WHO clinical stage (WHO clinical stage IV) (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.28‒0.98) and severe malnutrition at enrolment (AOR = 4.25, 95% CI = 3.02‒5.98)) predicted non-response to the nutritional program. Qualitative interviews revealed that the taste and perceived side effects of the nutritional supplement provided as part of the nutritional program, sharing/selling practices, religious and sociocultural issues, distance and poor access to the health services were barriers to program utilisation. Nutritional counselling and health service-related factors such as a previous enrolment in the program and positive experience in the health service were enablers of program utilisation.There was a clear nexus between contextual factors such as distance, quality of health service and sociocultural factors, and individual patient characteristics with the effectiveness of the nutritional program. Taking individual and contextual factors into consideration in program design, planning and implementation is essential if the nutritional program in HIV care services is to achieve its goal in addressing malnutrition amongst people living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3019391052,"Background Tackling the increasing global problem of childhood overweight and obesity requires an integrated approach. Studies increasingly emphasize the importance of the parents’ role in interventions designed to prevent overweight in children. The aim of this study was to develop a unified set of recommendations for healthy parenting practices that can be applied by all professionals who work with children age 4–13 years and can contribute to strengthening the integrated approach to childhood overweight. Methods A modified Delphi procedure was used to reach consensus regarding what these pedagogical recommendations should encompass. The 30 panelists were professionals and researchers who work with children age 4–13 in the domains of health care, overweight, parenting, education, nutrition, and/or sports. The procedure consisted of: i) extracting existing pedagogical recommendations from national guidelines and professional protocols, ii) appraising and prioritizing these recommendations in terms of relevance through two rounds of questionnaires, and iii) meeting to discuss and approve the set of recommendations. Results Consensus was reached for one set of eleven pedagogical theme-based recommendations designed to support and instruct parents how to stimulate healthy energy balance‒related behaviors in their child. Each recommendation contained information regarding: i) which behaviors in the child and/or parent are important, ii) why this is important, and iii) how parents can stimulate this behavior by applying parenting skills in daily life. The eleven themes were: modeling, positive parenting, breakfast, varied diet, sugar-sweetened beverages, snacks, physical activity, playing sports, quantity of screen time, screen time during meals, and sleep. Conclusion We developed a set of recommendations for healthy parenting that can be used by various professionals working with children age 4–13 and can contribute to creating an integrated approach to childhood overweight. We also developed a web-based app called “Recommendations for Healthy Parenting” as a convenient tool for following these recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W3020346733,"Background Repeated practice to acquire expertise could result in the structural and functional changes in relevant brain circuits as a result of long-term potentiation, neurogenesis, glial genesis, and remodeling. Purpose The goal of this study is to use task fMRI to study the brain of expert radiologists performing a diagnosis task where a series of medical images were presented during fMRI acquisition for 12s and participants were asked to choose a diagnosis. Structural and diffusion-tensor MRI were also acquired. Methods Radiologists (N = 12, 11M, 38.2±10.3 years old) and non-radiologists (N = 17, 15M, 30.6±5.5 years old) were recruited with informed consent. Medical images were presented for 12 s and three multiple choices were displayed and the participants were asked to choose a diagnosis. fMRI, structural and diffusion-tensor MRI were acquired. fMRI analysis used FSL to determine differences in fMRI responses between groups. Voxel-wise analysis was performed to determine if subcortical volume, cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy differed between groups. Correction for multiple comparisons used false discovery rate. Results Radiologists showed overall lower task-related brain activation than non-radiologists. Radiologists showed significantly lower activation in the left lateral occipital cortex, left superior parietal lobule, occipital pole, right superior frontal and precentral gyri, lingual gyrus, and the left intraparietal sulcus (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between groups in cortical thickness, subcortical volume and fractional anisotropy (p>0.05). Conclusions Radiologists and non-radiologists had no significant difference in structural metrics. However, in diagnosis tasks, radiologists showed markedly lower task-related brain activations overall as well as a number of high-order visual and non-visual brain regions than non-radiologists. Some brain circuits appear to be uniquely associated with differential-diagnosis paradigm expertise that are not involved in simpler object-recognition cases. Improved understanding of the brain circuitry involved in acquisition of expertise might be used to design optimal training paradigms."

A variety of mRNAs are delivered to dendrites and axons and translated in response to synaptic activation (4Holt C.E. Martin K.C. Schuman E.M. Local translation in neurons: visualization and function.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 (31270476): 557-56610.1038/s41594-019-0263-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To date, genetic and biochemical approaches have been used to visualize mRNAs in living cells. Aptamer-based RNA imaging techniques have been widely applied (5Urbanek M.O. Galka-Marciniak P. Olejniczak M. Krzyzosiak W.J. RNA imaging in living cells—methods and applications.RNA Biol. 2014; 11 (25483044): 1083-109510.4161/rna.35506Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The MS2 system is the most popular one and enables highly sensitive and specific imaging of transcripts (6Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 (9809065): 437-44510.1016/S1097-2765(00)80143-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). However, this method requires genetic manipulation of the target RNA sequence by inserting multiple aptamer-binding sequences. Many studies using the MS2 system exogenously expressed abundant target RNAs containing the MS2-binding sequence, which can lead to biased results due to overexpression. Singer's group knocked in the MS2- or PP7-binding sequence to the 3′-UTRs of target RNAs (7Park H.Y. Lim H. Yoon Y.J. Follenzi A. Nwokafor C. Lopez-Jones M. Meng X. Singer R.H.

Switch-on fluorogenic hybridization probes have been used to investigate the dynamics of unmodified mRNAs. The peptidic Pumilio homology domain RNA probe binds to RNA in a sequence-specific manner by recognizing eight conterminous bases, thus allowing spatiotemporal analysis of endogenous RNA localization (9Ozawa T.

To label native mRNA, we used the reduction-triggered fluorescence (RETF) probe technique (15Abe H. Wang J. Furukawa K. Oki K. Uda M. Tsuneda S. Ito Y. A reduction-triggered fluorescence probe for sensing nucleic acids.Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19 (18476727): 1219-122610.1021/bc800014dCrossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which consists of a pair of oligonucleotides conjugated with a nonfluorescent azidomethyl fluorescein derivative as a fluorogenic tag and with triphenylphosphine as a reducing reagent (Fig. 1A). The RETF probe emits fluorescence after the pair of probes hybridize to the target mRNA side by side and a reducing reaction between them occurs. The RETF probe detected endogenous mRNA at the single-nucleotide-mismatched level in fixed bacterial and living human cells (15Abe H. Wang J. Furukawa K. Oki K. Uda M. Tsuneda S. Ito Y.

Although the high signal-to-background ratio (S/B) of the RETF probe, reaching 2400:1 (15Abe H. Wang J. Furukawa K. Oki K. Uda M. Tsuneda S. Ito Y. A reduction-triggered fluorescence probe for sensing nucleic acids.Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19 (18476727): 1219-122610.1021/bc800014dCrossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), stands out among RNA probes (e.g. the best S/B of FRET-based RNA probes reported was 50:1 (18Marras S.A.E. Kramer F.R. Tyagi S. Efficiencies of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and contact-mediated quenching in oligonucleotide probes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 (12409481): e12210.1093/nar/gnf121Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)), background fluorescence derived from reduced probes dissociated from target mRNA complicates quantitative analyses. We adopted the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) method to overcome the background issue of the RETF probe. FCS allows quantification of the diffusion coefficient and concentration of fluorescently labeled biomolecules in living cells based on fluorescence fluctuation analysis within a tiny focal spot, which is small enough to measure molecular dynamics in not only neuronal dendrites (19Gennerich A. Schild D. Anisotropic diffusion in mitral cell dendrites revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.Biophys.

Two-photon correlation spectroscopy in single dendritic spines reveals fast actin filament reorganization during activity-dependent growth.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26020927): e012824110.1371/journal.pone.0128241PubMed Google Scholar). Autocorrelation functions calculated from the fluorescence fluctuation are fitted with theoretical diffusion models, and quantitative parameters are deduced. With fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, which is closely related to FCS, quantitative measurements of MS2-labeled β-actin mRNA were performed (21Wu B. Chao J.A. Singer R.H. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy enables quantitative imaging of single mRNAs in living cells.Biophys.

FCS discriminates diffusing molecule species of different diffusion coefficients, which are mainly influenced by the radius of gyration of the diffusion molecules and the viscosity of the medium. The radii of gyration of mRNA bound with RETF probes and free RETF probes were expected to be sufficiently different to be distinguished by diffusion coefficients. Numerous mRNA types, such as activity-regulated cytoskeleton protein (Arc; also known as Arg3.1), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (Ip3r1), and Ca2+/CaM kinase IIα (CaMKIIα), are distributed in the dendrites of central nervous system neurons. The immediate early gene, Arc, plays a role in activity-dependent synaptic modifications. Arc mRNA is robustly expressed by synaptic activity and then rapidly delivered throughout dendrites (23Link W. Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Krug M. Schwanke B. Frey U. Kuhl D. Somatodendritic expression of an immediate early gene is regulated by synaptic activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Newly synthesized Arc mRNA transcripts are selectively localized at activated synapses by an activity-dependent mRNA degradation mechanism, which eliminates Arc mRNA from inactive dendritic regions (27Farris S.

Whereas the MS2 system was previously used to visualize the 3′-UTR of Ip3r1 mRNA, its use was limited to the detection of colocalization with RNA-interacting proteins (38Bannai H. Fukatsu K.

In this study, we aimed to develop a technique to assess the dynamics of nonengineered endogenous mRNAs using the RETF probe together with FCS. We first tested whether RETF probes can detect Arc and Ip3r1 mRNAs in neuron. Subsequently, we employed FCS to discriminate mRNA-unbound and -bound probes by the difference in their diffusion coefficients. And finally, we tried out this approach by monitoring changes in the diffusion coefficient and concentration of Arc mRNA by neuronal activation. This combined RETF probe-FCS method, as demonstrated here, has a potential to distinguish RNA-bound and -unbound probes by diffusion patterns, providing semi-quantitative estimations of endogenous and unmodified mRNAs in living neurons. We designed two RETF probes targeting different mRNA locations, termed target 1 and target 2, for Arc mRNA and Ip3r1 mRNA, respectively. The target sequences were chosen from locations where successful in situ hybridization results were reported. To test whether the RETF probes can detect target RNAs in living neurons, we introduced sets of RETF probes targeting Arc mRNA or Ip3r1 mRNA into hippocampal neurons by the whole-cell patch-clamp method. The RETF probe-derived fluorescence signal started to increase after patch-clamp formation in both soma and dendrites and was saturated within 40 min, whereas a mismatched probe pair consisting of the azidomethyl fluorescein (Az) probe of target 1 and the triphenylphosphine (TPP) probe of target 2 Arc RETF probes yielded no fluorescence signal more than autofluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C). Fluorescence signals derived from RETF probes targeting Arc or Ip3r1 mRNAs spread across the cytosol (Fig. 1D). Although the increase in fluorescence derived from the RETF probes was clear, there was a possibility that not all of the fluorescence signal was emitted from RETF probes bound to target mRNAs, as some of it may have been from RETF probes detached from target mRNAs. To test this, we performed FCS, which was expected to distinguish between the RNA-bound and -unbound forms of RETF probes by virtue of diffusion coefficients. As a control probe, we used a fluorescein-conjugated scramble probe: a 15-base ssDNA of a random sequence conjugated with fluorescein instead of reduced Az. The sequence was confirmed not to have a match in the rat RNA database. Laser power adjustment and focal volume calibration should be done periodically (Fig. 2A). The irradiance of the 488-nm blue laser was adjusted to around 5 microwatts at the tip of the ×60 objective, which was determined not to saturate the absorption of the fluorophore within the focused laser spot (40Kinjo M. Sakata H. Mikuni S. First steps for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of living cells.Live Cell Imaging. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2010: 229-238Google Scholar). The focal volume was determined as horizontal and vertical radii (rxy and rz, respectively) by fitting an autocorrelation function of 10 nm rhodamine 6G in PBS buffer to a one-component three-dimensional (3D) diffusion model, with a fixed diffusion coefficient of 414 μm2/s (41Müller C.B. Loman A. Pacheco V. Koberling F. Willbold D. Richtering W. Enderlein J. Precise measurement of diffusion by multi-color dual-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.EPL. 2008; 83: 4600110.1209/0295-5075/83/46001Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The diameter of the detection pinhole built in the FV-300 confocal system, which also determines the effective focal volume for FCS, was fixed to 150 μm for all FCS experiments, which was larger than the one optimal for confocality for the objective (100 μm) due to the low signal condition in this study. The resultant rxy and rz were 0.34 and 3.26 μm, respectively. The structure parameter (γ = rz/rxy; 9.6) was larger than the benchmark values (ranging from 3 to 8) in optimally aligned systems, and γ was 5.6 with the 100-μm-diameter pinhole in our system. In an in vitro condition, a RETF probe for Arc yielded autocorrelation functions after mixed with in vitro–transcribed Arc RNA (Fig. S1B), which were fitted well to a two-component diffusion model irrespective of the addition of the scramble probe. The addition of RNase A to the mixtures eliminated the slower diffusion components, leaving the faster diffusion component unchanged (Fig. S1C). The slower-diffusing component was thought to represent the RNA-RETF probe complex, because it was diminished by the RNase addition, and the concentration of it (Cslow) was decreased by the dilution with the scramble probe solutions (Fig. S1Dd). And we consider that the faster diffusion component observed in the RNA-RETF probe mixture without the addition of the scramble probe represented RETF probe molecules detached from RNA, because its diffusion coefficient (Dfast) was very similar to that of the scramble probe (Fig. S1Da). The concentration range of the fast and slow components (2–30 nm) indicates that our FCS system faithfully measures concentration at the low nanomolar range in cell-free conditions. Contribution of RETF probes that were directly reduced by the triphenylphosphine-tagged probes without binding to RNA should be negligible, because the fluorescence signal was not detectable in an in vitro RETF experiment with RETF probes without RNA. In intracellular experiments, neurons were loaded with the target 1 and/or target 2 RETF probes or with the scramble probe together with Alexa Fluor 594 biocytin by whole-cell patch clamp (Fig. 2Ba) in a separate inverted microscope setup from the confocal/FCS microscope in this study. If the confocal/FCS microscope allows the patch-clamp experiment, the same microscope can be used. Substances may be alternatively loaded by microinjection, whereas it is much more difficult to apply to neurons than to cell lines because neurons are fragile. The success rate of the patch-clamp dye loading method was 80% (147 trials) in this study. If substance loading by patch-clamp and FCS measurement are performed on a single microscope setup, keeping patch-clamping during FCS measurements is possible; however, that is not suggested because continuous exchange of contents between pipette and cytosol makes conditions complex. The co-injected marker, Alexa Fluor 594 biocytin dye, was necessary to identify the target cell after changing microscope and to capture clear shapes of the cells, because the fluorescence intensity of RETF probes is too dim to identify easily and to capture confocal images of sufficient quality. Due to the high sensitivity of FCS, a scant cross-talk from the marker fluorescence channel to the FCS fluorescence channel would cause serious deformations of autocorrelation curves. There was no detectable contamination of the Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence to the FCS recording channel. A stainless chamber holding a coverslip with neurons was transferred from the microscope for patch-clamp to the confocal/FCS microscope, and FCS measurement was performed. Neurons injected with probes and the marker Alexa Fluor 594 biocytin were identified by epifluorescence microscopy with the Alexa Fluor 594 biocytin fluorescence, and confocal images were taken and stored (Fig. 2Bb). FCS recording was performed at the earliest 5 min after the patch-clamp loading to gain enough RETF signals (see Fig. 1C). The recording point for FCS was located at the cytosol in the soma or locations in dendrites 30–50 μm away from the soma. The fluorescence intensity recorded at single points in cells often rapidly decayed during the first 2–3 s and then became relatively stable. We considered that this rapid decay of fluorescence signal derived from immobile fluorescence sources, which was not the subject of this study. Hence, at each recording point, we omitted the first 5 s of irradiance (Fig. 2Bc) and then started a series of FCS recordings (Fig. 2Bd; 5–12 times for 20 s in each cell). The waiting time for obtaining meaningful FCS results after loading RETF probe may depend on factors such as the concentration of target mRNA and the location of the recording point in the cell (e.g. cell body and distal or proximal dendrite). If an autocorrelation function is not smooth enough for fitting with diffusion models even after repeated records are averaged, the fluorescence signal is too weak for FCS analysis, and more time should be allowed (∼30 min; see the saturation of fluorescence signals in Fig. 1C). If acceptable signal intensity is not gained after trying several cells, it is possible that the target mRNA concentration in the target cell is not high enough for the RETF-FCS method or that the choice of target sequence is not appropriate. Although in cell-free FCS, longer recording time compensates for weak fluorescence signals, longer recording time, or more repetitions, results in too much photobleaching in intracellular FCS. Thus, the minimum limit of target RNA concentration is higher in intracellular FCS than cell-free FCS. More photostable fluorescence tags will be required for better sensitivity of intracellular FCS. Knowing the dendrite size is necessary for choosing appropriate diffusion models (42Gennerich A. Schild D. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in small cytosolic compartments depends critically on the diffusion model used.Biophys.

The dendritic width of target neurons for FCS measurement was measured at 30–50 μm away from the soma on Alexa Fluor 594 biocytin images (Fig. 2Ca; see Experimental Procedures), where FCS measurements in the dendrite were performed. Accordingly, the dendrite diameter ranged from 1.9 to 3.0 μm (2.5 ± 0.3 μm; Fig. 3B). The confinement degree is expressed as d/ri, using the dendritic diameter d and the focal radius r (42Gennerich A. Schild D. Fluorescence correlation spectrosc"
https://openalex.org/W3020276360,"Background We aim to investigate the rate of spontaneous sputum conversion and reversion in patients with Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) lung disease. Methods Among 241 patients diagnosed with MABC lung disease between July 2012 and December 2018, 126 patients with persistent sputum positivity for ≥ 6 months without treatment were enrolled at a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Patients were subdivided into two groups, depending on whether or not treatment was initiated within 2 years of diagnosis. The rates of spontaneous sputum culture conversion and reversion was investigated in patients who did not receive treatment within 2 years. Results The mean age of 126 patients was 62.9 years. During a mean follow-up duration of 3.2 years, 33 (26.2%) patients received treatment within 2 years of diagnosis. Among the remaining 93 patients not receiving treatment within 2 years, spontaneous sputum conversion occurred in 24 (25.8%) patients during a mean follow-up duration of 3.7 years after diagnosis. No significant differences were observed in time to conversion between Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium massiliense lung diseases. The Cox regression analysis showed that malignancy as a comorbid disease and the lower number of lobes involved were independent predictors of spontaneous sputum conversion. After spontaneous sputum conversion, reversion occurred in 27.8% patients at a median of 18.2 months after conversion. Conclusions Among patients with MABC lung disease who did not receive treatment for at least 2 years after diagnosis, approximately one-fourth experienced spontaneous conversion. However, not a few patients experienced reversion after spontaneous conversion."

To capture network dynamics and temporal variations in link strengths between various types of nodes in a network, a dynamic weighted heterogeneous network is to be considered. Link strength prediction in such networks is still an open problem. Moreover, a study of variations in link strengths with respect to time has not yet been explored. The time granularity at which the weights of various links change remains to be delved into. To tackle these problems, we propose a neural network framework to predict dynamic variations in weighted heterogeneous social networks. Our link strength prediction model predicts future relationships between people, along with a measure of the strength of those relationships. The experimental results highlight the fact that link weights and dynamism greatly impact the performance of link strength prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3019089563,"The popularity of social media has increased users' social visibility. However, users' limited ability to control information spread could compromise privacy. People care about how others perceive them. We examined people's concerns for others' evaluations on their behaviors under different degrees of privacy conditions. Using a variant of the dictator game, we induced dictators to self-select into pro-self or pro-social types and asked recipients to give written evaluations of the dictators. We varied the degree of personal information privacy by making the written content known to the corresponding dictators only, all dictators, or either of them with equal chance. Also, the dictators could avoid receiving the message at a price. We showed that pro-self dictators' willingness to pay to conceal messages decreased when information privacy diminished. Thus, results indicated that image concerns wane in an environment where information privacy is weak. Our results contribute to understanding of the privacy paradox."
https://openalex.org/W3017996023,"Despite the large number of studies devoted to organic matter dynamics in fluvial ecosystems, the detrital pathways of spring headwater systems remain neglected. In particular, spring wetlands (helocrenes or seepages) might have considerable influence on downstream headwater stream systems due to the alteration of the nutrient and organic matter content of the water. In this study, we examined fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) drained from helocrenic springs to describe its downstream transport. We studied the quantity, nutrient content and physical components of FPOM gathered from the outflowing water using continuous sediment samplers. The nutrient content of local leaf litter deposits, residence time of water in the springs and concentration of dissolved nutrients in spring sources and outflows were also measured to characterize the inputs and outputs of the studied system. The results show that headwater spring wetlands represent a significant source of high-quality FPOM for downstream river networks. The estimated concentration of FPOM (<1000 μm) in the 11 investigated springs was 3.1 ± 2.5 mg.L-1. In general, the FPOM was relatively nutrient-rich (N = 19.25 ± 4.73 mg.L-1; P = 2.04 ± 0.78 mg.L-1; Ca = 9.65 ± 2.63 mg.L-1; S = 4.07 ± 1.16 mg.L-1; C = 278.68 ± 80.81 mg.L-1). The C:N and C:P ratios in the local leaf litter deposits were higher than in FPOM (41.04 ± 14.32 vs. 14.70 ± 2.46 and 591.7 ± 168.83 vs. 154,77 ± 64,73, respectively), indicating that suspended FPOM is more nutritious for consumers. A significant trend in terms of size fractions of FPOM was identified: with decreasing C:N and C:P ratios particle size decreases as well. Overall, the data suggest that the relatively small helocrenes can serve as an organic matter transformers, receiving primary particles and dissolved organic matter, transforming them and favouring their transport downstream. These biotopes may represent a substantial discontinuity of the river continuum at its origin, important for nutrient dynamics and food supply of associated biotic communities."
