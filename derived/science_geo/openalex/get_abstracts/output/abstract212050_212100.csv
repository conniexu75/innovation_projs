https://openalex.org/W2077106628,"THE values of the reduction-potential of GSH (Em7 at pH 7.0) measured with different methods (indicator dyes1, electric measurements2–4, equilibrium with the NADPH2/ NADP-system5,6 mixed disulphides4,7 range from − 0.35 V to + 0.04 V. The GSSG-reductases catalyse the reaction : Earlier attempts to demonstrate the back-reaction by spectrophotometric estimation of the NADPH2-formation were unsuccessful8,9. Rall and Lehninger5 calculated that the Em7 GSH cannot be more negative than − 0.13 V (with the new value of Em7 NADPH2 (ref. 10) − 0.17 V); Mapson and Isherwood6 found with the very sensitive fluorometric method the formation of very small amounts of NADPH2 (0.9 × 10−3 µmol./ml.)."

Thus, fatty acid oxidation, synthesis, and release, oxygen uptake and glucose utilization, are profoundly and characteristically affected by temperature (l), nutrition (2, 3), hormones (4), age (5, 6), and the genetic constitution (7). The mechanism by which each adaptation is made in metabolism by adipose tissue is poorly understood. Recent studies of lipid metabolism in adipose tissue indicate that there may be a common change in lipid biosynthesis with aging and diabetes for, in both, the rate of fatty acid synthesis (5, 8) and oxygen uptake (9, 10) is markedly decreased. It has also been shown that there is a marked decrease in the synthesis of palmitoleic and oleic acids de noso in adipose tissue from old rats compared to young, which is repaired by the administration of insulin or by the feeding of a fat-free diet (6). In this report, studies on the incorporation of acetate-1-i4C and stearic acid-l-% in vitro into the individual fatty acids of the epididymal fat pad from normal, alloxan-diabetic, and insulin-treated rats are presented. These experiments show a marked depression in the amount and synthesis of the monounsaturated fatty acids of adipose tissue from diabetic rats. This defect is not repaired by the addition of insulin in"

https://openalex.org/W1969215596,"IN 1962 it was reported that pronethalol (I) (formerly ‘Nethalide’), a derivative of isoprenaline in which the catechol ring is replaced by naphthalene, was able to antagonize the (β-responses to sympathetic stimulation or sympathomimetic drugs1. It was afterwards shown2 that pronethalol approximately doubled the lethal dose of ouabain, completely prevented the onset of ventricular fibrillation during intoxication by cardiac glycosides, and restored a regular rhythm to guinea pig hearts which had already been made to fibrillate by an overdose of ouabain. Experiments on isolated rabbit atria3, from which action potentials were recorded with intracellular micro-electrodes, indicated that pronethalol was an anti-arrhythmic agent approximately twice as potent as quinidine, and with a similar mode of action. Since many anti-arrhythmic agents are also local anaesthetics, it was of interest to discover whether pronethalol also could produce local anæsthesia."

https://openalex.org/W2051955915,Euler and Ahlstrom1 found that salicylate inhibited glucose and lactate dehydrogenases and that the inhibitory effect of the drug on the latter enzyme could be removed by adding cozymase. Salicylate has also been shown to inhibit malate and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities in vitro and the inhibitions were reversed by either NAD or NADP2.

https://openalex.org/W2023574043,"A NUMBER of recent reports have dealt with inhibition of methylation in Streptomyces aureofaciens. Strains of this organism which normally synthesize chlortetracycline can be directed toward the production of the 6-demethyl analogue by adding a number of compounds to the medium. Such compounds have included a variety of sulphonamides1,2 and aminopterin3 which act as inhibitors of folic acid mediated C6-methylation. In addition ethionine3–5, and to some extent D-methionine5, when added to the medium have also caused 6-demethylchlortetracycline production presumably by acting as antagonists of L-methionine, the normal source of the 6 methyl group6."

https://openalex.org/W2036043049,"IN the course of a Brucella eradication programme in an adult vaccinated herd certain anomalies were noted in the immune responses of 6-months-old calves to Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccination. Calves were routinely tested for Brucella sero-agglutinins immediately prior to vaccination. A proportion of these calves had positive titles at this stage, and after vaccination a few of them showed no, or very little, rise in agglutinin titre. On checking the clinical status of the dams of such calves it was found that they were Brucella-infected animals. It seemed likely that these calves had been exposed to Brucella abortus at a very early age and often for a prolonged period. Therefore it was decided to set up a preliminary experiment to investigate the immune response of calves which had been experimentally exposed to virulent Brucella abortus during the early days of life."
