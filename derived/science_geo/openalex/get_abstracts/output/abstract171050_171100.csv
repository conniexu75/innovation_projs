https://openalex.org/W2145242708,"β-Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that mediate homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by binding to agonist-occupied receptors and by uncoupling them from heterotrimeric G proteins. The recent finding that β-arrestins bind to some mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases has suggested that they might also function as scaffolds for GPCR-stimulated MAP kinase activation. To define the role of β-arrestins in the regulation of ERK MAP kinases, we examined the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on ERK1/2 activation and nuclear signaling in COS-7 cells expressing angiotensin II type 1a receptors (AT1aRs). Expression of either β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 reduced angiotensin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis but paradoxically increased angiotensin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in β-arrestin-expressing cells correlated with activation of a β-arrestin-bound pool of ERK2. The β-arrestin-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was accompanied by a significant reduction in ERK1/2-mediated, Elk1-driven transcription of a luciferase reporter. Analysis of the cellular distribution of phospho-ERK1/2 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation revealed that overexpression of β-arrestin resulted in a significant increase in the cytosolic pool of phospho-ERK1/2 and a corresponding decrease in the nuclear pool of phospho-ERK1/2 following angiotensin stimulation. β-Arrestin overexpression resulted in formation of a cytoplasmic pool of β-arrestin-bound phospho-ERK, decreased nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2, and inhibition of Elk1-driven luciferase transcription even when ERK1/2 was activated by overexpression of cRaf-1 in the absence of AT1aR stimulation. These data demonstrate that β-arrestins facilitate GPCR-mediated ERK activation but inhibit ERK-dependent transcription by binding to phospho-ERK1/2, leading to its retention in the cytosol. β-Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that mediate homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by binding to agonist-occupied receptors and by uncoupling them from heterotrimeric G proteins.

In response to receptor occupancy, GPCRs promote the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit and dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ subunit heterodimer. Once dissociated, free Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits regulate the activity of enzymatic effectors, such as adenylyl cyclases and phospholipase C isoforms. For the majority of GPCRs, productive G protein coupling in the continued presence of agonist is terminated by receptor phosphorylation followed by the binding of arrestins (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Specialized G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate agonist-occupied GPCRs, increasing their affinity for arrestins. Upon binding the receptor, arrestins sterically block further coupling between GPCR and G protein. In addition, the two non-visual arrestins, β-arrestin1 and 2, target GPCRs for endocytosis by linking the GPCR to components of the cellular endocytic machinery, including clathrin and AP-2 (3Goodman Jr., O.B.

Besides their well characterized roles in GPCR desensitization and sequestration, recent evidence suggests that β-arrestins may also contribute to GPCR signaling by functioning as adaptors or scaffolds for the recruitment of signaling molecules into complex with agonist-occupied receptors. By binding to both the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src, and to agonist-occupied β2-adrenergic receptors, β-arrestin1 can confer tyrosine kinase activity upon the receptor (5Luttrell L.M.

Similarly, β-arrestins are involved in recruiting c-Src to the neurokinin-1 receptor in KNRK kidney epithelial cells (6DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Proc.

Recent reports also indicate that β-arrestins can interact directly with component kinases of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (6DeFea K.A.

Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 can also serve as a scaffold for the component kinases of the JNK3 cascade, facilitating JNK3 activation by binding directly to JNK3 and the MAP kinase kinase kinase, Ask1 (9McDonald P.H.

Although it is increasingly clear that β-arrestins can bind to some MAP kinases and facilitate their activation by GPCRs, little is known about the role of β-arrestins in regulating MAP kinase function. Depending on receptor and cell type, GPCRs have been shown to cause ERK1/2 activation by several distinct mechanisms (10Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol.

Some of these, such as the protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the small G protein Rap1 (10Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol.

Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), are classical second messenger-dependent pathways. In addition, many GPCRs trigger the “transactivation” of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor (15Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

In light of such diversity, the question arises as to whether these different pathways of ERK activation are functionally redundant or whether they serve specialized functions within the cell. To define better the role of β-arrestins in the regulation of the ERK MAP kinases, we have examined the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on ERK1/2 activation and nuclear signaling in COS-7 cells expressing AT1aR. We find that while β-arrestin expression enhances AT1aR-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK, the formation of β-arrestin-ERK complexes leads to cytosolic retention of the activated ERK. By spatially constraining activated ERK1/2, β-arrestins reduce the ability of AT1aRs to stimulate ERK1/2-dependent transcription. These data suggest that β-arrestins may serve to target activated ERK1/2 to non-nuclear substrates. LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. Monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG affinity agarose was from Sigma.

The pcDNA3 expression plasmids encoding FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin1 and -2 were created in our laboratory. COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE as described previously (20Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23155-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated overnight in serum-free growth medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 100 μg/ml gentamicin prior to stimulation. COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with the expression plasmid encoding HA-AT1aR (2 μg/plate), with or without plasmids encoding β-arrestin1 or -2 (3 μg/plate) as indicated. One day after transfection, cells were split to 12-well plates and incubated for 18–24 h withmyo-[3H]inositol at 4 μCi/ml in serum-free growth medium. After labeling, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and preincubated for 1 h in PBS at 37 °C. The PBS was removed, and cells were incubated in fresh PBS containing 20 mm LiCl for 20 min. Cells were then stimulated for 1 h with 1 μm angiotensin II. The reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid, and total inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on Dowex AG1-X8 columns, as described (21Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG epitope-tagged β-arrestin was performed following transient transfection of COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either HA-AT1aR (2 μg/plate) or cRaf-1 (0.1–1.0 μg/plate) and GFP-ERK (1 μg/plate), with or without plasmids encoding FLAG-β-arrestin1 or -2 (3 μg/plate), as indicated. Stimulation was performed as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, monolayers were washed with PBS, solubilized in 1 ml of glycerol lysis buffer (5 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 2 mm EDTA, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and clarified by centrifugation. For the determination of protein expression and total cellular phospho-ERK1/2, 50 μl of each clarified whole cell lysate was removed, mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and aliquots containing ∼50 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 20 μl of a 50% slurry of monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG-affinity agarose, with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with glycerol lysis buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Protein immunoblotting for FLAG-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-β-arrestin2 was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antiserum. Co-precipitated ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK2 were detected using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antisera, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit IgG was employed as secondary antibody. Immune complexes on polyvinylidene difluoride filters were visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce), and autoradiographs were quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. ERK1/2-dependent transcription was measured using an Elk-1-driven luciferase reporter system. COS-7 cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with GAL4-Elk-1 (1 ng/plate), pRL-tk-luc (20 ng/plate), and pFR-luc (1 μg/plate), either pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1aR (2 μg/plate) or pCNG-myc-cRaf-1 (0.5 μg/plate), with or without pcDNA3-FLAG-β-arrestin1 or -2 (3 μg/plate). The GAL4-Elk-1 plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the transactivation domain of Elk-1, pFR-luc encodes the firefly luciferase gene under control of GAL-4 DNA-binding element, and pRL-tk-luc encodes Renillaluciferase under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. One day following transfection, the cells were transferred to 6-well dishes and serum-starved for 18 h. Stimulation with angiotensin II (1 μm) was carried out for 6 h. Luciferase activity was determined using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Cell extracts were assayed sequentially for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. 5-μl aliquots of cell lysate were incubated with 50 μl of luciferin reagent, and luminescence was recorded for 5 s. Subsequently, Stop and Glo® reagent (50 μl) was added, and the specific luminescence from Renilla luciferase was recorded for an additional 5 s. Firefly activities were normalized toRenilla luciferase activity. COS-7 cells transiently expressing HA-AT1aR and either GFP or the GFP-β-arrestin2 fusion protein were grown in collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes. Following angiotensin stimulation, cells were fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with absolute methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA, 5% FBS for 2 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescent staining of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 was done with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody in PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% FBS for 18 h at room temperature, followed by a 1:500 dilution Texas Red®-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG antibody in 1% BSA, 1% FBS for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope and a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens with dual line switching excitation (488 nm for GFP and 568 nm for Texas Red®) and emission (515–540 nm for GFP and 590–620 nm for Texas Red®) filter sets. For the separation of nuclear and cytosolic pools of endogenous ERK1/2, COS-7 cells on 100-mm plates were transfected with either pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1aR (2 μg/plate) or pCGN-myc-Raf-1 (0.5 μg/plate) with or without plasmids encoding β-arrestin1 or -2 (3 μg/plate). Serum-starved cells were stimulated with angiotensin II (1 μm) for 5 min. Monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were incubated on ice for 3 min to allow lysis prior to centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei. The supernatants contained the cytosolic fraction. Pellets containing cell nuclei were washed in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and again pelleted at 500 × g. Both cytosolic and nuclear fractions were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and phospho-ERK1/2 was determined by protein immunoblotting. The purity of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies to nuclear lamin B, retinoblastoma protein, and actin. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the HA-AT1aR, angiotensin II stimulation resulted in a 10.8 ± 2.2-fold increase in total inositol phosphates and an 8.9 ± 2.0-fold increase in phosphorylation of coexpressed GFP-tagged ERK1/2. To determine the effect of β-arrestins on AT1aR signaling, we first compared angiotensin II-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis and GFP-ERK2 phosphorylation in the presence and absence of overexpressed FLAG-β-arrestin1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2. Angiotensin II-stimulated PI hydrolysis reflects Gq/11-dependent activation of phospholipase Cβ isoforms (22de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of β-arrestins, which accelerate the uncoupling of GPCRs from their cognate G proteins, would be expected to attenuate angiotensin II-stimulated PI hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, overexpression of either β-arrestin1 or -2 resulted in a significant reduction in angiotensin II-stimulated inositol phosphate production, as expected. β-Arrestins have also been shown to bind to Raf-1 and ERK2 (8DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and to recruit both kinases to the AT1aR in response to angiotensin II stimulation (23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). If β-arrestins function as scaffolds to facilitate AT1aR-mediated ERK activation, then overexpression of β-arrestin might be expected to increase AT1aR-mediated ERK phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, overexpression of FLAG-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-β-arrestin2 increased angiotensin II-stimulated phosphorylation of GFP-ERK2 in whole cell lysates by 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that β-arrestin binding to the AT1aR plays a dual role. By sterically blocking the GPCR-G protein interaction, G protein-dependent signaling is attenuated. Simultaneously, by recruiting ERK to the agonist-occupied receptor, β-arrestin-dependent activation of the ERK cascade is initiated. Once activated, ERK1/2 phosphorylates numerous plasma membrane, cytosolic, and cytoskeletal substrates (24Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Activated ERK1/2 also translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription by phosphorylating nuclear transcription factors, such as the ETS family protein Elk-1 (24Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on ERK-dependent transcription, we employed a luciferase reporter assay system under the control of an Elk1-GAL4 fusion protein. COS-7 cells expressing AT1aRs were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the Elk1-GAL4 fusion protein and a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of GAL4 DNA-binding element. As shown in Fig. 2 A, addition of angiotensin II to these cells increased GAL4-dependent expression of the reporter gene by nearly 5-fold over the basal activity. Pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished angiotensin II-induced luciferase production. Treatment of cells with PD98059 completely inhibited angiotensin II-induced ERK1/2 activation, indicating that the stimulation of Elk1-driven transcription in response to angiotensin II was mediated entirely through the activation of endogenous ERK1/2. When AT1aR-mediated transcription was assayed in cells overexpressing β-arrestin, we found that the ability of β-arrestins to enhance AT1aR-mediated ERK phosphorylation did not translate into increased AT1aR-mediated Elk1-dependent transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 B, overexpression of FLAG-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-β-arrestin2 inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated transcription of the luciferase reporter by 30 and 60%, respectively. Despite its ability to enhance angiotensin II-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, overexpression of β-arrestins inhibited the AT1aR-mediated transcriptional response. This suggests that β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation leads to the formation of a discrete pool of activated kinase that is unable to induce a transcriptional response. To determine whether AT1aR stimulation in the presence of β-arrestins led to the activation of a β-arrestin-bound ERK pool, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-β-arrestin after angiotensin II stimulation and assayed the immunoprecipitates for the presence of phosphorylated GFP-ERK2. As shown in Fig.3, GFP-ERK coprecipitated with β-arrestin when FLAG-β-arrestin1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2 was expressed along with AT1aR and GFP-ERK. Consistent with the model of β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation, angiotensin II stimulation markedly increased phosphorylation of the β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2. Stimulation of AT1aRs results in rapid recruitment of β-arrestins from the cytoplasm to the agonist-occupied receptor on the plasma membrane, followed by the trafficking of receptor−β-arrestin complexes into endosomal vesicles (25Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Because β-arrestins are cytosolic proteins, we hypothesized that activated ERK1/2 bound to β-arrestin might be unable to enter the nucleus and therefore be unable to stimulate Elk-1-dependent transcription. To test this hypothesis, we performed confocal microscopy on COS-7 cells expressing AT1aR along with either GFP or GFP-β-arrestin2, and we determined the effect of β-arrestin expression on the cellular distribution of activated ERK1/2. Phospho-ERK1/2 was visualized after immunofluorescent staining using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and Texas Red®-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. As shown in Fig.4 A, in the absence of stimulation, GFP (top row, green) was diffusely distributed throughout the cell, whereas GFP-β-arrestin2 was confined to the cytosol (3rd row, green), and there was minimal staining of phospho-ERK1/2 (top and3rd row, red). In cells expressing GFP, treatment for 10 min with angiotensin II resulted in an increase phospho-ERK1/2 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (2nd row, red) without affecting the distribution of GFP (2nd row, green). In contrast, stimulation caused a distinctive redistribution of both phospho-ERK1/2 and GFP-β-arrestin2 in cells expressing GFP-β-arrestin2. After 10 min of agonist treatment, GFP-β-arrestin2 redistributed into characteristic large endosomal vesicles, which we have shown previously contain internalized AT1aR (23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) (bottom row, green). In these cells, phospho-ERK1/2 staining partially colocalized with GFP-β-arrestin2, and there was a relative paucity of anti-phospho-ERK1/2 immunofluorescence detected in the nucleus (bottom row, red). These findings suggested that overexpression of β-arrestin resulted in the targeting of a significant fraction of the phospho-ERK1/2 to endosomal vesicles and away from the nucleus. To assess quantitatively the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 after angiotensin stimulation, we performed cellular fractionation of AT1aR-expressing cells in the presence and absence of overexpressed FLAG-β-arrestin1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2. The purity of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was verified by immunoblotting for nuclear lamin B, retinoblastoma protein, and actin. As shown in Fig. 4 B, angiotensin II stimulation resulted in a marked increase in both cytosolic and nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 within 5 min. The increase in phospho-ERK1/2 was accompanied by a modest increase in nuclear ERK1/2, consistent with translocation of ERK1/2 from cytosol to nucleus upon activation. The effect of overexpressing FLAG-β-arrestin1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2 on angiotensin II-stimulated accumulation of nuclear and cytosolic phospho-ERK1/2 is shown in Fig. 4, C and D. In the presence of excess β-arrestin, nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 was reduced by ∼60% (Fig. 4 C), whereas the amount of phospho-ERK1/2 retained in the cytosolic fraction approximately doubled (Fig.4 D). Thus, while β-arrestin overexpression facilitated AT1aR-mediated activation of either endogenous ERK1/2 or coexpressed GFP-ERK2, the activated ERK was largely retained in the cytosol. This β-arrestin-dependent targeting of activated ERK away from the nucleus correlates with the observed reduction in ERK-dependent transcription in the presence of excess β-arrestin. The overexpression of β-arrestin has complex effects on AT1aR signal transduction. Although receptor-G protein coupling is reduced, leading to diminished Gq-mediated PI hydrolysis (Fig. 1 A), the efficiency of angiotensin-stimulated ERK activation is enhanced, possibly due to the greater availability of β-arrestin “scaffolds” (Fig.1 B). Thus, the inhibition of AT1aR-mediated Elk1-driven luciferase transcription could result either from the cytosolic retention of β-arrestin-bound phospho-ERK1/2, as suggested by the confocal microscopy and cell fractionation data (Fig. 4), or from the attenuation of receptor-G protein coupling, which might provide a necessary costimulus for the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we studied the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on ERK localization and transcriptional activity following receptor-independent activation of ERK by overexpressed cRaf-1. We have shown previously (23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) that overexpression of cRaf-1 causes both an increase in the amount of β-arrestin-bound ERK2 and activation of a β-arrestin-bound ERK2 pool. This effect correlates with the binding of cRaf-1 to β-arrestin-ERK complexes, is dependent on endogenous MEK activity, and is independent of GPCR stimulation. As shown in Fig.5 A (upper panel), cRaf-1 expression resulted in a marked increase in phosphorylation of coexpressed GFP-ERK2 when measured in whole cell lysates. Under these conditions, the presence of FLAG-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-β-arrestin2 did not alter the overall extent of cRaf-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lower panel), cRaf-1 expression caused a 1.5–3-fold increase in the amount of GFP-ERK2 that coprecipitated with β-arrestin and a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of β-arrestin-bound GFP-ERK2. Because the level of phospho-GFP-ERK2 in the whole cell lysate remained constant, these data would suggest that a larger proportion of the cellular pool of phospho-ERK was β-arrestin-bound in the presence of overexpressed β-arrestin. We next examined the effect of β-arrestin overexpression on the cellular distribution and transcriptional activity of ERK1/2 that was activated by cRaf-1 expression. Fig. 5 B depicts the effect of FLAG-β-arrestin1 or FLAG-β-arrestin2 on the distribution of nuclear and cytosolic phospho-ERK1/2. Similar to the results obtained when ERK1/2 activation was induced by stimulation of the AT1aR, nuclear phospho-ERK1/2 was reduced by ∼50% (upper panel), whereas the amount of phospho-ERK1/2 retained in the cytosolic fraction was modestly increased (lower panel) by the presence of excess β-arrestin. Fig. 5 C depicts the effect of FLAG-β-arrestin1 and FLAG-β-arrestin2 expression on cRaf-1-stimulated transcription of the Elk1-driven luciferase reporter. Expression of cRaf-1 alone provoked an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity. In the presence of excess β-arrestin, the effect was dramatically reduced. Because these data were obtained in the absence of GPCR activation, and under conditions where β-arrestin expression is leading to the formation of β-arrestin-phospho-ERK complexes, these data suggest that β-arrestin inhibits ERK-dependent transcription by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of activated ERK, rather than by accelerating GPCR desensitization. GPCRs are able to employ several distinct mechanisms to activate the ERK1/2 cascade (26Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). AT1aRs, for example, can activate ERK1/2 not only via β-arrestin-dependent pathways but also through G protein-dependent signals that sometimes involve cross-talk with classical receptor tyrosine kinases (27Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T.

In light of such diversity, the question arises as to whether these different pathways of ERK activation are functionally redundant. Our data suggest that they are not. Rather, the consequences of GPCR-mediated ERK activation appear to be determined to a significant degree by the mechanism of ERK activation. In a previous study (23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that β−arrestin2 acts as a scaffold for the Raf-dependent activation of ERK1/2. By using confocal microscopy, we found that AT1aRs, β−arrestin2, and phospho-ERK1/2 colocalize in endosomal vesicles after angiotensin stimulation. In this study, we extend these observations by determining the functional effects of β−arrestin expression on ERK1/2 activation and nuclear signaling in response to angiotensin. Although expression of either β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 led to an increase in the overall extent of angiotensin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, it was associated with a net decrease in both the size of the nuclear pool of phospho-ERK1/2 and in ERK1/2-dependent transcription of an Elk1 reporter. This effect was attributable to the cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 along with AT1aR-β-arrestin complexes in endosomal vesicles. As depicted schematically in Fig. 6, we propose that AT1aR stimulation results in the activation of two functionally distinct pools of ERK1/2. In COS-7 cells expressing exogenous AT1aRs, the receptor is present in relative excess over the endogenous β-arrestin pool. Under these conditions, AT1aR-mediated ERK1/2 activation proceeds through predominantly β-arrestin-independent mechanisms. These signals lead to an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the nucleus and stimulate Elk1-dependent transcription. Overexpression of β-arrestin results in a net increase in AT1aR-mediated ERK1/2 activation; however, the ERK1/2 is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to phosphorylate the nuclear pool of Elk-1. Because β-arrestins serve a dual function, in that they uncouple the AT1aR from its G proteins at the same time that they promote β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation, overexpression of β-arrestin leads to a net reduction in Elk-1-dependent transcription. In this model, the transcriptional response reflects a balance between the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 activated via G protein-dependent pathways and the cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 activated via the β-arrestin-dependent pathway. By increasing β-arrestin levels, the G protein-dependent signal is suppressed; the β-arrestin-dependent pathway is enhanced, and the balance is shifted in favor of the transcriptionally inactive pathway. Recent work by DeFea et al. (8DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that different mechanisms of GPCR-stimulated ERK1/2 activation lead to the formation of functionally distinct pools of ERK1/2. In KNRK cells expressing wild type PAR-2 receptors, stimulation of the receptor results in the β-arrestin-dependent activation of a cytosolic pool of ERK1/2 but does not trigger a mitogenic response. Mutant PAR-2 receptors that cannot bind β-arrestin still activate ERK1/2 but do so through a mechanistically distinct, calcium-dependent pathway. This receptor mutant, unlike the wild type receptor, induces nuclear translocation of ERK and does stimulate cell proliferation. β-Arrestin-ERK complexes appear to be relatively stable entities, because they can be isolated by both gel filtration (6DeFea K.A.

By using HA-tagged AT1aR, red fluorescent protein-tagged ERK2, and GFP-β-arrestin2 to follow the cellular distribution of the three proteins expressed in HEK-293 cells, we have found previously (23Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) that AT1aR, β-arrestin, and ERK all localize to endosomal vesicles after angiotensin II stimulation. Thus, the formation of stable complexes between β-arrestin and activated ERK could lead to cytosolic retention of ERK1/2. Our data are consistent with this hypothesis. In the presence of overexpressed β-arrestin, the cytosolic accumulation of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 is enhanced; the nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2 is impaired, and the ability of AT1aR to induce ERK1/2-dependent, Elk-1-driven transcription is inhibited. In addition to their role in directly phosphorylating nuclear transcription factors, ERK1/2 are known to phosphorylate numerous plasma membrane, cytoplasmic, and cytoskeletal substrates (24Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). These include several proteins involved in heptahelical receptor signaling, such as β-arrestin1 (29Lin F.T. Miller W.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). One potential role of β-arrestin-ERK complex formation could be to target specifically ERK1/2 to non-nuclear substrates involved in the regulation of GPCR signaling or intracellular trafficking. Alternatively, β-arrestin-bound ERK1/2 may phosphorylate other cytosolic proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as p90RSK (33Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), which in turn relay signals to the nucleus. In such a model, transcriptional events mediated directly by the nuclear pool of ERK1/2 would be attenuated, whereas alternate pathways of ERK-dependent transcription would persist, resulting in an altered pattern of transcription following activation of the GPCR. Original models of GPCR signaling envisioned heterotrimeric G proteins as the sole mediators of signals emanating from the receptor, whereas β-arrestins were viewed primarily as terminators of GPCR signaling.

The different cellular responses to TNF are signaled through cell surface receptors (p55, TNFR1 and p75, TNFR2), and their adaptor proteins, initiating different signaling pathways. These distinct signals can lead to opposing cellular effects as best exemplified by TNF's proapoptotic and antiapoptotic role (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). TNF-induced apoptosis primarily depends on the recruitment of a complex of adaptor proteins, including TRADD and FADD/MORT1 leading to the further recruitment and activation of various caspases and, subsequently, to programmed cell death (2Tartaglia L.A.

On the other hand, the cell activation, inflammatory reaction, and antiapoptotic function of the TNF receptor superfamily are predominantly mediated by another class of adaptor proteins, TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF) (1Locksley R.M.

To date, six members of TRAF proteins have been identified in mammals from TRAF1 to TRAF6. TRAF2 is the prototypical member of TRAF family. It can interact directly or indirectly with various members of TNF receptor superfamily to mediate the signal transduction of these receptors. TRAF2 can also interact with numerous intracellular proteins, such as I-TRAF/TANK, RIP, MAPK kinase kinase, NIK, and the caspase inhibitors cIAPs, and thereby transduces signals required for the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK or JNK) and antiapoptosis (6Song H.Y.

Sphingolipids have recently emerged as signaling molecules that mediate various activities of TNF (11Adam-Klages S. Schwandner R. Adam D. Kreder D. Bernardo K. Kronke M. J. Leukoc.

TNF signaling via sphingolipids is exemplified by two distinct pathways: the formation of ceramide resulting from the activation of sphingomyelinase or de novo synthesis and the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) upon sphingosine kinase (SphK) activation. While ceramide has been variably implicated as a mediator of TNF-induced apoptosis (13Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), S1P has been emerged as an antiapoptotic and mitogenic factor (14Olivera A. Spiegel S.

Antibodies against FLAG-epitope (M2, Eastman Kodak Co.), HA-epitope (Sigma), TRAF2, and IκBα (Santa Cruz) were used at a 1:5,000, 1:2,500 and a 1:1,000 dilution, respectively, for immunoblotting assays. The human SphK cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the GST fusion protein expression vector, pGEX-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Expression and purification of the derived GST-SphK fusion proteins were performed as described previously (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Cell lysates from each T75 flask of HUVEC or 293T cells overexpressed with TRAF2 or ΔTRAF2 were incubated with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to the GST-SphK or GST alone fusion proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After six extensive washes with lysis buffer, the coprecipitating proteins, along with whole lysates, were analyzed by an immunoblot assay with anti-TRAF2 antibodies. The transfected 293T cells were seeded on a 48-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cell/well and stimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) for 18 h. Cell viability was assessed by an MTT dye reduction assay and expressed as a proportion of cells maintained in normal culture medium as described previously (17Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). SphK activity was measured by incubating the cytosolic fraction with 5 μm sphingosine dissolved in 0.1% Triton X-100 and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm, 0.5 mCi/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C as described previously (18Xia P.

SphK kinase activity was expressed as picomoles of S1P formed per min per mg of protein. JNK activity was measured by the immune complex kinase assay in anti-HA immunoprecipitates form the cells coexpressed with HA-tagged JNK. The activity of immunoprecipitated complex was determined by incubation with GST-c-Jun(1–79) fusion protein as substrate as described previously (22Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). 293T cells were cotransfected the desired expression vectors or empty vector. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection followed by TNF stimulation. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used as a probe in these experiments included 5′-GGATGCCATTGGGGATTTCCTCTTTACTGGATGT-3′, which contains a consensus NF-κB binding site in E-selectin promoter that is underlined. Gel mobility shift of a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was performed by incubating a 32P-labeled NF-κB probe with 4 μg of nuclear proteins as described previously (22Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The specific DNA-protein complexes were completely abolished by addition of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotides. Stable transfected 293 cells overexpressing SphK, SphKG82D, or empty vector were cotransfected with pRK5-TRAF2 or pRK5 vector together with Ig-κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pTK81-IgK, 200 ng per transfection) andRenilla luciferase control vector (pRL, 20 ng per transfection). Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by supplementing empty vector as needed. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and reporter gene activity was determined by the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized relative to Renilla luciferase activity. Our previous findings have suggested that activation of SphK by TNF is required for cell survival and activation during TNF stimulation (17Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether TNF-induced SphK activation is mediated by TRAF2, which is a well documented transducer for the antiapoptotic signaling (5Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected human embryonic kidney cell line 293T with wild-type TRAF2, a dominant-negative TRAF2 (TRAF287–501, ΔTRAF2), or an empty vector. As shown in Fig.1, overexpression of TRAF2 not only enhanced TNF-induced SphK activity, but was also itself capable of activating SphK by 2-fold compared with control transfectants. Immunoblotting assay showed equivalent expression levels of the transgenes in the presence or absence of TNF stimulation (Fig.1 b). In addition, the TNF-induced SphK activation was blocked by ΔTRAF2 containing a deletion of the N-terminal RING finger that is fundamentally required for TRAF2 mediating downstream signaling and antiapoptosis (6Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). These data suggested a role of TRAF2 in mediating TNF-induced SphK activation, a novel signaling pathway for cellular response to TNF stimulation. As TRAF2 does not contain intrinsic catalytic activity, protein-protein interactions are essential for TRAF2-mediated activation of downstream signals (5Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility of a physical interaction between TRAF2 and SphK. We initially performed overexpression-based coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK 293T cell line coexpressed HA-epitope-tagged SphK with FLAG-epitope-tagged TRAF2 or ΔTRAF2. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, and the coprecipitated HA-tagged SphK was detected by immunoblot assay with anti-HA antibodies. SphK was found to be associated with TRAF2 in the immunoprecipitate complexes from the transfected cells (Fig. 2 a). Conversely, by using anti-HA-epitope antibodies to perform the immunoprecipitation assays, we also found that FLAG-tagged TRAF2 or ΔTRAF2 was coprecipitated with HA-tagged SphK (data not shown). In addition, we examined whether endogenous TRAF2 could also interact with SphK by using GST-SphK fusion protein to pull-down the associated cellular proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 b, GST-SphK fusion protein was capable of interacting with not only the overexpressed TRAF2 in 293T cells, but also the endogenous TRAF2 in HUVEC, confirming a physical interaction of TRAF2 with SphK. The dominant-negative TRAF2 (ΔTRAF2) was also shown to be associated with SphK (Fig. 2), indicating that the N-terminal RING finger of TRAF2 is not required for the interaction. A structure-based sequence alignment of TRAF2 binding sequences in various members of TNF receptor superfamily demonstrated a major consensus motif of (P/S/T/A)X(Q/E)E and a minor motif of PXQXXD (23;24). Analysis of the SphK sequence (human SphK-1) revealed two possible TRAF2-binding motifs in positions 240–243 (PLEE) and 379–382 (PPEE), respectively, providing a potential structural basis for the interaction of SphK and TRAF2. To test whether these two TRAF2-binding motifs are responsible for the binding of SphK to TRAF2, we generated three mutants of SphK, TB1-SphK, TB2-SphK, and TB1/2-SphK, in which the first, second, or both TRAF2-binding motifs were mutated with alanines, i.e.PLEE → PLAA and PPEE → PPAA, respectively (Fig.3 a). We found that expression of either TB2-SphK or TB1/2-SphK (data not shown), but not TB1-SphK, deleted the ability of SphK to coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF2 (Fig.3 b), indicating that the second TRAF2-binding motif is essential for the interaction of these two molecules. The cells enforced expressing TB1-SphK, TB2-SphK, or TB1/2-SphK raised an unstimulated SphK activity to similar levels found with wild-type SphK-transfected cells (Fig.4 a), revealing an undiminished intrinsic enzyme catalytic activity in these SphK mutants. Strikingly, the activity of TB2-SphK, but not TB1-SphK, failed to respond to TNF stimulation (Fig. 4, a and b), suggesting an important role for C-terminal TB2 site of SphK not only in its capacity of interaction with TRAF2, but also in mediating TNF-induced activation of SphK. By contrast, the response of TB-2 SphK to phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), an activator of SphK through protein kinase C activation (15;17), was undiminished (Fig.4 a), suggesting a TNF-specific defect of TB2-SphK. Taken together, these data indicate that SphK interacts with TRAF2 through the binding motif of PPEE379–382 and that this interaction is responsible for mediating TNF-induced SphK activation.Figure 4TB2-SphK and SphKG82D block TNF-induced SphK activation. a, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors, and SphK activity was determined after stimulation with TNF (1 ng/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), or nil for 10-min post-transfection at 48 h. Data are the mean (±S.D.) of relative activity of three individual experiments. The mean of unstimulated (Nil) levels of SphK activity in the cells transfected with SphK, TB1-SphK, TB2-SphK, and SphKG82D were 42,600, 43,100, 41,800, and 34 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. b, SphK activity was assayed in the SphK- or TB2-SphK-transfected 293T cells at the indicated time points of TNF (1 ng/ml) stimulation.

Wattenberg B.W. D'andrea R.J. Vadas M.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1527-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the role of SphK in the TRAF2-transduced signals. In agreement with previous report (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), overexpression of TRAF2 was capable of activating NF-κB as determined here by degradation of IκBα (Fig. 5 a) and gel shift assay of NF-κB DNA binding complex (Fig. 5 b). Coexpression of TB2-SphK markedly inhibited IκBα degradation (Fig. 5 a) and decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 5, b andc) induced by either TNF stimulation or overexpression of TRAF2. By contrast, overexpression of wild-type SphK increased NF-κB activity (Fig. 5 b), suggesting a potential effect of SphK on NF-κB activation. To further establish the role of the interaction of SphK with TRAF2 in mediating TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we used a point mutant of SphK (SphKG82D) that reserves intact TRAF2-binding motif but lacks the enzyme catalytic activity (20Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As anticipated, SphKG82D had undiminished binding ability to TRAF2 as determined by coimmunoprecipitation (data not shown) and completely abolished the SphK activity in response to TNF stimulation (Fig. 4 a). Expression of SphKG82D dramatically blocked the degradation of IκBα (Fig. 5 a) and inhibited the NF-κB DNA binding activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, b and c). We further performed NF-κB reporter gene assays that confirmed the result from the assays of IκBα degradation and NF-κB DNA binding, showing that overexpression of TRAF2 or SphK increased NF-κB-dependent gene activity, whereas the effect of TNF or TRAF2 on NF-κB activation was blocked by coexpression of SphKG82D (Fig.5 d). Thus, the TRAF2-mediated SphK activation is apparently necessary for TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Since JNK is another well documented major signal pathway mediated by TRAF2 during TNF stimulation (25Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 26Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), we tested whether the interaction of TRAF2 with SphK could also regulate the TRAF2-dependent JNK activation. Strikingly, neither TNF stimulation nor overexpression of TRAF2-induced JNK activity was affected by expression of TB2-SphK or SphKG82D (Fig.6). In addition, overexpression of wild-type SphK had no significant effect on JNK activation. Hence, in contrast with the effect of SphK on NF-κB, the activation of JNK induced by TNF or TRAF2 is independent of SphK. An essential role of TRAF2 in antiapoptosis has been definitively identified based on the studies with the dominant-negative TRAF2 and deletion of TRAF2 gene in vivo (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 9Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

We further investigated whether the interaction of TRAF2 with SphK is involved in TRAF2-mediated antiapoptotic siganling pathways. Consistent with previous reports (7Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 26Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), expression of ΔTRAF2 increased cell sensitivity to killing by TNF (Fig.7), indicating the role of TRAF2 in antiapoptosis. The effect of ΔTRAF2 was completely prevented by overexpression of SphK, even in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, suggesting an independent of de novo protein synthesis antiapoptotic pathway promoted by SphK activation (Fig. 7). While overexpression of TRAF2 had a partially protective effect against TNF-induced apoptosis in the presence of cycloheximide, it was substantially enhanced by coexpression with SphK (Fig. 7, right panel). By contrast, the protective effect of TRAF2 against apoptosis was abolished by coexpression of SphKG82D (Fig. 7). Taken together, our findings suggest that SphK activity is essential to determine the antiapoptotic capacity of TRAF2 during TNF stimulation. In this report, we describe an association of TRAF2 with SphK, the first lipid kinase to interact with this signal transducer, which provides a novel mechanism for the specific signaling pathway leading from TRAF2 to the activation of NF-κB and antiapoptosis (Fig.8). We demonstrate the association between TRAF2 and SphK by coimmunoprecipitation assays from the transfected cells and in vitro binding assays, which show that SphK associated with not only the transfected proteins but also endogenous TRAF2. In addition to the physical association, we provide four lines of evidence for a functional role of SphK in TRAF2 mediated TNF signaling: (i) either TNF or overexpression of TRAF2 was capable of activating SphK; (ii) TNF-induced SphK activation was blocked by the dominant-negative TRAF2, ΔTRAF2; (iii) overexpression of SphK potentiated the ability of TRAF2 in activation of NF-kB and antiapoptosis and restored the effect of ΔTRAF2; and (iv) SphK mutants lacking either TRAF2-binding motif or enzyme catalytic activity abrogated the effect of TRAF2. Thus, the interaction of TRAF2 with and subsequent activation of SphK appears critically involved in the process of TRAF2 mediated TNF signal transduction. TRAF2 is a signal-transducing adapter protein that contains a conserved C-terminal TRAF domain and an N-terminal region consist of a RING finger motif and an additional array of zinc finger-like structures (28Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The TRAF domain is involved in receptor association and homo/hetero-oligomerization of TRAF proteins and serves as a docking site for a number of other signaling proteins (4Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A structure-based sequence alignment has revealed a consensus motif of (P/S/T/A)X(Q/E)E existing among the TRAF2-binding receptors including TNFR2, CD40, CD30, OX40, 4-1BB, CD27, LTβ-R, and ATAR (23Ye H.

https://openalex.org/W2058868183,"Recent data have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed by subsets of neurons, coincident with angiogenesis within the developing cerebral cortex. Here we investigate the characteristics of VEGF expression by neurons and test the hypothesis that VEGF may serve both paracrine and autocrine functions in the developing central nervous system. To begin to address these questions, we assayed expression of VEGF and one of its potential receptors, Flk-1 (VEGFR-2), in the embryonic mouse forebrain and embryonic cortical neurons grown in vitro. Both VEGF and Flk-1 are present in subsets of post-mitotic neurons in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, VEGF levels are up-regulated in neuronal cultures subjected to hypoxia, consistent with our previous results in vivo. While the abundance of Flk-1 is unaffected by hypoxia, the receptor exhibits a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation, as do downstream signaling kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p90RSK and STAT3a, demonstrating activation of the VEGF pathway. These same signaling components also exhibited higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels in response to exogenous addition of rVEGFA165. This activation was diminished in the presence of specific inhibitors of Flk-1 function and agents that sequester VEGF, resulting in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in these neuronal cultures. Further, inhibition of MEK resulted in increased apoptosis, while inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase had no appreciable affect. In addition to the novel function for VEGF that we describe in neuronal survival, neuronal VEGF also affected the organization and differentiation of brain endothelial cells in a three-dimensional culture paradigm, consistent with its more traditional role as a vascular agent. Thus, our in vitro data support a role for neuronal VEGF in both paracrine and autocrine signaling in the maintenance of neurons and endothelia in the central nervous system.

Jin et al. demonstrated VEGF gene and protein expression in neurons of the cortex and hippocampus following a model for global cerebral ischemia in the adult rat brain, and the application of exogenous VEGF was shown to promote survival of rat cerebral neurons in culture and rescue HN33 hippocampal cells from death by serum withdrawal (18.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Nagayama T. Goldsmith P.C. Greenberg D.A. Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous work has demonstrated that VEGF expression by neurons of the developing cerebral cortex coincides both spatially and temporally with angiogenesis and that levels of VEGF in cortical neurons increase following hypoxic exposure (11.Ogunshola O.O.

Thus, this previously unknown source of endogenous VEGF production in the brain presents a novel paradigm for examining VEGF function. Interest in VEGF as a therapeutic molecule in a wide number of pathological conditions such as stroke and peripheral nerve damage led us to test the hypothesis that neuronal VEGF secretion may have specific signaling functions in the central nervous system (17.Issa R.

Here we report that neuronal VEGF and its receptor Flk-1 are expressed by cortical neurons of E15 embryos in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, use of an in vitro culture model demonstrates that neuronal VEGF expression is hypoxia-inducible, with the resulting VEGF capable of supporting tube formation in a brain microvascular endothelial cell line. Co-localization of VEGF and its Flk-1 receptor, as well as changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of both Flk-1 and downstream signaling molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinase, p90RSK, and STAT family members, suggests that VEGF mediates both auto- and paracrine signaling functions in central nervous system neurons. Finally, inhibition of either VEGF function or Flk-1 activity results in increased cell apoptosis, indicating that endogenously produced VEGF acts as a neuronal survival factor.

Quantitation was carried out on scanned images (Agfa Arcus II Scanner and Adobe PhotoShop 4.0, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) using the BioMax™ Program (Kodak, Rochester, NY) on a MacIntosh G3 computer. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Cell cultures were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm NaF and scraped into lysis buffer (see above). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described (26.Ilan N. Mahooti S. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times. Rat brain microvascular endothelial (RBE4) cells (27.Roux F. Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Claire M. Mailly P. Bourre J. Strosberg A. Couraud P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were cultured as previously described (28.Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The droplets were cultured in unconditioned media, in either normoxic or hypoxic E15 neuron-conditioned media for 6 days in 5% CO2 with media replenishment on day 3. After 6 days the cultures were fixed and mounted on slides for light microscopy. Controls were carried out using unconditioned media. Experiments were performed at least three times. Images were taken using a Zeiss research microscope equipped with epifluorescence and a SPOT™ camera before being transferred electronically to Adobe PhotoShop without image editing. We performed immunohistochemistry to localize VEGF and Flk-1 in E15 forebrain sections using a post mitotic neuronal marker (Tuj-1) to identify neuronal cells. We found that VEGF was expressed by neurons throughout the wall of the developing cerebrum (Fig. 1a). Flk-1 was also expressed by neurons of the E15 forebrain and widely distributed and at low levels (Fig. 1b). Additionally as expected, both VEGF and Flk-1 were present within vascular structures superficial to the cortical plate (Fig. 1, a and b). To determine whether cells in vitro expressed VEGF and Flk-1, we prepared primary cultures of E15 cortical neurons and performed immunohistochemistry. Staining revealed that ∼30% of Tuj-1-positive cells in culture expressed VEGF (Fig. 1, c and d); about 25% of Tuj-1-positive cells expressed Flk-1 (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, ∼90% of cells that expressed VEGF also expressed Flk-1 (Fig. 1g). To determine whether expression changed when cells were grown in vitro, we assayed levels of VEGF and Flk-1 in freshly dissociated but unplated neurons, as well as cells grown in culture. Both populations of cells expressed VEGF (Fig. 1e, lanes 1 and 2) and Flk-1 (Fig. 1h, lanes 1 and 2), and furthermore, the VEGF produced by these neurons was secreted into the media (Fig. 1e, lane 3). Similarly, E15 cortical neurons express Flk-1 as dissociated cells or cells grown in vitro (Fig. 1h, lanes 1 and 2). These results demonstrated that neurons in culture mimic neurons in the brain in their ability to synthesize and secrete VEGF. In addition, they have a receptor with which they could respond to this factor. Next, we examined the activation state of Flk-1 in cortical neuronal cultures and found that the Flk-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, indicating that a portion of the Flk-1 receptors is in an activated state (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation using an anti-Flk-1 antisera co-precipitated proteins of 85, 65, and 45 kDa (Fig. 2b), consistent with these bands representing p85 PI 3-kinase, Shc, and Nck, respectively, known signaling partners of Flk-1 (29.Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-V. Warren R. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To determine whether VEGF and Flk-1 levels are modulated by hypoxia, we performed Western blot analysis on neuronal culture lysates derived from normoxic and hypoxic cultures. While overall protein levels of Flk-1 remained unchanged (Fig. 2c), levels of VEGF in both lysates (data not shown) and conditioned media (Fig. 2d) were up-regulated ∼30% as expected by hypoxia. Interestingly, although Flk-1 protein levels did not change appreciably in response to hypoxia, Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels were observed to significantly increase in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2e). Further, to determine whether signaling cascade components related to Flk-1 activation are responsive to hypoxic conditions, we compared levels of total protein and activated (tyrosine-phosphorylated) protein for ERK, p90RSK, STAT-3a, STAT1, Akt, and p85 PI 3-kinase. Levels of total ERK, p90RSK, Akt, and STAT3a protein did not vary between cells grown in normoxic versus hypoxic conditions. In contrast, levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK, p90RSK, and STAT3a were significantly increased following hypoxia, indicating that they are being activated (Fig. 2f, fold change 1.9 ± 0.59, 2.5 ± 0.69, and 2.5 ± 0.58, respectively). Notably, Akt phosphorylation levels did not change appreciably after hypoxic exposure. Expression of STAT1 and PI 3-kinase were also not significantly increased by hypoxia. Since hypoxia is a known stimulus for VEGF induction we were interested in determining whether addition of exogenous rVEGF-A165could mimic the changes in signaling pathway components that we observed following sustained culture in hypoxia. Following daily administration of 10 ng/ml rVEGF-A165 for 6 days, we observed that levels of total ERK, p90RSK, Akt, and STAT3a protein did not vary greatly among cells grown under normoxic, hypoxic, and normoxic + rVEGF-A165 conditions. However, comparable with results with hypoxic cultures, levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK, p90RSK, and STAT3a were significantly increased following addition of rVEGF-A165, indicating activation of a VEGF-inducible signaling pathway (Fig. 2f, fold change 2.0 ± 0.16, 4.2 ± 0.9, and 2.0 ± 0.41, respectively). Notably, as in hypoxic cultures, Akt phosphorylation levels and STAT1 and PI 3-kinase expression levels were not significantly changed by VEGF treatment. To examine the effects of blocking VEGF/Flk-1 signaling in cortical neurons two approaches were taken. First, we inhibited VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity using SU1498, a potent and selective Flk-1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (23.Strawn L.M. McMahon G. App H. Schreck R. Kuchler W.R. Longhi M.P. Hui T.H. Tang C. Levitzki A. Gazit A. Chen I. Keri G. Orfi L. Risau W. Flamme W. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. Shawver L.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3540-3545PubMed Google Scholar), or added CB676475, a broad range VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (24.Hennequin L.F. Thomas A.P. Johnstone C. Stokes E.S. Ple P.A. Lohmann J.J. Ogilvie D.J. Dukes M. Wedge S.R.J.O.C. Kendrew J. Lambert-van der Brempt C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 5369-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). SU1498 was found to elicit increased apoptosis (as determined by TUNEL labeling) in a dose-dependent manner when added to E15 neuronal cultures (Fig. 3a). CB676475 exhibited similar properties (Fig. 3b, upper two panels). The second approach taken was to sequester endogenously expressed VEGF with either a neutralizing VEGF antibody or a recombinant soluble chimeric Flt-1 molecule. In both instances, cultures containing either of these agents exhibited increased apoptosis as evaluated by TUNEL labeling (Fig. 3b, lower three panels). To further examine the specific signaling pathways downstream of the VEGF-induced inhibition of apoptosis a pharmacological approach was taken. Namely, chemical inhibitors of either MEK (PD98059, 20 μm) and PI 3-kinase (Wortmannin and LY24002, 20 μm) were added daily from day one to day six of culture of the E15 neurons. As illustrated in Fig. 4, only occasional apoptotic cells were identified by caspase 3 staining of normoxic cultures (Fig. 4A) and normoxic cultures incubated with either 20 μm of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY (Fig. 4B) or Wortmannin (data not shown). In contrast, normoxic cultures incubated with 20 μm of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 exhibited markedly increased apoptosis as evidenced by the increase in caspase 3 staining (Fig. 4C). To determine whether neuronal VEGF is capable of promoting endothelial cell organization and differentiation, we assessed the effects of media conditioned by cortical cultures on brain microvascular endothelial cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels. 2Chow, J., Ogunshola, O. O., Fan, S. Y., Li, Y., Ment, L. R., and Madri, J. A. (2001) Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 130, 123–132. We found that neuronal-conditioned media supports rearrangement and differentiation of rat brain endothelial (RBE4) cells, resulting in the formation of tube-like structures (Fig. 5). The ability to affect tube formation correlated with levels of VEGF in the media, as no tubes form in cultures treated with unconditioned media (Fig. 5, panel 1). Modest tube formation is observed in cultures supplemented with media from normoxic neuronal cultures (Fig. 5, panel 2), and robust tube formation occurs in cultures that were supplemented with media from hypoxic neuronal cultures (Fig. 5, panel 3). Thus, although produced by cortical neurons in culture, neuronal VEGF has the ability to influence endothelial function and subsequent angiogenesis. We show here that embryonic cortical neurons, in vivo and in vitro, express VEGF and one of its receptors, Flk-1 (Flt-1 was not detected in these cultures). Moreover, Flk-1 is activated in cultured neurons and appears to initiate signaling via a cascade that likely includes PI-3 kinase, Akt, Shc, Nck, and the kinases ERK, p90RSK, and STAT3a. Under hypoxic conditions, cortical neurons express elevated levels of VEGF and Flk-1 activation is increased, supporting the concept that a primary response to hypoxia by cortical neurons is to increase VEGF production and subsequent Flk-1 signaling. An identical response was obtained using exogenous rVEGF-A165 confirming that neurons are capable of responding to both endogenous and exogenous VEGF production. Inhibition of VEGF signaling, using either pharmacological agents to block Flk-1 kinase activity or reagents that sequester endogenous VEGF, results in increased apoptosis, suggesting that VEGF may function as an autocrine and paracrine neuronal survival factor. Further, utilizing inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and MEK we generated data consistent with the concept that the MEK-ERK-p90RSK pathway is responsible, in part, for mediating neuronal survival in this culture model. Interestingly, the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway does not appear to be involved in the modulation of neuronal apoptosis in our in vitro model (Figs. 2, 4, and 6B). Finally, media conditioned by both normoxic and hypoxic cortical neurons promoted in vitro angiogenesis, with levels of VEGF correlating with the extent of tube formation. Our previous findings that neurons in the brain express VEGF are extended by these studies (11.Ogunshola O.O. Stewart W.B. Mihalcik V. Solli T. Madri J.A. Ment L.R. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 119: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).2 Indeed, the maintenance of expression of VEGF by neurons in culture demonstrates that this expression is intrinsic to these neurons, since it exists in the absence of proper cellular contact and connectivity. Furthermore, the observation that VEGF and Flk-1 are co-localized supports the notion that neuronal VEGF in the brain can act as an autocrine as well as a paracrine factor for neurons (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition to its more widely recognized role in angiogenesis, VEGF is involved in regulation of the early developmental program of retinal neurogenesis (31.Yourey P.A. Gohari S. Su J.L. Alderson R.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6781-6788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, the neurotrophic and mitogenic effects of exogenous VEGF result in stimulation of axon outgrowth through the Flk-1 receptor as well as increased survival of peripheral neurons in vitro, suggesting that further functions may exist (14.Sondell M. Lundborg G. Kanje M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5731-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sondell M. Sundler F. Kanje M. Eur. J. Neursci. 2000; 12: 4243-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, exogenous VEGF reduced neuronal cell death in an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia (18.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Nagayama T. Goldsmith P.C. Greenberg D.A. Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10242-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 32.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 14: 197-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we attribute a role to the endogenous production of VEGF by neuronal cells and suggest that not only VEGF from exogenous sources (such as astrocytes and endothelial cells) is important for neuronal survival. Our findings add to the complexity of biological roles that have been attributed to VEGF. We show that increased cell death results from a blockade of endogenous VEGF signaling indicating the importance of both VEGF and the Flk-1 receptor in neuronal survival. Our studies illustrate that complex signaling cascades are susceptible to elevation of endogenous VEGF levels in cortical neurons exposed to hypoxic conditions in vitro. Interestingly, contrary to findings by Jin et al., which demonstrate the importance of PI 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction system in VEGF-mediated neuroprotection in HN33 cells (30.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10242-10247Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar,32.Jin K.L. Mao X.O. Greenberg D.A. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 14: 197-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we find that the MEK-ERK pathway is crucial to the survival of cortical neurons in vitro. This discrepancy could be due to differences in experimental design as well as differences in the cell populations tested. Potentially acting through both autocrine and paracrine Flk-1 activation, ERK, p90RSK, and STAT 3a phosphorylation levels are up-regulated, either in abundance or in activity in cortical neurons under hypoxic conditions or after exposure to rVEGF. These findings, along with the observation of persistent stable Akt phosphorylation, highlight the fact that VEGF can modulate a number of downstream pathways some of which have not yet been identified. Furthermore our data suggests that neurons themselves provide a source of VEGF to aid their survival under adverse conditions, a response that will presumably depend on the severity of the insult. Perhaps this initial release of VEGF into the local environment may prolong survival of cells that are not irreversibly damaged until angiogenesis is initiated. Additional functional and novel responses of neurons to changes in local VEGF expression and their impact are still to be identified. We show that neuron-conditioned media supports differentiation and tube formation in a three-dimensional model of angiogenesis. Although we cannot exclude the presence of other pro-angiogenic factors in the conditioned media, our study suggests that neuronal VEGF is bioactive, can signal to surrounding endothelial cells, and can potentially produce a gradient to direct angiogenesis during development and in response to injury and trauma. Furthermore, hypoxia-conditioned media augments tube formation, consistent with our previous finding that neuronal VEGF can produce a gradient to direct angiogenesis in the developing cortex. Since cortical neurons are diverse and because we know that this diversity is at least in part recapitulated in vitro, it will be important in the future to understand the effects of VEGF stimulation on distinct cortical neuron subtypes. It is also tempting to speculate that there may be a neuronal-specific form of VEGF. Interestingly, not all cortical neurons express VEGF and/or flk-1 receptors, which may be a reason why some cells are more susceptible to injury and insult. In addition, the issue of whether modulating levels of Flk-1 signaling under hypoxic conditions will protect cells from the apoptosis they are destined to undergo is an interesting and pertinent question, as it may have profound implications for the treatment of cortical injury. Finally, our results suggest that there appears to be a coordinated process in which neurogenesis and angiogenesis share common molecular triggers. In the future, we will examine the roles that VEGF plays in neuronal maturation and assess the potential roles of VEGF in modulating neuronal plasticity within the developing brain and the coordination that exists between neurons and the blood vessels that supply them.

Whereas a number of phosphorylation targets has been described for the AKT/PKB kinases, both biochemical and genetic evidence support a subset of forkhead transcription factors including FKHR, FKHR-L1, and AFX as being important substrates for phosphorylation mediated by these kinases (16.Ogg S.

This outcome is an important component of cell survival mediated by the PI3K pathway, because nuclear localization of these forkhead family members results in the induction of transcriptional programs that lead to rapid cell death by apoptosis (17.Brunet A.

The induction of FKHR-mediated transcription results in a profound up-regulation of IGFBP-1 transcript (21.Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S.D. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as well as p27kipprotein levels (20.Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and although it is likely that the induction of p27kip results in cell cycle arrest, it is not clear how either of these targets could induce the rapid cell death that is observed. Recently, the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, BIM, was found to be induced in lymphocytes by growth factor withdrawal or FKHR-L1. However, although overexpression of this protein induced apoptosis, it was unclear whether BIM alone was sufficient to mediate FKHR-L1-mediated cell death in other cell types (24.Dijkers P. Medema R. Lammers J. Koenderman L. Coffer P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar).To isolate genes that are potentially involved with AFX-mediated apoptosis, we have produced cell lines that can be induced to synthesize a constitutively active form of AFX, and we have used these cell lines to examine AFX-modulated transcriptional changes. Here we describe an AFX-induced transcriptional program that involves the induction of the transcriptional repressor, BCL-6. An examination of potential targets for BCL-6 repression revealed that the gene encoding the anti-apoptotic BH3 protein, BCL-XL, contains BCL-6/STAT-binding sites, and we demonstrate that the induction of the AFX-transcriptional program results in the down-regulation of BCL-XL transcript and protein levels. Finally, we demonstrate the novel and unexpected finding that macrophages isolated from BCL-6−/− mice die with slower kinetics as compared with wild-type macrophages. These results thus describe a novel pro-apoptotic transcriptional repression program that is activated by nuclear localization of the AFX-type forkhead protein.RESULTSTo identify genes that are regulated by the AFX-type forkhead transcription factor, we derived HeLa cell lines that could be induced to generate a mutated form of AFX, which cannot be phosphorylated by the AKT/PKB kinase. Because phosphorylation of this transcription factor regulates its subcellular localization (17.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), a non-phosphorylatable form of the protein would be localized to the nuclear compartment in which it would constitutively activate the transcription of target genes. The AFX cDNA was under the control of the TET-On™ system, and its expression could thus be regulated by the addition of doxycycline (DOX). In addition, AFX contained the green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its carboxyl terminus, and we could thus follow the expression of the protein as well as its subcellular localization in real time. Fig. 1A illustrates that cells induced to express the AFX-GFP protein showed complete nuclear localization of the transcription factor. In addition, cells expressing AFX-GFP showed nuclear condensation and cell surface blebbing that are characteristic of apoptosis. An analysis of cell viability revealed that cells began to die ∼18–24 h after induction of AFX, and ∼70% cells were dead at 48 h after induction (Fig. 1B). The 20% apoptosis exhibited by this cell line in the presence of DOX for 18 h was the basal level (Fig. 1D). Further analysis demonstrated that cells expressing AFX were undergoing death by apoptosis (27.Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). An examination of caspase 3 activation (data not shown) as well as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 1C) demonstrated that these two components of the apoptotic death pathway were both induced in response to AFX synthesis. In addition, cell death could be almost completely inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1D), consistent with the activation of caspases being responsible for the observed cellular mortality. Finally, two genes that are known to be induced in response to AFX-type forkhead transcription factors, p27kip1 (Fig. 1C) (20.Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), were both up-regulated after AFX induction. Together, these results demonstrated that the induction and nuclear localization of AFX alone were sufficient to activate the apoptotic cell death pathway in this cell system.The data of Fig. 1 suggest that the activation of a transcription program by AFX is sufficient to induce the apoptotic death pathway through caspase activation. To examine genes that are regulated by AFX, we analyzed the transcripts in cells at various times after AFX induction using the GeneCalling™ procedure (25.Shimkets R. Lowe D. Tai J. Sehl P. Jin H.

An analysis of transcripts in DOX-induced versus non-induced cell lines revealed a large number of AFX-affected mRNAs, and a complete analysis of these changes will be published elsewhere.

As Fig. 2A illustrates, the GeneCalling™ procedure revealed that a fragment corresponding to theBCL-6 mRNA was clearly induced ∼18 h after AFX synthesis was initiated. To examine this induction in a more quantitative manner, TaqManTM-quantitative PCR analysis was performed at various times after AFX induction. Fig. 2Billustrates that BCL-6 transcript was up-regulated in response to AFX synthesis with maximal transcript at ∼20 h after AFX induction. In addition, this time course revealed that BCL-6transcription was significantly induced by 5 h after the addition of DOX and that the transcript began to level off after the 15-h time point (Fig. 2B). Whereas these data suggested that the transcript was regulated in response to AFX synthesis, Fig. 2C illustrates that the protein was also induced in response to AFX with a lag time of ∼3 h after the appearance of AFX. Importantly, BCL-6 was not induced in the absence of DOX or in cell lines not engineered to express mutant AFX (Fig. 2C). Finally, Fig. 2Dillustrates that the BLC-6 transcript is up-regulated by the inhibition of the AKT/PKB pathway with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, consistent with a role for this survival kinase in the regulation of AFX-transcriptional activity. Similar up-regulation of BCL-6transcript levels was observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293E treated with LY294002 for 24 h (data not shown). Together, these data suggested that BCL-6 is a transcriptional target gene for AFX.Figure 2BCL-6 up-regulation by AFX.A, GeneCallingTM analysis (25.Shimkets R. Lowe D. Tai J. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R.

Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) of transcripts in AFX stable cells induced versus non-induced with DOX for various times reveals several bands that were significantly up-regulated in the induced samples. Subsequent poisoning and TrapPing experiments (25.Shimkets R. Lowe D. Tai J. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Predki P. Rothberg B. Murtha M. Roth M. Shenoy S. Windemuth A. Simpson J. Simons J. Daley M. Gold S. McKenna M. Hillan K. Went G. Rothberg J. Nature Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) confirmed that these bands correspond to the BCL-6 gene (data not shown). A representative band, l0c0-124.4, highlighted here by a red vertical line is up-regulated 4.8-fold in cells induced with DOX for 18 h (EI18+D) as compared with that in non-induced cells (EI18−D). B, BCL-6 transcript levels increase with DOX induction. AFX stable cells were grown in the presence or absence of DOX. At the indicated times after DOX treatment, total RNA was isolated from adherent cells and subjected to TaqMan™-quantitative PCR. Relative BCL-6 RNA levels are depicted after normalizing to GAPDH mRNA levels. Similar results were obtained when RNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels (data not shown). After 5 h of DOX induction,BCL-6 transcript level is increased ∼3-fold over that of a 0-h sample. At 20 h after DOX induction, BCL-6 reaches a maximum induction of ∼6.7-fold, similar to that observed by the GeneCallingTM procedure. After 15 h of DOX induction, the level of BCL-6 transcript levels off. Every sample was analyzed in triplicate in each TaqMan™ experiment. Data shown are the averages of three independent experiments. Error barsrepresent the means ± S.E. C, BCL-6 protein levels increase in the presence of DOX-induced AFX expression. After growing in the presence or absence of DOX for the indicated times, the parental HeLa Tet-On™ cells and the AFX stable cells (cell line 15-14) were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting. Left panel, anti-FLAG antibody reveals that TM-AFX-GFP is not present in HeLa Tet-On™ cells even in the presence of DOX. In the 15-14 AFX stable cells, there is a small but detectable amount of TM-AFX-GFP expression (arrow) in the absence of DOX, although the levels do not increase over time. In contrast, in the presence of DOX, a high level of AFX expression is achieved beginning at 3 h of DOX treatment. Anti-BCL-6 antibody detects a small amount of BCL-6 protein in HeLa Tet-OnTM cells at 24 h regardless of DOX treatment (right panel). 15-14 AFX stable cells, which have a slightly leaky expression of AFX, also show small levels of BCL-6 protein in the absence of DOX. In the presence of DOX, BCL-6 protein expression is significantly induced 6 h after the addition of DOX, reaches a maximum level at 10 h, and begins to decline slightly between 10 and 16 h. D, the inhibition of the PI3K pathway activates BCL-6 transcription. HeLa cells not engineered to express inducible AFX were cultured in the presence of Me2SO (DMSO) or 25 μmLY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by TaqMan™-quantitative PCR. RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. The addition of LY294002 increased the endogenous BCL-6 transcript level ∼2-fold (p = 0.00059). Both samples were analyzed in triplicate in each TaqMan™ experiment. Data shown are averages of three independent experiments. Error bars represent the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An examination of the BCL-6 promoter region (35.Ohashi K. Miki T. Hirosawa S. Aoki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) revealed that it contains a number of potential consensus AFX-binding sites (5′-(G/C)(A/C)N(G/a)T(A/c)AA(T/c)A(T/g)(T/g)(G/c)-3′) (Fig. 3A,S1–S8) (36.Leenders H. Whitfield S. Benoist C. Mathis D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2980-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of these sites, we produced various truncations of the promoter region and analyzed the activation of a downstream luciferase reporter gene in response to cotransfected AFX. As a control, we also cotransfected a form of AFX with a single point mutation (151HR152153) that abolishes DNA binding and transcriptional activation (19.Tang E. Nunez G. Barr F. Guan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B illustrates that a promoter fragment containing ∼1296 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box gave a 6-fold increase in luciferase production in response to transfected wild-type AFX but showed no response to the DNA-binding mutant of AFX. Fragments corresponding to ∼600 and ∼185 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box also showed a significant although decreased response to AFX, whereas a control plasmid lacking the BCL-6promoter region showed no enhanced response. These data suggested that multiple sequence elements in the BCL-6 promoter might act as functional AFX-binding sites. To examine these sites for AFX binding, we performed gel shift assays using wild-type and mutant AFX DNA-binding domains. The S6 site bound avidly to the wild type but not to the DNA-binding mutant of AFX (Fig. 3, C andD). Other sites also appeared to bind to the wild-type DNA-binding domain although with apparently less affinity than the S6 site. Furthermore, the S6-binding site can compete specifically for AFX binding with itself as well as with a known forkhead-binding site (irs) derived from the IGFBP-1 promoter (19.Tang E. Nunez G. Barr F. Guan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), whereas the S2 site that did not interact with AFX failed to compete (Fig. 3D). The importance of the S6 target site was further verified by the observation that a single nucleotide mutation of this site that was shown to result in greatly decreased AFX binding (data not shown) resulted in significantly lower AFX activation of theBCL-6 promoter (Fig. 3E), approximately equal to that seen for the truncation mutant lacking the S6-binding site (Fig. 3B). Finally, the examination of the BCL-6promoter region also revealed a consensus BCL-6-binding site (5′-(T/a/c/g)(T/c)(C/a/t)(C/t/g)(T/a)(A/C/g)GAA (A/T)(G/a/c)-3′) (Fig. 3A) (29.Staudt L. Dent A. Shaffer A. Yu X. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 18: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35.Ohashi K. Miki T. Hirosawa S. Aoki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because BCL-6 is a transcriptional repressor, we reasoned that this site might act to regulate negatively AFX-induced BCL-6 expression. Fig. 3F illustrates that increasing levels of AFX expression initially up-regulate and then down-regulate BCL-6 promoter activity. In addition, the mutation of the BCL-6-binding site significantly enhances the response of the promoter to transfected AFX, although the promoter is still ultimately down-regulated. These data suggest that there is a negative feedback effect of AFX on the BCL-6 promoter that is in part probably due to endogenously produced BCL-6 regulating its own promoter negatively. Similar results were observed when luciferase assays were performed in BJAB cells, a lymphoid cell line (Fig. 3G).Because the PI3K lipid kinase pathway controls the AKT/PKB protein kinases (1.Toker A. Cantley L. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), we searched for survival-regulating genes that might also be regulated by this pathway through the expression of BCL-6. The levels of the critical pro-survival BH3 protein BCL-XL have been found to be regulated by the PI3K pathway in a number of studies, and several reports have suggested that BCL-XL levels can be down-modulated by the overexpression of BCL-6 (19.Tang E.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of Rab27A-dependent membrane trafficking or the specific effector molecules of Rab27A. In this study, we discovered that the Slp (synaptotagmin-like protein) homology domain (SHD) of Slp1–3 and Slac2-a/b specifically and directly binds the GTP-bound form of Rab27A both in vitro and in intact cells but not of the other Rabs tested (Rab1, Rab2, Rab3A, Rab4, Rab5A, Rab6A, Rab7, Rab8, Rab9, Rab10, Rab11A, Rab17, Rab18, Rab20, Rab22, Rab23, Rab25, Rab28, and Rab37). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that Slp2 (or Slp1) colocalized with Rab27A in the melanosomes of melanoma cells. Slp2 and Rab27A were distributed to the periphery of the cells (especially at the dendritic tips) in the wild-type melanoma cells, whereas they accumulated in the perinuclear region in the melanosome transport-defective cells (S91/Cloudman). These results strongly indicated that the SHD of Slp1–3 and Slac2 functions as an in vivo Rab27A binding domain. rab27A, which encodes a small GTP-binding protein, was recently identified as a gene in which mutations caused human hemophagocytic syndrome (Griscelli syndrome) andashen mice, which exhibit defects in melanosome transport as well as in regulated granule exocytosis in cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

The Slp family contains two conserved domains at the N terminus, referred to as Slp homology domain 1 (SHD1) and Slp homology domain 2 (SHD2) (15Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, A andC). The SHD1 and SHD2 of Slp3-a and Slp4 are separated by a sequence containing two zinc-finger motifs, whereas Slp1 and Slp2-a lack such zinc-finger motifs, and their SHD1 and SHD2 are linked together. The SHD has also been found in other proteins, including Slac2-a (Slp homologue lacking C2domains-a) (15Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Images were pseudo-colored and superimposed with Adobe Photoshop software (version 5.0). cDNAs encoding the SHD or RBD were amplified by conventional PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 (or -2T) vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described previously (29Fukuda M.

GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by the standard method (37Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using bovine serum albumin for reference. GST-Slp1-SHD encoded amino acids 1–117 of mouse Slp1, GST-Slp2-a-SHD encoded amino acids 1–87 of mouse Slp2-a, GST-Slp3-a-SHD encoded amino acids 1–152 of mouse Slp3-a, GST-Slp4-SHD encoded amino acids 1–150 of mouse Slp4, GST-Slac2-a-SHD encoded amino acids 1–153 of mouse Slac2-a, GST-Slac2-b-SHD encoded amino acids 1–87 of human Slac2-b, and GST-rabphilin-3-RBD encoded amino acids 1–186 of mouse rabphilin-3. COS-7 cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged Rab proteins were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A, and the proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 17,360 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, each of the cell lysates was appropriately diluted beforehand so that the same amount of Rab proteins would be contained in the reaction mixture (see Fig. 2 A). The amount of Rab proteins in the reaction mixtures was confirmed by immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.). A 20-μl volume of glutathione-Sepharose beads (wet volume) coupled with 1 μg of GST fusion proteins (or GST alone) was incubated with 1 ml of COS-7 cell lysate containing Rab proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads five times with 1 ml of the buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), proteins trapped with the beads were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and then immunoblotted with HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (27Fukuda M.

The FLAG-Rab27A protein in the cell lysates described above was affinity-purified by incubation with 10 μl of anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer 1 containing 1m NaCl to remove proteins that nonspecifically bound to the beads or Rab27A. After washing twice with 1 ml of the buffer 1, the beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg each of GST-Slp1-SHD, -Slp3-a-SHD, or -Slac2-a-SHD in 1 ml of buffer 2 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) containing 0.5 mm GTPγS. After washing the beads with 1 ml of buffer 1 five times, GST fusion proteins trapped with the beads were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with HRP-conjugated anti-GST antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody as described previously (27Fukuda M.

The recombinant FLAG-Rab27A was affinity-purified with the anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel as described above. A guanine nucleotide-exchange reaction was performed by incubating of the FLAG-Rab27A-bound beads for 1 h at 4 °C with buffer 1 containing either 0.5 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP. The beads were then incubated with COS-7 cell lysates containing T7-tagged Slp1, Slp3-a, or Slac2-a in 1 ml of buffer 2 containing either 0.5 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with 1 ml of buffer 1 five times, proteins trapped with the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody as described previously (27Fukuda M.

In our previous study, we found a novel protein motif, the Slp homology domain (SHD) in the N-terminal domain of Slp1–4 and Slac2-a (15Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A data base search revealed the existence of an additional SHD-containing protein lacking two C2 domains, and we therefore named it Slac2-b (Fig.1 A). The SHD consists of SHD1 and SHD2, which are separated by two zinc-finger motifs in some molecules (asterisks in Fig. 1 A), and homology search analysis indicated that the SHD of Slp1–4 and Slac2 shows striking homology to the Rab3 binding domain (RBD) of RIM1, RIM2, rabphilin-3, and Noc2 (18Yamaguchi T.

It should be noted that all the SHD2 included a sequence similar to the Rab3-binding site of rabphilin-3 (SGAWFF; # in Fig. 1 C) (38Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, because the SHD of the Slp family and Slac2 forms a distinct branch from the RBD of RIM1, RIM2, rabphilin-3, and Noc2 in the phylogenetic tree, we hypothesized that the SHD functions as a certain Rab (other than Rab3) binding domain. To verify this hypothesis, we prepared twenty different Rab proteins (Rab1, Rab2, Rab3A, Rab4A, Rab5A, Rab6A, Rab7, Rab8, Rab9, Rab10, Rab11A, Rab17, Rab18, Rab20, Rab22, Rab23, Rab25, Rab27A, Rab28, and Rab37), which are known to be present in distinct membrane structures and involved in membrane trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 24Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). Each of the Rab proteins with a FLAG tag was expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.2 A), and a GST pull-down assay was performed by using the SHD of Slp1, Slp2-a, Slp3-a, Slp4, Slac2-a, Slac2-b, and the RBD of rabphilin-3 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). To our surprise, all the SHDs interacted with Rab27A. The SHD of Slp1, Slp2-a, and Slac2-b specifically interacted with Rab27A but not with other Rabs (Fig. 2, C, D, andH). The SHD of Slp3-a and Slac2-a preferentially interacted with Rab27A and weakly with Rab10 (Fig. 2, E andG). The SHD of Slp4 preferentially interacted with Rab8 and Rab27A and weakly with Rab3A (Fig. 2 F). By contrast, the RBD of rabphilin-3 interacted with Rab3A, Rab8, and Rab27A with almost similar affinity (Fig. 2 I). Under our experimental conditions, none of the Rab proteins were trapped with the beads coupled with GST alone (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the interaction of the SHD with Rab27A is not a nonspecific interaction with GST or beads alone. It should be noted that Rab3A, Rab8, and Rab27A are phylogenetically similar and form a small branch on the phylogenetic tree (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2077026916,"Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional coactivator protein Gcn5 functions as a catalytic histone acetyltransferase (HAT). In this work, we examine the roles of the Ada2 and Ada3 coactivator proteins that are functionally linked to Gcn5. We show that yeast Ada2, Ada3, and Gcn5 form a catalytic core of the ADA and Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase HAT complexes, which is necessary and sufficient in vitro for nucleosomal HAT activity and lysine specificity of the intact HAT complexes. We also demonstrate that Ada3 is necessary for Gcn5-dependent nucleosomal HAT activity in yeast extracts. Our results suggest that Ada2 potentiates the Gcn5 catalytic activity and that Ada3 facilitates nucleosomal acetylation and an expanded lysine specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2106762735,"We have developed methods that allow detection, quantitation, purification, and identification of cardiac proteinsS-thiolated during ischemia and reperfusion. Cysteine was biotinylated and loaded into isolated rat hearts. During oxidative stress, biotin-cysteine forms a disulfide bond with reactive protein cysteines, and these can be detected by probing Western blots with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. S-Thiolated proteins were purified using streptavidin-agarose. Thus, we demonstrated that reperfusion and diamide treatment increased S-thiolation of a number of cardiac proteins by 3- and 10-fold, respectively. Dithiothreitol treatment of homogenates fully abolished the signals detected. Fractionation studies indicated that the modified proteins are located within the cytosol, membrane, and myofilament/cytoskeletal compartments of the cardiac cells. This shows that biotin-cysteine gains rapid and efficient intracellular access and acts as a probe for reactive protein cysteines in all cellular locations. Using Western blotting of affinity-purified proteins we identified actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, HSP27, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase Cα, and the small G-protein ras as substrates for S-thiolation during reperfusion of the ischemic rat heart. MALDI-TOF mass fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides independently confirmed actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase S-thiolation during reperfusion.

Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1991; 5: 853-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein thiols have been implicated as targets of this oxidative attack (2Haddock P.S. Shattock M.J. Hearse D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 38: H297-H307Google Scholar), and it is likely that injury involves terminal or irreversible oxidation of these reactive groups. Less severe oxidative damage occurs during reperfusion after shorter sublethal periods of ischemia and reperfusion (ischemic preconditioning), and this initiates a stress-adaptive signaling response (3Zucchi R.

Post-translational modification by S-thiolation can regulate protein function in much the same way as phosphorylation (5Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Although protein S-thiolation is modulated by the cellular redox status, there are also specialized enzyme systems that catalyze the addition or removal of low molecular weight thiols (6Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). There are an increasing number of proteins that are known to be regulated byS-thiolation.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The study of protein S-thiolation in vivo is technically challenging, and this has hindered progress in this area. Many studies of protein S-thiolation during oxidant stress have used cultured cells with a radiolabeled thiol pool in which theS-thiolated proteins are detected by autoradiography of non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels (19Collison M.W. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The investigation of specific proteins that are known to be S-thiolated has been achieved by non-reducing isoelectric-focusing gel electrophoresis coupled with Western blotting (8Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 310: 273-281Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The basis of this approach is that proteinS-thiolation changes the isoelectric point of proteins, which alters the isoelectric focusing banding pattern (an effect that is reversible by application of chemical reducing agents such as DTT).1 The methods we have developed overcome many of the difficulties in the investigation of protein S-thiolation. Previously, we used biotinylated glutathione to detect and purify proteins that are S-glutathiolated during ischemia and reperfusion (20Eaton P. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.)3380Google Scholar, 21Eaton P. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Circulation. 1998; 98 (abstr.)4223Google Scholar). However, this probe for reactive cysteines was inefficient in crossing the plasma membrane, and primarily labeled membrane proteins. Here we report a refinement of this approach, which exploits biotinylated cysteine (biotin-cysteine) as a probe for proteins that are S-thiolated during oxidant stress. Biotin-cysteine rapidly crosses the plasma membrane and can be used to detect, quantify, purify, and identify proteins susceptible to oxidation in all compartments of the cell. Here we show that cytosolic and detergent-insoluble (myofilament and cytoskeletal) proteins are also major substrates forS-thiolation during the pro-oxidizing condition in myocardium. We have also been able to identify a number of the proteins that become S-thiolated in the myocardium following ischemia and reperfusion. S-Thiolation of proteins during ischemia and reperfusion is particularly significant (as this is a physiologically relevant oxidant stress), whereas many studies use chemical oxidants that cause a physiologically irrelevant redox change. These were obtained from Sigma or BDH unless stated and were of AnalaR grade or above. 120 mg of the water-soluble biotinylation reagent sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK) was added to 29 mg of cysteine in 2 ml of 10× phosphate-buffered saline and left to derivatize for one hour at room temperature. The mildly alkaline reaction conditions ensure that the amino (and not the thiol) group is the primary target for derivatization. Biotin-cysteine (Fig.1 A) was then purified using a Shimadzu HPLC system with an automated fraction collector on an APEX, 5-μm ODS column (Jones Chromatography, Hengoed, UK) with detection at λmax (190–400 nm) using a diode array detector. Biotin-cysteine was added to the bicarbonate perfusion buffers when required at a concentration of 0.5 mm, and this was confirmed spectrophotometrically using the Ellman reagent (Pierce and Warriner, UK) with cysteine as a standard. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were used throughout this study and were obtained from BK Universal. The animals were maintained humanely in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institute of Health (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1985). Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (40 mg) and injected with sodium heparin (200 IU) via the femoral vein. Hearts were rapidly excised, placed in cold (4 °C) bicarbonate buffer, and cannulated. The hearts were then perfused with bicarbonate buffer gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Perfusion was in the non-recirculating Langendorff mode at a constant flow of 12 ml/g tissue per min. The bicarbonate buffer contained (in mmol/liter): NaCl, 118.5; KCl, 3.1; KH2PO4, 1.18; NaHCO3, 25.0; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.4; and glucose, 10.0. The perfusion protocols used in this study are summarized are shown in Fig. 1 B. In studies involving whole heart zero-flow ischemia, this was initiated by terminating perfusion, during which time hearts continued to be maintained at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled chamber. Reperfusion was achieved by reinitiating perfusion for the required time. Hearts were homogenized (10 ml of buffer per g of cardiac tissue) on ice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, benzamidine (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 ng/ml), and aprotinin (100 ng/ml) pH 7.0 using a polytron tissue grinder. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant containing cytosolic protein was removed. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again at 4 °C for 10 min at 20,000 ×g. The supernatant (enriched in membrane proteins) was removed from the pellet that represents cytoskeletal and myofilament proteins. Each of the three fractions was reconstituted in SDS buffer without a reducing agent. SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Bio-Rad mini protean II system. In some samples, to confirm thatS-thiolated/biotinylated proteins were modified via disulfide formation, 20 mm DTT was added to the SDS buffer. After electrophoresis samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using a semi-dry blotter (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).S-Thiolated proteins were identified by virtue of their biotin tags using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Western blots were digitized using a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet 11C). The digitized image was then quantitatively analyzed for total protein S-thiolation in each lane using the NIH-Image software. S-Thiolated proteins were affinity-purified using streptavidin-agarose. Hearts were homogenized (10 ml of buffer per g of cardiac tissue) on ice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, benzamidine (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 ng/ml), and aprotinin (100 ng/ml) pH 7.0 using a polytron tissue grinder. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were used directly for the purification of the oxidized protein. The cytoskeletal and myofilament pellet proteins were solubilized by resuspension in homogenization buffer containing 1% SDS. Each fraction was rotated at 4 °C overnight. The agarose pellet was then extensively washed with phosphate buffered saline and 1% Triton X-100. S-Thiolated proteins were released from the streptavidin-agarose by treatment with 20 mm DTT in phosphate buffered saline. Affinity-purified proteins were reconstituted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane we tested for the presence of candidate proteins. The proteins were selected on the basis that there is previous evidence in the literature suggesting that they are targets for thiol modification. The presence of these proteins was tested using standard immunoblotting methods. The antibodies used included actin (Sigma), GAPDH (Biogenesis, UK), HSP27 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Ltd., distributed by Bioquote Ltd., York, UK), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), protein kinase Cα (Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Ras protein (Transduction Laboratories) Tryptic digests were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE-Pro instrument operated in reflectron mode. All spectra were internally calibrated using a lock mass routine based on the monoisotopic molecular ion relating to a trypsin autolysis product present at m/z 2163.0569. A list of monoisotopic peptide masses was obtained for each sample. These were submitted to the Mascot data base searching algorithm. Each protein was identified by matching multiple peptides to the corresponding entry within the SwissProt data base. A mass accuracy of 30 ppm was specified. A Shimadzu HPLC system, equipped with diode array detection and automated fraction collection was utilized. Separation was carried out using a Hewlett Packard Zorbax 300SB C8 reverse phase column, an optimized trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient and detection at 280 nm. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were assessed using analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test. Differences were considered significant at the 95% confidence level. Fig.2 A shows that there was a low, basal level of protein S-thiolation in the aerobically perfused isolated rat heart and that ischemia and reperfusion or treatment with the thiol-selective oxidant diamide increased the amount of protein oxidation. Quantitative analysis of total proteinS-thiolation (Fig. 2 B) shows that the physiologically relevant oxidative burden of ischemia and reperfusion significantly (p < 0.05) increased the modified protein (3-fold). The thiol-selective oxidant diamide was particularly effective at inducing protein S-thiolation; significantly (p < 0.05) increasing it 10-fold above control and DTT treatment of these samples abolished S-thiolation. Fig.3 shows that proteins from cytosolic, membrane, and cytoskeletal/myofilament fractions were allS-thiolated during ischemia and reperfusion. The largest overall amount of S-thiolation occurred in the cytosolic and cytoskeletal/myofilament fractions. Fig.4 A shows a Coomassie-stained gel of S-thiolated proteins that were affinity-purified using streptavidin-agarose from a cardiac homogenate treated with SDS, which will solubilize all of the protein components present. Clearly there are S-thiolated proteins over the entire molecular weight range of this 10% acrylamide gel, and this represents theS-thiolation of a great many proteins (possibly hundreds) during cardiac reperfusion. HPLC analysis of S-thiolated proteins purified from the cytosol (Fig. 4 B) shows that there are about twenty dominant S-thiolation substrates in this fraction. Fig. 5 shows a series of Western immunoblots in which we have used a panel of antibodies to probe the affinity-purified S-thiolated proteins. The antibodies used were selected because they probe for proteins that have been described previously to be susceptible to cysteine-targeted oxidative modifications. This study shows that proteins that are S-thiolated during cardiac reperfusion include actin, GAPDH, HSP27, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase Cα, and the small G-protein ras. At the present time, the majority of the proteins oxidized at cysteine residues during reperfusion remain unknown. Further analysis of the affinity-purified sample may identify proteins that are not yet known to be regulated byS-thiolation. Delayed extraction MALDI mass fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides identified four of the purifiedS-thiolated proteins. Fig. 6shows a representative peptide mass fingerprint obtained after in-gel digestion of a 25-kDa S-thiolated protein shown in Fig.4 A. 12 peptides were found to match those expected for triosephosphate isomerase, which represents 53% sequence coverage. Other proteins identified in this way included GAPDH, actin, aconitate hydratase, M-protein, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, and myoglobin. It is noteworthy that the immunoblot analysis, which also identified actin and GAPDH as S-thiolation substrates, was carried out prior to the MALDI-TOF analysis. In this study we have shown the practical application of biotin-cysteine in the investigation of protein S-thiolation. These methods will find application in isolated organs, tissues, cell cultures, or homogenates where redox-induced proteinS-thiolation is of interest. The presence of a biotin tag on proteins that become S-thiolated allowed a range of investigative procedures to be carried out, which exploit the high affinity of biotin for avidin derivatives. Thus, S-thiolated proteins were detected on non-reducing Western blots using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence and were quantified via digitization and pixel intensity analysis.S-Thiolated proteins were purified using a streptavidin affinity matrix and subsequently eluted using DTT. These proteins were then identified using Western blotting and antibodies to candidate proteins that are known to have reactive cysteines or MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis of tryptic peptides involving protein data base searching. N-terminal sequencing and public data base searching of the purified proteins are also suitable methods for identifying each protein. The subcellular fractionation studies showed that membrane, cytoskeletal/myofilament, and cytosolic proteins becomeS-thiolated during reperfusion. The modification of cytosolic proteins at this time demonstrates that biotin-cysteine gains rapid intracellular access. Previously we used biotinylated glutathione to detect S-thiolated proteins, but we found that membrane proteins were the principal targets for modification and that few cytosolic proteins were labeled (20Eaton P. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.)3380Google Scholar, 21Eaton P. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Circulation. 1998; 98 (abstr.)4223Google Scholar). The biotin-GSH did not efficiently cross the plasma membrane, indicating the advantage of the present method utilizing biotin-cysteine. The use of avidin-coupled fluorescent dyes would also allow the localization of modified proteins using microscopy. Clearly the pathophysiological oxidant stress associated with ischemia and reperfusion results inS-thiolation of a range of cardiac proteins. The amount ofS-thiolation induced by the thiol-selective diamide was considerably greater than that induced by reperfusion, indicating that only a small proportion of proteins are S-thiolated during the ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Our findings agree with studies that have used myocytes or cell lines with 35S-labeled GSH to show that S-glutathiolation occurs following treatment with chemical oxidants, which simulates the oxidative component of ischemia and reperfusion (19Collison M.W. Thomas J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein S-thiolation during reperfusion is expected because free radicals are known to be produced at this time (22Garlick P.B. Davies M.J. Hearse D.J. Slater T.F. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). These free radicals target thiol groups, rendering many proteins dysfunctional, and may contribute to myocardial stunning or reperfusion arrhythmias (1Hearse D.J. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1991; 5: 853-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein cysteines can be modified by a range of electrophilic species with a spectrum of potential cysteine oxidation products, some of which are reversible. Reversible cysteine modifications includingS-thiolation, can be regarded as a protective mechanism in which reactive protein thiols are protected from irreversible or terminal oxidation by the formation of a mixed disulfide with a low molecular weight thiol. The proteins that were modified by biotin-cysteine during reperfusion are likely to be representative of proteins with reactive cysteines that are particularly susceptible to oxidation in a number of different ways (not justS-thiolation). Thus, although we have detectedS-thiolated proteins during early reperfusion, there may also be a variety of other oxidative cysteine modifications occurring at the same time. In the absence of biotin-cysteine, the modification may involve a range of species including glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, nitrosoglutathione, glutathione sulfonamide, glutathione disulfide S-oxide, nitric oxide, hypochlorous acid, or other oxidizing species. This is illustrated by studies showing that cysteines within the G-protein Ha-Ras are susceptible to bothS-thiolation and S-nitrosylation (17Mallis R.J. Buss J.E. Thomas J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Presumably, the oxidative cysteine end products that dominate during an oxidative insult will depend on many factors, including the nature and intensity of the oxidizing species and intracellular spatial distribution. Protein cysteines can also be progressively oxidized by oxygen to form sulfenic (−SOH), sulfinic (SOOH) or sulfonic (SO3H). Sulfenic modifications are reversible and chemically reducible, and its formation is functionally critical in the activity and regulation of some proteins (23Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Whether or not a protein thiol undergoes reversible or irreversible oxidation will depend on whether it encounters a low molecular weight thiol or molecular oxygen as well as the extent of the oxidative insult. A greater oxidative burden may be expected after longer periods of ischemia because at this time low molecular weight thiol antioxidants are depleted, as are NADPH and ATP, which are required for the maintenance of many antioxidant defense systems (24Ceconi C. Bernocchi P. Boraso A. Cargnoni A. Pepi P. Curello S. Ferrari R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 47: 586-594Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the proteins we have detected by virtue of an S-thiolation reaction are those that are likely to be oxidized (reversibly or irreversibly) during cardiac reperfusion. These proteins may represent the actual molecular targets of the oxidative damage that accompanies reperfusion and consequently may represent potential therapeutic targets. The formation of terminally oxidized protein thiols will have far reaching consequences because as these proteins will have to be replaced by de novo synthesis. Functionally critical reactive thiol groups are found in many key cardiac proteins including those that are important in ATP production (9Reddy S. Jones A.D. vanderVliet A. Cross C.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 223Crossref Google Scholar), ionic homeostasis (7Shattock M.J. Matsuura H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 91-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), signal transduction (14Ward N.E.

Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The oxidation of these key proteins would have profound implications for cardiac function and viability during oxidative stress. There are multiple mechanisms by which proteinS-thiolation may occur in the isolated rat heart during post-ischemic reperfusion. It is not clear whether a single mechanism is solely responsible for S-thiolation or if several mechanisms contribute. Metal-catalyzed oxidation or disulfide bond exchange are likely modes of protein S-thiolation in the heart. Biotin-cysteine is likely to form a range of low molecular weight mixed disulfides including self-dimerization and with endogenous cysteine, glutathione, or other cysteine-containing molecules. Once formed, these mixed disulfides will exchange with reduced protein thiols and cause S-thiolation. Commassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis ofS-thiolated proteins that have been affinity-purified demonstrates that a great many proteins become S-thiolated during oxidant stress. HPLC analysis of S-thiolated proteins from the cytosol shows that there are about twenty dominant proteins present. Western blot analysis of affinity-purifiedS-thiolated proteins with antibodies to candidate proteins has demonstrated that actin, GAPDH, HSP27, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase Cα, and the G-protein ras areS-thiolated during cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry peptide mapping has also independently identified GAPDH and actin as target proteins forS-thiolation. In addition MALDI-TOF analysis has also identified triosephosphate isomerase and aconitate hydratase (aconitase) as oxidative targets. Clearly, the majority of the proteins that are S-thiolated during reperfusion remain unknown. Most of the S-thiolation substrates we have identified are proteins that have already been reported to have reactive cysteine residues susceptible to oxidation. Indeed there is evidence in cellular systems for the S-thiolation of actin, GAPDH, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase C, and the G-protein ras (8Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 310: 273-281Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25010-25015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSP27 S-thiolation has been previously observed in an in vitro system in which GSSG was added to purified protein. Cysteine 141 is the only thiol group within rat cardiac HSP27 and therefore must be the site ofS-thiolation. These studies also showed that HSP27 formed disulfide-linked dimers and that these paired protein molecules assemble into the large multimeric complexes (28Zavialov A. Benndorf R. Ehrnsperger M. Zav'yalov V. Dudich I. Buchner J. Gaesrel M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Dudich I.V. Zav'yalov V.P. Pfeil W. Gaestel M. Zav'yalova G.A. Deneyuk A.I. Korpela T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has also been shown in a cell model that there is a direct relationship between the multimeric aggregate size of HSP27 and the concentration of GSH as well as evidence that there is interplay between the HSP27 and GSH that regulates the cellular levels of these molecules (30Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 241: 187-192Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of HSP27 regulates its ability to act as a molecular chaperone and also controls its ability to inhibit the polymerization of actin, an intermediate filament protein that interestingly is also a known target of S-thiolation (8Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 310: 273-281Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Many metabolic enzymes are known to have reactive cysteine residues, the oxidation of which inactivates these proteins (31Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2001; 63: 69-172Google Scholar). Identification of GAPDH is consistent with previous reports (including our own, Ref. 32Eaton P. Hearse D.J. Shattock M.J. Circulation. 2001; 102 (abstr.): 602Google Scholar), that GAPDH is a target for oxidative stress (27Ravichandran V. Seres T. Moriguchi T. Thomas J.A. Johnston R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25010-25015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mohr S. Stamler J.S. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 271: 4209-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is likely that S-thiolation occurs at the reactive and catalytically essential cysteine 149 (34Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 360: 187-194Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Oxidation of this residue inactivates the enzyme and may be achieved by a range of oxidants including GSSG, GSNO, NO, HOCl, and GS(O)SG (33Mohr S. Stamler J.S. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 271: 4209-4214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 35Pullar J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Vissers M.C.M. Am. J.

Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Triosephosphate isomerase is another glycolytic enzyme that we found to be S-thiolated during cardiac oxidative stress. It catalyzes the reversible interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (the same molecule metabolized by GAPDH) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In the disease hereditary hemochromomatosis there is a systemic deficiency of triosephosphate isomerase, causing wide ranging cardiac pathologies (41Guertl B. Noehammer C. Hoefler G. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 349-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this enzyme is likely to contribute to the metabolic deficit that is known to occur during reperfusion (42Taegtmeyer H. Goodwin G.W. Doenst T. Frazier O.H. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: A3-A10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We also detected the oxidation of another isomerase during reperfusion, the enzyme aconitase. The iron sulfur-containing citric acid enzyme aconitase is responsible for the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. Aconitase activity is dependent on the redox state of its cubane [2Fe–4S] cluster as well as the surrounding cysteine residues. Oxidants such as peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide are known to reversibly inhibit this protein and may contribute to its loss of cardiac function during ischemia and reperfusion (11Cheung P-Y. Danial H. Jong J. Schultz R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inhibition also contributes to other disease states such as neurodegeneration (43Li Q.Y. Pedersen C. Day B.J. Patel M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Myocardial aconitase activity is lost during ischemia and reperfusion, but this can be prevented by antioxidant interventions with low molecular weight thiols. In this connection, antioxidant therapy with low molecular weight thiols is known to combat cardiac injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion. Protein kinase C isoforms are known to have cysteine-rich domains that contain target residues forS-thiolation, which regulate activity. However, there have been conflicting reports of both kinase activation and inactivation following oxidation (15Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, like all tyrosine phosphatases, has catalytically essential cysteine residues (13Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21938-21942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This thiol has a lower pK a than typical thiols at cellular pH, making it more reactive and easier to oxidize, particularly when intracellular pH rises during post-ischemic reperfusion. Ras proteins are small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that couple oxidant stress-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling through the oxidation of one or more of its cysteine residues by S-thiolation or S-nitrosylation (1781). It is clear that many classes of proteins can be regulated byS-thiolation during oxidative stress; these modifications offer a potential mechanism that directly couples protein function to cellular redox state (single step signal transduction). Protein cysteine oxidation does not simply have to be a detrimental process and may be the molecular cue that initiates a biological response. For example, oxidant stress during short periods of ischemia and reperfusion is crucial to the triggering of cardioprotective stress adaptive pathways (3Zucchi R. Yu G.Y. Galbani P. Mariani M. Ronca G. Roncatestoni S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4VandenHoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Similarly, the protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning is blocked by antioxidants and initiated by pro-oxidants (45Yue Y. Krentz M. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Critz S.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H590-H595PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cohen M.V. Yang X.M. Liu G.S. Heusch G. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that modification of cysteine residues in the heart during oxidative stress may be involved with the triggering of the preconditioning cardioprotection. In this connection, protein kinase C and protein phosphatases have both been implicated in the mechanism of ischemic preconditioning; thus, it is particularly interesting that we have detected theS-thiolation during ischemia and reperfusion of the heart (44Brooks G. Hearse D.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 627-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly biotin-cysteine is a useful tool in the study of protein S-thiolation. In these studies we have shown its application and utility in the setting of ischemia and reperfusion in the isolated rat heart. The methodologies we have developed are applicable to other intact organ models of oxidant stress as well as tissue culture and in vitro models."

The interaction of β2-adaptin with β-arrestin involves critical arginine residues in the C-terminal domain of β-arrestin and plays an important role in initiating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Laporte, S. A., Oakley, R. H., Holt, J. A., Barak, L. S., and Caron, M. G. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23120–23126). However, the β-arrestin-binding site in β2-adaptin has not been identified, and little is known about the role of β-arrestin/AP-2 interaction in the endocytosis of other GPCRs. Using in vitro binding assays, we have identified two glutamate residues (Glu-849 and Glu-902) in β2-adaptin that are important in β-arrestin binding. These residues are located in the platform subdomain of the C terminus of β2-adaptin, where accessory/adapter endocytic proteins for other classes of receptors interact, distinct from the main site where clathrin interacts. The functional significance of the β-arrestin/AP-2/clathrin complex in the endocytosis of GPCRs such as the β2AR and vasopressin type II receptor was evaluated using mutant constructs of the β2-adaptin C terminus containing either the clathrin and the β-arrestin binding domains or the β-arrestin-binding domain alone. When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, both constructs acted as dominant negatives inhibiting the agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR and the vasopressin type II receptor. In addition, although the β2-adaptin construct containing both the clathrin and β-arrestin binding domains was able to block the endocytosis of transferrin receptors, a β2-adaptin construct capable of associating with β-arrestin but lacking its high affinity clathrin interaction did not interfere with transferrin receptor endocytosis. These results suggest that the interaction of β-arrestin with β2-adaptin represents a selective endocytic trigger for several members of the GPCR family. β-Arrestins, proteins involved in the turn-off of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation, bind to the β2-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-2. The interaction of β2-adaptin with β-arrestin involves critical arginine residues in the C-terminal domain of β-arrestin and plays an important role in initiating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (Laporte, S. A., Oakley, R. H., Holt, J. A., Barak, L. S., and Caron, M. G. (2000)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23120–23126). However, the β-arrestin-binding site in β2-adaptin has not been identified, and little is known about the role of β-arrestin/AP-2 interaction in the endocytosis of other GPCRs.

These results suggest that the interaction of β-arrestin with β2-adaptin represents a selective endocytic trigger for several members of the GPCR family. G protein-coupled receptor clathrin adaptor protein, AT1R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor β2-adrenergic receptor clathrin-coated vesicle glutathione S-transferase vasopressin type II receptor hemagglutinin transferrin receptor activation domain binding domain arginine vasopressin phosphate-buffered saline human embryonic kidney fluorescein isothiocyanate green fluorescent protein β-Arrestins (β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2) are cytosolic proteins involved in the homologous desensitization of many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)1 (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar,2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of GPCRs triggers the activation and the recruitment of specific GPCR protein kinases leading to the phosphorylation of cytosolic residues in the receptor to promote the subsequent binding of β-arrestin. For example, the interaction of β-arrestin with the phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) prevents further coupling to its cognate G protein (i.e. Gs), thus terminating the second messenger signaling events. β-Arrestins, initially appreciated exclusively for their ability to desensitize agonist-activated GPCRs, are now believed to play a much more intricate role in other cellular events such as endocytosis, trafficking, and intracellular signaling of the GPCRs (2Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For instance, the initial observation that β-arrestin and mutants of β-arrestin could modulate the internalization of β2AR provided evidence for a role of β-arrestins in this process (5Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Moreover, the findings that β-arrestins were able to associate with components of the endocytic machinery, such as clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2, have provided an attractive mechanism to explain how β-arrestins could engage GPCRs in the internalization pathway (6Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 7Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J.

Although β-arrestins can associate with a great number of agonist-stimulated GPCRs at the plasma membrane to trigger their internalization, the fate of the receptor/β-arrestin complexes differs greatly among receptors. For example, β-arrestin dissociates from β2AR at or near the plasma membrane following the internalization of the receptor, whereas β-arrestin has been shown to traffic into endosomes with other GPCRs like the vasopressin type II receptor (V2R) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) (8Oakley R.H.

Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins with V2R and AT1R correlates with the slow recycling to the plasma membrane and resensitization of these receptors (8Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar). However, for some GPCRs the intracellular trafficking of β-arrestins with the receptors seem to activate specific signaling pathways. For the AT1R and the protease-activating receptor 2, the formation of endosomal receptor/β-arrestin complexes has been shown to serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and the activation of components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (11McDonald P.H.

Endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) is one of the most common routes utilized by mammalian cells to internalize diverse classes of cargo such as extracellular molecules and membrane receptors. CCVs at the plasma membrane, also referred to as clathrin-coated pits, are composed of two main structural proteins: clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2 (14Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 15Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). AP-2 is a heterotetrameric complex that serves the dual role of assembling clathrin into organized cage structures and acting as an adaptor to link cargo to clathrin lattices. This is achieved through the recognition of distinct signal motifs in the cytosolic domain of membrane proteins by different subunits of AP-2. For example, the μ2-subunit of AP-2 recognizes tyrosine-based internalization signals within the cytosolic domains of receptors (16Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), whereas the β2-subunit of AP-2 (β2-adaptin) interacts with clathrin and helps to promote clathrin lattice assembly (19Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The α-subunits of AP-2 bind dynamin (20Wang L.H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a GTPase that promotes budding of clathrin-coated vesicles (21Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and recruit other endocytic accessory proteins necessary for the formation and processing of CCVs (22Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the interaction of β-arrestin with β2-adaptin is necessary for the targeting of the β2AR into CCVs and have identified critical residues in β-arrestin that mediate this interaction (23Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, little information is available for the corresponding β-arrestin-binding site in β2-adaptin. Moreover, although β-arrestin/AP-2 complexes have been shown to play a role in the internalization of the β2AR, the functional significance of these complexes in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of other GPCRs remains undetermined. In this study we sought to identify critical residues within the β2-subunit of AP-2 involved in β-arrestin binding, and have investigated the functional importance of this interaction in the internalization process of different classes of membrane receptors. Isoproterenol was purchased from Research Biochemical Inc., and arginine vasopressin (AVP) was obtained from Sigma. The anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, anti-epsin antibody was from Santa Cruz, and anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. [3H]AVP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GAL4-AD fusion proteins were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fragments derived from the N-terminal domain (1–588) and the C-terminal domain (592–937, 664–937, 784–937, and 784–840) of the human β2-adaptin were cloned into BamHI andXhoI of pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences AB). The GST-β-arrestin-1 C-terminal construct (331–418) has been described elsewhere (23Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). β2-Adaptin-(664–937)-Y888A, -E849A, and -E902A were constructed by PCR by generating two fragments: an N-terminal fragment containing a ClaI restriction site and the residues to be substituted, and a C-terminal fragment starting at the residue following the mutation and ending with the stop codon of β2-adaptin followed by a BamHI restriction site. The PCR fragments were cut with ClaI andBamHI, and blunt end-ligated into pGEX-5X-2-β2-adaptin-(664–937) cut withClaI/BamHI. Silent mutations were introduced into the N-terminal fragment of β2-adaptin-(664–937)-E902A (BamHI), and in the C-terminal fragments of β2-adaptin-(664–937)-E849A (MluI) and 664–937-Y888A (HindIII) for screening purposes. PCR fragments derived from the C-terminal domain of β2-adaptin (592–937, 664–937, and 825–937) were cloned into BamHI and XhoI of pACT-2 (Invitrogen). The GAL4-BD-β-arrestin-2 and the GAL4-AD-β2-adaptin fusion proteins have been described elsewhere (7Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Full-length GAL4-AD-β2-adaptin mutants (E849A and E902A) were generated by excising a BspEI/SacI fragment from pGEX-5X-β2-adaptin-(664–937) -E849A and -E902A, respectively, and ligating the fragments into β2-adaptin wild type digested with the same enzymes. All sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Nucleic Acid Facility, Duke University, Durham, NC). Fusion genes expressing β-arrestin-2 or β2-adaptin wild type and mutants were co-transformed into PJ69-4A yeast strains using the lithium acetate method (CLONTECH). Protein-protein interactions were assayed for their adenine (Ade) auxotrophy complementation as described previously (7Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Transient transfections were performed using a modified calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (24Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into appropriate plates and experiments were performed the following day. For internalization experiments using the β2AR or the V2R, cells were seeded at a density of 5.0–7.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates, respectively. β2-Adrenegic receptor sequestration was assessed by flow cytometry as described previously (8Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293 cells were incubated with or without isoproterenol (10 μm) for 20 min. Sequestration of receptors was defined as the fraction of cell surface receptors that was removed from the surface after exposure to agonist. Internalization of the V2R was assessed using a previously described assay with minor modifications (8Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In brief, cells expressing the V2R were incubated at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salt containing 0.2% (w/v) of bovine serum albumin in presence of 1 nm [3H]AVP for 20 min. Internalization of receptors was stopped on ice by rapidly washing the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were washed three times with either ice-cold PBS to remove the unbound agonist or ice-cold acid wash buffer (0.2 n acetic acid, pH 2.6, 150 mm NaCl) to remove both the unbound AVP and the cell surface receptor-bound agonist. Sequestration of receptors was defined as the percentage of radioligand that was acid-resistant after incubating cells for 20 min at 37 °C. Internalization of transferrin was assessed using confocal microscopy to measure the uptake of FITC-conjugated transferrin in HEK 293 cells. Cells were incubated with FITC-transferrin for 15 min at 37 °C and then fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. For the detection of β2-adaptin mutants, fixed cells were stained in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) using a primary HA antibody followed by secondary Texas red labeling. For quantification of transferrin uptake, 100 cells showing comparable expression of β2-adaptin minigene constructs (as estimated by the intensity of the fluorescence) were analyzed. Inhibition of transferrin uptake was defined as maximal when transfected cells showed a FITC signal of less than 25% of that of adjacent cells lacking the expression of the β2-adaptin constructs (i.e. when transfected cells showed a reduction of transferrin fluorescence signal of more than 75%). The level of transferrin and β2-adaptin fluorescence (in intensity per pixel) was measured in different areas of the cytoplasm using the LSM 510 microscope software as described previously (25Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). β2-Adaptin and β-arrestin-1 C-terminal constructs in pGEX-5X-2 were transformed inEscherichia coli BL21-gold (DE3) cells, and GST fusion proteins were prepared as previously described (23Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing the Flag-tagged β-arrestins or HA-tagged β2-adaptin constructs were solubilized in TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was recovered for GST fusion protein binding assays. For experiments involving mouse whole brain extract, a similar procedure was followed for protein solubilization, with the exception that whole brain was homogenized in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Binding assays were performed using 10 μg of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads that were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with solubilized proteins. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with cold TGH or TE buffer, and the protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, analyzed by Ponceau's staining to detect the integrity of the GST fusion proteins, and subjected to immunoblotting. The β2-subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2 (i.e. β2-adaptin) interacts with two arginine residues (Arg-394 and Arg-396) in the C-terminal domain of β-arrestin to mediate the targeting of β2AR to CCVs (23Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To identify the sites in β2-adaptin involved in β-arrestin binding, the entire coding sequence of β2-adaptin was divided into two halves: an N-terminal half (β2-adaptin 1–588) and a C-terminal half (β2-adaptin-(592–937)). GST fusion proteins of both regions were generated. Fusion proteins were incubated with cytosolic extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing either Flag-tagged β-arrestin-1 or Flag-tagged β-arrestin-2. Protein complexes were recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis of affinity-purified proteins indicated that GST-β2-adaptin-(592–937) interacted with β-arrestins (Fig. 1). No detectable interaction was observed with GST-β2-adaptin 1–588 or GST alone. The region between residues 592 and 937 of β2-adaptin contains two distinct protein-protein interaction domains: the hinge and the ear (Fig.2 A). The hinge region has been reported to contain a high affinity binding site for clathrin (26Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The ear region binds several different endocytic accessory proteins and contains a second low affinity clathrin binding site (28Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further define the β-arrestin binding site in β2-adaptin, different truncation constructs of β2-adaptin-(592–937) were generated and tested for their association with β-arrestin using the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 A). GST-fusion proteins containing truncations of the C-terminal domain of β2-adaptin were incubated with cytosolic extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing Flag-β-arrestin-1. Bound β-arrestin or clathrin were detected by Western blot (Fig. 2 B). Results indicate that the binding of β-arrestin does not involve the hinge domain, because the removal of the N-terminal 71 residues in GST-β2-adaptin-(592–937) generated a fragment, 664–937, that still associates with β-arrestin-1 despite losing its ability to interact avidly with clathrin. Deletion of the next 119 amino acids in GST-β2-adaptin-(664–937) generated a fragment, 784–937, that still associates with β-arrestin. However, removing the last 96 amino acids in GST-β2-adaptin-(784–937) generated a fragment, 784–840, that lost its ability to interact with β-arrestin. These data suggest that the determinants sufficient for β-arrestin binding are present within the sequence 841–937 of the β2-adaptin ear domain.Figure 2β-Arrestin binding site is located in the ear domain of β2-adaptin. A, schematic representation of GST-β2-adaptin C-terminal constructs. Depicted are the hinge domain (residues 592–699) where a high affinity clathrin-binding site has been identified (residue 616–663) and the ear domain of β2-adaptin (residues 700–937).B, cytosol extracts from HEK 293 cells expressing Flag-tagged β-arrestin-1 (βarr1) was incubated with GST-β2-adaptin fusion proteins or GST alone. Protein complexes were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-clathrin (upper panel) and anti-Flag antibodies (lower panel). Results show that β-arrestin-1 binding to β2-adaptin does not require the hinge domain, and most likely involves the last 96 residues of β2-adaptin C terminus. Input represents 5% of the total amount of starting material used in the assay. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the fine mapping studies with β2-adaptin fusion proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the β-arrestin binding site in β2-adaptin. Full-length and different C-terminal constructs of β2-adaptin were expressed with β-arrestin-2 in yeast, and the association between the proteins was evaluated (Table I). Expression of full-length β2-adaptin, β2-adaptin-(592–937), or β2-adaptin-(664–937) fragments together with β-arrestin-2 was sufficient to induce yeast growth on selective media. Moreover, a fragment of β2-adaptin C terminus encoding the last 112 residues (825–937) was also found to interact with β-arrestin in the same yeast-based assay. Taken together, results from both approaches indicate that the β-arrestin binding site is located within residues 825–937 of the β2-adaptin C terminus.Table IInteraction of β-arrestin and β2-adaptin using a yeast two-hybrid assayGAL4-AD-β2-adaptinpAS2–1GAL4-BD-βarr−Leu/−Trp−Leu/−Trp/−Ade−Leu/−Trp−Leu/−Trp/−Ade1–937+−++++592–937+−+++664–937+−+++825–937+−++Plasmids encoding GAL4-BD-β-arrestin-2 or GAL4-BD alone (pAS2–1) were co-transformed in the yeast strain PJ69–4A with GAL4-AD-β2-adaptin (β2-adaptin-(1–937)) or different C-terminal constructs (β2-adaptin-(592–937), -(664–937), and -(825–937)).

Results are representative of at least three independent experiments. The crystal structure of the ear domain of β2-adaptin has recently been solved (28Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the structure reveals the presence of two regions: an N-terminal subdomain (residues 705–825) and a C-terminal or “platform” subdomain (residues 826–937) (Fig.3). Our results indicate that the β-arrestin-binding site is located within the platform subdomain of β2-adaptin. We have recently shown that this interaction involves two arginine residues within the β-arrestin C terminus (Arg-394 and Arg-396) (23Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the positively charged guanidino group of the arginine residues in β-arrestin might form an ionic bond with the carboxyl group of acidic residues in β2-adaptin (i.e. aspartate or glutamate). Initial attempts at defining the β-arrestin binding site by replacing pairs or triplets of consecutive acidic residues in the β2-adaptin C-terminal domain yielded only limited information on the residues involved. Indeed, most of the β2-adaptin mutants by themselves were trans-activating in the yeast two hybrid system, with the exception of the β2-adaptin-(825–937) (E828A, D829A, E833A) and β2-adaptin-(664–937) (E922A, D932A) constructs, which did not show any trans-activation when expressed by themselves and were both found to still interact with β-arrestin-2 (data not shown). Alternative strategies to map the β-arrestin-binding site in β2-adaptin were considered. We took advantage of the solved structure of β2-adaptin C terminus to identify neighboring acidic residues in the platform subdomain that might participate in this interaction (28Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region of β2-adaptin contains 13 acidic residues, and analysis of their relative position in the β2-adaptin platform reveals the presence of a candidate pair: residue Glu-849, located in the first β-sheet strand between the α1 and α2 helices; and residue Glu-902, located in the fourth β-sheet strand (Fig. 3). Although these residues are distant with respect to the primary sequence, structurally and molecularly the side chains of Glu-849 and Glu-902 residues are in close proximity to one another (≈6–10 Å). These two charged residues are located within a hydrophobic pocket in the center of the β2-adaptin platform subdomain (28Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The location of electrostatically charged residues such as Glu-849 and Glu-902 in this polar patch of β2-adaptin is reminiscent of other protein-protein"
https://openalex.org/W2027844562,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factors are cytoplasmic proteins that induce gene activation in response to cytokine receptor stimulation. Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 proteins dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. This transcriptional activation by STAT3 proteins has been shown to require the recruitment of coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300. In the present study, we show that steroid receptor coactivator 1, NcoA/SRC1a, originally identified as a nuclear receptor coactivator, also functions as a coactivator of STAT3 proteins. In coimmunoprecipitations, NcoA/SRC1a was found to associate with STAT3 following IL-6 stimulation of HepG2 hepatoma cells. Pull-down experiments indicated that the N-terminal part of NcoA/SRC1a associates with the activation domain of STAT3. Overexpression of NcoA/SRC1a or its SRC1e isoform enhanced transcriptional activation by STAT3 proteins in transient transfection experiments. This ability of NcoA/SRC1a to enhance STAT3 activity is dependent upon the presence of the CBP-interacting domain, activation domain 1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that STAT3, NcoA/SRC1a, and CBP/p300 are simultaneously recruited to the p21waf1 promoter following interleukin-6 stimulation.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). Each STAT3 protein contains an Src homology 2 domain close to the C terminus that induces the formation of an active dimer upon Src homology 2 domain-phosphotyrosine interaction. Activated STAT3 transcription factors then translocate into the nucleus to activate target genes. Among these genes, STAT3 proteins can recognize a conserved element in the promoter of p21waf1 and increase the mRNA expression of this cell cycle regulatory gene (2Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C.

Thus, many STAT3 target genes are key components of the regulation of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Accordingly, STAT3 activation is often associated with cell growth or transformation, and disruption of thestat3 gene causes embryonic lethality around day E7.5 (9Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W.

Tumor-derived cell lines or samples from human cancer frequently contain activated forms of STAT3. Moreover,src-transformed cell lines exhibit activated STAT3, and co-expression of a dominant negative form of STAT3 is sufficient to block cell transformation by src (4Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J.

One of the important questions to be resolved is what molecular basis governs gene activation by STAT3 proteins. The molecular basis of gene activation by DNA binding transcription factors involves the recruitment of different coactivator complexes that modify or remodel chromatin at target promoters or recruit the RNA Pol II holoenzyme. Chromatin remodeling machines such as ISWI- or SWI/SNF-containing complexes influence nucleosome positioning. In addition, proteins such as CBP/p300, P/CAF, and TAF250 appear to be required for their ability to acetylate histones and other proteins (16Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 17Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 18Kadonaga J.T.

Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Increased acetylation is often associated with activation of gene transcription and is believed to loosen chromatin structure and facilitate remodeling. Among these histone acetylases, the CBP/p300 protein functions as a coactivator for many different transcription factors. Its HAT activity is important for transcriptional stimulation (23Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Mullen T. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar); however, CBP/p300 can also be tightly associated with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (24Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus, histone acetylases allow greater access to DNA but also function as bridging factors to the transcriptional machinery. There are now several families of histone acetylases, related to the GCN5, CBP, TAF250, and NcoA/SRC1a proteins (21Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1999; 12: 599-606Crossref Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 22Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), respectively, and, surprisingly, a number of acetylases from different families bind to each other. Initially discovered as a nuclear receptor-binding protein (25Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), the NcoA/SRC1a coactivator is involved in transcriptional activation by various proteins such as AP-1, SRF, NF-κB, and STAT6 (26Sheppard K.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), NcoA/SRC1a is thought to contribute to transcriptional activation mainly through the recruitment of CBP/p300 to transcription factors (32Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A.

Transcriptional activation by STAT proteins relies on interactions with the coactivator CBP/p300 and requires its HAT activity (23Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Mullen T.

In line with these results, CBP/p300 can interact with the activation domain of STAT3 to regulate transcription (38Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 39Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A. Levy D. J. Biol.

Since NcoA/SRC1a has been found to be associated with p300/CBP, we made the hypothesis that it could be a coactivator of STAT3 proteins. In this study, we show that, following IL-6 stimulation, NcoA/SRC1a interacts with STAT3 and potentiates its transcriptional activity through its CBP/p300-interacting domain AD1. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that STAT3, NcoA/SRC1a, and CBP/p300 are all rapidly recruited to the promoter of the p21waf1 gene. This suggests that NcoA/SRC1a and CBP/p300 function at the same step in the process of STAT3-mediated activation of gene transcription. Cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Polyclonal STAT3 (C20), polyclonal anti-NcoA/SRC1 (M-341), polyclonal anti-CBP (A22), and phospho-STAT3 Tyr705 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and New England Biolabs, respectively. The NcoA/SRC1a expression vector was used as a template for PCR amplification of the various domains used in pull-downs and luciferase experiments. Some of these plasmids have been described elsewhere (32Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Constructs were subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector using specific oligonucleotides containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Details of constructs are available upon request. Cells were plated at a density of 1.4 × 106/10-cm plate and serum-starved for 1–3 days, and after two washings with cold PBS, nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Lee et al. (40Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer was added to the plates (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After three cycles of freeze-thaw, cytoplasmic extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were spun down at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with nuclear cell extracts (5 mg) precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% slurry in PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cleared extracts were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Note that the NcoA/SRC1a immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitates were washed two times in Buffer C (10 mmTris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) and one time with Tris 20 mm (pH 8) prior to the addition of sample buffer. Following electrotransfer, membranes were analyzed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies diluted in TBS buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented for NcoA/SRC1a and STAT3 (C20) with bovine serum albumin (2.5%) and milk powder (5%), whereas only bovine serum albumin (6%) was added for phospho-STAT3 Tyr705. Note that the NcoA/SRC1a membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. Proteins were visualized using the ECL system of Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Recombinant cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine, according to the manufacturer's instructions and using the TNT kit (Promega). Pull-down reactions were performed by incubating purified His-STAT3-(716–770) (100 ng) with 50 ng of GST or GST-SRC-(361–782) coupled to glutathione beads in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, and 1% Brij 96). After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed once with binding buffer, twice with binding buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The reverse experiment was performed with His-STAT3-(716–770) coupled to nickel-agarose resin. When using in vitro NcoA/SRC1a translated proteins, 2 μg of His-STAT3-(716–770) fusion protein coupled to nickel-agarose resin where used. In this case, proteins were allowed to interact for 1 h at 4 °C in the absence of Brij 96. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (41Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 8.5 μg of total RNA was then size-fractionated on a denaturing 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and transferred to Nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). After 6 h of prehybridization, hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 5 ml of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7), 0.75 m NaCl, 50% formamide, 3.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The full-length p21 human cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the random priming labeling kit from Amersham Biosciences (specific activity >109 cpm/μg) and was used as a probe. Following hybridization, filters were then washed four times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at room temperature for 20 min each. They were then exposed for 2 days to x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. CHIP experiments were performed according to the method of Shang et al. (42Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown to 60% confluence and serum-starved for at least 2 days. Following IL-6 (20 ng/ml) addition for various times, cells were washed twice with PBS and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min; rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected in 1 ml of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.7), 10 mm dithiothreitol; incubated for 15 min at 30 °C; and then recovered by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed sequentially with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, 1 ml of ice-cold buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0,5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5), and 1 ml of ice-cold buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.5). Cells were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated three times for 10 s each at the maximum setting. Supernatants were then recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted 3–10 times in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and subjected to one round of immunoclearing for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 μg of preimmune serum, and 45 μl of protein A-Sepharose (of 50% slurry). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with specific antibodies, and then 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 45 μl of protein A-Sepharose (of 50% slurry) were further added for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl) and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Bead precipitates were then washed three times with TE buffer and eluted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1m NaHCO3. Eluates were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. Supernatants were then incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with proteinase K (80 μg each), and DNA was precipitated using classical procedures. For PCR, 10 μl from a 50-μl DNA preparation were used for 30 cycles of amplifications. The following primers were used: region −879/−593 of the p21waf1 promoter, 5′-TTCAGGAGACAGACAACTCACTCG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GACACCCCAACAAAGCATCTTG-3′ (backward primer); region −2760/−2486 of the p21waf1 promoter, 5′-TTGTGCCACTGCTGACTTTGTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGCCTGAAGAAGGAGGATGTGAGG-3′ (backward primer). Transient transfections were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and repeated at least five times. Cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104 in six-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. After 36–48 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml) for 6 h and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 300 μl of lysis buffer was added (0.1 m KHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton). Luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations and then measured using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. To determine whether NcoA/SRC1 might be involved in the regulation of STAT3 activation, we first asked whether it could bind specifically to STAT3 proteins. HepG2 hepatoma cells were stimulated with IL-6 for 15 min, nuclear extracts were recovered, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed alternatively with polyclonal antibodies directed against NcoA/SRC1 (Fig. 1 A,lane 2), polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3 (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), or nonspecific antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3). Proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were revealed by immunoblotting with the reciprocal antibodies. In both cases, NcoA/SRC1 and STAT3 were found to co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and4). Similar effects were also observed in a different cell line that also expresses the IL-6 receptor, the murine M1 monocyte cell line (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and6). This interaction was dependent on the presence of IL-6, since a very weak interaction was detected between the two proteins when cells were serum-starved for 2 days (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, NcoA/SRC1 and STAT3 coimmunoprecipitate in response to IL-6 stimulation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and4). Whether the phosphorylation has a direct effect on the interaction or is only related to an increased quantity of STAT3 in the nucleus remains, however, to be determined. Importantly, these co-immunoprecipitations were carried out using nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells; therefore, the association between NcoA/SRC1 and STAT3 does not require that these proteins be overexpressed. Altogether, these results indicate that STAT3 transcription factors interact with NcoA/SRC1. Recent results have shown that NcoA/SRC1 can potentiate the transcriptional activity of AP-1, SRF, NF-κB, and nuclear receptors. Having shown that NcoA/SRC1 and STAT3 could interact, we therefore hypothesized that this interaction might increase the transcriptional activity of STAT3. To verify this, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing two STAT3 consensus binding sites upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter together with a vector expressing NcoA/SRC1a. Following transfection, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with IL-6 for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured on cytoplasmic extracts. IL-6 stimulation induced a 3-fold increase in reporter gene activity, and this activation was further potentiated in the presence of an NcoA/SRC1a expression vector (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 1–3). This suggests that the co-activator is able to potentiate the activity of the endogeneous STAT3 proteins. Inclusion of a STAT3-expressing vector in the transfection mix led to a 10-fold increase in expression following cell stimulation. This activation was further increased 8-fold in the presence of NcoA/SRC1a (Fig.2 A, lanes 4–7). Importantly, NcoA/SRC1a had no effect on the basal expression of control reporter genes (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 4 and5; see also Fig. 3).Figure 3NcoA/SRC1a interacts with the activation domain of STAT3. A, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with vectors expressing a Gal4 luciferase reporter gene (100 ng) together with vectors expressing a Gal4 fusion protein linked to the STAT3 activation domain (300 ng), in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lanes 1 and2) of a plasmid encoding NcoA/SRC1a (1 μg). As a control, the same experiments were performed in parallel using a Gal4-p53 plasmid (300 ng; lanes 4–6). Following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with IL-6 for 6 h, and cytoplasmic extracts were then prepared and processed to measure luciferase activity. The mean of five transfections is shown. B, representation of the carboxyl-terminal His-STAT3-(716–770) fusion protein used in the pull-down experiments. C, His-tagged STAT3 fusion proteins corresponding to the activation domain of STAT3 (His-STAT3-(716–770); 2 μg) were tested for binding to in vitro 35S-labeled full-length NcoA/SRC1 proteins. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Lane 1 contains 20% of the amount of the 35S-labeled NcoA/SRC1 proteins used in the pull-down reactions (20%Input).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NcoA/SRC1 exists as two functionally distinct isoforms, SRC1a and SRC1e, due to differential splicing of an exon at the 3′-end of the SRC1 mRNA. The unique C-terminal sequence in SRC1a contains an additional NR binding (LXXLL) motif and also acts to repress the activity of a CBP-independent activation domain (AD2) (43Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the two isoforms differ in their ability to potentiate STAT3 mediated transcription, these experiments were repeated using an NcoA/SRC1e-expressing vector. As shown in Fig.2 B, NcoA/SRC1e potentiated the activity evoked by STAT3 to the same extent as the SRC1a isoform. Its effect on the IL-6-induced transactivation increased when increasing amounts of NcoA/SRC1e expression vectors were included in the transfection mix. Thus, we concluded from these results that NcoA/SRC1a can potentiate the transcriptional activity of STAT3 proteins. Importantly, electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments using stable cell lines overexpressing NcoA/SRC1a showed that NcoA/SRC1a had no effect on STAT3 DNA binding and nuclear expression following IL-6 stimulation (data not shown). Functioning as a coactivator, we then hypothesized that NcoA/SRC1a should potentiate the activity of a chimeric Gal4-STAT3 fusion protein corresponding to the activation domain of STAT3. Using a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter gene, we found that NcoA/SRC1a was able to potentiate transactivation by Gal4-STAT3 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Importantly, NcoA/SRC1a had no effect on the transcriptional activity of control Gal4 fusion proteins such as Gal4-p53 (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 5 and6). These results indicate that the effect of NcoA/SRC1a is specific and also suggest that NcoA/SRC1a interacts with the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of STAT3. To verify this, in vitro pull-down experiments were performed using bacterially produced 6× histidine-tagged STAT3 containing the 716–770 amino acids corresponding to the activation domain of STAT3 (Fig. 3 B, His-STAT3-(716–770)) and [35S]methionine-labeled NcoA/SRC1 proteins via in vitro transcription/translation. We found that in vitro translated NcoA/SRC1a was retained by His-tagged STAT3-(716–770) immobilized on beads, whereas it was not retained by histidine beads alone (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 2 and 3). We concluded from these results that NcoA/SRC1 binds at least to the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of STAT3. Moreover, these pull-down experiments also suggest that the interaction between NcoA/SRC1 and STAT3 is probably direct, although we cannot rule out the possibility that NcoA/SRC1a functions via another partner that could be co-purified with His-tagged STAT3-(716–770) or NcoA/SRC1. To further extend these results and investigate which domain(s) in NcoA/SRC1a mediated the interaction with STAT3, we tested various fragments of NcoA/SRC1a for interactions with STAT3 in pull-down experiments. These fragments (Fig.4 A) were labeled with [35S]methionine using in vitrotranscription/translation and mixed with bacterially produced His-STAT3-(716–770). Whereas in vitro translated full-length NcoA/SRC1a was retained by His-tagged STAT3-(716–770) (see Fig. 3 B and data not shown), the fusion protein did not interact with amino acids 781–1140 of NcoA/SRC1a or with the 567–1140 fragment (Fig. 4 A, data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2076257088,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) activate tyrosine kinases, including Src. Whether or not tyrosine kinase activation by AT1R occurs independently of heterotrimeric G protein coupling and, if so, the cellular function of such a mechanism are unknown. To address these questions, we used an AT1aR intracellular second loop mutant, which lacks heterotrimeric G protein coupling (AT1a-i2m). Surprisingly, Ang II-induced Src activation was preserved in AT1a-i2m, which was not attenuated by inhibiting protein kinase C and Ca2+ or by inhibiting Gαi or Gαq in CHO-K1 cells. By contrast, Ang II-induced Src activation was abolished in a C-terminally truncated AT1a-(1–309), where Ang II-induced inositol phosphate response was preserved. Ang II activates ERKs via a Src-Ras-dependent mechanism in AT1a-i2m. ERKs activated by AT1a-i2m phosphorylate their cytoplasmic targets, including p90RSK, but fail to translocate into the nucleus or to cause cell proliferation. Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of ERKs by wild type AT1aR was inhibited by overexpression of nuclear exportin Crm-1, while that by AT1a-i2m was restored by leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm-1. In summary, while Src and ERKs are activated by Ang II even without heterotrimeric G protein coupling, the carboxyl terminus of the AT1 receptor is required for activation of Src. Interestingly, ERKs activated by heterotrimeric G protein-independent mechanisms fail to phosphorylate nuclear targets due to lack of inhibition of Crm-1-induced nuclear export of ERKs. These results suggest that heterotrimeric G protein-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms play distinct roles in Ang II-mediated cellular responses. Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) activate tyrosine kinases, including Src. Whether or not tyrosine kinase activation by AT1R occurs independently of heterotrimeric G protein coupling and, if so, the cellular function of such a mechanism are unknown. To address these questions, we used an AT1aR intracellular second loop mutant, which lacks heterotrimeric G protein coupling (AT1a-i2m). Surprisingly, Ang II-induced Src activation was preserved in AT1a-i2m, which was not attenuated by inhibiting protein kinase C and Ca2+ or by inhibiting Gαi or Gαq in CHO-K1 cells. By contrast, Ang II-induced Src activation was abolished in a C-terminally truncated AT1a-(1–309), where Ang II-induced inositol phosphate response was preserved. Ang II activates ERKs via a Src-Ras-dependent mechanism in AT1a-i2m. ERKs activated by AT1a-i2m phosphorylate their cytoplasmic targets, including p90RSK, but fail to translocate into the nucleus or to cause cell proliferation. Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of ERKs by wild type AT1aR was inhibited by overexpression of nuclear exportin Crm-1, while that by AT1a-i2m was restored by leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm-1. In summary, while Src and ERKs are activated by Ang II even without heterotrimeric G protein coupling, the carboxyl terminus of the AT1 receptor is required for activation of Src. Interestingly, ERKs activated by heterotrimeric G protein-independent mechanisms fail to phosphorylate nuclear targets due to lack of inhibition of Crm-1-induced nuclear export of ERKs. These results suggest that heterotrimeric G protein-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms play distinct roles in Ang II-mediated cellular responses. angiotensin II Ang II type 1 AT1 receptor protein kinase C epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription phospholipase C G protein-coupled receptor adrenergic receptor 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride fluorescein isothiocyanate inositol phosphate(s) inositol trisphosphate pertussis toxin wild type phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate The signaling mechanism of the angiotensin II (Ang II)1 type 1 (AT1) receptor has traditionally been portrayed as being dependent on heterotrimeric G proteins (1Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 28: 269-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The AT1 receptor activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) via Gαq proteins. This causes generation of inositol trisphosphates as well as diacylglycerol, which in turn causes release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+store sites and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. The AT1 receptor also couples to Gαi, thereby regulating adenylyl cyclase (2Shirai H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides coupling with the heterotrimeric G proteins, activation of tyrosine kinases is also intimately involved in the AT1 receptor signaling (3Bernstein K.E. Ali M.S. Sayeski P.P. Semeniuk D.

Both nonreceptor type tyrosine kinases (Src, Fyn, Yes, Pyk2, focal adhesion kinase, and JAK2) and receptor type tyrosine kinases (EGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptors) are activated by the AT1 receptor (5Ishida M.

These tyrosine kinases regulate downstream signaling mechanisms, including PLCγ, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, and STAT (6Sadoshima J. Izumo S.

Several mechanisms have been shown to mediate tyrosine kinase activation by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; reviewed in Refs. 11Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 12Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A.

First, the downstream effectors of Gα and Gβγ mediate tyrosine kinase activation. For example, Ca2+ and PKC activated through the Gαq-PLCβ pathway directly or indirectly affect activities of tyrosine kinases, including Src, focal adhesion kinase, PYK2, and epidermal growth factor receptor (7Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Cohen R.A. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12223-12230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Gβγ causes activation of tyrosine kinases through its effects upon downstream signaling molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase γ (18Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crepo P. Pelicci P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Second, Gα directly interacts with tyrosine kinases and regulates their kinase activities. Gαq and Gαs directly regulate Bruton's tyrosine kinase (19Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and Src family tyrosine kinases (20Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Third, direct interaction between the GPCRs and signaling molecules seems to affect tyrosine kinase activities. Arrestins associate with the carboxyl terminus of the β2-AR phosphorylated by GRK in a ligand binding-dependent manner. Arrestins work as scaffold proteins, thereby regulating downstream kinases, such as Src, ERKs, ASK1, JNK3, and EGF receptor (21Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S.

SHP-2 binds to the carboxyl terminus of the AT1 receptor, thereby mediating interaction between the AT1 receptor and JAK2 (24Marrero M.B. Venema V.J. Ju H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, active Src has been shown to directly associate with the β2- and β3-ARs (25Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L.

Fifth, activation of epidermal growth factor receptor by GPCR is mediated by metalloproteinase-induced cleavage of pro-HB-EGF in PC3 cells (27Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) or by an N-acetylcysteine-dependent mechanism in cardiac fibroblasts (17Wang D. Yu X. Cohen R.A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Some of the aforementioned cross-talks between GPCRs and tyrosine kinases are initiated by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins alone or via downstream signaling molecules (7Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20989-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By contrast, in some cases, GPCRs may stimulate tyrosine kinases through G protein-independent mechanisms (see Ref. 30Araki T. Gamper M. Early A. Fukuzawa M. Abe T. Kawata T. Kim E. Firtel R.A. Williams J.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4018-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 31Alderton F. Rakhit S. Kong K.C. Palmer T. Sambi B. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28578-28585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it has not been unequivocally proven whether or not the AT1 receptor is able to stimulate tyrosine kinases in the absence of G protein coupling. Furthermore, even if tyrosine kinases are activated in a G protein-independent mechanism, the cellular function of such a signaling mechanism is unknown. In the present investigation, we examined the role of G protein coupling in activation of the tyrosine kinase Src by the AT1 receptor. To abolish G protein coupling, we used an AT1a receptor mutant, which lacks both Gαq and Gαi coupling (32Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We examined Src and ERK activation through this mutant and found that Src and ERKs are activated by Ang II even without AT1 receptor-G protein coupling. We further examined the functional role of the G protein-independent activation of the Src-ERKs in CHO-K1 cells. Our results suggest that ERKs activated through a G protein-independent signaling mechanism phosphorylate their cytoplasmic target but fail to translocate into the nucleus, suggesting that heterotrimeric G protein-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms play distinct roles in Ang II-mediated cellular responses. Mammalian expression plasmid encoding Gαq was obtained from ATCC. Expression plasmid encoding RGS4 was obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. Expression plasmid encoding Crm-1 was from Dr. M. Yoshida (33Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Ang II was purchased from Peninsula. Anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody was from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and rabbit anti-active ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody was from Promega. Anti-phospho-Elk1 monoclonal antibody, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase E10 monoclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Dowex AG1-X8 formate resin was from Bio-Rad. [3-iodotyrosyl 4-125I]Ang II and [3H]myoinositol were from Amersham Biosciences. Enolase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Pertussis toxin, GF109203X, BAPTA-AM, PP1, and PD98059 were from Biomol. GTPγS and leptomycin B were from Sigma. The full-length rat AT1a receptor cDNA subcloned into pCDM8 mammalian expression vector was obtained from Dr. J Harrison. In addition, two kinds of AT1a receptor mutants were used. One mutant has a series of point mutations in the conserved DRYXX(V/I)XXPL sequence at the amino-terminal portion of the second intracellular (i2) loop, where Asp125, Arg126, Tyr127, and Met134 were converted to Gly125, Gly126, Ala127, and Ala134, respectively (designated as AT1-i2m) (32Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Kondo T. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In another mutant, Asp74 was replaced with Asn74 (designated as AT1-D74N) (34Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminally truncated AT1a receptor, AT1a-(1–309) was generated by PCR. Generation of these mutants has been described previously (35Modrall J.G. Nanamori M. Sadoshima J. Barnhart D.C. Stanley J.C. Neubig R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C801-C809Crossref Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding either wild type AT1a (pcDM8-AT1a-WT), AT1a-i2m (pcDM8-AT1a-i2m), AT1a-D74N (pcDM8-AT1a-D74N), or the control plasmid (pcDM8) was transfected into CHO-K1 cells together with pSVNeo by electroporation. Stable transfectants were selected with neomycin (400 μg/ml). Expression of the wild type AT1a receptor (AT1a-WT) or the mutants was confirmed by receptor binding assays. Experimental results were verified with multiple independent stable cell lines for each construct. Saturation binding curves were determined using a modification of the whole cell receptor binding assay (36Ullian M.E. Linas S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). AT1a-expressing CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in 24-well plates. After 24 h of serum starvation, each well was aspirated and rinsed with assay buffer (OPTI-MEM1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) medium with 0.1% fetal bovine albumin). Assay buffer containing 30 pm[3-iodotyrosyl 4-125I]Ang II and varying concentrations of unlabeled Ang II (0–300 nm) was added to cells and incubated in a volume of 0.2 ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then immediately placed on ice, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Nonspecific binding (less than 5% of total binding) was determined by adding 1 μm unlabeled Ang II. The B max and the dissociation constant (K d) for [3-iodotyrosyl 4-125I]Ang II binding was determined by using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad). Protein assay was performed on each sample using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After an overnight incubation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 5 mmTris buffer (pH 7.5), containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm AEBSF. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the cells were subjected to two cycles of freeze/thaw and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing the membrane fraction was resuspended in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor (binding buffer), aliquoted. Membrane protein concentrations were determined. Suspended membranes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-Ang II at 25 °C for 60 min in the presence of varying concentrations of GTPγS. Bound radioligand was separated from free ligands by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed and centrifuged once, and the radioactivity was counted. Measurement of inositol phosphates (IPx) was based upon the method of Berridge et al. (37Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), as described by Thompson et al. (38Thompson J.B. Wade S.M. Harrison J.K. Salafrance M.N. Neubig R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 216-222PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [3H]myoinositol (10 μCi/ml) in F-12 for 24 h at 37 °C. Labeling was terminated by aspirating the medium, rinsing cells with oxygenated reaction buffer (142 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml d-glucose), and harvesting cells with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.02% EDTA. Cells were centrifuged twice (300 × g, 5 min) in reaction buffer, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of reaction buffer containing 60 mm LiCl. The stimulation of IPx production was initiated by mixing 0.25 ml of cell suspension with 0.25 ml of 0–100 nmAng II in reaction buffer (without LiCl). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then 0.5 ml of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added. Precipitates were pelleted (4100 × g, 20 min), and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was transferred to new tubes, washed with water-saturated diethyl ether, and neutralized with NaHCO3. IPx were isolated by adsorption to 0.5 ml of Dowex AG1-X8 formate resin slurry and rinsed five times with 3 ml of unlabeled 5 mm myoinositol, followed by elution with 1 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.1m formic acid. The elutes were counted by liquid scintillation counter in 5 ml of Scinti-verse. To normalize released IPx for lipid content, the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction of each sample was processed for lipid analysis. After resuspending the pellet in 0.5 ml of H2O and 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2), a 200-μl aliquot of the organic phase was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy in 5 ml of Scinti-verse. The tyrosine kinase activity of Src was determined by the immune complex kinase assay using enolase as a substrate as described previously (6Sadoshima J. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates containing equal amount of protein (750 μg) were incubated with anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose was then added. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer without SDS or deoxycholic acid and then washed once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.015% Brij 35). Pellets were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the kinase buffer with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.25 μg of enolase as substrates. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer on ice. Reaction mixtures were boiled and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Results were analyzed by densitometry. Adenovirus-mediated transduction was performed as described previously (39Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transduced with an adenovirus vector harboring dominant-negative Ras (Ad5.N17Ras) (courtesy of Dr. M. D. Schneider, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. For a control study, Ad5/ΔE1sp1B (courtesy of Dr. B. French, Baylor College of Medicine) was used. All experiments were performed 48 h after transduction. To determine the phosphorylation of ERKs, cells were scraped in a hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm AEBSF, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20H; Transduction Laboratories), anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase polyclonal antibody (Promega), or anti-phosphospecific p90RSK polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against ERKs (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to determine the total amount of ERKs. Cells were plated in 24-well plates. Transfections were carried out using 1 μl/ml of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with 0.4 μg of DNA in 250 μl/well OPTI-MEM1 medium (Invitrogen). To determine whether Elk1 is activated by a given stimulus, the PathDetectTM in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system (Stratagene) was used, in which a plasmid (0.15 μg/ml) containing five tandem repeats of the yeast GAL4 binding sites linked to firefly luciferase (pFR-Luc) and another plasmid (50 ng/ml), consisting of the activation domain of Elk1 fused with the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 (Elk1-GAL4), were co-transfected. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 0.4 μg/ml by adding an empty vector. 12 h after the transfection, the culture medium was changed to serum-free. Cells were further cultured in the presence or absence of Ang II (10−7m) for an additional 12 h. Cells were then lysed with the Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities were measured. An SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase construct (SV40 β-gal; 0.01 μg/ml) was co-transfected, and the β-galactosidase activity was determined by using Lumi-Gal 530 (Lumigen). The luciferase values were divided by the β-galactosidase values to correct for differences in the transfection efficiency. Cells were grown on glass coverslips. After stimulation, cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min followed by a brief dip in acetone at −20 °C. For staining of phospho-Elk-1 and phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1 μg/ml) and phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase E10 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1 μg/ml) were used, respectively. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline. Microscopic analyses were performed by using confocal microscopy. Detailed methods of immunostaining have been described (39Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and scraped with Tris-buffered saline. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmAEBSF) by gentle pipetting and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by adding 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing vigorously for 10 s, followed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) for 30 s. Supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm AEBSF) and rocked for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. The samples were stored at −80 °C. Cells were plated at a density of 0.3 × 106 per well in six-well plates. 12 h after plating, cells were serum-starved for 12 h and incubated with Ang II (10−7m) for 36 h. Ang II was added every 12 h. After stimulation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.1 ml of 0.05% trypsin for 5 min, followed by the addition of 0.4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to neutralize the trypsin. The cells were suspended thoroughly by pipetting. Cell numbers were counted using a hemocytometer. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance. The post-test comparison was performed by the method of Tukey. Significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. To examine the role of the heterotrimeric G proteins in tyrosine kinase activation by AT1a receptors, we used AT1a-i2m and AT1-D74N, which have been shown to lack or have impaired coupling with heterotrimeric G proteins in COS7 cells (32Ohyama K.

We stably transfected either the wild type AT1a receptor (AT1a-WT), AT1a-i2m, or AT1a-D74N into CHO-K1 cells, which have no endogenous Ang II receptors. We isolated 20–25 clones with various levels of AT1a receptor expression for each receptor. We determined K d andB max in each clone using 125I-Ang II. Cell lines expressing each receptor with similarK d (1.78 ± 0.58, 1.82 ± 0.32, 0.77 ± 0.32 nm for AT1a-WT, AT1a-i2m, and AT1a-D74N, respectively) and B max (64.5 ± 1.7, 61.7 ± 2.1, and 73.3 ± 5.4 fmol/mg for AT1a-WT, AT1a-i2m, and AT1a-D74N, respectively) were used for the further experiments (cell line WT-#25, i2m-#12, and D74N-#7, respectively). We designated these cell lines as CHO-WT, CHO-i2m, and CHO-D74N. The results presented in this study were reproducible in other cell lines expressing either AT1a-WT, AT1a-i2m, or AT1a-D74N with similar expression levels (cell line WT-#20, i2m-#7, and D74N-#9, respectively). Receptor interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins was evaluated by measuring125I-Ang II binding to the receptors in the presence or the absence of the nonhyrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS. GTPγS shifts the G protein-coupled receptor from a high affinity state to a low affinity state. Since this shift is considered as an indicator for effective interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins (41Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10580-10586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of GTPγS on 125I-Ang II binding to AT1a-WT, AT1a-i2m, and AT1a-D74N. As shown in Fig.1, GTPγS decreased Ang II binding to the AT1a-WT and AT1a-D74N in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, Ang II binding to AT1a-i2m was not affected by GTPγS even at 10−4m, suggesting that AT1a-i2m lacks heterotrimeric G protein coupling in CHO-K1 cells. Thus, we further characterized the signaling mechanism of AT1-i2m in comparison with AT1a-WT. Binding of"

We have employed the skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 to study posttranslational regulation of Notch1 protein levels during myogenesis. Although the major degradation pathway of the activated intracellular Notch1 fragment appears to involve ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, we provide evidence for an alternative catalytic pathway where the endogenous, transmembrane form of Notch1 is targeted to the lysosomal compartment. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of transmembrane Notch1 protein after treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine but not after treatment with various proteasome inhibitors. This finding was supported by the observation that the transmembrane form of Notch1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and specifically coprecipitated with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Our data suggest a regulatory mechanism down-regulating Notch1 protein levels already at the cellular surface, possibly with consequences for Notch-dependent signal transduction during terminal differentiation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2007687079,"BRCA1, a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, has been implicated in gene regulation. Previous studies demonstrate that BRCA1 induces GADD45, a p53-regulated and stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in cellular response to DNA damage. However, the mechanism(s) by which BRCA1 regulates GADD45 remains unclear. In this report, we have shown that BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter is mediated through the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs located at theGADD45 promoter region. Site-directed mutations of both OCT-1 and CAAT motifs abrogate induction of the GADD45promoter by BRCA1. Both OCT-1 and CAAT motifs are able to confer BRCA1 inducibility in a non-related minimal promoter. Physical associations of BRCA1 protein with transcription factors Oct-1 and NF-YA, which directly bind to the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs, are established by biotin-streptavidin pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Such protein interactions are required for interaction of BRCA1 with theGADD45 promoter because either immunodepletion of Oct-1 and NF-YA proteins or mutations in the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs disrupt BRCA1 binding to the GADD45 promoter. These findings indicate that BRCA1 can up-regulate its targeted genes through protein-protein interactions and provide a novel mechanism by which BRCA1 participates in transcriptional regulation.

A number of observations have implicated BRCA1in cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA1 associates and colocalizes with Rad51 protein and may be involved in DNA recombination.

Therefore, through its functions in DNA repair process, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, BRCA1 plays an important role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. This is strongly supported by the demonstration that murine embryos carrying aBRCA1 null mutation exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities, probably due to defective G2/M checkpoint control and improper centrosome duplication (14Shen S.X.

BRCA1 has an N-terminal ring finger domain and a C-terminal transcription activation domain that activates transcription when fused to a DNA-binding domain (32Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that BRCA1 strongly activates GADD45 in a p53-independent manner. Activation of the GADD45 promoter requires normal transcription-activating function of BRCA1 because the tumor-derived BRCA1 mutants (1749R and Y1853insA), which lack transcription activity, are unable to activate the GADD45 promoter (41Jin S. Zhao H. Fan F. Blanck P. Fan W. Colchagie A.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 up-regulates GADD45is complex and may involve the regulatory elements located at either the third intron or the promoter region of GADD45. BRCA1 also represses GADD45 expression through its interaction with ZBRK1 transcription factor (42Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Despite the discrepancy of the effect of BRCA1 on GADD45 transcription, it has been well accepted that GADD45 is one of the BRCA1 downstream effectors and probably mediates the role of BRCA1 in maintenance of genomic stability. The transcription factor Oct-1, a member of the POU homeodomain family, is ubiquitously expressed and binds to the AGTCAAAA consensus sequence through its DNA-binding POU domain (43Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). High affinity Oct-1-binding sites are found in a number of cellular promoters (44Fletcher C. Heintz N. Roeder R.G.

Yu Chen K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, both Oct-1 and NF-YA, but not NF-YB and NF-YC, were found to be induced following treatment with genotoxic agents, indicating that these two transcription factors may participate in cellular response to DNA damage (52Zhao H.

In this article, we identify OCT-1 and CAAT as the BRCA1-regulatory elements required for BRCA1 activation of the GADD45promoter. Disruptions of the OCT-1 and CAAT motifs abolish activation of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1. Moreover, BRCA1 physically associates with Oct-1 and NF-YA transcription factors. These results characterize an important molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 regulatesGADD45.

Similarly, PG-OCT-1wt or PG-OCT-1mut was constructed by cloning 5 direct repeats of the intact OCT-1 motif (TGATTTGCATAGCCCTGTGG) or mutated OCT-1 motif (TGGCCTGCATAGCCCTGTGG) upstream of a minimal polyomavirus early promoter linked to a CAT gene via HindIII- and PstI-cloning sites. In the case of PG-CAATwt or PG-CAATmut, 3 repeats of the intact CAAT motif (TTAACCAATCAC) or mutated CAAT box (TTAACGTATCAC) were cloned into the same reporter plasmids described above. The human breast carcinoma MCF-7 line, the human lung carcinoma line H1299, and the human colorectal carcinoma line HCT116 were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (18Kastan M.B.

For MMS treatment, cells were exposed to medium containing MMS (Aldrich) at 100 μg/ml for 4 h, and then the medium was replaced with fresh medium. For UV radiation, cells in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and irradiated to a dose of 10 Jm−2. Cells treated with MMS and UV were collected 16 h posttreatment for the CAT assay (20Zhan Q. Fan S.

In addition, 4 μg of pCMV-GFP plasmid (which expresses green fluorescence protein) was included in each experiment. After transfection, expression of GFP protein was detected by Western blotting assay to determine transfection efficiency. Measurement of CAT activity was carried out as described previously (56Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, resuspended in 0.25m Tris (pH 7.8), and disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles. Equal amounts of protein were used for each CAT assay. The CAT reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the CAT activity was determined by measuring the acetylation of 14C-labeled chloramphenicol using thin layer chromatography. Radioactivity was measured directed with Betascope analyzer. The specific CAT activity was calculated by determining the fraction of chloramphenicol that had been acetylated. The relative CAT activity was determined by normalizing the activity of the treated samples to that of the untreated sample. Each value represented the average of at least three separate determinations (54Zhan Q. Chen I.T. Antinore M.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Antibodies against BRCA1, Oct-1, NF-YA, and Jun-D were commercially provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For preparation of nuclear protein, exponentially growing HCT116 cells were collected, rinsed with PBS, and resuspended in 200 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9); 10 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.1 mm EGTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following vortexing, the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. After centrifugation, insoluble pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9); 400 mmKCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mmdithiothreitol; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were placed on ice and subjected to vortexing for 15 s every 10 min, over a period of 40 min. Finally, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected for further analysis. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis, 300 μg of nuclear protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-BRCA1, Oct-1, NF-YA, or Jun-D antibodies and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Protran membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, washed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween), and incubated with anti-Oct-1, NF-YA, and BRCA1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Following washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody at 1:4000 in 5% milk, the membranes were washed, and bound horseradish peroxidase was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Four oligonucleotides containing biotin on the 5′-nucleotide of the sense strand were used in the pull-down assays. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: 1) wt oligo, 5′-GCAGGCTGATTTGCATAGCCCAATGGCCAAGCTGCATGCAAATGAGGCGGA, which corresponds to positions −107 to −57 of the humanGADD45 promoter; 2) mut oligo1, 5′-GCAGGCTGATTTGCATAGCCtgATGGCCAAGCTGCATGCAAATGAGGCGGA, which corresponds to positions −107 to −57 of the humanGADD45 promoter with the CAAT box mutated; 3) mut oligo2, 5′-GCAGGCTGgccTGCATAGCCCAATGGCCAAGCTGCATGCAggcGAGGCGGA, which corresponds to positions −107 to −57 of the humanGADD45 promoter with two OCT-1 motifs mutated; and 4) mut oligo3, 5′-GCAGGCTGATTTGCATAGCCtgATGGCCAAGCTGCATGCAggcGAGGCGGA, which corresponds to positions −107 to −57 of the human GADD45 promoter with two OCT-1 sites and one CAAT box mutated. These oligonucleotides were annealed to their respective complementary oligonucleotides, and 51-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides were gel-purified and used. Nuclear protein was extracted as described earlier. One microgram of each double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 300 μg of nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor. Following the incubation, 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) was added to the reaction and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Prior to this step, 300 μl of the original streptavidin-agarose bead preparation was preabsorbed with 500 μl of bovine serum albumin, 50 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 50 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA for 30 min at 25 °C. The streptavidin-agarose beads were washed three times and resuspended in 300 μl of the binding buffer. The protein-DNA-streptavidin-agarose complex was washed three times with binding buffer and loaded onto a SDS gel. Detection of BRCA1, Oct-1, and NF-YA proteins was performed as described above (54Zhan Q. Chen I.T. Antinore M.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our group recently demonstrated (41Jin S. Zhao H. Fan F. Blanck P. Fan W. Colchagie A.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that BRCA1 induces expression of GADD45 mRNA and activates theGADD45 promoter. As shown in Fig.1 A, when pHG45-CAT2, aGADD45 promoter reporter construct that spans −909 to +144 of the GADD45 promoter region, was cotransfected with either pCMV.neo (Neo) or pCR3.BRCA1 (BRCA1) into the human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cell line (wt p53), human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cell line (wt p53), or HCT116 p53−/− cell line (where p53 alleles were deleted via homologue recombination), the GADD45 promoter reporter was strongly activated in all cell lines regardless of p53 status. To determine transfection efficiency, GFP expression vector was cotransfected with each tested plasmid. The expression of GFP protein detected by immunoblotting analysis indicated that transfection efficiency was similar among different samples with variations less than 20%. To map the BRCA1-responsive elements in theGADD45 promoter, a series of the GADD45 CAT reporters that spanned the different regions of the humanGADD45 promoter were constructed. Following cotransfection of these GADD45 promoter reporter plasmids with the BRCA1 expression vector into human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 and HCT116 p53−/− cells, CAT assays were conducted, and the CAT activities were analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, most of theGADD45 CAT reporters were strongly activated following expression of BRCA1 protein. With progressive 5′-deletion, pHG45-CAT13 that extended 5′ only to −62 relative to the transcription start site exhibited little induction following expression of BRCA1. These observations indicate that the region between −107 and −62 contains the regulatory elements required for the responsiveness of theGADD45 promoter to BRCA1 expression. To confirm if the region from −107 to −62 is responsible for activation of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1, we constructed a reporter plasmid designated as PG-CAT−107/−57, where a DNA fragment corresponding to the GADD45 promoter region between −107 and −57 was cloned upstream of a minimal polyomavirus promoter linked to a CAT reporter gene. This minimal polyomavirus promoter itself is unable to respond to BRCA1 expression or DNA-damaging agents (data not shown). When cotransfected with pCR3.BRCA1 (BRCA1) into HCT116 cells, PG-CAT−107/−57 exhibited induction (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, both pCMV.neo (Neo) and pC53-SN3 (p53) had no effect on this reporter, indicating that the region between −107 and −57 is capable of conferring the BRCA1 inducibility to a non-related promoter reporter. Interestingly, PG-CAT−107/−57 was also shown to be strongly induced by UV radiation and MMS, suggesting that activation of theGADD45 promoter by BRCA1 and DNA damage might share some common regulatory elements. Inspection of DNA sequence exhibits two OCT-1 motifs and one CAAT box located at this region of the humanGADD45 promoter (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether the OCT-1 and CAAT box motifs play roles in activating the GADD45 promoter following expression of BRCA1, we mutated the OCT-1 or CAAT motifs inGADD45 promoter CAT reporter constructs (53Jin S. Fan F. Fan W. Zhao H. Tong T. Blanck P. Alomo I. Rajasekaran B. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2683-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It should be noted here that our previous work (54Zhan Q. Chen I.T. Antinore M.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated that there are certain regulatory elements located more upstream of theGADD45 promoter, such as EGR1/WT1. Therefore, to exclude the influence of such responsive elements, we choose pHG45-CAT11, which only contains the region from −121 to +144 of the GADD45promoter. Following cotransfection of these mutants of theGADD45 promoter reporters into both HCT116 (wt p53) and H1299 cells, where the p53 gene is deleted, induction of CAT activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, pHG45-CAT11 exhibited the strongest activation by BRCA1. Single mutation in either OCT-1 or CAAT1 motifs (pHG45-CAT11 m1, pHG45-CAT11 m2, and pHG45-CAT11 m3) had little effect on BRCA1-induced activation of the GADD45 promoter. However, dou"

We now show that the apoptotic effects of NGF in hippocampal neurons are observed only from the 2nd day of culture onward. This switch in the effect of NGF is correlated with an increase in p75 expression levels and increasing levels of ceramide generation as the cultures mature. NGF application to neuronal cultures from p75exonIII−/− mice had no effect on ceramide levels and did not affect neuronal viability. The neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, scyphostatin, inhibited NGF-induced ceramide generation and neuronal death, whereas hippocampal neurons cultured from acid sphingomyelinase−/− mice were as susceptible to NGF-induced death as wild type neurons. The acid ceramidase inhibitor, (1S,2R)-d-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol, enhanced cell death, supporting a role for ceramide itself and not a downstream lipid metabolite. Finally, scyphostatin inhibited NGF-induced Jnk phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons.

Typically, the diverse effects observed after p75 activation are explained by “cell context,” which may involve the differential activation of a number of intracellular signaling pathways, including NFκB translocation (25Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm M.R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A.

Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Ceramide is a lipid second messenger implicated in diverse intracellular pathways, most prominently those regulating cell death in assorted cell types (28Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 29Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H.

A plethora of studies have looked at the effects of exogenously added ceramide analogues on cultured cells, and in cultured neurons both outgrowth and survival/death effects have been reported (31Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mitoma J. Ito M. Furuya S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Neurosci.

However, less attention has been paid to endogenous ceramide generation in neurons. Endogenous ceramide can be generated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) or by de novo synthesis, processes that occur at different intracellular locations, and by different modes of regulation (29Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ceramide generated by SM hydrolysis can be produced by either neutral or acid sphingomyelinases (N-SMase or A-SMase, respectively) (30Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), which may be differentially distributed between the cell body and the axon (34de Chaves E.P.

A prominent example of an endogenous signaling system that generates ceramide in the nervous system is p75 (27Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A.

Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) suggested a role for ceramide in p75-mediated cell death of oligodendrocytes, subsequent studies on neurotrophin-induced death of neurons have focused primarily on the role of a pathway involving Jun kinase, mixed lineage kinases, and p53 (13Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 20Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, two recent studies on hippocampal neurons documented strikingly different effects for NGF in the same cell type and focused on two different second messengers downstream of p75 (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we observed a ceramide-dependent enhancement of axonal elongation in cultured hippocampal neurons by NGF (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another study observed Jnk-dependent cell death of hippocampal neurons (21Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), albeit cultured under different conditions. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we have now performed a systematic study to rigorously dissect the effects of NGF at different stages of neuronal development in culture and the role of ceramide signaling in these processes. We show that in addition to its ability to stimulate axonal outgrowth (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ceramide generated via binding of NGF to p75 can induce cell death in hippocampal neurons only from the 2nd day of culture onward, which parallels an increase in p75 expression levels. We further demonstrate a requirement for N-SMase activity in both neuronal cell death and Jnk phosphorylation and the lack of requirement for an A-SMase activity in these processes. Thus, in the same neuron, NGF signaling via p75 can play two different roles, both of which require ceramide as an upstream signaling component.

Rats (Wistar) and mice (C57BL6) were purchased from Harlan Animal Laboratories and were maintained in the animal facility of the Weizmann Institute. P75exonIII−/− mice (38Lee K.F. Bachman K. Landis S. Jaenisch R. Science. 1994; 263: 1447-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) on a C57BL6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, and a breeding colony was maintained in the animal facility of the Weizmann Institute. A-SMase−/− mice (39Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Kolesnick (Sloan-Kettering, New York), and a heterozygous breeding colony was maintained. Rat hippocampal neurons were cultured at low density as described previously (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar), with modifications to allow culturing in defined medium. Briefly, the dissected hippocampi of embryonic day 18 rats were dissociated by trypsinization (0.25% w/v, for 15 min at 37 °C). The tissue was washed in Mg2+/Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and dissociated by repeated passage through a constricted Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated in minimal essential medium with 10% horse serum at a density of 25,000 cells per 13-mm glass coverslip that had been precoated with poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml). After 2–4 h, coverslips were transferred into 24-well multidishes (Nunc), containing B27 supplemented Neurobasal medium (41Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), and cultures were maintained in this defined medium. For experiments using scyphostatin, neurons were transferred into 24-well multidishes (Nunc) that contained a monolayer of astroglia, as described previously (31Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). In this case, coverslips were placed with the neurons facing downwards, separated from the glia by paraffin “feet,” and maintained in serum-free medium (minimal essential medium) at a density of 25,000 neurons per 13-mm coverslip, which included N2 supplements (40Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar), ovalbumin (0.1%, w/v), and pyruvate (0.1 mm). Neurons cultured at high density (230,000 cells per 24-mm glass coverslip in 100-mm Petri dishes), also maintained in Neurobasal medium, were used for biochemical analyses. Neurons were also cultured at low (25,000 neurons per 13-mm coverslip) and high density from embryonic day 17 p75exonIII−/− mice (38Lee K.F. Bachman K. Landis S. Jaenisch R. Science. 1994; 263: 1447-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and from A-SMase−/− mice (39Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Mouse neurons were cultured exactly as described for rat neurons and were cultured both in the absence or presence of a glial co-culture. For A-SMase−/− mice, heterozygous males and females were mated, and the genotype of individual embryos was determined by both RT-PCR (39Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and by analysis of A-SMase enzyme activity (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Live and dead cells were distinguished using 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1, respectively, as detailed in the Live/Dead® viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, OR). At least 300–400 cells were counted per coverslip. Neurons were examined using a Plan 25× objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Apoptosis was measured using Hoechst 33342, and cells were examined using the 60× objective of a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope. Neurons were plated at high density and incubated with C6-NBD-SM (dissolved in ethanol). After various times of incubation, cells were removed from the coverslips by scraping with a rubber policeman into ice-cold distilled water and were lyophilized. C6-NBD lipids were extracted and analyzed as described (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two methods were used to quantify NBD fluorescence. In some cases, fluorescent spots were removed from the coverslips by scraping, lipids extracted, and fluorescence analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5B luminescence spectrometer. Alternatively, fluorescence was quantified using a Fluor-STM-MultiImager (Bio-Rad), using Quantity One software for scanning and quantification. When significant amounts of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide were detected on the TLC plates, a correction was made to calculate total C6-NBD-ceramide formed (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out using the Titan one-tube system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, as per manufacturer's instructions. Band intensity was quantified using a Bio-Rad model GS-690 Imaging Densitometer and analyzed using Molecular Analyst software, version 2.1.2. Expression of p75, TrkA, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels in hippocampal neurons was analyzed using the following primers: for p75, GTCGTGGGCCTTGTGGCC and CTGTGAGTTCACACTGGGG; for TrkA, CGTTGATGCTGGCTTGTGC and GGAGAGATTCAGGTGACTGA; and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) TTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAGG and CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG. Primers for genotyping of A-SMase−/− embryos were as follows: for neomycin, CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC and AGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC); and for ASMase AGCCGTGTCCTCTTCCTTAC and CGAGACTGTTGCCAGACATC. Neuronal proteins were extracted from 20 high density coverslips per culture in an ice-cold buffer composed of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Igepal detergent, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase inhibitors. Equal loading on SDS-PAGE gels was verified by cell number and parallel Western blots for total Jnk and α-tubulin. Western blots for p75 were performed using the 9651 polyclonal antiserum as previously described (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-jnk was identified using the anti-diphospho-Thr-183/Tyr-185-Jnk antibody from New England Biolabs according to the manufacturer's instructions. We demonstrated recently (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that application of NGF to hippocampal neurons, immediately after plating, stimulated axonal outgrowth through activation of N-SMase and ceramide generation. However, another recent study (21Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that neurotrophins, including NGF, can induce apoptosis in 5-day-old cultured hippocampal neurons. We therefore examined the effects of increasing NGF concentrations on neuronal viability at different stages of culture. No NGF-induced cell death was observed in neurons exposed to NGF at concentrations up to 500 ng/ml immediately after plating (Fig.1 A). In contrast, increasing concentrations of NGF did affect neuronal viability when added to the neuronal cultures on day 1 or on day 4, with 50–60% neuronal cell death at the highest NGF concentrations (Fig. 1 A). We confirmed that this cell death was due to apoptosis by using Hoechst 33342, which specifically labels apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 1 B). A 1.6-fold increase in nuclei displaying chromatin condensation was detected in neurons treated with NGF on day 1 in culture. We demonstrated previously (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that during the first 24 h in culture, hippocampal neurons express low levels of p75. To determine whether the increased ability of NGF to kill hippocampal neurons on day 1 versus day 0 in culture could be due to changes in neurotrophin receptor expression, p75 and TrkA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR on days 0, 1, and 4 in culture. P75 transcript levels increased ∼4-fold between days 0 and 1 and remained constant for the next 3 days (Fig. 2 A). A TrkA transcript was not detected at any of these stages in culture. Increased levels of p75 protein were also detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B), with an accumulative increase of ∼2-fold from day 0 to day 4. We next measured ceramide formation upon binding of NGF to the p75 receptor. There was an essentially linear correlation between NGF concentration and ceramide formation when analyzed on 1-day-old neurons (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, ∼70% more ceramide was generated by application of 100 ng/ml NGF to day 1 neurons as compared with neurons immediately after plating, and ∼125% more ceramide on day 4 neurons (Fig. 3 B). Note that the amount of ceramide generated after NGF application on day 0 is not significantly higher than the basal levels in control cells on day 1 (Fig. 3 B). To prove definitively a connection between binding of NGF to p75, ceramide generation, and neuronal cell death, we analyzed the effects of NGF on neurons cultured from p75exonIII−/− mice (38Lee K.F. Bachman K. Landis S. Jaenisch R. Science. 1994; 263: 1447-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that hippocampal neurons cultured from p75exonIII−/− mice contained no full-length p75 and also no TrkA during the entire period of culture. Application of 500 ng/ml NGF had no effect on neuronal viability in p75exonIII−/− mice, whereas wild type mouse hippocampal neurons were killed (Fig.4 A). In contrast, C6-ceramide (5 μm) killed both wild type and p75exonIII−/− neurons (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, ceramide levels increased by ∼2-fold upon treatment of neurons from wild type mice with 500 ng/ml NGF, whereas there was no increase in ceramide levels in p75exonIII−/− mice (Fig.4 B). Thus, p75 is required for ceramide generation upon NGF application to hippocampal neurons. We next examined the mechanism of ceramide generation upon binding of NGF to p75. To distinguish between activation of N-SMase or A-SMase, neurons were incubated with scyphostatin (42Tanaka M. Nara F. Suzuki-Konagi K. Hosoya T. Ogita T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7871-7872Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Bernardo K. Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kreder D. Micheli M. Schafer R. Sickman A. Schmidt W.E. Schroder J.M. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7641-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which has an IC50 for N-SMase 50-fold lower than for A-SMase (44Nara F. Tanaka M. Masuda-Inoue S. Yamasato Y. Doi-Yoshioka H. Suzuki-Konagai K. Kumakura S. Ogita T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1999; 52: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, scyphostatin had no effect on human A-SMase activity when measured in vitro at either pH 4.7 or pH 6.4, even up to concentrations as high as 50 μm (not shown), at which complete inhibition of N-SMase occurs (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to a marked toxicity of scyphostatin to neurons cultured in Neurobasal medium without glia, experiments with this inhibitor were carried out at concentrations of up to 1 μm on hippocampal neurons co-cultured with glia. Under these conditions scyphostatin was not toxic and inhibited ceramide generation upon NGF application (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, preincubation with scyphostatin inhibited NGF-induced neuronal cell death (Fig. 5 A), supporting the involvement of an N-SMase in this process. We next examined the possible role of A-SMase in NGF-induced death of hippocampal neurons using A-SMase−/− mice (39Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A-SMase−/− hippocampal neurons were equally susceptible to NGF-induced death as neurons from their wild type littermates (Fig.5, C and D). Neurons were also tested for viability in the presence of glutamate (45Pelled D. Shogomori H. Futerman A.H. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and as described previously (46Yu Z.F. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Zhou D. Cheng G. Schuchman E.H. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), A-SMase−/− neurons were partially resistant to glutamate-induced death (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to the excitotoxic stress-activated pathway of ceramide generation, which is mediated via A-SMase (46Yu Z.F. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Zhou D. Cheng G. Schuchman E.H. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), NGF-induced death of hippocampal neurons is mediated by N-SMase. Ceramide can be degraded by ceramidases to downstream metabolites such as sphingosine 1-phosphate, which has been shown to act as an extracellular initiator of apoptosis (47Edsall L.C. Pirianov G.G. Spiegel S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 17: 6952-6960Google Scholar, 48Moore A.N. Kampfl A.W. Zhao X. Hayes R.L. Dash P.K. Neuroscience. 1999; 94: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore used the ceramidase inhibitor,d-e-MAPP (49Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), to determine whether ceramide itself or a downstream metabolite(s) is responsible for neuronal death. In the absence of NGF, increasing concentrations ofd-e-MAPP resulted in an increase in both ceramide levels and in neuronal cell death, confirming that elevating ceramide elicits neuronal cell death (Fig.6 A). Importantly,d-e-MAPP enhanced the ability of NGF to kill neurons (Fig. 6 A). Finally, the combination of NGF andd-e-MAPP generated additively higher levels of ceramide than either NGF or d-e-MAPP by themselves (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results support the involvement of ceramide itself, and not a downstream lipid metabolite, in eliciting neuronal cell death in hippocampal neurons. Previous studies (20Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 21Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have implicated Jun kinase activation in neuronal cell death induced by neurotrophin binding to p75. To determine whether ceramide generation and Jun kinase phosphorylation are part of the same cascade or represent distinct signaling pathways, we analyzed Jnk activation in hippocampal neurons upon NGF application. Hippocampal neurons from 4-day-old cultures were incubated with 500 ng/ml NGF for different times, revealing a 2-fold increase in phospho-Jnk levels from 90 min onward (Fig. 7 A). Preincubation with scyphostatin before NGF application inhibited the NGF-induced increase in phospho-Jnk (Fig. 7 B). Thus ceramide generation by N-SMase is required for NGF-induced Jnk phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons. In our current and previous studies, we demonstrate that cultured hippocampal neurons undergo a switch in their response to NGF after the first 24 h in culture, from acceleration of the rate of axonal outgrowth (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to apoptotic cell death (this study). Both responses depend on the p75 neurotrophin receptor (Figs. 2 and 4 and Ref. 17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cell death is correlated with increased expression of p75. Intriguingly, both effects also require ceramide generation via N-SMase (Figs. 3 and 5 and Ref. 17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide itself (and not a downstream lipid metabolite) is required for the death signal (Fig. 6), and finally, ceramide generation is upstream of Jun kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 7) in the signaling cascade initiated by NGF binding to p75 in hippocampal neurons. When p75 is expressed at low levels, namely during the initial 24 h after plating neurons, ceramide generation is sufficient to enhance axonal outgrowth (17Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not neuronal death. In contrast, when p75 levels increase, i.e. after 24–48 h in culture, ceramide generation increases significantly and is sufficient to induce neuronal death. We demonstrated previously that exogenously added ceramide can have dual effects in hippocampal neurons, either stimulating neuronal growth or inducing death (31Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we now demonstrate that endogenous ceramide levels can be regulated by changes in the level of the p75 receptor, which presumably activates N-SMase, although the mechanism of activation/interaction is not known (see below). Interestingly, a recent report (50Roux P.P. Bhakar A.L. Kennedy T.E. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23097-23104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) demonstrated that p75-mediated Akt activation occurs at p75 levels much lower than those required to elicit apoptosis in the same cells. Changes in expression of an intermediary linking ceramide to the Jnk pathway could also account for the strikingly different response of day 0versus older neurons. Alternatively, the differential response might be attributed solely to the increased levels of ceramide in older neurons passing a threshold required for an apoptotic response. This issue cannot be fully resolved until the downstream targets of ceramide are identified in neurons and in other cells (29Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that ceramide generation, probably at the higher levels required to induce apoptosis, modulates the membrane environment, perhaps due to its propensity to laterally segregate within the plane of the lipid bilayer and due to its smaller packing volume than SM (29Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, exogenously added (51Chen C.S. Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13291-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 52Holopainen J.M. Angelova M.I. Kinnunen P.K. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and endogenously generated ceramide (53Zha X. Pierini L.M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) affect endocytosis and vesiculation in model membranes and cells, and chronically applied ceramide inhibits NGF internalization in sympathetic neurons (34de Chaves E.P. Bussiere M. MacInnis B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36207-36214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because ceramide generation occurs in a highly compartmentalized manner (29Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 54Dobrowsky R.T. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), increases as low as 2-fold (such as that observed between days 1 and 2, Fig. 3) could represent a much higher localized increase in the membrane compartments containing p75. Whether the rate of p75 internalization is affected by ceramide is not known; however, it is conceivable that such an increase might affect p75 internalization or retrograde trafficking. In this context it is interesting to note that blocking internalization of the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor selectively inhibits apoptotic signaling (55Schutze S. Machleidt T. Adam D. Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Kruse M.L. Heinrich M. Wickel M. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10203-10212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), while not affecting other p55-dependent pathways. Many recent studies (56Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) examining the role of endogenous ceramide in apoptotic cell death have focused on ceramide generated from A-SMase, most notably for members of the NGF/tumor necrosis factor receptor family. Our current findings implicating a neuronal N-SMase in apoptotic signaling of p75 suggest a difference between p75 signaling and that of other NGF/tumor necrosis factor receptor family members. Indeed the receptor domain and interactors linking the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor to N-SMase have been shown to be distinct from the domain and the interactors that signal apoptosis (57Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Morgener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, some evidence has been presented for the involvement of an A-SMase in p75 signaling in PC12 cells (56Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 58Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Lisanti M.P. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in which p75 signaling was localized to caveolar domains, and was regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the same structures (56Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings may reflect differences between p75 signaling in primary neuronsversus cycling cells such as PC12. Because N-SMases are less well characterized than A-SMases, the mode and mechanism of interaction between p75 and N-SMase cannot be determined until a genuine N-SMase involved in ceramide signaling pathways is identified and sequenced (43Bernardo K. Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kreder D. Micheli M. Schafer R. Sickman A. Schmidt W.E. Schroder J.M. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Kronke M. J. Biol.

It was demonstrated recently that all four neurotrophins elicit the death of hippocampal neurons by binding to p75 (21Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that this effect is mediated via Jun kinase. Interestingly, dual roles have been suggested for Jun kinase, in development and stress responses, with different Jun kinase pools serving different functions (62Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); likewise, different roles have been suggested for Jun kinase in ceramide signaling (63Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our data show that ceramide generation is necessary for both NGF-induced neuronal cell death and Jnk activation, suggesting that ceramide somehow regulates or modulates one of the interactors or kinases upstream of Jnk. The current state of knowledge regarding downstream targets of ceramide (64Willaime S. Vanhoutte P. Caboche J. Lemaigre-Dubreuil Y. Mariani J. Brugg B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or activation pathways to Jnk (65Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B.

Histone and nucleosome interaction has been shown to be mediated by specific chromatin domains called bromodomains and chromodomains. Here we provide evidence for a similar function of two additional domains within the yeast SAGA complex, containing the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5. We have analyzed deletion and substitution mutations within Gcn5 and Ada2, an interacting protein within SAGA, and have identified substrate recognition functions within the SANT domain of Ada2 and regions of the histone acetyltransferase domain of Gcn5 that are distinct from catalytic function itself. These results suggest that histone and nucleosomal substrate recognition by SAGA involves multiple conserved domains and proteins, beyond those that have been previously identified.

Transcriptional regulation requires activator and repressor proteins and their associated complexes as well as the chromatin structure of the template. Activators bind to specific DNA sequences upstream from promoters and increase transcription by recruiting coactivator, or adaptor, complexes that provide interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery (1Guarente L.

A variety of mechanisms are believed to influence the state of chromatin, including ATP-dependent remodeling by complexes such as Swi-Snf (11Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N.

At least two yeast native complexes, ADA and SAGA, are known to contain the Ada2-Ada3-Gcn5 trimer. The 1.8-MDa SAGA complex also possesses a number of other transcriptionally relevant subunits (21Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L.

The Gcn5 HAT domain is required for transcription and chromatin remodeling at SAGA-dependent promoters (30Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L.

Additional specific proteins/domains within SAGA promote nucleosome acetylation: mutation of either the bromodomain of Gcn5 (see below) (22Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J.

Besides possessing HAT activity, SAGA interacts with activation domains (33Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Côté J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L.

Biol. 2000; 20: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An important question concerning histone modifications is how substrate specificity is achieved. The bromodomain is present in a variety of chromatin-associated proteins (37Haynes S.R. Dollard C. Winston F. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Dawid I.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 202603Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in both nucleosome and modification-specific histone tail recognition (38Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Gcn5 efficiently acetylates nucleosomal histones only as a component of the SAGA or ADA complex and not as a monomer, and, as mentioned above, this requires the bromodomain of Gcn5. The bromodomain of CBP also specifically targets acetylation to nucleosomal substrates (39Manning E.T. Ikehara T. Ito T. Kadonaga J.T. Kraus W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bromodomains of Gcn5 and TAFII250 interact with acetylated lysine, suggesting that in addition to recognizing nucleosomes, the bromodomain may have a role in recognition of modified histone substrates (40Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 41Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G.

More recently, the chromodomain of heterochromatin protein HP1 was discovered to bind specifically to a methylated lysine residue (Lys9) of histone H3 as part of heterochromatic silencing (43Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar, 44Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Another motif with potential transcription- and chromatin-related functions is the SANT domain (45Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), found inSwi3, Ada2, the co-repressor NCoR,TFIIIB, and ISWI. All of these proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation, and most (Swi3, Ada2, NCoR, and ISWI) are present in chromatin-regulatory complexes. SANT-homologous repeats in the Myb oncoprotein have been implicated in DNA binding (46Howe K.M. Reakes C.F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 47Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), but the function of the SANT motif itself is still unclear. However, recent reports indicate that a SANT-containing region of several co-repressors can bind (48You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 49Guenther M.G. Barak O. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) histone deacetylases (HDACs), again indicating a chromatin-related role. Recent structural studies of HATs have revealed how substrate is bound within the catalytic site. The x-ray crystal structures of several HAT domains, including Hat1, Gcn5, PCAF, and Esa1, have recently been solved (50Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is known that histone tail substrate interacts with the Gcn5 HAT domain within a pronounced cleft created by the N- and C-terminal portions of the domain (51Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Previous mutational studies have identified key residues for catalytic function (30Wang L. Liu L. Berger S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 640-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 52Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 53Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D.

A. 1999; 96: 8931-8936Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and these residues map to contact points with acetyl-CoA and histone substrate. One interesting aspect of the HAT structures is the presence of evolutionarily conserved and solvent-exposed residues in the HAT domain that do not make contact with either acetyl-CoA or histone. Thus, these residues may serve as direct docking sites for certain aspects of nucleosomes or for additional proteins that recognize nucleosomes. To gain a better understanding of the structure and function of the SAGA complex in relationship to substrate recognition, we have characterized the SAGA complex from a series of deletion and substitution mutants of Ada2 and Gcn5. The Ada2 and Gcn5 deletion mutants chosen for this study and summaries of their previously determined in vivo effects and in vitrointeractions are shown in Fig. 1. The results of the present study identify new specific regions of Ada2 and Gcn5 that are important in substrate recognition. For ADA2 integrations,ada2Δ strain SB330 (MAT a ada2Δ his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 ura3–52) was produced by transforming FY1369 with anada2Δ::hisG-URA3-hisG fragment from plasmid pyADA2-KO (2Berger S.L. Piña B.

For integration of GCN5 alanine substitution mutations, gcn5Δ/Ada2-tagged strain SB349 (MAT a gcn5Δ ADA2–2Flag::TRP1 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ ura3–52) was used; it was produced (as described above for SB330) by GCN5 knockout of Ada2-tagged strain SB345 (MAT a ADA2–2Flag::TRP1 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ ura3–52), in which strain SB301, a trp1Δ derivative of FY1369, was genomically tagged at the C terminus of ADA2 with two tandem FLAG epitope tag sequences by the method of Longtine et al.(56Longtine M.S.

The plasmids were linearized withNsiI or StuI and used for transformation of theada2Δ or gcn5Δ strains, for integration into the genome at the URA3 locus for expression from theADH1 or GCN5 promoters. For comparing levels of Ada2 in cell extracts, a single FLAG epitope tag (encoding DYKDDDDK) was added by QuikChange mutagenesis to the C terminus of Ada2 in the wild-type and W-E, DEE, and W-I constructs; after integration, extracts were prepared by glass bead breakage, and samples were used for an anti-FLAG Western blot. To test the immunoreactivity of ΔSANT-a Ada2 toward anti-Ada2 antiserum, an HA epitope-tagged construct of pYES2-Ada2 was mutagenized to ΔSANT-a by QuikChange; wild-type and ΔSANT-a versions were overexpressed in yeast by galactose induction, and extract samples were used for parallel anti-Ada2 and anti-HA Western blots. Yeast HAT complexes were prepared from 4-liter YPD cultures of the ADA2 and GCN5integrants by the method of Grant et al. (16Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), and Mono Q fractions were used for HAT assays with [3H]acetyl-CoA and free histone (Sigma) or nucleosome substrates as described previously (22Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), with the following changes. Each 30-μl reaction contained 10 μg of BSA and reaction buffer with pH 7.5 and no salt; all salt was contributed by the 5 μl of sample to be assayed (generally about 0.35 m in chromatography or extraction buffer). Mono Q fraction amounts used for these assays were adjusted based on SAGA yield, as judged by Western blotting (see below), and salt content was made equal in all assays by way of chromatography buffer. Reaction products were run on SDS-18%-PAGE gels, which were visualized by fluorography (Entensify or Enlightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SAGA immunoprecipitation for HAT assays in Fig. 3 was performed by incubating 40 μl (wild type) or 60 μl (ΔSANT-a) of SAGA Mono Q peak fraction with 2 μl of anti-TafII60 or anti-TafII145 (negative control) antiserum and 30 μl of Protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in a total volume of 222 μl with extraction buffer (16Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

Beads were washed five times with 500 μl of extraction buffer and once with 500 μl of HAT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Assays were performed for 45 min at 30 °C with rotation after combining 10 μl of 50% bead slurry (one-sixth of sample) with 50 μl of a mixture containing HAT buffer with 10 mmsodium butyrate, 0.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences), and 8 μg of nucleosomes or 40 μg of free histones. Of the final 60 μl of slurry, 40 μl was run on SDS-PAGE as described above. For HAT assays in Table I, Gcn5 integrants in an Ada2–2FLAG-tagged strain were grown in 50 ml of YPD to an optical density of 0.8 at the 600-nm wavelength, and extracts were prepared in extraction buffer by glass bead breakage. Amounts of extract containing 1 mg of total protein (Bio-Rad assay) were used for immunoprecipitation with 1.5 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (4.4 mg/ml; Sigma) at 4 °C overnight, followed by 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for several hours and elution with 2.5 μl of 15.8 mg/ml FLAG peptide in 40 μl of extraction buffer for several hours at 4 °C. 5 μl of these elutions were used for HAT assays, and 10 μl were used for Western blots. For Western blot analysis, SAGA peak fractions from Mono Q were run on SDS-10%-PAGE gels. For Ada2 deletion mutant preparations with lower yields of SAGA (ΔSANT-a and Δ7), more sample was used in each lane; this normalization was based on TafII60 and Spt20 Western blots. Amounts used were typically 20 μl for ΔSANT-a, 15 μl for Δ7, and 10 μl for the others. For Ada2 alanine substitution mutants, the normalized amounts of SAGA peak fractions were 5.5 μl of wild type, 10 μl of DEE, and 7.5 μl of W-I. For Gcn5 truncations, 10 μl of wild type and Δ253N and 20 μl of Δ169N were used. Proteins were electroblotted to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes, and SAGA subunits were detected with specific antisera as described previously (22Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Anti-Ada3 antiserum was provided by L. Guarente's laboratory and was used at a dilution of 1:5000. The Ada2 deletion mutants fall into three categories with respect to their effects on growth and transcription: normal, impaired, and very impaired (19Candau R. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5237-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). We wished to determine the structural and functional basis for these in vivodefects and, in particular, whether HAT activity was altered by any of these mutations in Ada2. SAGA complexes were prepared by conventional chromatography (16Grant P.A. Duggan L. Côté J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) from integrants of wild-type ADA2 and the deletion mutants. The complexes were analyzed for subunit composition by Western blotting with antibodies against a subset of SAGA proteins (Fig.2). SAGA was present in preparations of all the mutants of Ada2 and exhibited normal chromatographic elution properties on Mono Q (data not shown). Thus, the defective growth of most of these mutants is not due to an overall absence of SAGA. As shown in the Western blots (Fig. 2), two of the SAGA complexes prepared from the ADA2 mutants (ΔZZ and ΔSANT-a) were intact. Like wild type, SAGA(ΔZZ) (lacking the cysteine-rich, ZZ-type putative zinc-binding domain (61Ponting C.P. Blake D.J. Davies K.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Winder S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 11-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)) contained a full complement of the subunits tested, consistent with previous observations that the mutant strain exhibits normal growth. Thus, the significance of previous findings that in vitro translated Ada2(ΔZZ) is defective for Gcn5 interaction is still unclear (19Candau R. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5237-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SAGA(ΔSANT-a) (lacking the N-terminal half of the SANT domain (45Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar)) also contained all subunits. (The level of Ada2 appears somewhat low in theupper left panel of Fig. 2, but an antibody study with HA-tagged Ada2(ΔSANT-a) (Fig. 2, right panel) suggests that the Ada2(ΔSANT-a) subunit is present in wild-type amounts but reacts poorly with anti-Ada2 antiserum.) However, despite the finding that all SAGA subunits tested were present in normal amounts, the strain bearing ada2ΔSANT-a had impaired functions in vivo, the basis of which is explored below. The other Ada2 mutants resulted in loss of specific subunits from SAGA. SAGA(ΔSANT-b) (with deletion of the C-terminal half of Ada2's SANT domain) specifically lacked Gcn5, consistent with the previous identification of this region as critical for Gcn5 interaction in vitro (19Candau R. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5237-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SAGA(Δ7) lacks most of SANT and an adjacent region N-terminal to it, and this mutant SAGA also lacked Gcn5; Ada2Δ7 itself may also be absent, since extremely low signal is detected, although this deletion does remove the SANT-a region, which appears to be required for full recognition by the anti-Ada2 antiserum. The Ada2Δ9 deletion removes the C-terminal half of SANT-b, and in this case Gcn5 was still present in SAGA, albeit at a significantly reduced level. SAGA(Δ12) and SAGA(Δ14) displayed littl"

The class II deacetylase HDAC6 was inactive in this assay, but the three class I enzymes deacetylated all histone lysines tested, although with varying efficiency. In comparison to HDAC1, HDAC3 preferentially deacetylated lysines 5 and 12 of H4 and lysine 5 of H2A. H4 tails in purified mononucleosomes were refractory to deacetylation by both HDAC1 and HDAC3, unless ATP was added to the reaction mix. Surprisingly, ATP also consistently enhanced cleavage of free, non-nucleosomal histones, but not small peptides, by both enzyme complexes. We found no evidence that ATP operates by phosphorylation of components of the HDAC complex, but have shown that HDACs 1, 2, and 3 all co-immunoprecipitate with the ATP-dependent chaperone protein Hsp70. Another common ATP-dependent chaperone, Hsp90, was absent from all HDAC complexes tested, whereas Hsp60 associated with HDAC1 only.

Chromatin function is regulated not only by the overall level of histone acetylation, but also by targeted acetylation of individual histones and even of specific lysine residues. The first examples of this were found in Drosophila and yeast, but there are now several examples in mammals of situations where patterns of acetylation of individual histones (usually H3 and H4) in defined chromatin domains vary independently (5Gregory R.I.

BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). It is now also clear that acetylation often does not function in isolation, but forms part of a wider, coordinated pattern of post-translational modification, including serine phosphorylation and methylation of lysines and arginines (7Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Spencer V.A. Davie J.R.

Maintenance of such complex regional patterns of histone-specific and residue-specific modification, requires targeting of the appropriate enzymes (10Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It also requires that the catalytic specificity of these enzymes is such that they modify only selected residues, even when several copies of the same residue (e.g.lysine) are present in the same region of the histone tail. Levels of acetylation are established and maintained by the complementary activities of two families of enzymes, the histone acetyltransferases and the histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 (11Grant P.A. Berger S.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Kochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genes Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The histone deacetylases have been placed in three groups on the basis of sequence homologies. The mammalian class I enzymes (HDACs 1–3 and 8) are orthologues of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deacetylase and transcriptional regulator Rpd3, whereas the class II enzymes (HDACs 4–7 and 9) are orthologues of yeast Hda1 (13Rundlett S.E.

Kaeberlin M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 22Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The Sir2 deacetylases are completely dependent on NAD for catalytic activity (21Imai S.-I. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlin M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Both histone acetyltransferases and HDACs are frequently found as components of multiprotein complexes (11Grant P.A. Berger S.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Kochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genes Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HDAC1 and HDAC2 are found together in three separate complexes, distinguished by their subunits. The first of these contains DNA-binding transcriptional repressors (e.g. the methyl DNA-binding protein MeCP2), the histone-binding proteins RbAp48/RbAp46, and the co-repressors Sin3A/B (12Kochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genes Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Ng, Hn-H., and Bird, A. (2000) 25, 121–126Google Scholar). The Sin3 complex can interact with N-CoR and SMRT, two silencing mediators for unliganded retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (24Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.-M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D.

The second complex contains, in addition to HDAC1/2 and RbAp48/46, metastasis-associated protein 2 (MTA2) and the dermatomyositis autoantigen Mi-2 (27Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H-P. Lane W. Reinberg D.

These (and possibly other) subunits confer both nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase activities, and it is referred to as the NuRD complex. A third complex contains HDAC1/2, the transcriptional corepressor CoREST and additional proteins, but no RbAp46/48 (31You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Additionally, HDAC3 has been shown to interact directly with N-CoR and SMRT (16Emiliani S. Fischle W. Lint C.V. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and to co-purify with the class II enzymes HDAC4 and HDAC5 (18Grozinger C. Hassig C. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Both class I and class II enzymes have recently been shown to co-localize in microscopically defined nuclear bodies, though whether this is a result of physical association remains uncertain (32Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.-Y. Alvarez J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The acetylation of defined lysines in the histone tail domains must be a result of the selective action of histone acetyltransferases or HDACs or both. In the present study, we explore the catalytic specificities of human HDACs, using antibodies to HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6 to immuno-isolate endogenous complexes containing these catalytic components. We have used a Western blotting assay to show that the class I HDACs can deacetylate all lysines tested in free histones, but with variable efficiency. The enzymes show no deacetylation of nucleosomal histones, unless ATP is added to the reaction. Surprisingly, ATP also significantly and consistently enhances the deacetylation of free histones by all three class I enzymes. We show that the ATP-dependent chaperone proteins Hsp60 and Hsp70 are associated with HDAC complexes, providing circumstantial evidence that the stimulatory effect of ATP on HDAC catalytic activity operates through these proteins. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were prepared against components of deacetylase complexes using the following synthetic peptides: HDAC1, EEKPEAKGVKEEVKLA; HDAC2, GEKTDTKGTKSEQLSNP; HDAC3, APNEFTDGDHDNDKESDVEI; HDAC6, AHQNKFGEDMPH; RbAp48, ENIYNDEDPEGSVDPEGQGS. Preparation and specificities of rabbit antisera and purification of antibodies were as described previously (33White D.A. Belyaev N.D. Turner B.M. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 10: 417-424Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All antisera for the immunoprecipitation procedures were column-purified for total IgG using protein A-Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Antibodies against Sin3A and N-CoR were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz). A mouse monoclonal antibody against HDAC3 (that also recognizes HDAC1 and HDAC2) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were obtained from Santa Cruz. The specificities of all antisera employed for the experiments described here were tested by Western blotting (see below), and all were shown to detect just a single major protein band (or explicable doublet) of the appropriate molecular weight. SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels were prepared and run as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Western blots used standard blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat powdered dried milk (Marvel™) (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In general, 50% saturated ammonium sulfate cuts of rabbit polyclonal antisera against either acetylated isoforms of histones H2A, H2B, and H4, or HDAC1, -2, -3, and -6, were used for immunodetection, with final dilutions of between 200 and 1000. A peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), as specified by the suppliers of the reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were stripped by treating with 0.2 m NaOH for 20 min with gentle agitation, after which they could be reprobed once. The response of the ECL reaction was found to be linear over the range of histone proteins used in Western blot experiments. Peptides corresponding to the first 20 amino acids of the N-terminal tails of H3 and H4, were labeled with [3H]acetic anhydride (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), as described previously (35Sendra R. Rodrigo I. Salvador L. Franco L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), to typical specific activities of 227.0 Ci/mol (H3) and 74.3 Ci/mol (H4). Assays of HDAC activity were essentially as described (36Li W. Chen H.-Y. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Ryan J. Llinas J. White D.A.

Immunocomplexes (as protein A-Sepharose pellets) were mixed with 280 μl of HDAC assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete Mini™ protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20 μl of a mixture of labeled H3 and H4 peptides (56.7 and 71.6 nmol, respectively, 4.0 × 105 dpm/assay) for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 100 μl of stop solution (2 m HCl, 0.5m acetic acid). Liberated acetyl groups were extracted into 1000 μl of ethyl acetate (Sigma). Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min. 750 μl of the organic layer was mixed with 2 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. Acetate release was shown to be directly proportional to the volume of protein A-Sepharose (PAS) beads added. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum. For [3H]acetate labeling, about 2 × 108 log-phase cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 10 min, followed by 10 mmbutyrate and [3H]sodium acetate (specific activity 2200 Ci/mol; ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) at a final concentration of 0.1 mCi/ml. Labeling was for 60 min at 37 °C. Hyperacetylated free histones were acid-extracted and passed through a Sephadex G50 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) column to remove unincorporated label. Histone substrate had an activity of ∼1.7 × 104 dpm/μg (a specific activity of 104.9 Ci/mol, assuming that the average molecular mass of histones is 13.7 kDa). Deacetylase assays were performed as described above for peptide substrates, except that approximately 0.5 × 105 dpm (3.0 μg) histone substrate was added per assay, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Approximately 1 × 108 log-phase HeLa cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, for 5 min, washed three times in sterile 1× PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet-P40 (Sigma; Igepal C630 is a recent substitute for this detergent), 10% (v/v) glycerol and protease inhibitors). The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle stirring and then sonicated on ice using a Sanyo sonicator fitted with a parabolic probe (four times; amplitude of 5–7 μm for 15-s intervals). The whole cell extract (WCE) was clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 5 min and used immediately. WCE from HeLa cells was immunoprecipitated with IgG purified from appropriate antisera with PAS. A typical experiment used 100 μl of WCE (containing 100 μg of soluble protein) diluted with 850 μl of incubation buffer (identical to lysis buffer, except for the omission of Nonidet P-40), and incubated with 20 μg of purified IgG for 16 h at 4 °C. Control immunoprecipitation experiments included no antibody or 20 μg of PAS-purified pre-immune IgG or 20 μg of irrelevant IgG. All incubations were performed in siliconized 1.6-ml Eppendorf tubes. A 100-μl aliquot of a 50% (v/v) slurry of rehydrated PAS was then added and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. PAS was pelleted in a microcentrifuge (6000 × g for 1 min) and washed three times in wash buffer (identical to lysis buffer, except that Nonidet P-40 was at 0.1%), and once in HDAC assay buffer. HDAC activity in the PAS pellets was assayed as described above. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, it was necessary to prevent leaching of IgG heavy chain and protein A (these obscure the HDAC bands on Western blots). HDAC antisera (500 μg of IgG) were cross-linked to a 100-μl bed volume of recombinant protein A-agarose (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min with 40 mm dimethyl pimelimidate, pH 9.0, as described elsewhere (38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The enzymatic specificities of immunocomplexes were tested against acetylated core histones and mononucleosomes using a Western blotting assay (27Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H-P. Lane W. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 39Barlow A.L. van Drunen C.M. Johnson C.A. Tweedie S. Bird A. Turner B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylated free histones were acid-extracted from HeLa cells treated for 4–6 h with 5 mm butyrate. Histone preparations were dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and supplemented with protease inhibitors. Hyperacetylated mononucleosomes were purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (40O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Low levels of endogenous deacetylase activity in the mononucleosome preparation were inhibited by treatment with 100 ng/ml HC toxin, followed by extensive dialysis into HDAC assay buffer. Initial experiments to assess deacetylation of histones or mononucleosomes used equivalent levels of total specific activity, based on the radiolabeled peptide assay (5000 dpm, releasing 1.60 nmol of acetate) for each enzyme. Pellets were mixed with 5.0 μg of histones or mononucleosomes in 300 μl of HDAC assay buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with continuous agitation, in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm ATP, pH 7.0. Aliquots containing 0.5 μg of histones or 1.5 μg of mononucleosomes were run on SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), Western blotted, and immunostained with antibodies to acetylated histones. Labeling was quantified by densitometry of nonsaturated signals and expressed as a percentage of the labeling for untreated histone. For each series of experiments, filters were reversibly stained with Ponceau S dye (Sigma) to confirm equality of loading. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to determine whether the different class I HDACs are contained in separate complexes and whether they associate with the class II enzymes HDAC4 and HDAC6. Illustrative results are shown in Fig. 1. HDAC immunocomplexes, prepared with antibodies to HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4 (Fig. 1,lanes 1, 3, and 4), and HDAC6 (data not shown), are free of significant contamination with other HDAC subunits. In contrast, immunocomplexes prepared with antibodies to HDAC2 (Fig. 1, lane 2) contain significant amounts of HDAC1, detectable both with a polyclonal antiserum specific for HDAC1 (top panel) and with a monoclonal antibody recognizing all three class 1 HDACs (third panel). As expected, antibodies to HDAC1, -2, and -3 all precipitated RbAp48, Sin3a, and N-CoR (data not shown). Collectively, the results show that the deacetylase activity present in HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC6 immunocomplexes is likely to be due primarily to one type of catalytic subunit, namely that against which the antibody is directed. The activity of HDAC2 immunocomplexes will represent a mixture of HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities. HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6 immunocomplexes were tested for their ability to cleave specific acetylated lysine residues in hyperacetylated histones using a Western blot approach. Our panel of site-specific antibodies recognize the following acetylated lysine residues: Lys-14 and Lys-9/18 in H3; Lys-12/15 in H2B; Lys-5 in H2A; Lys-16, Lys-12, Lys-8, and Lys-5 in H4. These antibodies were used to probe Western blots of core histones before and after treatment with deacetylase complexes. Deacetylation is seen as diminution of a specific histone band. To facilitate comparison of the different immunocomplexes, each assay contained both the same amount of core histone and the same amount of deacetylase activity, measured using the radiolabeled peptide assay. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 immunocomplexes give at least partial deacetylation of all lysines tested in H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Fig.2, A and B,top three panels). In contrast, HDAC6 immunocomplexes show a partial deacetylation only of H4Ac5 and H4Ac8 (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panels). The activities of the HDAC1 and HDAC2 complexes are always comparable, both giving complete deacetylation of H3Ac14 and all H4 lysines, but incomplete deacetylation of H2A and H2B. This identity may be due in part to the presence of HDAC1 in the anti-HDAC2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1). The specificity of HDAC3 seems rather different, with complete deacetylation of H2A, H4Ac5, and H4Ac12, but only partial deacetylation of H3, H2B, H4Ac8, and H4Ac16. The differences between the specificities of HDAC1 and HDAC3 were confirmed by a kinetic analysis in which we monitored deacetylation of H2A, H2B, and H4 by differing amounts of HDAC1 and HDAC3 immunocomplexes. The results are shown graphically in Fig.3 A. They show that HDAC1 deacetylates all four H4 lysines at a similar rate but deacetylates H2A more slowly and H2B more rapidly (Fig. 3 A). HDAC3 deacetylates H4 Lys-8 and Lys-16, and H2B, at exactly the same rate as HDAC1, but deacetylates H4 Lys-5 and Lys-12, and H2A Lys-5, much more rapidly (Fig. 3 A). The specificities of immunocomplexes containing HDAC1 and HDAC3 were tested against a mononucleosome substrate (Fig.4). Mononucleosomes were extensively purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, followed by inactivation of endogenous deacetylase activity, before use in the Western blot-based assay. HDAC1 and HDAC3 immunocomplexes were adjusted to the same level of deacetylase activity, as determined by the conventional peptide assay, to allow comparison of their ability to deacetylate histones in chromatin. All three sites tested in mononucleosomes (H4 Lys-16, Lys-8, and Lys-5) were refractory to deacetylation by either enzyme (Fig. 4). HDAC1 is an integral component of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex (27Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H-P. Lane W. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 28Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Côté J. Wang W. Mol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), so ATP-dependent remodeling activity is likely to be present in material immunoprecipitated with anti-HDAC1. We hypothesized that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling might facilitate HDAC-catalyzed deacetylation, and as a first test of this, 0.5 mm ATP was included in the deacetylation reaction. Under these conditions, HDAC1 gave detectable deacetylation at H4 Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-16, whereas HDAC3 gave almost complete deacetylation of H4 Lys-5, partial deacetylation of H4 Lys-16, but no detectable deacetylation of H4 Lys-8 (Fig. 4). Initially as a control for the experiments on nucleosomal histones, we tested the effects of ATP on deacetylation of free histones. Surprisingly, we detected a significant and consistent enhancement of activity. To explore this further, experiments on the kinetics of deacetylation of free histones, using varying concentrations of HDAC immunocomplex, were carried out in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B. ATP enhances cleavage of H2A, H2B, and H4 lysines by both HDAC1 and HDAC3. (Compare the rates of cleavage in Fig. 3 B with those of the same samples assayed in parallel in the absence of ATP, in Fig.3 A.) There are quantitative, histone-specific differences between the two enzymes, in the degree of stimulation by ATP. Cleavage of H2A Lys-5 by HDAC3 shows only a small increase in the presence of ATP compared with HDAC1, whereas cleavage of H4 Lys-8 and H2B by HDAC1 shows only a small enhancement compared with HDAC3 (Fig. 3,A and B). The enhancement of activity by ATP is always most pronounced at low concentrations of enzyme. Levels of deacetylation converge at higher enzyme concentrations as the reaction nears completion. The effect of ATP on deacetylase activity was tested in an alternative assay using hyperacetylated core histones labeled in vivowith [3H]acetate. Deacetylation by HDAC1 and HDAC3 immunocomplexes over a 2-h time course is shown in Fig.5. ATP strongly enhances activity of both enzymes at the earlier time points. The same assay, at a fixed time of 30 min, was used to determine the concentration of ATP required for optimum deacetylase activity. As shown in Fig.6, both HDAC1 and HDAC3 immunocomplexes are maximally stimulated at or below 0.1 mm ATP. The analogue ATPγS, which is hydrolyzed much more slowly than ATP, gives only a small stimulation of deacetylation over the same range of concentrations (Fig. 6), showing that the stimulatory effect requires ATP hydrolysis. Neither GTP nor ADP increases rates of deacetylation (data not shown). In contrast to its effects on deacetylation of whole histones, ATP at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mmhas no effect at all on the deacetylation, by HDAC1 or HDAC3, of the chemically acetylated H3 and H4 peptides used for routine HDAC assays (results not shown).Figure 6Deacetylation of radiolabeled histones by HDAC1 and HDAC3 in the presence of ATP or ATPγS. HeLa histones radiolabeled in vivo with [3H]acetate were incubated for 30 min with HDAC1 (▪, ■) or HDAC3 (●, ○) immunocomplexes in the presence of variable concentrations of ATP (solid symbols) or ATPγS (open symbols). Rates of deacetylation are expressed as picomoles acetate released per minute.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have explored two possible mechanisms for the stimulation of HDAC activity by ATP. The first is that a protein kinase activity present in the immunocomplexes, phosphorylates one or more components of the complex and thereby stimulates activity. There are precedents for this. Evidence has been presented that HDAC1 is phosphorylated in vivo at sites within ∼100 residues of the C-terminal end (41Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Fischer D. Cohen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and we have shown that treatment with alkaline phosphatase abolishes the HDAC activity of preparations fromXenopus oocytes (37Ryan J. Llinas J. White D.A. Turner B.M. Sommerville J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2441-2452PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, HDAC4 has been shown to associate with extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and can be phosphorylated in vitro by these enzymes (42Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.G.

Common features of these endoproteinases include a HEXXH-zinc binding/catalytic domain, multiple sites ofN-linked glycosylation, and membrane linkage with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchor, all of which may contribute to posttranslationally regulate enzyme expression (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The finding that gp63 has an HEXXH domain and can undergo autoactivation, presumably via a cysteine switch mechanism, has led to its comparison with matrix metalloproteases (10Button L.L. Wilson G.

Upon inoculation into the mammalian host by their sandfly vector, infective flagellated promastigotes are exposed to a variety of antimicrobial factors, some of which may be inactivated by gp63. For example, gp63 renders Leishmania resistant to complement-mediated lysis; cleavage of surface C3b enhances parasite binding to macrophage complement receptors, thereby facilitating uptake by the obligate host cell of the organism (15Brittingham A. Morrison C.J. McMaster W.R. McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. Mosser D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3102-3111PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, gp63 itself is a ligand for binding to host surface proteins, such as the fibronectin receptor (16Rizvi F.S. Ouaissi M.A. Marty B. Santoro F. Capron A. Eur. J.

Science. 1976; 193: 678-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The survival of Leishmania amazonensisin this inhospitable environment is greatly facilitated by the presence of proteolytically active gp63 (13Chaudhuri G. Chaudhuri M. Pan A. Chang K.P. J. Biol.

Release apparently involves both autoproteolysis and secretion as likely mechanisms. The finding of extracellular, proteolytically active gp63 released by multipleLeishmania species may reflect a common requirement of extracellular protease for the parasite life cycle and may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. Two parasite stocks were used for the majority of these studies, an attenuated, gp63-deficient variant of L. amazonensis, designated 250 clone 1, which had been cultivatedin vitro for more than 300 passages (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14McGwire B. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and parentalL. amazonensis, designated 12 clone 1, which has remained cryopreserved with minimal in vitro growth since 1980 (LV 78). The latter has been cultured less than 50 passages in vitro and is virulent both in vitro and in vivo. The gp63 deficiency of the variants consistently correlates with a decrease of in vitro and in vivoinfectivity. Cloned parasites from each stock used in this study were maintained in medium 199 (M199, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 25 °C. Recent clinical isolates of Leishmania tropica and L. infantumfrom endemic sites in Turkey were maintained as described above. Construction of gp63 expression plasmids and parasite transfection were performed as described previously (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Parasite protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for immunoblot analysis using polyclonal rabbit serum raised against denatured and deglycosylated gp63 purified by monoclonal affinity chromatography fromL. amazonensis (5Chang C.S. Chang K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fc and developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For metabolic labeling, stationary phase promastigotes were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and labeled for 30 min in Hanks' containing 100 μCi ml−1[35S]methionine/cysteine (specific activity = 100 mCi mmol−1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per 108cells. After labeling, cells were washed three times in excess M199 medium and resuspended in M199 containing 10-fold excess methionine/cysteine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin to a density of 3 × 107 cells ml−1. Cells were chased and collected by centrifugation. Under these conditions, no change in cell density was observed. Both cell pellets and conditioned medium after centrifugation were retained for further analysis. All medium samples were cleared by three rounds of centrifugation and passage through a 0.2-μm filter before immunoprecipitation for 1 h at 4 °C with gp63-specific antiserum at a dilution of 1:200. For collecting cell-associated gp63, cell pellets (4 × 108 cells) were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice for 30 min after the addition of 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in a microcentrifuge. The samples were thereafter processed as described for conditioned medium. Immune complexes, in each case, were collected by the addition of 50 μl of 33% protein-A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by three washes with 0.2n NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS and then processed for SDS-PAGE and gel autoradiography as described previously (24Chang C.S.

Cell-associated and -released gp63 were assessed in the same aliquot of culture to evaluate their relative levels.

Briefly, culture supernatants from stationary phase cells were immunoprecipitated using gp63-specific antibodies covalently linked to protein-A-Sepharose using dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). Beads with immune complexes were washed as described above and washed twice more in GPI-PLC digestion buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) and divided into two fractions, one treated with 200 ng of recombinantTrypanosoma brucei GPI-PLC (a gift from K. Mensa-Wilmot) and another, used as a negative control. Purified cell-derived gp63 in fresh culture medium was processed exactly as described above as a positive control. All samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. To test the association of extracellular gp63 with membrane vesicles, aliquots of spent medium from metabolically labeled cells were subjected to centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. gp63 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant as described above. This precipitated gp63, an uncentrifuged aliquot of the culture supernatant, and the solubilized 100,000 ×g pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For graphical representation of kinetics and quantitation, blots were analyzed by laser-scanning densitometry. Parasites were washed three times with PBS, adjusted to a density of 108 ml−1 to which 1 ml of 0.5 mg ml−1 of EZ-Link LC-sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) was mixed, and incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended again in labeling solution, and incubated again for 20 min on ice. The labeling was then quenched by washing the cells three times in excess M199, and the sample was processed for gp63 analysis as described above. For zinc chelation experiments, parasites were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min on ice, washed three times in PBS, and surface-biotinylated as described above. Zinc chelation was performed by adding a stock solution of 1,10-phenanthroline to provide the various final concentrations indicated. Biotinylated molecules were collected using immobilized streptavidin (SA) as described above. Spent medium from cultured parasites was collected, filter-sterilized, and concentrated ∼50-fold using a Centricon 20 concentrator. Bovine serum albumin was removed using a Hi-Trap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and fractions were assessed for the presence of gp63 by Western blotting. gp63-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Hi-Trap QFF column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with a continuous salt gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with gp63-specific polyclonal serum. gp63-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to dialysis to remove excess salt before further treatment. Endoglycosidase H treatment of gp63 was performed at 37 °C at pH 5.5 before SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Spent medium samples (250 μl each) from cultures of stationary phase parasites were assayed for proteolytic activity using azocasein as the substrate (26Chaudhuri G. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After incubation, each sample was diluted with 0.4 ml of PBS before the addition of 0.1 ml of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate undigested azocasein. The precipitates were removed by microcentrifugation for 2 min. Caseinolytic activity was determined by reading the absorbance of supernatants at 366 nm and expressed as μg of azocasein digested per h−1 ml−1 medium. The proteolytic activity of gp63 was assessed by comparison of medium pre- and post-immunoprecipitation with gp63-specific antiserum. We previously found gp63 in the culture medium ofL. amazonensis transfectants expressing a mutant gp63 defective in GPI anchor addition (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether gp63 is normally released spontaneously by wild type parasites, recently acquired clinical isolates causing cutaneous (L. tropicaEP39–41) or visceral (L. infantum EP32) disease were tested. Our laboratory stock of wild type L. amazonensis was included for comparison. Parasites were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased for 12–48 h with cold methionine/cysteine. gp63 and a stable cytoplasmic protein, p36 (27Liu X. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), were immunoprecipitated from cell and medium fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig.1). This analysis revealed substantial levels of radiolabeled gp63 in the supernatants of all promastigote cultures. Interestingly, radiolabeled gp63 was released by the recent clinical (EP32-14) isolates, peaking after 12 h and decreasing slightly from 24 to 48 h post-chase, probably because of degradation of the protein. The gp63 released by different isolates was 63–65 kDa in size, consistent with that seen previously (24Chang C.S. Inserra T.J. Kink J.A. Fong D. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 18: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of all samples with an antiserum specific for a stable cytosolic protein, p36 (27Liu X. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), revealed its presence only in cells (Fig. 1, Cell, p36) and not in the medium (Fig.1, Medium, p36), indicating that gp63 release did not occur as a result of cell damage or death. These results demonstrate that gp63 is released from virulent, wild typeLeishmania isolates. The recent isolates tested for gp63 had undergone less than five in vitro passages. The release kinetics are similar to those of our laboratory stock of virulent wild type L. amazonensis (14McGwire B. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings together with the absence of significant gp63 release from avirulent L. amazonensis (Fig. 2 A, see the next paragraph), suggest an association of gp63 release with virulence. It is also possible that specific gp63 isoforms are selectively released reflective of their different functional roles.Figure 2Release of gp63 is independent of glycosylation. A, pulse-chase analysis of cell- and medium-associated gp63. A gp63-deficient variant of L. amazonensis (gp63 DV Cells) was transfected with constructs encoding wild type gp63 (gp63 WT), a gp63 mutant deficient in glycosylation (gp63 DG), or expression vector alone (vector). Proteins of stationary phase (1 × 108 ml−1) promastigote transfectants were metabolically labeled by incubating parasites in medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine followed by cold medium for the indicated times. Aliquots of culture were removed, and cell and medium fractions were separated. gp63 was immunoprecipitated from each and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, graphical representation of gp63 release. The percent of total radiolabeled gp63 that is found in the medium is presented as the ratio of protein precipitated from the medium to protein precipitated from cells + medium. Background endogenous gp63 from the gp63DV cells (vector lanes) was subtracted from that of the gp63WT transfectants to achieve measurement of the transgene wild type cellular gp63 (gp63 WT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the mechanism of gp63 release from cultured promastigotes, we employed a gp63-deficient variant of L. amazonensis(gp63DV), which produces ∼5% of the normal level of gp63 (14McGwire B. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Liu X. Chang K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Analysis of gp63 proteins expressed in transfectant gp63DV cells from specific transgenes facilitates the analysis of protein release, because these cells otherwise release little endogenous gp63 (seen in Fig. 2 A, vector). Because glycosylation may play a role in protein trafficking and secretion (29Morrison C.J. Easton R.L. Morris H.R. McMaster W.R. Piret J.M. Dell A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 68: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 30Zheng X. Lu D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and mutations in the glycosylation sites of gp63 lead to reduced surface expression (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we examined the release of these mutants proteins. gp63DV promastigotes expressing wild type gp63 (gp63WT) or a mutant lacking all three sites of N-linked glycosylation (gp63DG) (9McGwire B.S. Chang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7903-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), both, released significant amounts of gp63 into the culture supernatant (Fig.2 A). The kinetics of extracellular accumulation of gp63 in these cultures was determined by immunoprecipitation of cell and medium fractions of [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse-labeled stationary phase promastigotes, as described. Release of gp63WT was detected as early as 4 h post-chase, with the extracellular concentration peaking ∼12 h post-labeling (Fig.2 A). gp63DG was released with approximately the same kinetics (Fig. 2 A, gp63 DV andgp63 DG). Because gp63DG produced from the transgene in both cell and medium fractions has increased electrophoretic mobility, it is possible to visualize the endogenous gp63 produced by the gp63DV cells as well (Fig. 2) (14McGwire B. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative analysis of cell-associated and released gp63 revealed that ∼60–70% of gp63WT and gp63DGsynthesized during the labeling period was released by 12 h of chase (Fig. 2 B). Thus, release of gp63 is not affected by its extent of glycosylation. Moreover, the extent of deglycosylation does not affect the kinetics of gp63 release. In pulse-chase experiments, the cell-associated deglycosylated mutant was apparent within 1 h post-chase and became detectable extracellularly within 4 h (Fig. 2), similar to that observed for wild type (Figs. 2 and3) and GPI-mutant gp63s (not shown). In the case of VSG (32Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that GPI-anchoring may provide a forward targeting signal inasmuch as VSG reporters lacking GPI-anchoring motifs have slower forward movement out of the endoplasmic reticulum, although they do eventually become secreted (32Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In light of this, the at least 3 h lag time between the appearance of cell-associated gp63 and release of gp63 may be related to the absence of a GPI moiety in the latter, hastening its exit from the cell. At least some of the released gp63 is derived from that preexisting on the parasite surface. This was demonstrated by examining gp63DVcells expressing gp63WT protein that were either surface-biotinylated (Fig. 3 A) or labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Fig. 3 B). Biotinylated gp63 was increasingly released in the medium over the 48-h time period, indicating that it was derived from the parasite surface. Concurrent analysis of the release of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled gp63 over the same time period showed a peak extracellular concentration after 12 h of chase, with a minimal decline in protein levels over successive time points (Fig. 3 B). This suggests the existence of at least two pools of extracellular gp63, released with different kinetics. There are several possible explanations for increasing levels of biotinylated, extracellular gp63 in the setting of steady to decreasing amounts of radiolabeled extracellular gp63 (Figs. 2 and 3). The simplest is that some of the extracellular gp63 is directly secreted by the parasite without first being localized at the cell surface. This interpretation is suggested by results of double labeling experiments. Wild typeL. amazonensis promastigotes were first labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, then surface-biotinylated, and finally chased in medium for increasing time (Fig.4). gp63 from cell and medium fractions was isolated by immunoprecipitation or by chromatography on immobilized streptavidin for analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4, Cell and Medium panels). The cellular fractions contained a constant amount of radiolabeled gp63 (Cell, gp63, Autorad), whereas surface-labeled gp63 steadily declined with time (Cell,gp63, SA-HRP). Analysis of the medium fraction revealed increasing accumulation of surface-released gp63 (Medium, gp63, SA-HRP) as seen in previous single-labeling experiments. Some of the biotinylated gp63 was radioactive (Medium, SA, Autorad), indicating that it acquired a surface location after biosynthesis. We also analyzed the medium after removal of biotinylated material to determine whether some of the released gp63 may be biosynthetically radiolabeled but not biotinylated (Fig. 4, Medium Post-SA Clear). The gp63 contained in this ”SA-cleared“ medium did not contain any biotinylated gp63 (Medium Post-SA Clear,gp63, SA-HRP) but did contain increasing concentrations of radiolabeled, nonbiotinylated gp63 (Medium Post-SA Clear, gp63, Autorad). Because the vast majority of 35S-labeled gp63 destined for the surface-release pathway acquires its surface location during the first 60 min of chase (data not shown), it is unlikely that the radiolabeled, nonbiotinylated gp63 seen in the bottom autoradiogram trafficked through the surface after the biotinylation step. Rather, this material was likely derived from another intracellular pool that never became localized on the surface before its release. Another less likely possibility could be that released gp63 was endocytosed by the parasites. It has recently been shown that cell surface gp63 appears to be internalized, probably during surface membrane recycling (33Weise F. Stierhof Y.D. Kuhn C. Wiese M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4587-4603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the decreasing surface-biotinylated gp63 may be reduced partially by this mechanism. Because the total biotinylated cellular gp63 fraction appears to decrease over time this would indicate that such internalized material is either degraded or released. It is also possible that a fraction of internalized surface gp63 may be secreted, accounting for some biotinylated gp63 accumulating extracellularly. Could secretion of gp63 occur simply as a result of oversaturation of the GPI-anchoring pathway during protein synthesis and maturation? Wild type Leishmania release significant amounts of gp63 (Fig.1). In addition, wild type L. amazonensis overexpressing transgenetically derived gp63 have increased levels of cell-associated (34Chen D.Q. Kolli B.K. Yadava N. Lu H.G. Gilman-Sachs A. Peterson D.A. Chang K.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and released gp63 (not shown). If the GPI pathway were constitutively oversaturated, accounting for the natural endogenous release from the wild type cells, then one would expect only further release of gp63 in these transfectants and stable amounts of cell-associated gp63. We postulate that there is a constitutive distributio"
https://openalex.org/W2010055171,"BIG2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of small GTPases, which regulate membrane association of COPI and adaptor protein (AP)-1 coat protein complexes. A fungal metabolite, brefeldin A (BFA), inhibits ARF-GEFs and leads to redistribution of coat proteins from membranes to the cytoplasm and membrane tubulation of the Golgi complex and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To investigate the function of BIG2, we examined the effects of BIG2-overexpression on the BFA-induced redistribution of ARF, coat proteins, and organelle markers. The BIG2 overexpression blocked BFA-induced redistribution from membranes of ARF1 and the AP-1 complex but not that of the COPI complex. These observations indicate that BIG2 is implicated in membrane association of AP-1, but not that of COPI, through activating ARF. Furthermore, not only BIG2 but also ARF1 and AP-1 were found as queues of spherical swellings along the BFA-induced membrane tubules emanating from the TGN. These observations indicate that BFA-induced AP-1 dissociation from TGN membranes and tubulation of TGN membranes are not coupled events and suggest that a BFA target other than ARF-GEFs exists in the cell.

The budding of carrier vesicles is triggered by membrane binding of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1 and Sar1 families of small GTPases (reviewed in Refs. 1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Schmid S.L. Damke H.

ARFs are found in all eukaryotes and have been shown to function in a variety of membrane-trafficking events. In mammals, the ARF family members are divided into three classes based on sequence similarity, Class I (ARF1-ARF3), Class II (ARF4 and ARF5), and Class III (ARF6) (reviewed in Refs. 1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and 4Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The Class I ARFs, especially ARF1, have been most extensively studied and shown to regulate the assembly of coat protein complexes onto vesicle-budding sites including the COPI complex on the Golgi complex, the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex on thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), and the AP-3 complex on endosomes (5Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 6Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Donaldson J.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The only Class III member, ARF6, functions in endosome-plasma membrane recycling system and in the remodeling of actin cytoskeleton (7Al-Awar O. Radhakrishna H. Powell N.N. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Little is known concerning the roles of the Class II ARFs. Similar to other GTP-binding proteins, ARF cycles between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. GDP-bound ARF is primarily cytosolic although weakly associated with membranes, whereas the active GTP-bound form binds tightly to membranes in which it encounters effectors. For instance, ARF1-GTP promotes the formation of COPI-coated and clathrin/AP-1-coated vesicles at the pre-Golgi intermediates and at the TGN, respectively, by inducing an assembly of the coat complexes onto membranes and possibly by activating lipid mediators (8Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J.

Furthermore, brefeldin A (BFA), which blocks guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF, inhibits the assembly of the COPI and AP-1 complexes onto membranes and induce the formation of membrane tubules from the Golgi complex and the TGN that subsequently fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum and with endosomes, respectively (11–14, reviewed in Refs. 6Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Therefore, it has been suggested that the BFA-induced dissociation of coat proteins from membranes is a prerequisite for membrane tubulation (15Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

However, accumulating evidence shows that membrane tubules are also formed under physiological conditions, indicating that membrane-bound compartments communicate with each other by tubules as well as vesicles (for example, see Refs. 18Cooper M.S.

All ARF-GEFs identified so far possess a Sec7 domain of ∼200 amino acids that is a minimum unit for the catalysis (reviewed in Refs. 26Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of one of the high molecular weight ARF-GEFs, BIG2. When cells overexpressing BIG2 were treated with BFA, the dissociation from membranes of the AP-1 complex but not that of the COPI complex was blocked, suggesting that BIG2 is implicated in the formation of clathrin/AP-1-coated vesicles through activating ARFs but not that of COPI-coated vesicles. However, in the BIG2-overexpressing cells, the BFA treatment still induced the formation of membrane tubules with which not only BIG2 itself but also ARF, AP-1, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) were associated. These observations indicate that BFA-induced coat dissociation is not necessarily a prerequisite for membrane tubulation and that another target of BFA, which inherently blocks membrane tubulation, is present in the cell. A BLAST search was performed against a human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base using the yeast Sec7p sequence as a query and identified an EST (GenBankTMaccession number AA121376) that coded for a part of a protein showing significant homology to the Sec7 domain sequence of Sec7p. A part of the EST sequence was amplified from a human liver cDNA library (Invitrogen) by polymerase chain reaction and used to screen a human hepatoma HepG2 cDNA library (34Hosaka M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biomed. Res. 1994; 15: 383-390Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ten positive clones were identified by screening of ∼1.8 × 106clones, and the longest clone (clone 7) was subjected to further analysis. The cDNA insert of clone 7 was ∼3.0-kb long and covered a part of human BIG2 polypeptide (amino acid residues 103–1362). Subsequent screening of the same HepG2 library with the clone 7 insert identified several positive clones, and two of them (clones 22 and 67) covered the missing BIG2 region (amino acids 1–208 and 881–1719, respectively). However, the most C-terminal region of BIG2 did not appear to be covered by the cloned cDNAs. Another BLAST search against the human EST data base using the most 3′ part of the clone 67 insert identified an EST (GenBankTM accession numberAA594443) that appeared to cover the missing region, and the corresponding cDNA fragment (7C-AA) covering amino acids 1710–1785 was amplified from the human liver cDNA library. The amino acid sequence deduced from the composite cDNA sequence was confirmed to be identical to the reported human BIG2 sequence (32Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To construct expression vectors for epitope-tagged BIG2, an oligonucleotide for an epitope sequence for hemagglutinin (HA) or for Myc was first introduced between theHindIII and BamHI sites of the pcDNA4/HisMax or pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), respectively. The entire coding sequence for BIG2 was then ligated downstream of the epitope sequence of the resulting pcDNA4-HAN or pcDNA3-MycN vector. The construction of expression vectors for C-terminally HA-tagged ARF1 was described previously (35Hosaka M. Toda K. Takatsu H. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An expression vector for the GGA homology (GGAH) domain of Golgi-localizing γ-adaptin ear homology domain ARF-binding protein 1 (GGA1) fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was constructed by subcloning of a cDNA fragment covering the GGAH domain (amino acids 141–326) of human GGA1 (36Takatsu H.

Monoclonal mouse antibody (2G11) to cation-independent MPR (37Dintzis S.M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Suzanne Pfeffer (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) or purchased from Affinity Bioreagents. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to γ-adaptin (100.3), mannosidase II (Man II) (53FC3), Lamp-1 (H4A3), and EEA1 (clone 14) and polyclonal rabbit anti-β-COP antibodies were purchased from Sigma, BAbCo, PharMingen, Transduction Laboratories, and Affinity Bioreagents, respectively. Monoclonal rat anti-HA (3F10) and monoclonal mouse anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were from Roche Diagnostics and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Alexa488-conjugated antibodies and Cy3- and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, respectively. For the expression of HA-tagged BIG2, HeLa cells or Clone 9 rat hepatocytes were transfected with its expression vector using a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 6 h in the presence of 20 mm sodium butyrate. For the coexpression of HA-tagged ARF1 and Myc-tagged BIG2, their expression vectors were microinjected into the nuclei of HeLa cells using Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246, and the cells were incubated for 3 h. Staining of the cells was performed by essentially the same procedures as described previously (38Torii S. Banno T. Watanabe T. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.-W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

The transfected or microinjected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 or fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol. The cells were then incubated with the indicated combinations of primary antibodies followed by a combination of Alexa488-conjugated and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies and observed using a confocal microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica). The activation levels of ARF1 in cells were estimated by a recently developed pull-down assay using GGA (40Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells grown on a 10-cm dish were transfected with an expression vector for either wild type or mutant ARF1-HA alone or in combination with that for HA-tagged BIG2 using the FuGENE 6 reagent and incubated for 18 h in normal medium and then for 6 h in medium containing 20 mm sodium butyrate. The cells were then lysed in 0.65 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing a CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysates were precleared by incubation with GST prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants (0.5 ml) were then incubated with the fusion protein of GST and the GGA1 GGAH domain prebound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The pellets were washed three times with cell lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for detection of ARF or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for detection of BIG2 and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blot was incubated sequentially with monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (3F10) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG and detected using a Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human BIG2 has recently been cloned and found to be associated with the Golgi region (32Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

In these studies, however, neither its precise intracellular localization nor its physiological role has been determined. Because we have independently cloned human BIG2 cDNAs (see “Materials and Methods”), we set out to address these issues. To this end, we first attempted to raise antibodies to BIG2, but they did not work well in immunofluorescence studies. Therefore, we transiently transfected epitope-tagged (HA- or Myc-tagged) BIG2 into cells and examined its subcellular localization. When expressed at moderate levels in HeLa cells and in Clone 9 rat hepatocytes, HA-BIG2 was localized in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1,A–F). Similar perinuclear localization was observed for Myc-tagged BIG2 (see Fig. 3 C′). The staining for BIG2 overlapped with that for β-COP (a COPI subunit, Fig. 1 A), Man II (a medial Golgi membrane protein, Fig. 1 B), γ-adaptin (a subunit of the AP-1 complex, Fig. 1 C), or MPR (a protein recycling between the TGN and late endosomes, Fig.1 D). In contrast, BIG2 was not significantly colocalized with Lamp-1 (a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes, Fig.1 E) or EEA1 (an early endosomal protein, Fig.1 F). These observations are compatible with the data presented by Yamaji et al. (33Yamaji R. Adamik R. Takeda K. Togawa A. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2567-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that BIG2 is localized primarily in the Golgi region.Figure 3Effect of BIG2-coexpression on the BFA-induced redistribution of ARF1. HeLa cells microinjected with an expression vector for HA-tagged ARF1 alone (A andB) or in combination with that for Myc-tagged BIG2 (C and D) were left untreated (A andC) or treated with 5 μg/ml BFA for 15 min (Band D) and processed for staining with anti-HA antibody (A and B) or double-staining with anti-HA (C and D) and anti-myc (C′ andD′) antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” Merged images are shown in C"" andD"".View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A previous study showed that BIG2 catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF in vitro (32Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Yamaji R. Adamik R. Takeda K. Togawa A. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2567-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the study did not address whether it is also functional in vivo. To address this issue, we made use of a recently developed pull-down assay (40Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) for active GTP-bound ARF using GST fused to the GGAH domain of GGA, which interacts directly with ARF in a GTP-dependent manner (41Boman A.L. Zhang C.-J. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 42Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The specificity of this assay was tested using lysates from cells transfected with wild type or mutants of C-terminally HA-tagged ARF1. As shown in Fig. 2, top panel, the binding efficiency to GST-GGAH of GTP-bound mutant of ARF1, ARF1(Q71L) (lane 3), was extremely high as compared with those of wild type ARF1 (lane 4) and its nucleotide-free mutant, ARF1(N126I) (lane 2). Although two bands for ARF1-HA were detected in each lane, we speculate that the upper band may represent myristoylated full-length ARF1, and the lower band may be its degradation product or its non-myristoylated form. We then examined the activation of ARF by BIG2 in cells using this assay. As shown in Fig.2, top panel, the binding of ARF1 from cells cotransfected with ARF1-HA and HA-BIG2 (lane 5) to GST-GGAH was increased 2–3-fold as compared with that from cells transfected with ARF1-HA alone (lane 4). The data indicate that BIG2 does activate ARF1 in cells. Although the -fold activation of ARF1 by BIG2 appears to be low, this may reflect the difference between them in the subcellular localization; namely, BIG2 is associated mainly with the TGN (see below), whereas ARF1 is associated not only with the TGN but with other compartments as well. BFA inhibits ARF-GEFs and thereby inhibits the recruitment of ARF onto Golgi membranes. Therefore, it is possible that the overexpression of an ARF-GEF may block the BFA-induced redistribution of ARF from membranes to the cytoplasm. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of BIG2 overexpression on the localization and BFA-induced redistribution of ARF. To this end, HeLa cells were microinjected with the expression vector for C-terminally HA-tagged ARF1 alone or in combination with that for Myc-tagged BIG2. The microinjected cells were left untreated or treated with BFA for 15 min and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. As reported previously (35Hosaka M. Toda K. Takatsu H. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), when expressed alone, ARF1 was localized in the perinuclear Golgi region (Fig.3 A). The treatment of the cells with BFA resulted in the redistribution of ARF1 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B) as reported previously (44Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Zhang C.-J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The perinuclear localization of ARF1 was superimposed on that of BIG2 and was not apparently affected by the coexpression of BIG2 (Fig. 3,C–C""). When the BIG2-coexpressing cells were treated with BFA, we met with an unexpected phenomenon. Namely, in the BFA-treated cells, BIG2 was present on membrane tubules emanating from the perinuclear region (Fig. 3 D′). Furthermore, to our surprise, some fraction of ARF1 was present along the BIG2-positive tubules, although most of the fraction appeared to dissociate into the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, D–D""). The labeling for BIG2 and ARF1 often looked like queues of spherical swellings along the same tubular processes. These observations make it possible for BIG2 to be involved in the activation of ARF in vivo. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the BFA-induced membrane tubulation is not necessarily coupled with inactivation of ARF. Because BFA inhibits membrane association of coat protein complexes such as COPI and AP-1 through inhibiting ARF-GEFs, thereby blocking membrane recruitment of ARFs, it was reasonably speculated that the overexpression of ARF-GEF may also block the BFA-induced redistribution of the coat proteins. To see for which coat recruitment BIG2 is responsible, the localization of γ-adaptin or β-COP was examined when BIG2-transfected cells were treated with BFA. As shown in Fig. 4,A–A"", when BIG2-transfected cells were treated with BFA for 15 min, the labeling for γ-adaptin was also observed along the BIG2-positive tubules, whereas in non-transfected cells seen in the same field marked by asterisks, γ-adaptin was redistributed into the cytoplasm. Again, the labeling for BIG2 and γ-adaptin often looked similar to queues of spherical swellings along the same tubular processes. The membrane tubules were still observed by a much longer incubation period (up to 2 h) in the presence of BFA (data not shown), suggesting that the tubular processes did not fuse with any compartment other than the compartment from which the tubules originated. By contrast, β-COP was redistributed into the cytoplasm by treatment with BFA for only 1 min even in the BIG2-transfected cells and was not observed along the BIG2-positive tubules (Fig.5, A–A"").Figure 5Effect of BIG2-overexpression on BFA-induced redistribution of β-COP and Man II. Clone 9 cells transfected with the expression vector for HA-tagged BIG2 were treated with 5 μg/ml BFA for 1 min (A and B) or 15 min (C and D) and processed for double-staining with antibodies to the HA epitope (A–D) and to either β-COP (A′ and C′) or Man II (B′ and D′) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Merged images are shown in A""–D"". Asterisks indicate non-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To more clearly show that γ-adaptin remained associated with membranes in cells overexpressing BIG2 when treated with BFA, we exploited the fact that BFA-induced membrane tubules extend along microtubules, and the treatment of cells with nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting drug, results in complete inhibition of the tubule formation (12Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 13Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J.

Cell. 1990; 61: 135-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, the treatment of the BIG2-transfected cells with nocodazole for 2 h caused not only the labeling for BIG2 (Fig. 6, A and C) but also the labeling for γ-adaptin (Fig. 6 A′) and β-COP (Fig. 6 C′) to fragment and disperse throughout the cytoplasm. When the nocodazole-treated cells were then treated with BFA for 15 min in the continued presence of nocodazole, γ-adaptin remained associated with the fragmented BIG2-positive structures while being redistributed into the cytoplasm in non-transfected cells seen in the same field (Fig. 6,B and B′). In contrast, β-COP was redistributed from membranes of the fragmented Golgi into the cytoplasm even in the BIG2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6, D andD′). These observations indicate that BIG2 is involved in the membrane recruitment of the AP-1 complex but not that of the COPI complex. The above results suggest that BIG2 functions primarily on TGN membranes. To corroborate this finding, cells overexpressing HA-BIG2 were treated with BFA for 15 min and double stained for HA and MPR. MPR is present in the TGN and late endosomes and appears in TGN-derived tubules after short periods of BFA treatment (13Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 43Wood S.A. Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, B–B"", the labeling for MPR was observed along the BIG2-positive membrane tubules induced by the BFA treatment. Again, the MPR labeling often looked like a queue of spherical swellings. In contrast, punctate labeling for Lamp-1, a late endosome/lysosome marker, in untreated cells (see Fig. 1 E) was not apparently affected by the BFA treatment nor observed along the BFA-induced tubules containing BIG2 (data not shown). Thus, the BIG2-positive tubules appear to be derived from the TGN. We then examined whether BIG2 overexpression also affects the disorganization of the Golgi complex induced by BFA. It has been known that by a relatively short term incubation period (<1 min) of cells with BFA, COPI is dissociated from Golgi membranes, but the Golgi complex itself is apparently intact, whereas a longer incubation period results in the formation of Golgi tubules, which in turn fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum (11Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A–A"" andB–B"", irrespective of BIG2 transfection, the treatment of cells with BFA for 1 min led to the redistribution of β-COP but not Man II, a medial Golgi marker. This finding indicates that the β-COP redistribution observed in BIG2-overexpressing cells did not result from the Golgi disorganization. When cells were treated with BFA for 15 min, the Man II labeling was a cytoplasmic pattern reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum even in the BIG2-transfected cells (Fig. 5,D–D""), indicating that BIG2 is unable to affect the BFA-induced Golgi disorganization. These observations all together indicate that (i) BIG2 functions primarily on TGN membranes, (ii) through activating ARF, BIG2 is responsible for the recruitment of the AP-1 complex, but not that of the COPI complex, onto membranes, and (iii) the dissociation of coat proteins from membranes is not necessarily a prerequisite for membrane tubulation induced by BFA. Guanine nucleotide exchange on ARFs catalyzed by their GEFs, especially high molecular weight ARF-GEFs, results in their membrane association that triggers subsequent membrane recruitment of coat protein complexes such as the COPI complex with cis-Golgi membranes and that of the AP-1 adaptor complex with TGN membranes. Thus, ARF-GEFs are key regulators for the formation of coated carrier vesicles (26Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 27Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). BFA is known to inhibit high molecular weight ARF-GEFs and thereby inhibit membrane association of ARF itself and that of coat protein complexes (6Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Donaldson J.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

Furthermore, this drug induces tubulation of Golgi and TGN membranes, which has been proposed to follow the coat dissociation (15Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 17Scheel J. Pepperkok R. Lowe M. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previous studies (32Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 33Yamaji R. Adamik R. Takeda K. Togawa A. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2567-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have shown that BIG2 localizes mainly in the Golgi region but have not addressed which coat recruitment or which transport step BIG2 regulates through activating ARF. In this study, we addressed these questions by comparing changes in response to BFA between normal and BIG2-overexpressing cells. Because the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of BIG2 on ARFs is inhibited by BFA, it was anticipated that the BIG2 overexpression was able to antagonize some aspects of the effects of BFA. When overexpressed in cells, BIG2 blocked BFA-induced dissociation of ARF and the AP-1 complex from membranes. By contrast, the BIG2 overexpression was unable to antagonize BFA-induced COPI redistribution. The data indicate that BIG2 is involved in the recruitment of the AP-1 complex with the TGN membranes through activating ARF but not in the recruitment of COPI with cis-Golgi membranes. In the course of the experiments, we unexpectedly found that the BIG2 overexpression did not inhibit the BFA-induced membrane tubulation and that ARF and AP-1 were associated with the BIG2-containing membrane tubules. The tubules appear to be derived from the TGN but not from the Golgi complex, because MPR but not Man II was also found on the BIG2-positive tubules. The tubular processes lasted up to at least 2 h in the presence of BFA and did not appear to fuse with any compartment other than the TGN. In normal cells, BFA induces tubules from the TGN, which then fuse with endosomal compartments (12Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 13Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Given that prior uncoating is generally required for membrane fusion, it is probable that the continuous presence of the AP-1 coat led to the stable BFA-induced tubules observed in the BIG2-overexpressing cells by inhibiting membrane fusion. These observations also indicate that the dissociation of coat proteins from membranes is not necessarily a prerequisite for membrane tubulation and that a BFA target other than ARF-GEFs may exist in the cell and regulate membrane tubulation/fission. Such a candidate target is BFA-ADP-ribosylated substrate (BARS), which is ADP-ribosylated in a BFA-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo (46Mironov A. Colanzi A. Silletta M.G. Fiucci G. Flati S. Fusella A. Polishchuk R. Di Mironov Jr., A. Tullio G. Weigert R. Malhotra V. De Corda D. Matteis M.A. Luini A. J.

When added to permeabilized cells, BARS strongly inhibits BFA-induced Golgi tubular disassembly, whereas pre-ADP-ribosylated BARS does not. By contrast, BARS has no effect on BFA-induced coat dissociation. Recently, Weigert et al. (48Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spanfò S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) have reported that BARS is directly or indirectly implicated in the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to generate phosphatidic acid and regulates fission of Golgi membrane tubules. Because lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity has been reported to be also required for another membrane fission event (49Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Söling H.-D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 50Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1999; 401: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is likely that BFA induces membrane tubules by inhibiting membrane fission by inhibiting the function of BARS or a related protein. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that inhibition of another BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF such as BIG1 may lead to the tubule formation. Future studies will be required to solve this problem. Another striking observation in this study is that the labeling for BIG2, AP-1, ARF, and MPR often looked like queues of spherical swellings along the BFA-induced tubular processes. Supporting our observation is the most recent report of Huang et al. (51Huang F. Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They have observed a dynamic movement of the μ1 AP-1 subunit tagged with yellow fluorescent protein in living cells by time-lapse imaging and found that the μ1-positive structures move as queues of spherical swellings along the tubules, and vesicles are frequently formed at the tips of the tubular extensions. Thus, the images of the AP-1-positive swellings along the BFA-induced tubules we observed may correspond to frozen images at some time point of the dynamically moving swellings along the tubules formed under physiological conditions. In this context, an observation in the BARS study (48Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spanfò S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) described earlier is also noteworthy. A feature of intermediates of Golgi tubule fission induced by BARS is a number of sites in which the tubule diameter is greatly reduced, in other words, queues of boluses or swellings are found in the tubule fission intermediates. Although the study (48Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spanfò S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S. Mancini R. Polishchuk E.V. Salmona M. Facchiano F. Burger K.N.J. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Nature. 1999; 402: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) did not determine whether the swollen regions are coated or whether the constricted sites along the tubules represent bona fidefission sites, it is tempting to speculate that the swollen regions in the intermediates correspond to those observed when BIG2-overexpressing cells were treated with BFA.

All three proteins share common exons, but differ significantly based upon the use of alternative terminal exons. The biological roles of BAH and humbug and their functional relationship to junctin remain unclear. To evaluate the role of BAH in vivo, the catalytic domain of BAH was specifically targeted such that the coding regions of junctin and humbug remained undisturbed. BAH null mice lack measurable BAH protein in several tissues, lack aspartyl β-hydroxylase activity in liver preparations, and exhibit no hydroxylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of clotting Factor X. In addition to reduced fertility in females, BAH null mice display several developmental defects including syndactyly, facial dysmorphology, and a mild defect in hard palate formation. The developmental defects present in BAH null mice are similar to defects observed in knock-outs and hypomorphs of the Notch ligand Serrate-2. In this work, β-hydroxylation of Asp residues in EGF domains is demonstrated for a soluble form of a Notch ligand, human Jagged-1. These results along with recent reports that another post-translational modification of EGF domains in Notch gene family members (glycosylation by Fringe) alters Notch pathway signaling, lends credence to the suggestion that aspartyl β-hydroxylation may represent another post-translational modification of EGF domains that can modulate Notch pathway signaling. Previous work has demonstrated increased levels of BAH in certain tumor tissues and a role for BAH in tumorigenesis has been proposed. The role of hydroxylase in tumor formation was tested directly by crossing BAH KO mice with an intestinal tumor model,APCmin mice. Surprisingly, BAH null/APCmin mice show a statistically significant increase in both intestinal polyp size and number when compared with BAH wild-type/APCmincontrols. These results suggest that, in contrast to expectations, loss of BAH catalytic activity may promote tumor formation. The BAH genomic locus encodes three distinct proteins: junctin, humbug, and BAH.

The consensus sequence for aspartyl/asparaginyl hydroxylation has been found in a wide range of proteins including clotting factors, Notch receptors, and their ligands, ligands of the tyro-3/Axl family of receptor tyrosine kinases and structural proteins of the extracellular matrix (1.Stenflo J.

In addition, the gene encoding BAH is conserved from Drosophila to man (6.Dinchuk J.E. Henderson N.L. Burn T.C. Huber R. Ho S.P. Link J. O'Neil K.T. Focht R.J. Scully M.S. Hollis J.M. Hollis G.F.

To date, the biological role for this post-translational modification has remained elusive. Recent studies on the genomic organization of the BAH locus revealed that BAH contains 24 exons and spans over 200 kilobases of genomic DNA (6.Dinchuk J.E. Henderson N.L. Burn T.C. Huber R. Ho S.P.

These studies yielded the surprising observation that two additional proteins are produced from this locus. One of these proteins, humbug (junctate), shares an identical NH2-terminal half of the protein with BAH, but lacks the entire 52-kDa COOH-terminal catalytic domain (6.Dinchuk J.E. Henderson N.L.

Humbugencodes a type II membrane protein with a short putative amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and a highly charged lumenal domain. The third protein encoded by this locus, junctin, has been previously described and is known to be an integral part of the ryanodine receptor complex (8.Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O.

Junctin shares a common NH2-terminal end with BAH and humbug that corresponds to the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain and the first 42 amino acids on the endoplasmic reticulum lumenal side of the membrane (6.Dinchuk J.E.

Acta. 1998; 1387: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), little is known about the biological role of the hydroxylation of EGF domains. Initial work focused on coagulation cascade proteases that are known to contain varying levels of hydroxylation of their EGF domains (17.Derian C.K. VanDusen W. Przysiecki C.T. Walsh P.N.

These studies were unable to demonstrate altered activity of the proteases when the level of hydroxylation was varied. Multiple additional roles for hydroxylase have been postulated. One proposed role is that hydroxylase may modify signaling through the Notch pathway by direct hydroxylation of Notch receptors and/or their ligands, all of which contain multiple EGF domains with consensus hydroxylation sequences (13.Monkovic D.D. VanDusen W.J. Petroski C.J. Garsky W.M. Sardana M.K. Zavodszky P. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There has been no direct proof that BAH plays a role in this pathway or even that these proteins are hydroxylated. Another proposed role for aspartyl β-hydroxylase, and humbug, was derived directly from the observation that these two proteins are encoded by the same locus as junctin and share significant coding regions (6.Dinchuk J.E. Henderson N.L. Burn T.C. Huber R. Ho S.P. Link J. O'Neil K.T. Focht R.J. Scully M.S. Hollis J.M. Hollis G.F. Friedman P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Direct proof of interaction of BAH and humbug with the ryanodine receptor has not been shown, but preliminary experiments suggest that overexpression of humbug in in vitro systems can alter Ca2+ movement in cell culture systems (7.Treves S. Feriotto G. Moccagatta L. Gambari R. Zorzato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39555-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BAH overexpression has also been associated with epithelial malignancies. Initial observations suggested that BAH is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer (21.Lavoissiere L. Jia S. Nishiyama M. de la Monte S.M. Stern A.M. Wands J.R. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These studies measured BAH levels by utilizing both polyclonal antibodies directed against a fusion protein coding for humbug and the monoclonal antibody FB-50, which has now been demonstrated to detect both BAH and humbug (6.Dinchuk J.E. Henderson N.L. Burn T.C. Huber R. Ho S.P. Link J. O'Neil K.T. Focht R.J. Scully M.S. Hollis J.M. Hollis G.F. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39543-39554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because these antibody reagents recognize both BAH and humbug, it is difficult to tell if one or both of these proteins are up-regulated in these malignancies. Recent studies using NIH 3T3 cells transfected with murine and human BAH suggested a more direct role for BAH in transformation (22.Ince N. de la Monte S.M. Wands J.R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1261-1266PubMed Google Scholar). Because it has been difficult to establish the biological role of BAH by direct biochemical approaches, a genetic approach was taken to assess the role of BAH in vivo. Transgenic mice were generated in which the catalytic activity of BAH was removed by deletion of exons 22 and 23 using homologous recombination. These exons were targeted for removal because they are required for BAH catalytic activity, but are spatially well separated from the coding exons of humbug and junctin. BAH catalytic null animals were evaluated for developmental and reproductive defects. While BAH null animals are viable, they exhibit multiple developmental abnormalities reminiscent of those seen in animals carrying Notch ligand mutations and have altered reproductive capacity. To provide additional insight into a possible role for BAH in tumorigenesis, these mice were crossed with mice carrying the APCmin mutation that leads to multiple intestinal polyp formation. BAH null mice were compared with BAH wild-type animals carrying the APCmin mutation. Analysis of BAH catalytic null animals carrying the APCmin mutation revealed a significant increase in region-specific polyp size and frequency when compared with BAH wild-type animals. A region of mouse BAH known to be critical for catalytic activity (14.Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15.McGinnis K. Ku G.M. VanDusen W.J. Fu J. Garsky V. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Biochem. 1996; 35: 3957-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was targeted for removal by homologous recombination in AB2.2 ES cells. Southern blotting and long range PCR of DNA derived from ES cells were used to confirm correct targeting at this locus (Fig. 1, a and b). Targeted ES cells were injected into donor C57/BL6 blastocysts to produce founder chimeric mice. Founder chimeric mice were mated to produce germ-line transmission of the knock-out. All mice were housed in a fully accredited (by the American Association for the Accreditation of Animal Care International), specific pathogen-free facility at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma Research Labs, Inc. (Wilmington, DE). C57BL/6J-APCmin mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), stock number 002020, and maintained by crossing APCmin/Apc+ males with C57BL/6NTac females purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY), model number B6. BAH(+/−) APCmin/Apc+ mice were generated by mating APCmin/Apc+ males with BAH (+/−) or (−/−) females having a mixed strain background (129S6/SvEv × C57BL/6NTac). Male BAH(+/−)APCmin/Apc+ mice were mated with BAH(+/−) females to produce BAH(−/−) APCmin/Apc+ and BAH(+/+)APCmin/Apc+ mice for study. Intestines were harvested from 110-day-old BAH(−/−)APCmin/Apc+, and BAH(+/+) APCmin/Apc+ male and female mice after CO2 euthanasia. For approximately one-third of the BAH(−/−) APCmin/Apc+ mice it was necessary to harvest the tissue between days 84 and 108 so as to avoid premature death because of the severity of the disease developing in these animals. Entire intestinal tracts were removed and flushed with phosphate-buffered saline from stomach to cecum, and from anus to cecum. The gut epithelium was distended and fixed by filling the tract with phosphate-buffered saline-buffered 10% formalin (pH 7.0). The small intestines were divided into three sections as outlined below and polyps were scored along their entire lengths. Proximally, the duodenum included the region 4 cm immediately distal to the stomach. Distally, the ileum encompassed the section 4 cm immediately proximal to the cecum. The middle section (jejunum) connected the duodenum and ileum and varied in length from 10.5 to 30 cm with an average length of 22.1 cm in BAH(+/+) mice and 20.7 cm in BAH(−/−) mice. Polyps were also counted along the entire length of the colon. Each section was opened longitudinally and polyps were counted and measured under a stereomicroscope at ×10–60 magnification. Tumors from 21 null and 22 wild-type mice were counted and measured by examination at ×30 magnification from four regions of the gastrointestinal tract: duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and the colon. Count data and tumor size data were analyzed using a square root transformation to stabilize the variance. The three primer pairs used for genotyping APCmin mice were: IMR033 5′-GCCATCCCTTCCGTTAG-3′, IMR034 5′-TTCCATTTGGCATAGGC-3′, and IMR758 5′-TTCTGAGAAAGACAGAATTA-3′. The PCR conditions used are those recommended by the Induced Mutant Resource of The Jackson Laboratory. To screen for the BAH catalytic exons 22–23 knockout, a forward primer at the 5′ end outside of the resistance cassette (Spe-2, 5′-TCTGTGTACTACAATAATTTGGC-3′) and a reverse primer inside the resistance cassette (neo805P, 5′-AGGACATAGCGTTGGCTA-3′) were used (Fig. 1a). For the wild-type region the same forward primer, Spe-2, was used in combination with a primer within exon 22 (22-2, 5′-AGTAAAGCACAGGTCTTAGGC-3′). The wild-type product is ∼800 bp long and the disrupted product is ∼400 bp long (Fig. 1a). By evaluating both of these PCR reaction products, the KO status of the mice can be determined. Taq DNA polymerase with associated buffer and MgCl2 from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD) were used for conventional PCR according to manufacturer's instructions for both the APCmin and BAH wild-type control PCR. For amplification of the BAH catalytic KO region, Taq DNA polymerase was used with Optitaq G buffer (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed essentially as described (23.Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Primers and probes were synthesized and purified by Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA). All probes, with the exception of the 18 S probe, were modified at the 5′ end with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein aminohexylamidite, and at the 3′ end with the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine (Biosearch Technologies Inc.). The 5′ end of the 18 S probe was modified with VIC (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For Asph exon 5a (junctin), primers ACCCATCAAAGAAGAGCTGAAGA, CCCCTTCCCTCTATCCTCCTG, and probe CCCTGCCTTCGCTCTTCATTCTTGCT were used. For AspH exon 14a (humbug), primers GGAATTCAGGGTGTATGAGAAACAG, CCAGTGTATAAAGGAAGAGGCTCATC, and probe CCCAGAGTTTGCTGCTGGGTCCAA were used. For AspH exon 23 (catalytic domain), primers TGCACCCTGGAACTCATGTG, GGATCACTAACCCCAGATGCAT, and probe CAGGACCCACAAACTGCAGGCTCC were used. For 18 S rRNA, primers CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA, GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT, and probe TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC were used. Total RNA was prepared from murine heart tissue using the RNeasy purification system according to the manufacturer's (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the Advantage RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was DNase I-treated and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. For Taqman-based real-time PCR expression profiling, 25 ng of each cDNA was added to the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (PerkinElmer Life Science, Foster City, CA) along with 900 nm of each primer and 200 nmof probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time fluorescence monitoring was performed with the PerkinElmer 7700. Standard curves were generated for each transcript using a serial dilution of cDNA. Relative abundance was then determined by comparing the cycle threshold values for each reaction with this standard curve. Abundance levels calculated from negative control reactions performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase were then subtracted from experimental sample abundance. Input levels of cDNA were corrected for by normalizing all data to 18 S ribosomal RNA levels. All expression measurements were performed in quadruplicate using two independently generated cDNA samples. Mouse liver specimens (∼30 mg each) were homogenized on ice with 200 μl of buffer A1 (buffer A: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.9% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, 1 mg/ml aprotinin and 10 mg/ml leupeptin) in a 2-ml tube using a Tissuemizer (Becton Dickinson) running at ∼11,000 rpm for 25 s. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cell lysates were diluted by adding an additional 200 μl of buffer A and were then loaded onto QIAshredder spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) to shear high molecular weight DNA. After centrifuging in microcentrifuge tubes at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatants were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The eluates were adjusted to a volume of ∼0.5 ml with buffer A and were re-centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for another 30 min. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the Lowry method. Three mg of total protein (∼150–300 μl) from each supernatant was added to 0.5 ml of 50% SP-Sepharose High Performance resin pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer B: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.9% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The total volume including resin was adjusted to 1 ml with buffer B. These mixtures were equilibrated on a roller for 40 min and were then centrifuged briefly at ∼1000 rpm for 10–15 s. After 4 successive 1-ml washes in buffer B, bound proteins were eluted with 4 successive washes of 0.25 ml of buffer C (buffer C: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin) each. All buffers were stored at 4 °C. Each elution was performed by mixing the resin with buffer C on a roller for 5 min. Eluted proteins were pooled to reach a final volume of 1 ml/tissue sample and were stored at −70 °C awaiting determination of enzymatic activity. To determine the recovery of aspartyl β-hydroxylase activity during the purification process, a known amount of human 52-kDa aspartyl β-hydroxylase catalytic domain (14.Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J. Burke C.J. Kuo A. Griffin P.R. Sardana M.K. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based upon the recovery of activity in this sample the recovery of aspartyl β-hydroxylase activity after purification from mouse tissue samples was determined to be 70–80%. Aspartyl β-hydroxylase activity was assayed as described previously (10.Gronke R.S. Welsch D.J. VanDusen W.J. Garsky V.M. Sardana M.K. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. J. Biol.

Incubations were carried out in a final volume of 40 μl in 1.5-ml siliconized Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C for 30 min. Final concentrations of reagents were 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mmferrous ammonium sulfate, 20 mmα-[1-14C]ketoglutaric acid (α-[1-14C]ketoglutaric acid (54.5 mCi/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Science), 120 mm EGF substrate, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A linear response was obtained when between 12 and 24 μl of partial purified aspartyl β-hydroxylase was used. Mouse blood was collected by direct cardiac puncture into anticoagulant (1/10th of the final volume). The anticoagulant consisted of 84 mg of citric acid, 177 mg of trisodium citrate, 116 mg of benzamidine, 2 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 units of heparin in a final volume of 10 ml. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. 1 mbarium chloride was added to the plasma slowly with stirring during 2 h of incubation at 4 °C. For 1 ml of plasma, 90 μl of barium chloride was added. This mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with mixing. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 ×g, pellets were washed 3 times with 300 μl of 0.9% NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine. Final pellets were dissolved in 120 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h with mixing at 4 °C. The protein mixture was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5. After dialysis, proteins were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The protein mixture was further resolved by high performance liquid chromatography using a 2.1 × 50-mm Vydac C4 column. The Vydac C4 column was equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% acetonitrile, and between 50 and 100 μl of protein mixture was loaded. Subsequently, a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 47.5% was applied at an increasing rate of ∼0.23% per minute. Protein fractions from 1 to 10 were collected and analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel. Fraction 1 was eluted from the column at an acetonitrile concentration of 36%. Fraction 1 contained a single protein band on SDS-PAGE. This band was cut out, minced, and the protein was eluted and sequenced. The NH2-terminal sequence of this band corresponded to the reported NH2-terminal sequence of mouse Factor X (data not shown). All glass tubes and vials were pyrolyzed at 500 °C for at least 4 h. Protein samples were dried in the glass tubes in a Speedvac (Savant Instruments Inc., Hicksville, NY). 500 μl of 6n HCl (Pierce Biochemicals, Rockford, IL) was added to each hydrolysis vial. Acid hydrolysis tubes were incubated for 20 h at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere. After hydrolysis, samples were dried and processed according to Waters AccQ-Fluor Reagent kit protocol. Derivatized samples (100 μl) were dried in the Speedvac, dissolved in 20 μl of 10% acetonitrile, and loaded onto an high performance liquid chromatography column under conditions and gradient specified by Waters (Millipore Corporation, Milford, MA). For Hya (β-hydroxyaspartic acid) calculations, various amounts of e-Hya (24.Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sc. U. S.

Wild-type and knock-out mouse tissues were collected in separate vials and placed into a dry ice bath. Thawed tissues were washed briefly in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) plus 1 tablet of “Complete” protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/50 ml of buffer. Tissues were homogenized for 30 s on ice in extraction buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2 tablets of Complete per 50 ml of extraction buffer). Extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 × g, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of wild-type and knock-out tissue proteins were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Novex, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 2 h at 50 V with an ice pack cooling unit using 10 mm CAPS-NaOH, pH 11.0, 10% methanol as a transfer buffer. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, for 2 h. Incubation with primary polyclonal antibody was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the catalytic domain of human BAH (14.Jia S. McGinnis K. VanDusen W.J"

A nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, has recently been reported to be expressed in VSMCs. Here we examined a role of PPAR-γ in TXR gene expression in VSMCs. PPAR-γ ligands 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 and troglitazone reduced TXR mRNA expression levels as well as cell growth as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Transcriptional activity of the TXR gene promoter was suppressed with PPAR-γ ligands, and the suppression was augmented further by PPAR-γ overexpression. By deletion and mutation analyses, the transcription suppression was shown to be the result of a −22/−7 GC box-related sequence (upstream of transcription start site). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays also showed that the sequence was bound by Sp1 but not by PPAR-γ, and the formation of a Sp1·DNA complex was inhibited either by coincubation with PPAR-γ or PPAR-γ ligand treatment of VSMCs. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated a direct interaction between PPAR-γ and Sp1. In conclusion, PPAR-γ suppresses TXR gene transcription via an interaction with Sp1.

Bertani T. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The biological action of TX is mediated via its specific membrane TX receptor (TXR). We previously isolated a cDNA for rat TXR (7Abe T. Takeuchi K. Takahashi N. Tsutsumi E. Taniyama Y. Abe K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), localized it in either the kidney (8Takahashi N. Takeuchi K. Abe T. Sugawara A. Abe K.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4143-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and identified its chromosomal localization (10Takeuchi K. Nakagawara K. Mori M. Abe T. Takahashi N. Tsutsumi E. Taniyama Y. Kato T. Takeuchi T. Abe K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have isolated 5′-flanking region (FL) of the rat TXR gene and studied its transcription regulation in VSMCs (11Takahashi N. Takeuchi K. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Kato T. Wilcox C.S. Abe K.

Either insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones including troglitazone (TRO) or 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(PGJ2) (13Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Recently, PPAR-γ has been shown to be present not only in adipocytes but also in vascular tissues including VSMCs (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), and an inhibitory effect of PPAR-γ on gene expression in atherosclerosis has been studied. Activation of PPAR-γ with its ligands suppressed expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (16Kato K. Satoh H. Endo Y. Yamada D. Midorikawa S. Sato W. Mizuno K. Fujita T. Tsukamoto K. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in vascular endothelial cells and that of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in VSMCs (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed that PPAR-γ can suppress TX synthase gene transcription in macrophages (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the role of PPAR-γ in TXR gene expression in VSMCs. We observed that PPAR-γ inhibited the TX-mediated cell growth of VSMCs and TXR mRNA expression. Suppression of TXR gene transcription was confirmed, and the suppression was shown to be dependent on a GC box-related sequence present at the −22/−7 region of TXR gene promoter (upstream of transcription start site), which was bound by Sp1 but not by PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ was shown to interact physically with Sp1 by glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. Taken together, PPAR-γ was suggested to suppress TXR gene transcription via a protein-protein interaction with Sp1. An antiatherosclerotic action of PPAR-γ by inhibiting TXR gene expression in VSMCs may be suggested.DISCUSSIONTX-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMCs was inhibited by PGJ2 and an insulin-sensitizing drug TRO, both of which have been shown to be ligands for PPAR-γ (13Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Because TXR mRNA expression was also decreased by these PPAR-γ ligands, the inhibition of TX-stimulated DNA synthesis by PPAR-γ ligands was suggested to be caused at least in part by the repression of TXR expression. Moreover, the TXR expression suppression was dependent on a gene transcription mechanism involving PPAR-γ because overexpression of PPAR-γ suppressed transcription of the TXR gene, which was augmented by the addition of PPAR-γ ligands. The TXR gene transcription suppression appeared to be PPAR-γ ligand-specific because PPAR-α ligand LTB4 (24Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) showed little effect. It is suggested that PPAR-γ specifically suppresses the TXR transcription possibly leading to a decrease in TXR expression as well as its function in VSMCs.PPAR-γ has been shown to heterodimerize with RXR-α, bind to PPRE, and induce ligand-dependent transactivation (27Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Deletion mutant analyses have demonstrated that the region between −47 and −7, most likely the −22/−7 GC box-related sequence, is responsible for the transcription suppression by PPAR-γ. However, we did not observe any PPAR-γ binding to the −47/−7 region by EMSA either as a monomer/homodimer or as a PPAR-γ·RXR-α heterodimer. Additionally, no PPRE consensus sequence was identified within the −47/−7 region. The −22/−7 GC box-related sequence was actually bound by Sp1, and the binding was decreased either by incubation with PPAR-γ or PPAR-γ ligand treatment. It was thus suggested that PPAR-γ interacts with Sp1 causing the transcription suppression. PPARs have been reported to regulate transcription by interacting with other transcription factors or cofactors. For instance, PPAR-α was shown previously to activate prolactin gene transcription via an interaction with growth hormone factor (GHF)-1 or coactivators such as cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and SRC-1 (30Tolon R.M. Castillo A.I. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26652-26661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It also suppressed interleukin-6 gene transcription via an interaction with nuclear factor-κB or AP-1 (31De Delerive P. Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Regarding PPAR-γ, it suppressed interleukin-12 gene transcription via an interaction with nuclear factor-κB (32Chung S.W. Kang B.Y. Kim S.H. Pak Y.K. Cho D. Trinchieri G. Kim T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32681-32687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene transcription via a direct interaction with CBP (33Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed recently that PPAR-γ suppresses TX synthase gene transcription via a direct interaction with nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sp1 was shown to interact physically with other nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoic acid receptor (34Suzuki Y. Shimada J. Shudo K. Matsumura M. Crippa M.P. Kojima S. Blood. 1999; 93: 4264-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), estrogen receptor (35Wang F. Hoivik D. Pollenz R. Safe S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and progesterone receptor (36Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but all of these interactions enhanced their Sp1-induced gene transcriptions. In the present study, we have observed a direct physical interaction between PPAR-γ and Sp1 by GST-pull down assays. The interaction is specific because it has been augmented in the presence of PPAR-γ ligand. We thus propose a mechanism by which PPAR-γ inhibits the action of Sp1 on the GC box-related sequence. This is the first report describing an interaction between PPAR-γ and Sp1 causing the transcription inhibition by PPAR-γ.The effects of PPAR-γ and its ligands on the cardiovascular system have been studied. PPAR-γ ligands suppress expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (16Kato K. Satoh H. Endo Y. Yamada D. Midorikawa S. Sato W. Mizuno K. Fujita T. Tsukamoto K. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys.

In VSMCs, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by PPAR-γ ligands (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We have reported recently the suppression of type-1 angiotensin II receptor gene transcription by PPAR-γ in VSMCs (38Sugawara A. Takeuchi K. Ikeda Y. Uruno A. Kudo M. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Hypertension. 1999; 34 (abstr.): 363Google Scholar) and that of TX synthase gene transcription by PPAR-γ in macrophages (17Ikeda Y.

Moreover, in terms of atherogenesis, PPAR-γ inhibited macrophage activation (39Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 40Ricote M. Li A.C.

Ikegami H. Mikami H. Masuo K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), ameliorate microalbuminuria (44Imano E. Kanda T. Nakatani Y. Nishida T. Arai K.

An inhibitory effect of TRO on carotid arterial wall thickening in diabetic patients was also reported (46Minamikawa J. Tanaka S. Yamauchi M. Inoue D. Koshiyama H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1818-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It thus appears that PPAR-γ has an antiatherosclerotic effect.An increase in TX production is widely reported in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) (47Carr M.E. J.

Moreover, TX-induced aortic contraction is augmented in diabetic rats (51Hattori Y. Kawasaki H. Kanno M. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1999; 104: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both synthesis and action of TX are suggested to be up-regulated in DM. We have shown previously that PPAR-γ and its ligands also suppressed expression of the TX synthase gene (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is supported by the observation that TRO reduced TX production in human platelets and erythroleukemia cells (52Hishinuma T. Yamazaki T. Mizugaki M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 62: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PPAR-γ and its ligands may thus attenuate both synthesis and action of TX, exerting a beneficial effect on cardiovascular complications in DM patients.In conclusion, PPAR-γ suppresses TXR gene expression at the transcription level via an interaction with Sp1 and inhibits TX-induced cell proliferation in VSMCs. PPAR-γ can inhibit TX system possibly causing antiatherosclerotic and anticoagulative effects on the vasculature. Thromboxane (TX)1A2 is a labile metabolite of arachidonic acid synthesized by TX synthase (1Yokoyama C. Miyata A. Ihara H. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5170-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or testis (9Takahashi N. Takeuchi K. Abe T. Murakami K. Yamaguchi M. Abe K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4143-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and identified its chromosomal localization (10Takeuchi K. Nakagawara K. Mori M. Abe T. Takahashi N. Tsutsumi E. Taniyama Y. Kato T. Takeuchi T. Abe K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have isolated 5′-flanking region (FL) of the rat TXR gene and studied its transcription regulation in VSMCs (11Takahashi N. Takeuchi K. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Kato T. Wilcox C.S. Abe K. Ito S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ is a nuclear hormone receptor that was shown to transactivate adipocyte-specific genes and induce adipocyte differentiation (12Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Either insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones including troglitazone (TRO) or 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(PGJ2) (13Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar) has been identified as a ligand of PPAR-γ. Recently, PPAR-γ has been shown to be present not only in adipocytes but also in vascular tissues including VSMCs (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), and an inhibitory effect of PPAR-γ on gene expression in atherosclerosis has been studied. Activation of PPAR-γ with its ligands suppressed expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (16Kato K. Satoh H. Endo Y. Yamada D. Midorikawa S. Sato W. Mizuno K. Fujita T. Tsukamoto K. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in vascular endothelial cells and that of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in VSMCs (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed that PPAR-γ can suppress TX synthase gene transcription in macrophages (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of PPAR-γ in TXR gene expression in VSMCs. We observed that PPAR-γ inhibited the TX-mediated cell growth of VSMCs and TXR mRNA expression. Suppression of TXR gene transcription was confirmed, and the suppression was shown to be dependent on a GC box-related sequence present at the −22/−7 region of TXR gene promoter (upstream of transcription start site), which was bound by Sp1 but not by PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ was shown to interact physically with Sp1 by glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. Taken together, PPAR-γ was suggested to suppress TXR gene transcription via a protein-protein interaction with Sp1. An antiatherosclerotic action of PPAR-γ by inhibiting TXR gene expression in VSMCs may be suggested. DISCUSSIONTX-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMCs was inhibited by PGJ2 and an insulin-sensitizing drug TRO, both of which have been shown to be ligands for PPAR-γ (13Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). Because TXR mRNA expression was also decreased by these PPAR-γ ligands, the inhibition of TX-stimulated DNA synthesis by PPAR-γ ligands was suggested to be caused at least in part by the repression of TXR expression. Moreover, the TXR expression suppression was dependent on a gene transcription mechanism involving PPAR-γ because overexpression of PPAR-γ suppressed transcription of the TXR gene, which was augmented by the addition of PPAR-γ ligands. The TXR gene transcription suppression appeared to be PPAR-γ ligand-specific because PPAR-α ligand LTB4 (24Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) showed little effect. It is suggested that PPAR-γ specifically suppresses the TXR transcription possibly leading to a decrease in TXR expression as well as its function in VSMCs.PPAR-γ has been shown to heterodimerize with RXR-α, bind to PPRE, and induce ligand-dependent transactivation (27Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Deletion mutant analyses have demonstrated that the region between −47 and −7, most likely the −22/−7 GC box-related sequence, is responsible for the transcription suppression by PPAR-γ. However, we did not observe any PPAR-γ binding to the −47/−7 region by EMSA either as a monomer/homodimer or as a PPAR-γ·RXR-α heterodimer. Additionally, no PPRE consensus sequence was identified within the −47/−7 region. The −22/−7 GC box-related sequence was actually bound by Sp1, and the binding was decreased either by incubation with PPAR-γ or PPAR-γ ligand treatment. It was thus suggested that PPAR-γ interacts with Sp1 causing the transcription suppression. PPARs have been reported to regulate transcription by interacting with other transcription factors or cofactors. For instance, PPAR-α was shown previously to activate prolactin gene transcription via an interaction with growth hormone factor (GHF)-1 or coactivators such as cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and SRC-1 (30Tolon R.M. Castillo A.I. Aranda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26652-26661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It also suppressed interleukin-6 gene transcription via an interaction with nuclear factor-κB or AP-1 (31De Delerive P. Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Regarding PPAR-γ, it suppressed interleukin-12 gene transcription via an interaction with nuclear factor-κB (32Chung S.W. Kang B.Y. Kim S.H. Pak Y.K. Cho D. Trinchieri G. Kim T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32681-32687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene transcription via a direct interaction with CBP (33Li M. Pascual G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4699-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have observed recently that PPAR-γ suppresses TX synthase gene transcription via a direct interaction with nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sp1 was shown to interact physically with other nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoic acid receptor (34Suzuki Y. Shimada J. Shudo K. Matsumura M. Crippa M.P. Kojima S. Blood. 1999; 93: 4264-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), estrogen receptor (35Wang F. Hoivik D. Pollenz R. Safe S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and progesterone receptor (36Owen G.I. Richer J.K. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but all of these interactions enhanced their Sp1-induced gene transcriptions. In the present study, we have observed a direct physical interaction between PPAR-γ and Sp1 by GST-pull down assays. The interaction is specific because it has been augmented in the presence of PPAR-γ ligand. We thus propose a mechanism by which PPAR-γ inhibits the action of Sp1 on the GC box-related sequence. This is the first report describing an interaction between PPAR-γ and Sp1 causing the transcription inhibition by PPAR-γ.The effects of PPAR-γ and its ligands on the cardiovascular system have been studied. PPAR-γ ligands suppress expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (16Kato K. Satoh H. Endo Y. Yamada D. Midorikawa S. Sato W. Mizuno K. Fujita T. Tsukamoto K. Watanabe T. Biochem. Biophys.

In VSMCs, expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by PPAR-γ ligands (15Marx N. Schonbeck U. Lazar M.A. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). We have reported recently the suppression of type-1 angiotensin II receptor gene transcription by PPAR-γ in VSMCs (38Sugawara A. Takeuchi K. Ikeda Y. Uruno A. Kudo M. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Hypertension. 1999; 34 (abstr.): 363Google Scholar) and that of TX synthase gene transcription by PPAR-γ in macrophages (17Ikeda Y.

Moreover, in terms of atherogenesis, PPAR-γ inhibited macrophage activation (39Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 40Ricote M. Li A.C.

Ikegami H. Mikami H. Masuo K. Am. J. Hypertens. 1995; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), ameliorate microalbuminuria (44Imano E. Kanda T. Nakatani Y. Nishida T. Arai K.

An inhibitory effect of TRO on carotid arterial wall thickening in diabetic patients was also reported (46Minamikawa J. Tanaka S. Yamauchi M. Inoue D. Koshiyama H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1818-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It thus appears that PPAR-γ has an antiatherosclerotic effect.An increase in TX production is widely reported in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) (47Carr M.E. J. Diabetes Complications. 2001; 15: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 48Hishinuma T. Koseki Y. Murai Y. Yamazaki T. Suzuki K. Mizugaki M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1999; 58: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as well as in animal DM models (49Okumura M. Imanishi M. Yamashita T. Yamamura Y. Kim S. Iwao H.

Moreover, TX-induced aortic contraction is augmented in diabetic rats (51Hattori Y. Kawasaki H. Kanno M. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1999; 104: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both synthesis and action of TX are suggested to be up-regulated in DM. We have shown previously that PPAR-γ and its ligands also suppressed expression of the TX synthase gene (17Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S. Ito S. Takeuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33142-33150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is supported by the observation that TRO reduced TX production in human platelets and erythroleukemia cells (52Hishinuma T. Yamazaki T. Mizugaki M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 62: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PPAR-γ and its ligands may thus attenuate both synthesis and action of TX, exerting a beneficial effect on cardiovascular complications in DM patients.In conclusion, PPAR-γ suppresses TXR gene expression at the transcription level via an interaction with Sp1 and inhibits TX-induced cell proliferation in VSMCs. PPAR-γ can inhibit TX system possibly causing antiatherosclerotic and anticoagulative effects on the vasculature. TX-stimulated DNA synthesis in VSMCs was inhibited by PGJ2 and an insulin-sensitizing drug TRO, both of which have been shown to be ligands for PPAR-γ (13Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P.

It is suggested that PPAR-γ specifically suppresses the TXR transcription possibly leading to a decrease in TXR expression as well as its function in VSMCs. PPAR-γ has been shown to heterodimerize with RXR-α, bind to PPRE, and induce ligand-dependent transactivation (27Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Sp1 was shown to interact physically with other nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoic acid receptor (34Suzuki Y. Shimada J. Shudo K. Matsumura M. Crippa M.P. Kojima S.

The COOH-terminal domain of LBP promotes delivery of LPS to CD14 on both polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes resulting in cell activation. In the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, LBP and BPI each promote aggregation of LPS to protein-LPS aggregates of increased size (apparent M r > 20 × 106 Da), but only LPS associated with LBP and BPIN-LBPC is disaggregated in the presence of CD14. BPI and LBPN-BPIC promote apparently CD14-independent LPS association to monocytes without cell activation. These findings demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of these closely related endotoxin-binding proteins dictates the route and host responses to complexes they form with endotoxin.

The major inducer of host responses to Gram-negative bacteria (GNB)1 is endotoxin,i.e. lipopolysaccharide, LPS, the unique glycolipid that comprises the bulk of the outer leaflet of the GNB outer membrane (1Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). These amphipathic molecules are composed of a unique, conserved hydrophobic moiety, the lipid A region, that is a disaccharide ofN-acetylglucosamine substituted with saturated fatty acids and attached to a highly charged acidic carbohydrate region of varying size and composition (1Raetz C.R.

The chemical structure of endotoxin promotes the formation of highly ordered, but potentially malleable aggregated state(s).

Through interaction with CD14, LPS activates cells via a transmembrane receptor capable of promoting signal transduction. This recognition/response cascade includes the Toll-like receptor family of proteins, most notably Toll-like receptor 4, that serve as the primary mediator of endotoxin signaling (20Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

The host also utilizes defense mechanisms that blunt endotoxin-triggered inflammatory responses by eliminating viable GNB and by neutralizing endotoxin. One potent host protein that blocks LPS activity is bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), a basic protein residing in azurophilic granules of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and in the extracellular fluid of PMN-rich inflammatory exudates (22Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). BPI efficiently neutralizes LPS and is also potently cytotoxic and opsonic, especially toward GNB (22Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Iovine N.M. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the functional properties of LBP and BPI differ markedly, they share 45% amino acid identity, are encoded within the same region of chromosome 20, and belong to a family of lipid-binding proteins that include phospholipid transfer protein and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (26Tobias P.S.

The three-dimensional crystal structure for BPI reveals an unusual “hinged” two-domain boomerang-like molecular structure. The extensive sequence homology between LBP and BPI predicts a nearly superimposable three-dimensional structure for LBP (30Beamer L.J. Carroll S.F. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggesting that despite their different bioactivities, BPI and LBP have a similar organization of structure and function. In support of this view, studies on the interaction of LBP and BPI with LPS have demonstrated that the NH2-terminal domain of each protein is responsible for binding LPS (28Gazzano-Santoro H.

In BPI, both affinity for LPS and antibacterial activity are concentrated in this portion of the protein (31Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Frangione B. Mannion B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14891-14894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 33Lamping N.

Agents Actions. 1991; 34: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, promotion by LBP of CD14-dependent cell activation by LPS requires the complete LBP molecule implying that after association of LBP with LPS, the COOH-terminal domain of LBP is needed for transfer of LPS to CD14 (37Han J. Mathison J.C. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8172-8175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the ability of BPI to promote delivery of intact GNB to PMN depends upon both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of BPI (23Iovine N.M. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10973-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, protein binding to aggregated endotoxin is mediated by the NH2-terminal domain of LBP and BPI, followed by delivery of LPS to distinct host acceptors via their COOH-terminal domains. We speculate that the functional properties of endotoxin-containing particles associated with BPI or LBP could be determined, in part, by differences in the identity and/or cellular localization of their downstream targets. In this study, LBP, BPI, and previously described chimeric proteins of LBP and BPI (39Abrahamson S.L. Wu H.M. Williams R.E. Der K. Ottah N. Little R. Gazzano-Santoro H. Theofan G. Bauer R. Leigh S.

DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to further define the role of the COOH-terminal domain of BPI and LBP in delivery of endotoxin to specific cellular and extracellular host targets. We compared the effects of these proteins on the binding of LPS to and activation of enriched populations of leukocytes and on the interaction of LPS with sCD14. A gel filtration chromatography system has been applied that permits isolation of a homogeneous population of LPS aggregates (LPSagg). Using this gel filtration system, we monitored changes in the physical state of LPSagg with LBP, BPI, or chimeric proteins and sCD14. Our results indicate that both the targeting of LPS to specific host acceptors and the subsequent functional effects depend mainly on the properties of the carboxyl-terminal domain of BPI and LBP. The following proteins were provided by Dr. Stephen Carroll, Xoma Corp. (Berkeley, CA): recombinant human BPI (rBPI), human BPI-21, the bioactive NH2-terminal fragment of BPI (residues 1–193), LBP, sCD14, and two chimeric proteins, LBPN-BPIC (amino acids 1–197 of LBP and 200–456 of BPI) and BPIN-LBPC (amino acids 1–200 of BPI and 199–456 of LBP), and rabbit polyclonal anti-LBP antibodies. Isolation of native human BPI and LBP and the design and purification of the recombinant proteins have been described previously (39Abrahamson S.L. Wu H.M. Williams R.E. Der K. Ottah N. Little R. Gazzano-Santoro H. Theofan G. Bauer R. Leigh S. Orme A. Horwitz A.H. Carroll S.F. Dedrick R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies against BPI were generated in goat as has previously been described (41Capodici C. Weiss J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4789-4796PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against CD14 utilized were MEM-18, MY4, and FITC-MY4 from Coulter, Inc. Sephacryl HR S500 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Lucigenin was purchased from Sigma. Human serum albumin (HSA) was endotoxin-free, 25% stock solution manufactured by Baxter Healthcare Corp., Glendale, CA. 3H-LPS (purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was dissolved in endotoxin-free water to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and sonicated twice on ice for 10 min. Aliquots were stored frozen until needed or aggregates were immediately isolated by column chromatography on Sephacryl S500 as described below. Samples for isolation of a homogeneous 3H-LPS aggregate population were diluted 1:1 in Hanks' balanced salts buffer solution containing magnesium and calcium (HBSS+), 20 mm HEPES with 2% HSA and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before application to the column and elution as described below. Essentially all (>98%)3H cpm in purified LPSagg are present within the fatty acids specific to the lipid A region of LPS (42Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Venous blood was drawn from healthy human volunteers, after informed consent in accordance with the established guideline (IRB committee approved protocol), into a heparinized syringe, and leukocytes were isolated by sedimentation in pyrogen-free 3% dextran (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The platelet- and leukocyte-rich upper phase were layered on Histopaque (Sigma) in a 2:1 ratio (v/v) and spun at 50 × g at room temperature for 30 min. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interface between the upper serum/dextran phase and the lower Histopaque phase. The cell pellet contained PMN and erythrocytes; the latter were subsequently removed by hypotonic lysis. The purified PMN and mononuclear cells (MNC) were washed in Hanks' balanced salts solution without magnesium and calcium (HBSS−) and spun for 10 min at 30 × g. The recovered pellet was resuspended in HBSS+ containing 1% HSA. To obtain a more purified monocyte cell fraction, the mononuclear cell mixture obtained after Histopaque sedimentation was incubated with immunomagnetic beads bearing the anti-CD3 (pan T-cell marker) and anti-CD19 (pan B-cell marker) in 4:1 bead:lymphocyte ratio according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Corp., Lake Success, NY) for negative selection of monocytes. After 30 min at room temperature, lymphocytes bound to the magnetic beads were removed by application of the magnet to the tube. The non-adherent cells were decanted into a fresh tube and diluted in HBSS+, 1% HSA to 0.5–1 × 106 cells/ml. These cells were histologically >85% monocytes and >75% CD14+ as evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using FITC-MY4. 3H-LPS (specific activity 900 cpm/ng) from E. coli K12 LCD25 (List Biologicals) was utilized in binding studies to human PMN or enriched MNC as has been previously described (23Iovine N.M. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10973-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Typical incubation mixtures contained cells (2.5–5 × 106) and 100 ng/ml 3H-LPS in 0.5 ml HBSS+, 1% HSA ± the indicated protein in a dose range from 0.1 to 100 nm. Incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed twice in cold saline, transferred in saline to a fresh tube, centrifuged at 500 ×g for 4 min at 4 °C (42Weinrauch Y. Katz S.S. Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the pellet solubilized by boiling in 100 μl of 5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA for 10 min. Recovered 3H-LPS in the solubilized cells was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Cell associated 3H-LPS is expressed as percent of total added 3H-LPS cpm. In experiments examining the effect of anti-CD14 antibodies, 10 μg/ml MEM-18 or MY-4 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with cells before the addition of 3H-LPS and proteins (LBP, BPI, LBPN-BPIC, and BPIN-LBPC). Binding was determined as described above. Columns of Sephacryl S500 (1.5 × 18 cm) were routinely pre-equilibrated in HBSS+, 10 mm HEPES, 1% HSA, pH 7.4. In experiments examining the effect of the divalent cations Mg2+ and Ca2+, samples were prepared in Hanks' balanced salts buffer minus Mg2+ and Ca2+, 10 mmHEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 1% HSA and eluted from columns in the same buffer. Samples applied to the columns were eluted at room temperature at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and aliquots evaluated for 3H-LPS content by liquid scintillation spectroscopy to determine elution profiles. A homogeneous population of 3H-LPS aggregates was prepared by chromatography on Sephacryl S500 HR of 20 μg of 3H-LPS reconstituted as described above. Peak fractions (LPSagg,M r∼ 1–1.5 × 106 Da) were combined and used as a source of 3H-LPS of a defined size range in subsequent experiments. Samples of 3H-LPS ± indicated proteins (BPI, LBP, BPIN-LBPC, LBPN-BPIC ± sCD14) were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in HBSS+, 1% HSA in volumes from 100 to 500 μl before application to columns. The purified aggregates either were used immediately or stored in Teflon vials. These samples were stable at 4 °C for at least 2 weeks. For binding assays of LPSagg, LBP:LPSagg, and BPI:LPSagg, the peak fractions obtained from Sephacryl S500 chromatography were pooled, evaluated for radioactivity, and an aliquot rerun to confirm homogeneity of pooled fractions. Because of the low concentration of LPS in these fractions, binding assays typically were done in a total volume of 1 ml. Molecular size of aggregates was determined by comparing elution of the aggregates against that of the following standard proteins run under the same conditions +/−HSA as indicated: thyroglobulin, blue dextran (+/−HSA), cytochrome c (+/−HSA), aldolase, ferritin (+/−HSA). To verify the presence of LBP or BPI in isolated LPSagg:protein aggregates, samples of LPSagg + LBP or BPI were incubated as described and the aggregates isolated in the void volume of Sephacryl S500 columns equilibrated in Hanks', 10 mm HEPES (1.5 × 6 cm). Shorter columns were used to reduce losses of LPSagg during chromatography without albumin yet allowed efficient isolation of the large aggregates. Void volume fractions containing LPS were precipitated with tricholoracetic acid, the precipitated material was washed, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Control samples containing only LBP or BPI with no LPS were also chromatographed and treated in a similar manner. In addition to these samples, control samples of LBP and BPI of varying concentration were electrophoresed using an Amersham Biosciences, Inc. PhastGel System through either 12.5 (LBP) or 10–15% (BPI) acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose by semi-dry transfer using the same system. For immunoblotting, the nitrocellulose was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing, the blots were treated with the appropriate primary antibody (1:1000 rabbit anti-LBP or goat anti-BPI serum) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 25 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (either donkey anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-goat IgG) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Then the blots were developed using the Pierce SuperSignal substrate system. 3H-LPS (100 ng/ml) ± LBP or BPI or purified aggregates of 3H-LPS as indicated (2 ng/ml in 90 μl) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were added to 96-well plates (Optiplate, Packard) followed by 10 μl of a cell suspension containing 30 or 60 μm lucigenin and either 5 × 106/ml monocytes isolated by immunomagnetic beads or 1 × 107/ml MNC from Histopaque sedimentation (final volume: 100 μl). Lower concentrations of lucigenin were used in assays with 100 ng LPS/ml to reduce the sensitivity of LPS-triggered lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. Chemiluminescence was measured at 37 °C with 5 s of gentle shaking every 5 min in an Anthos Lucy I luminometer (Columbia Bioscience, Federick, MD). Data were collected for 5 s/sample at 10-min intervals for 2 h. LPS-dependent chemiluminescence, reflecting increased cellular oxidase activity, was measured using a dose curve of unfractionated LPS (0.1–1000 ng LPS/ml) or purified LPSagg (about 0.1–20 ng/ml). Leukocyte chemiluminescence was negligible (<100 photons/s) in the absence of LPS. The ability of endotoxin-binding proteins to facilitate interaction and delivery of purified3H-LPS to peripheral blood leukocytes was evaluated by measuring cell association of 3H-LPS in the presence of varied concentrations of LBP, BPI, BPI-21, and two chimeric LBP/BPI proteins, LBPN-BPIC and BPIN-LBPC. Two cell populations were examined: PMN (>98% pure) and a purified MNC that contained ≥50% monocytes. PMN or MNC (0.5–1 × 107/ml) were incubated with3H-LPS (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C and varying concentrations of protein. The amount of 3H-LPS that remained associated after extensive washing of the cells was evaluated. As seen in Fig.1 A, only LBP and BPIN-LBPC promoted association of3H-LPS to PMN. BPI and LBPN-BPIC, as well as BPI-21 (data not shown) were unable to mediate [3H]LPS binding to PMN at any time tested (up to 2 h). Strikingly different results were obtained when the effect of these endotoxin-binding proteins on the association of 3H-LPS to an enriched MNC population was examined (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to PMN, both LBP and BPI, as well as both chimeric proteins, BPIN-LBPc and LBPN-BPIC, promoted association of3H-LPS with MNC in a dose-dependent manner. LBP facilitated more 3H-LPS association to MNC than BPI (>2-fold). BPIN-LBPC and LBPN-BPIC were nearly equipotent and intermediate between LBP and BPI in promoting delivery of3H-LPS to MNC. Maximal 3H-LPS cell association to PMN and MNC required between 1 and 10 nmendotoxin-binding protein. Therefore, proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of LBP (LBP, BPIN-LBPC) promoted delivery of purified LPS to both MNC and PMN (MNC > PMN). Proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of BPI (BPI, LBPN-BPIC) only promoted LPS association with MNC. BPI-21 did not promote 3H-LPS cell association to either PMN or MNC (Fig. 1 B) indicating a requirement of the carboxyl-terminal domain of BPI for BPI-dependent delivery of endotoxin to MNC. Both BPI as well as LBP-dependent 3H-LPS binding observed in MNC are apparently to the monocytes in MNC.3H-LPS binding was increased when a more monocyte-enriched MNC (>85%) was used (data not shown). In contrast, there was little or no LPS binding to purified lymphocytes in the absence or presence of LBP or BPI. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of MNC incubated with BODIPY-endotoxin indicated that both LBP- and BPI-dependent binding of 3H-LPS to blood mononuclear cells is restricted to monocytes. 2J. Hume and J. Weiss, unpublished observations. On monocytes and PMN, mCD14 is the major initial target of LPS exposed to LBP (9Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Differences in delivery of3H-LPS to PMN and monocytes by LBP, BPI, and the two chimera (Fig. 1) could be explained by: 1) differences in mCD14 levels in monocytes and PMN (monocytes > PMN) (42Weinrauch Y.

To test the role of mCD14, we measured the effects of two anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) on cell association of LPS. The two mAbs, MY-4 and MEM-18, are directed against different epitopes of CD14 (45Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol.

They were preincubated with the cells prior to addition of 3H-LPS and the indicated endotoxin-binding proteins. As shown in Fig.2 A, both MY-4 and MEM-18 almost completely blocked delivery of LPS to MNC (or to PMN; data not shown) that was mediated by LBP and BPIN-LBPC. These same mAbs had no (MY-4) or more limited (MEM-18) effect on LPS association mediated by BPI or LBPN-BPIC to MNC. These findings suggest that LPS binding to MNC and PMN is dependent on mCD14 when mediated by proteins containing the COOH-terminal domain of LBP. In contrast, LPS binding to MNC mediated by proteins containing the COOH-terminal domain of BPI is largely independent of mCD14. An alternative interpretation of the above findings is that LPS complexes associated with proteins containing the COOH-terminal domain of BPI engage CD14 but in a way that is less susceptible to inhibition by the particular anti-CD14 mAb examined. To further test the possible role of the COOH-terminal domain of LBP and BPI in interactions of LPS with CD14, we monitored these interactions in solution using sCD14 and a gel filtration system (5Giardina P.C.

Studies suggested that insulin- or growth factor-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and its downstream protein kinase, Akt. In the present study we demonstrated that UVB induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at multiple sites, Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69, leading to dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E. UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was blocked by p38 kinase inhibitors, PD169316 and SB202190, and MSK1 inhibitor, H89, but not by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by certain extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and mitogens, dissociates the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF-4E and relieves the translation block. Therefore, 4E-BP1 is thought to be important in the regulation of protein synthesis (2Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N.

Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family are classically believed to be the major signal transduction pathways in the UV response. Here we report that ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induced the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites including Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69, in the mouse epidermal JB6 cell line. Considering the critical role of 4E-BP1 in initiating protein synthesis, this may be a novel mechanism for UV-promoted tumorigenesis. Using specific kinase inhibitors and dominant negative cell lines, we further demonstrated that UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was mediated by MAP kinase p38 and its downstream kinase mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), whereas PI3-kinase or its downstream kinase Akt did not appear to be involved. These results suggested a signaling pathway independent of PI3-kinase and Akt leading to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1.

Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against phosphorylated sites of 4E-BP1 (Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69), Akt (Ser-473), and phosphorylation of the members of MAP kinase family as described previously (14Haghighat A.

Antibodies against total 4E-BP1, Akt, or the members of MAP kinase family were used as internal controls to determine loading efficiency. Cl 41 cells were also treated with UVB and then 4E-BP1 in the cells was immunoprecipitated using an antibody against 4E-BP1 and captured by A/G PLUS-agarose/Sepharose beads. The samples were resolved by Western blotting and 4E-BP1 or eIF-4E was detected with antibodies against 4E-BP1 or eIF-4E. PI3-kinase activity was assessed as described previously (7Huang C. Ma W-Y.

In brief, JB6 Cl 41 cells and the dominant negative mutant cell line for the PI3-kinase p85 subunit were cultured in monolayers in 100-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. When cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were starved by culturing them in serum-free minimal essential medium for another 12 h. The cells were then either treated or not treated for 30 min with 0.1 μm wortmannin and then exposed to insulin (2.5 μg/ml) for 10 min or UVB (4 kJ/m2) followed by another 15 min incubation. The cells were then disrupted with 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin), kept on ice for 30 min, and then sonicated (3 s). The lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min) and the supernatant fraction (200 μg of protein) was incubated with 20 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-PI3-kinase p85α antibody (Z-8, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The enzyme-antibody-agarose complex was washed twice with 500 μl of each of the following buffers: 1) phosphate-buffered saline: 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate); 2) 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 3) 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The supernatant fraction was carefully removed from the enzyme-antibody-agarose complex and buffer 3 (20 μl) was added and the complex was incubated for 5 min on ice. Substrate buffer (20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Sigma, purity >98%)) previously sonicated for 10 min was added and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reaction buffer (10 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) was added and the mixture incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. The reaction was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 4 n HCl and 130 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), vortexed for 30 s, and kept for 5 min at room temperature. The chloroform phase (30 μl) was spotted onto 1% potassium oxalate-coated Silica Gel H (Uniplate) previously baked at 110 °C for 1 h. The plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/NH4OH/dH2O (60:47:2:11.3; v/v) and dried at room temperature. Radiolabeled spots were detected using the Storm 840 PhosphorImage System (Molecular Dynamics). The activities of JNKs, ERKs, or p38 kinase were determined as described previously (16Zhong S. Ma W-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) following immunoprecipitation using c-Jun, Elk-1, or ATF-2 as substrate, respectively. In brief, serum-starved Cl 41 cells and stable transfectants, DN-p38, DN-JNK1, and DN-ERK2 were exposed to UVB irradiation (4 kJ/m2) followed by culturing for another 30 min. The cells were disrupted with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF) and immunoprecipitated by mixing 500 μg of protein of each cell lysate with antibodies against p38 kinase, JNKs, or ERKs overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. The immunocomplex was captured by adding 100 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose/Sepharose beads and gently rocked on an orbital shaker for another 4 h at 4 °C. The following components were then added: 10 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol); 0.5 μg of substrate, and 10 μl of [γ-32P] (1 μCi/μl) mixture. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then 30 μl of the mixture was spotted on individual pieces of p81 paper (2 cm2). The assay squares were washed twice with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone and then transferred to scintillation vials with 5 ml of scintillation mixture and counted in a scintillation counter. The results were presented as cpm. In vitrophosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by active p38 kinase, MSK1, Akt kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or immunoprecipitated mTOR was assessed as described previously (16Zhong S. Ma W-Y.

In brief, Cl 41 cells were treated with SB202190 or rapamycin at the concentrations indicated for 30 min and then exposed to UVB. After incubation for another hour, mTOR in the cells was immunoprecipitated using an antibody against mTOR (Oncogene, Boston, MA) and captured by A/G PLUS-agarose/Sepharose beads. 4E-BP1 substrate (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was incubated with active p38 kinase, MSK1, Akt kinase, or immunoprecipitated mTOR beads and 200 μm ATP in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mmMgCl2) for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was detected by Western blot with antibodies against phosphorylated sites of 4E-BP1 as described previously. An antibody against total 4E-BP1 was used as an internal control to verify equal protein loading. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is an important step in controlling the rate of initiation of translation in mammalian cells (17Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Our results showed that UVB induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69, in both time- and dose-dependent manners (Fig. 1, A andB). To further investigate whether UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylations lead to functional dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment and Western blot analysis was performed. In samples immunoprecipitated with anti-4E-BP1 antibody following UVB treatment, eIF-4E could be detected by Western blot in the control and 30 min after UVB, but not at 60 min (Fig.1 C) after UVB, indicating that 4E-BP1 was dissociated from eIF-4E by 60 min after UVB irradiation. These data suggest that UVB irradiation induces phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites that results in the functional dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E. UVB irradiation is known to cause activation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinases (14Haghighat A. Sonenberg N. J. Biol.

Therefore we examined the influence of specific MAP kinase inhibitors on UVB- or insulin-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Both PD169316 and SB202190, specific inhibitors of MAP kinase p38, suppressed UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, but had no effect on insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2,A and B). The two inhibitors effectively repressed UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase, but had no effect on phosphorylation of ERKs (Fig. 2, A and B). Neither MEK1 specific inhibitor, PD98059 nor U0126, had an effect on either UVB- or insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2,C and D). PD98059 or U0126 also had no effect on UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase (Fig. 2, C andD). In these experiments, insulin failed to induce phosphorylation of p38 kinase (Fig. 2, A-D). To further confirm that MAP kinase p38 might be involved in mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, we used JB6 Cl 41 and dominant negative mutant cell lines for p38 kinase (DN-p38), ERK2 (DN-ERK2), and JNK1 (DN-JNK1) to study phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by UVB or insulin. UVB- but not insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was blocked in the DN-p38 cell line compared with control Cl 41 (CMV-neo) cells (Fig.3 A). DN-JNK1 or DN-ERK2 had no effect on the phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). UVB did not induce phosphorylation or activation of p38 kinase, ERKs, or JNKs in DN-p38, DN-ERK2, or DN-JNK1, respectively, demonstrating that the dominant negative mutant cells were effective mutants (Fig.4, A-C).Figure 4UVB-induced kinase activity is effectively blocked in dominant negative mutant MAP kinase cells.

UVB-induced phosphorylations of 4E-BP1 were also inhibited by H89, a selective inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases that has been demonstrated to inhibit UVB- or EGF-induced activation of MSK1 (13Zhong S.

These results indicate that both p38 kinase and its downstream kinase MSK1 may be involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. We have demonstrated that p38 kinase or MSK1 is required for mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. To further investigate whether activated p38 kinase or MSK1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 directly,in vitro phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was tested. Results indicate that 4E-BP1 was phosphorylated by activated p38 kinase or MSK1in vitro, and was also weakly phosphorylated by active Akt (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites showed a differential response to the activation of different kinases. Active p38 kinase induced strong phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at sites Thr-36 and Thr-45, but only phosphorylated Ser-64 weakly (Fig. 6). On the other hand, MSK1 induced a strong phosphorylation at Ser-64, but only weak phosphorylation at Thr-36 and Thr-45 (Fig. 6). At a similar dose, Akt could only induce a weak phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 compared with p38 kinase or MSK1 (Fig. 6). These results suggested that both p38 kinase and its downstream kinase, MSK1, are mediators for activation of 4E-BP1. However, the mechanisms of the activation are still not clear. Insulin has been reported to induce 4E-BP1 activation through a PI3-kinase dependent pathway (17Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Mark T. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To investigate whether UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is also mediated by PI3-kinase, we used a wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, to pretreat JB6 C1 41 cells. Results indicated that wortmannin did not block UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 although it blocked insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig.7 A). Considering the possibility that wortmannin might be light sensitive, we used medium from the wells of the cells pretreated by wortmannin and exposed to UVB to treat cells for insulin exposure. The medium containing wortmannin did not block UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 but effectively blocked insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 similar to wortmannin that was not exposed to UVB (data not shown). This result demonstrated that wortmannin was still effective after UVB irradiation and the failure of wortmannin to block UVB-induced phosphorylation was not due to the inefficiency of wortmannin after UVB irradiation. DN-p85 expression also had no effect on UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 7 B). However, the activation of PI3-kinase induced by either UVB or insulin was blocked by wortmannin or in Cl 41 cells expressing DN-p85 (Fig. 7, C and D). Akt is suggested to act both upstream of 4E-BP1 and downstream of PI3-kinase to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 (17Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To further verify that observation, we determined whether UVB-induced Akt was influenced by either wortmannin or by expression of DN-p85. The results clearly showed that both UVB- and insulin-activated phosphorylation of Akt was blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 7 A) and that UVB-induced phosphorylation of Akt was also blocked in DN-p85 cells (Fig. 7 B). These results strongly suggested that, unlike insulin, UVB might induce 4E-BP1 phosphorylation through a PI3-kinase and Akt independent pathway. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been demonstrated to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly (20Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). To investigate whether UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is mediated by mTOR, we used rapamycin (21Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) to pretreat JB6 Cl 41 cells followed by exposure to UVB irradiation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 induced by UVB was weakly inhibited by rapamycin in a concentration range that are not cytotoxic (Fig. 8 A) (21Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs was not affected by rapamycin (Fig. 8 A), indicating that the effect of rapamycin is not through p38 kinase. When we assessed mTOR activity using 4E-BP1 as substrate, we found that UVB could activate mTOR and this activation was blocked by the p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, or rapamycin pretreatment (Fig. 8 B). Thus, mTOR may also be involved in UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. UV irradiation is a major risk factor for human skin cancer (22Matsui M.S. Delco V.A. Mukhtar H.

We reported here that UVB could induce a rapid (15 min following UVB exposure) phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, Thr-69, leading to dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E, which is thought to be critical in its function to initiate the protein translation process (26Gingras A.C.

Considering the important role of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, this mechanism may also be implicated in the tumor promotion effects of UVB. UV irradiation has long been known to activate signal transduction pathways mediated by the MAP kinase family (17Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 18Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C.

In the present studies, both p38 kinase-specific pharmacological inhibitors, PD169316 and SB202190, effectively blocked UVB-, but not insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. However, the MEK inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126, which inhibit activation of ERKs, had no inhibitory effects on UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. These results indicated that p38 kinase is required for mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, but ERKs are not. This conclusion was further confirmed using dominant negative mutants of p38 kinase, JNK1, or ERK2 cells. UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was blocked in DN-p38 kinase, but not in DN-JNK1 or DN-ERK2 cells. On the other hand, insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was not blocked in any of the three dominant negative mutant cell lines. The MAP kinase isoform ERKs is the earliest discovered and by far the most effective kinase that phosphorylates 4E-BP1 in vitro(27Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 28Haystead T.A.J. Haystead C.M. Hu C. Lin T-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23185-23191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERKs were later demonstrated not to be responsible for growth factor-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in vivo because blocking ERKs activation with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, did not inhibit insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in rat adipocytes (29Lin T-A.

Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). This agrees well with the result observed in our experimental model. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that MAP kinases mediate the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 because some other pathways may also be involved in control of the phosphorylation upon different stimuli or in certain cell types. In our model, p38 kinase, a member of MAP kinase family, and its downstream kinase, MSK1, are involved in the mediation of UVB-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, but neither seemed to have an effect on insulin-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. This result indicates that two different pathways are independently involved in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 following different stimuli. p38 kinase and MSK1 also phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at Thr-36, Thr-45, and Ser-64 in vitro. Our in vitro test showed that the responses of the phosphorylation sites to the activation of p38 kinase or MSK1 were different. 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on five sites in response to insulin stimulation (31Fadden P.

J. 1998; 336: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Four of these sites, Thr-36, Thr-45, Ser-64, and Thr-69, fit a Ser/Thr-Pro motif (32Heesom K.J. Avision M.B. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), however, the site that is more important for the function of the protein is not yet clear. A two-step model suggested that the phosphorylation of Thr-36 and Thr-45 may be priming events for the subsequent phosphorylation of other sites toward the carboxyl-terminal of the eIF-4E-binding site (26Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr-36 and Thr-45 did not result in the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E until Ser-64 and Thr-69 were phosphorylated (26Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In our results, the phosphorylation of Thr-36 and Thr-45 occurred at 15 min and reached maximal by 30 min after UVB exposure, whereas the maximal phosphorylation of Ser-64 and Thr-69 was around 60 min after UVB exposure (Fig. 1 A). The results agreed well with the observation that the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E occurred between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1 C). All of the phosphorylation sites of 4E-BP1 are conserved in many species (1Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donze O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 29Lin T-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), suggesting that all may be important in regulating this protein. An accumulation of evidence supports the hypothesis that the PI3-kinase and Akt pathways are involved in the mediation of insulin- or growth factor-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (33Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments, neither the PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, nor dominant negative mutant PI3-kinase subunit p85 (DN-p85) cells, was able to block UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, although they both effectively blocked UVB-activated PI3-kinase and Akt. These results indicated that UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is at least through one pathway that is independent of PI3-kinase and its downstream kinase Akt. mTOR has been reported to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly (19Hara K. Yonezawa K. Mark T. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Our results showed that rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, weakly blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, but had no effect on UVB-induced activation of p38 kinase or ERKs. The p38 kinase inhibitor, SB202190, blocked UVB-activated mTOR and subsequent activation of 4E-BP1. These results suggest that mTOR may also be involved in the signaling pathway leading to activation of 4E-BP1. However, whether p38 kinase acts through mTOR or whether other effectors are involved in mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 needs to be further clarified. We conclude that UVB induces phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, leading to the functional dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E. UVB-induced phosphorylations of 4E-BP1 occur through a pathway involving mTOR and kinases p38/MSK1, but independently of PI3-kinase and Akt (Fig. 9).

Although a number of investigators have attempted to identify the binding site(s) in VN for these molecules, the literature remains somewhat controversial. For example, three different regions of the VN molecule have been proposed to contain the binding sites for uPAR and PAI-1. The first region, the somatomedin B (SMB) domain (residues 1–44) was identified from direct binding studies (9Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second region in VN that has been implicated in uPAR and PAI-1 binding is the heparin binding (HB) domain (residues 348–370). Thus, synthetic peptides from this domain interfere with both uPAR (21Waltz D.A. Natkin L.R. Fujita R.M. Wei Y. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and PAI-1 (28Gechtman Z. Sharma R. Kreizman T. Fridkin M. Shaltiel S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) binding to VN. Moreover, mAb 8E6 (which has been mapped to the HB domain (Ref. 13Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) also inhibits the binding of PAI-1 to VN. Although a third region in VN (residues 115–121) was shown to have weak PAI-1 binding activity (29Mimuro J. Muramatsu S. Kurano Y. Uchida Y. Ikadai H. Watanabe S. Sakata Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the relative importance of this region for PAI-1 and uPAR binding remains to be established. Another potential problem for the interpretation of VN binding studies concerns the molecular forms of VN employed (i.e. native closed form versus the more opened denatured form). These forms of VN have dramatically different binding properties for various ligands including uPAR and PAI-1. For example, although PAI-1 binds to both native and denatured VN, it appears to bind more avidly to the denatured form (30Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M.

It was suggested that there is an initial low affinity interaction between PAI-1 and the COOH-terminal domain (including the HB domain) and that this interaction induces a conformational change in native VN, which exposes the partially cryptic NH2-terminal SMB domain (30Lawrence D.A.

Although uPAR binds to denatured VN (11Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Deng G.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), available evidence suggests that it does not bind to native VN (33Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because of these inconsistent and sometimes conflicting results, we decided to reexamine the binding sites in VN for uPAR and PAI-1. We constructed and purified several recombinant VN variants, and also developed a series of mAbs against VN. We then employed these molecules in real-time biomolecular interaction analysis experiments (BIAcore) to more precisely identify the uPAR and PAI-1 binding sites in denatured VN, and to determine the kinetic constants for their interactions. Our results indicate that the SMB domain is the only high affinity binding site for uPAR and PAI-1 in VN, and that the binding site for mAb 8E6 is distinct from the binding sites for uPAR and PAI-1. The 8E6 epitope is not localized to the HB domain, but rather is present in the connecting region immediately adjacent to the SMB domain. Sulfation of tyrosines 56 and 59 in this region is essential for recognition by this mAb. These observations suggest that results from previous studies using either mAb 8E6 or synthetic peptides to identify binding sites in VN may actually reflect indirect effects or steric hindrance. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), plasminogen, heparin, and heparin-albumin-biotin were purchased from Sigma. Human urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) was a kind gift from Winthrop Laboratory (Rensselaer, NY). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8E6 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, whereas mAbs 153, 1244, and 1330 were developed in our laboratory by standard hybridoma techniques using denatured VN as immunogen. Polyclonal antibodies against human VN, PAI-1, and uPAR were raised in rabbits. Biotin-labeled secondary antibodies as well as streptavidin alkaline phosphatase and its substrate were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The BIAcore running buffer (HBS-EP: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20), Sensor Chip (CM5), and Amine Coupling kit, were purchased from BIAcore (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden). The recombinant stable active form of human PAI-1 was purified from expression clone 14-1b (a kind gift from Daniel Lawrence) inEscherichia coli BL21 cells as described by Kvassman and Shore (34Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The recombinant soluble form of human uPAR (amino acid residues 1–281) was expressed and purified as described previously (35Higazi A.A.R. Mazar A. Wang J. Reilly R. Henkin J. Kniss D. Cines D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Native VN was purified from human plasma by a modification of the original procedure of Dahlbäck and Podack (36Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), using heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) to remove contaminating albumin and to improve the purity as described by Bittorf et al. (37Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extended or denatured form of VN was purified from urea-treated human plasma as described by Yatohgoet al. (38Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). VN variants (1–44, 1–97, and 40–459) were constructed from a human VN cDNA by employing standard PCR amplification methods. The sense (5′) and the antisense (3′) oligonucleotide primers containing a restriction enzyme site were as follows: VN 1–44, 5′-TAGAACGTCCATGGACCAAGAGTCATGCAA-3′ (5′) and 5′-AATACTCGAGTCAAGTCACTTGGGGCTTGC-3′ (3′); VN 1–97, 5′-TAGAACGTCCATGGACCAAGAGTCATGCAA-3′ (5′) and 5′-GGTACTCGAGTCACAGAACAGGTGTCTGCTCA-3′ (3′); VN 40–459, 5′-ATAAATGGATCCAAGCCCCAAGTGACTCG (5′) and 5′-TTATACTCGAGCTACAGATGGCCAGGAGC-3′ (3′). The single point mutant (VN 1–97Y28A) was generated using a two-step PCR method as follows: Using the full-length cDNA as template, a 5′ PCR fragment was constructed using one 5′-specific primer (5′-TTCTCATACTGGCCCTGCTGGCAT-3′) and the reverse complementary mutagenic primer (5′-CAGCAGCTCTGAGCGTAAGAGCAGA-3′). The 3′ fragment was generated by PCR using one mutagenic primer (5′-CTCTGCTCTTACGCTCAGAGCTGCT-3′) and a 3′-specific primer (5′-GCCTCTTCCTCAGGTTTCAGAACA-3′). For the second round of PCR, the 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments were used as templates and amplified by the same primer designed for VN 1–97. For protein expression, PCR-amplified products were digested with NcoI andXhoI or BamHI and XhoI, and ligated into the pET-32a (+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). To generate the double deletion mutant (VN 40–342,377–459), the VN 40–459 expression clone was used as template and amplified by the sense primer (5′-CCATCCCGCGCCACGTGGCTGT-3′) starting from residue 377 and the antisense primer (5′-GGGTGCCATGCCTGAGATGTAGAT-3′) starting from residue 342. E. coli AD494 cells were transformed with various expression plasmids and grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (15 μg/ml) to a density of ∼2 × 108 cells/ml. The cells were transferred to room temperature, induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and lysed using a pressure cell press (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY). The cold osmotic shock fluid was centrifuged at 31,000 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was employed for the purification of the target peptides using TALON™ metal affinity resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The eluted peptides were then dialyzed against a 0.10 concentration of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated by lyophilization. The concentration of the purified proteins was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). To determine the heparin binding capacity of the VN variants, wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with VN or VN variants (5 μg/ml). Excess sites on the wells were blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/0.5 m NaCl) for 2 h at 37 °C, and then the wells were washed with TBS. Biotin-conjugated heparin-albumin (0.5 μg/ml) was added and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the wells were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The bound heparin-albumin was detected using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (AP) and a chromogenic substrate for AP. To determine the plasminogen binding capacity of the VN variants, wells were coated with plasminogen (1 μg/ml), blocked, and washed as above; then the various forms of VN (5 μg/ml) were added, and the wells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the bound VN variants were detected by incubating the wells with rabbit anti-vitronectin IgG (1:1000 dilution) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 45 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed and then incubated sequentially with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, with streptavidin AP, and finally with the chromogenic substrate. To determine the extent of uPAR and PAI-1 binding, wells were first coated with VN or VN variants (0.5 μg/ml), blocked, and washed. Then, uPAR plus uPA (5 μg/ml each; the uPA was added to enhance the binding of uPAR to VN (Ref. 11Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or PAI-1 (1 μg/ml) were added and the wells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed and bound protein was detected by incubating them with 2 μg/ml of either rabbit anti-uPAR or rabbit anti-PAI-1 IgG in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 45 min at 37 °C. Biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, streptavidin AP, and a chromogenic substrate were added, and the concentration of bound protein was determined kinetically by monitoring the change in color at 405 nm (milli optical density per min; mOD/min). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a constant flow rate (10 μl/min) of running buffer. Briefly, denatured VN or VN variants were immobilized on the sensor chip using the amine coupling method as described by the manufacturer, and then various concentrations of uPAR plus uPA, or PAI-1 alone, were injected. Thus, in these experiments, the VN concentrations were constant and the concentrations of uPAR and PAI-1 were varied. This experimental set-up minimizes the influence of differences in the percent of properly folded VN, on the calculation of binding constants. The association, dissociation, and regeneration phases were followed in real-time by monitoring the change in signal expressed in resonance units (RU). Sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation Software, version 3.0. Kinetic constants were obtained from the association and dissociation curves generated from different concentrations of analyte by using the 1:1 binding model (A + B = AB) available in the software. This model gave a single-site binding of one analyte to the immobilized ligand. Comparison fitting with a more complex binding model did not give a better interpretation of the data. Between experiments, the chips were regenerated as recommended by the manufacturer by washing with regeneration buffer (0.1 mHCl). This treatment does not alter the binding properties of the VN-coated biosensor chip (31Ehnebom J. Björquist P. Sigurdardottir O. Deinum J. Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 2000; 14: 47-57Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In some experiments, denatured VN was immobilized on the sensor chip and then a preincubated mixture containing increasing concentrations of native or denatured VN (0–4 μm) with either uPAR containing uPA (1 μmeach) or PAI-1 (50 nm) was injected. The preincubation time for VN with uPAR plus uPA was 30 min at room temperature, whereas that for VN with PAI-1 was 10 min at room temperature. The amount of bound uPAR or PAI-1 was quantified by monitoring binding rates (RU/s). In other experiments, denatured VN was immobilized on the sensor chip and then uPAR plus uPA (0.5 μm each) or PAI-1 (0.25 μm) were injected, followed by the immediate injection of increasing concentrations of mAbs (0−4 μm) by using the coinjection mode. The amount of bound uPAR or PAI-1 was quantified by monitoring changes in RU. Wells were first coated with denatured VN (0.5 μg/ml) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Excess sites were blocked by incubating the wells with 5% BSA in TBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed and preincubated with increasing concentrations of heparin or plasminogen (0 μg/ml−10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. After this incubation, a 0.05 volume of uPAR plus uPA (500 nm each) containing 1 μm aprotinin, or of PAI-1 (10 nm), was added to the wells and the plates were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the wells were incubated with 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-uPAR or anti-PAI-1 IgG in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed, and bound antigens were detected as described above by monitoring the change in color at 405 nm. Acid hydrolysis of VN was performed as described previously (9Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified denatured 65-kDa VN (2 mg) was incubated with 70% formic acid for 24 h at 37 °C. The resultant sample was diluted 1:10 with distilled water and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA and 8 m urea, and applied to a heparin-agarose column (heparin-agarose type II-S (Sigma); bed volume, 2 ml) to remove intact VN and heparin-binding fragments of VN. The unbound material was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, HiLoad 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences AB); bed volume, 120 ml) for the further purification of the 40-kDa VN fragment (VN 1–217). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the VN fragments was determined by the microsequencing core at Scripps Research Institute after the reaction samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The effect of acid treatment on the ligand binding properties of VN was determined by adding 2 μl of 10 n HCl to 18 μl (320 μg/ml) of the 40-kDa VN fragment (VN 1–217). The VN samples were incubated for 0–4 min at 85 °C and then immediately neutralized by adding 21.2 μl of 1m Tris. The samples were diluted with PBS to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and then coated onto the wells by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Excess sites were blocked by incubating the wells with 5% BSA in TBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then washed and incubated with either uPAR plus uPA (5 μg/ml each), with PAI-1 (1 μg/ml), or with mAbs (153, 8E6, 1244, and 1330: 2 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the wells were incubated sequentially in biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, streptavidin AP, and finally the chromogenic substrate. Bound antigens were revealed as described above by monitoring the change in color at 405 nm. SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels (12%) according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analysis, proteins in the gels were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Excess sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation with 3.5% casein in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing once with TBS, the membranes were probed with 2 μg/ml mAb 8E6 in 3.5% casein in TBS by incubation overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:2500 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG in TBS containing 3.5% casein. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences AB). Synthesis of sulfated VN peptides (VN 48–68) was conducted by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (40Kitagawa K. Aida X. Fujiwara H. Yagami T. Futaki S. Kogire M. Ida J. Inoue K. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The peptide chain was constructed on a Fmoc-Ala-2-chlorotrityl resin using a Shimadzu PSSM-8 peptide synthesizer. Fmoc-Tyr(SO3Na) was used for the introduction of Tyr(SO3H) residues. The protected peptide resin was then treated with a mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol/dichloromethane (1:4 v/v) for 30 min at 25 °C and filtered. The filtrate was condensed, and dry ether was added. The precipitate thus obtained was then treated with 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at 0 °C for 8 h. The resulting sulfated peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and the fidelity of the products was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Synthetic peptides diluted in PBS (62.5–1000 ng) in 2 μl were spotted onto PVDF membranes. Excess sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 3.5% casein in TBS. After washing once with TBS, the membranes were probed with 10 μg/ml mAb 8E6 in 3.5% casein in TBS by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were probed a second time by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in a 1:2500 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG in 3.5% casein in TBS. Immunoreactive peptides were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences AB). Cell adhesion assays were performed as previously described (19Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) using the human histiocytic lymphoma-derived cell line U937 (ATCC CRL 1593) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Briefly, microtiter wells (0.32 cm2; 96 wells/plate) were coated overnight at 4 °C with denatured VN (1 μg/well). The wells were then blocked by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 7.5% BSA and washed twice with RPMI containing 0.02% BSA (RPMI/BSA). RPMI/BSA medium (100 μl) was added to the wells with or without PAI-1 (40 μg/ml) or various mAbs (40 μg/ml). The wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with the RPMI/BSA solution. After the U937 cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were added, the microtiter plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, then agitated twice for 1 min (Molecular Devices Vmax plate reader), and gently washed with RPMI/BSA. The number of remaining adherent cells was determined by crystal violet staining as follows. The medium was first removed from the wells, and then the cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with crystal violet, washed extensively with water, and extracted into 10% acetic acid. The amount of stain in the extract was quantified by absorbance at 590 nm. Intact human VN is 459 amino acids long and is composed of distinct domains (Fig.1). Experiments were performed to evaluate the role of two of these domains (i.e. the SMB and HB domains), in uPAR binding to VN. In these experiments, we directly compared the ability of uPAR, PAI-1, plasminogen, and heparin to bind to VN fragments lacking either the SMB domain or the HB domain (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, heparin (panel A) and plasminogen (panel B) bound to denatured VN and to VN variants containing the HB domain, but did not bind to VN variants lacking this domain. Importantly, the magnitude of binding of these molecules to rVN 40–459 was similar to that for their binding to denatured VN. Thus, the majority of the recombinant VN 40–459 molecules in this preparation appear to be properly folded and functionally active. Despite this, neither uPAR (panel C) nor PAI-1 (panel D) bound significantly to VN fragments containing this functional HB site if a functional SMB domain also was lacking (i.e. the Y28A mutant or mutants lacking the SMB domain). They bound only to intact VN and to VN fragments containing the SMB domain. Thus, the HB domain does not appear to be required for the binding of uPAR and PAI-1 to VN, whereas the SMB domain is necessary and sufficient for these interactions. These conclusions are supported by the data summarized in Fig.3. In these experiments, the effect of increasing concentrations of heparin or plasminogen on the binding of uPAR (Fig. 3 A) and PAI-1 (Fig. 3 B) to denatured VN was assessed. As shown, high concentrations of heparin and plasminogen had no effect on the binding of uPAR or PAI-1 to denatured VN. These results are again consistent with the conclusion that the binding of uPAR and PAI-1 to denatured VN does not invol"
https://openalex.org/W2037851184,"We have shown in a previous study that desensitization and internalization of the human dopamine D1 receptor following short-term agonist exposure are mediated by temporally and biochemically distinct mechanisms. In the present study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to remove potential phosphorylation sites in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl tail of the dopamine D1 receptor to study these processes. Mutant D1 receptors were stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, and kinetic parameters were measured. Mutations of Ser/Thr residues to alanine in the carboxyl tail demonstrated that the single substitution of Thr-360 abolished agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor. Isolated mutation of the adjacent glutamic acid Glu-359 also abolished agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptor. These data suggest that Thr-360 in conjunction with Glu-359 may comprise a motif necessary for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and desensitization. Agonist-induced internalization was not affected with mutation of either the Thr-360 or the Glu-359 residues. However, receptors with Ser/Thr residues mutated in the distal carboxyl tail (Thr-446, Thr-439, and Ser-431) failed to internalize in response to agonist activation, but were able to desensitize normally. These results indicate that agonist-induced desensitization and internalization are regulated by separate and distinct serine and threonine residues within the carboxyl tail of the human dopamine D1 receptor.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase protein kinase A cytomegalovirus Chinese hamster ovary Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium hemagglutinin Dopamine D1 receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs1) and mediate their physiological response by coupling with stimulatory G proteins, which in turn activate adenylyl cyclase and increase levels of intracellular cAMP (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar).

In the rat dopamine D1 receptor, a single consensus PKA site in the third intracellular loop (encompassing Thr-268) was shown to be responsible for agonist-induced homologous desensitization (15Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that the human dopamine D1 receptor treated with specific PKA inhibitors desensitized normally, whereas co-expression of GRKs 2, 3, and 5 enhanced receptor desensitization (16Lewis M.M.

Stimulation of cAMP in opossum kidney cells that endogenously express the dopamine D1 receptor has been shown to be essential for internalization (20Bates M.D. Olsen C.L. Becker B.N. Albers F.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14757-14763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, a recent study with substitution mutations of all four PKA sites in the rat dopamine D1receptor demonstrated that internalization was unaffected (15Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization has also been associated with several other motifs in GPCRs, such as a dileucine sequence (21Gabilondo A.M.

In many receptors, serine and threonine residues have been shown to have a role in internalization (23Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

In view of the variable regulation of GPCR internalization reported, we were interested in determining the residues mediating desensitization and internalization in the human dopamine D1 receptor.In the present study, we have identified a single threonine and a neighboring acidic residue that are critical for rapid agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of the human dopamine D1 receptor. Furthermore, we have also identified a region containing one serine and two threonine residues in the distal carboxyl tail that is required for internalization of the human dopamine D1 receptor.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that rapid agonist-induced desensitization and phosphorylation of the human dopamine D1 receptor is critically dependent on Thr-360 and the preceding Glu-359 in the proximal segment of the carboxyl tail. Mutation of either Glu-359 or Thr-360 prevented agonist-induced phosphorylation, indicating that Thr-360 is the primary site or has a dominant role as the initiation site of agonist-induced phosphorylation. The motif we identified (consisting of Glu-359 and Thr-360), in which the threonine is flanked on its amino-terminal side by the acidic amino acid, defines a site of GRK2 recognition and phosphorylation (19Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because basal levels of phosphorylation of the D1 receptors mutated at Glu-359 or Thr-360 was also reduced, this indicates that these residues have a role in maintaining the basal level of agonist-independent phosphorylation. In addition, we have identified a cluster of residues consisting of two threonines and one serine in the distal portion of the carboxyl tail, Thr-446, Thr-439, and Ser-431, that is responsible for rapid agonist-induced internalization. Furthermore, we have shown that, in the human dopamine D1 receptor, desensitization and internalization are biochemically distinct mechanisms, because the residues that were involved in abolishing desensitization or internalization did not have a reciprocal effect on the other process.The sequence in the dopamine D1 receptor that includes the putative GRK2 recognition motif, is shown in Fig.7 in comparison with analogous sequences in the dopamine D5, the β2-adrenergic and the adenosine A3 receptors. Although no definitive consensus sequences have been identified for the various GRKs, both GRK1 and GRK2 are known as acidotropic kinases, because they most actively phosphorylate serines and threonines in close proximity to acidic amino acids (19Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). GRK2 has been shown to preferentially phosphorylate serines and threonines with acidic amino acids on the amino-terminal side. In contrast, GRK1 recognizes serines and threonines with acidic residues localized to the carboxyl-terminal side (19Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Zhao X. Palczewski K. Ohguro H. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GRK5 and GRK6, which preferentially act at serine residues with neighboring basic amino acids on the amino-terminal side (39Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are not likely to act at Thr-360, because there are no adjacent basic residues. Therefore, we propose that the effect of ablation of either Thr-360 or the adjacent Glu-359 resulting in loss of desensitization and agonist-induced phosphorylation indicates that GRK2 may be the critical regulator of rapid agonist-induced desensitization and phosphorylation in the human dopamine D1 receptor.The β2-adrenergic and the dopamine D1receptors share significant homology, including similarly sized carboxyl tails, and each receptor activates stimulatory G proteins and undergoes GRK-mediated homologous desensitization. Studies using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to inhibit GRK2 synthesis (41Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and specific antibodies to inhibit GRK2 availability (42Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) indicate that this kinase may be involved in the homologous desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor. The substantial increase in the extent of dopamine D1 receptor phosphorylation following overexpression of GRK2 has suggested a role for GRK2 in regulation of dopamine D1 receptor desensitization (17Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3771-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that the Ser/Thr residues that are subject to GRK2 phosphorylation would be situated in similar regions of the β2-adrenergic and the dopamine D1 receptors because of the structural similarities of the two receptors. Recently, it has been shown in the β2-adrenergic receptor that, although Ser-364, together with Glu-362, might meet the criteria for a putative GRK2 recognition site, mutagenesis of Ser-364 was shown to have no effect on desensitization (14Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mutation of the two serines, at positions 355 and 356, however, did eliminate desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (14Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Even though there is no acidic residue directly amino-terminal to these residues, the presence of a PKA site located on the amino-terminal side of Ser-355, when phosphorylated, may modify the charge distribution in the proximal carboxyl tail and, therefore, may have an additional effect to modulate GRK2-mediated desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor mediated through Ser-355 and Ser-366. As can be seen in Fig.7, the putative GRK2 recognition motif present in the dopamine D1 receptor also differs from that identified in the rat adenosine A3 receptor, which contains two threonine residues at positions 318 and 319 in the carboxyl tail (43Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).GPCRs may have GRK2 motifs located toward the distal or proximal regions of the carboxyl tails, or the third intracellular loop (8Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, there is considerable variability between both the location of GRK2 recognition motifs within GPCRs and the sequences that comprise GRK motifs in a given receptor. The sites of GRK phosphorylation of rhodopsin (37Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the μ opioid (44Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the δ opioid (45Guo J. Wu Y. Zhang W. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) receptors are located in the distal carboxyl tails. In addition to being located more proximally, the putative GRK2 recognition site of the dopamine D1 receptor required only the presence of Glu-359 or Thr-360. The serine at position 362 does not appear to participate as a primary site of GRK action in the dopamine D1 receptor desensitization motif, because when Thr-360 was mutated, Ser-362 was not able to substitute and was found not to have a primary role in receptor desensitization.The mechanism and putative motifs mediating internalization are variable, however, mutagenesis studies have suggested a role for carboxyl tail serine and threonine residues in internalization (23Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Biol.

In this study we determined that three residues in the distal portion of the carboxyl tail (Thr-446, Thr-439, and Ser-431) were involved in internalization of the D1 receptor. Earlier studies of the D1 receptor in opossum kidney cells that endogenously express the dopamine D1 receptor identified a role for PKA-mediated internalization (20Bates M.D. Olsen C.L. Becker B.N. Albers F.J. Middleton J.P. Mulheron J.G. Jin S.L. Conti M. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14757-14763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis of the PKA sites of the rat dopamine D1 receptor (15Jiang D. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 675-683PubMed Google Scholar), and of the human receptor in the present study, had no effect on internalization. The residues involved in internalization, however, appeared to have no role in rapid agonist-induced desensitization of the D1receptor. The dissociated regulation of internalization and desensitization is not uncommon among GPCRs, although in some receptors, such as the μ and δ opioid receptors, the same residues are responsible for regulation of both processes (27Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. Wang J.B. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27610-27616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Hasbi A. Allouche S. Sichel F. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Landemore G. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 237-247PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have identified residues responsible for desensitization, which have no role in internalization, such as for the α1-adrenergic (46Wang J. Wang L. Zheng J. Anderson J.L. Toews M.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the N-formyl peptide (23Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the CB1 cannabinoid (47Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the m2 muscarinic receptors (48Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This has recently been reinforced in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor for which a carboxyl tail dileucine motif (21Gabilondo A.M. Hegler J. Krasel C. Boivin-Jahns V. Hein L. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12285-12290Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and an NPXXY motif found near the cytoplasmic portion of the seventh transmembrane domain, have both been implicated in its internalization (22Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the cluster of Ser/Thr residues responsible for N-formyl peptide receptor desensitization (23Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the two serines responsible for CB1 cannabinoid receptor desensitization (47Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have no effect on internalization. Studies of the m2 muscarinic receptor, however, identified two third intracellular loop clusters of Ser/Thr residues, either of which mediated internalization whereas only one was necessary for desensitization (48Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14152-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In summary, we have identified two separate and distinct sites in the carboxyl tail of the human dopamine D1 receptor consisting of specific serine and threonine residues that mediate desensitization and phosphorylation or internalization of the receptor. We provide evidence that a GRK2 recognition motif may be a critical regulator of rapid agonist-induced desensitization of the human dopamine D1 receptor. Dopamine D1 receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs1) and mediate their physiological response by coupling with stimulatory G proteins, which in turn activate adenylyl cyclase and increase levels of intracellular cAMP (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Desensitization of GPCRs is defined as a loss of responsiveness to agonist treatment following prolonged agonist exposure (2Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In the dopamine D1 receptor, we have shown that following short-term agonist exposure, desensitization and internalization were differentially regulated, both biochemically and temporally (4Ng G.Y. Trogadis J. Stevens J. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10157-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rapid desensitization results from receptor uncoupling from G protein following phosphorylation of intracellular domains of the receptor and subsequent internalization of receptor from the cell surface (5Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and second messenger-dependent kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), are serine/threonine kinases that function to uncouple the receptor from G protein (5Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 6Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GRKs additionally promote the interaction of the receptor with arrestin proteins, which recruit the receptors to clathrin-coated pits for subsequent internalization (9Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor is closely related structurally and functionally to the dopamine D1 receptor, and the definition of the precise sites mediating desensitization occurred in a stepwise manner. Initial studies identified a region of the β2-adrenergic receptor carboxyl tail that was involved in agonist-induced desensitization (10Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and a recent study narrowed this region to the proximal portion of the carboxyl tail of the receptor and identified three serine residues essential for regulating desensitization (14Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Agonist activation of GPCRs may result in phosphorylation of many serines and threonines that are not necessarily directly involved in the process of desensitization. Therefore, functional desensitization studies in conjunction with the direct demonstration of phosphorylation are necessary to determine the specific residues essential for desensitization (12Seibold A.

We discuss a model whereby the RseB-RseA interaction represents a measure for misfolded polypeptides in the bacterial envelope, modulating the assembly of ςE RNA polymerase and the cellular heat shock response. core polymerase sigma E transcription factor holoenzyme complexed to sigma E regulator of ςE a variant of RseA with a six-histidine tag appended at the C terminus a variant of ςE with a six-histidine tag appended at the N terminus maltose binding protein mutant allele of maltose binding protein PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Folding and assembly of proteins in the bacterial envelope requires mechanisms and factors that are distinct from those of the cytoplasmic heat shock chaperones GroEL/GroES and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (1Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Protein misfolding in the cytoplasm is sensed directly by the general heat shock transcription factor ς32 (RpoH) (2Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast, two independent pathways have evolved to sense the presence of misfolded polypeptides in the periplasm and in the outer membrane ofEscherichia coli (3Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The CpxRA system comprises a two-component signal transduction system. It appears that the histidine kinase CpxA senses the presence of misfolded polypeptides in the periplasm, resulting in autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to the aspartyl of the cytoplasmic CpxR response regulator. CpxR then activates the transcription of various genes that act on the bacterial envelope (3Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The second pathway requires ςE,1 a sigma factor that associates with core RNA polymerase to generate the transcriptionally active α2ββ′·ςE(E·ςE) complex (4Mecsas J. Rouvière P.E. Erickson J.W.

Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Rouvière P. De Las Peñas A. Mecsas J. Lu C.Z. Rudd K.E. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Similar to ς32 regulation, this modest increase in transcriptional activation is presumably due to the high level of basal expression of ςE-dependent promoters, because folding catalysts in the bacterial envelope are required at all times, even prior to the exposure to extreme stress. Consistent with this view is the observation that rpoE, the structural gene for ςE, is essential for the growth of E. coliunder all conditions (8De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6862-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of ςE RNA polymerase is controlled by rseA and rseB(regulator of sigma E), two genes that are encoded within the ςE operon rpoErseABC (9De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Deletion ofrseA leads to a 9-fold increase in transcription of ςE-dependent promoters, whereas deletion ofrseB results in a 2-fold stimulation (9De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). RseA is inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane via a single transmembrane segment, positioning the N-terminal domain in the cytoplasm and the C-terminal domain in the bacterial periplasm. Co-immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography experiments revealed the existence of interactions between ςE and RseA and between RseA and RseB. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of RseA alone is sufficient to bind ςE and to prevent transcription of ςE RNA polymerase (9De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), presumably by sequestering the sigma factor from RNA polymerase. Gross and co-workers (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) showed that, under conditions of extreme stress, i.e.when misfolded outer membrane proteins accumulate in the bacterial periplasm, RseA may be rapidly degraded, leading to transcriptional activation at ςE-dependent promoters. Proteolysis of RseA appears to require DegS (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). DegS is a putative periplasmic protease anchored to the inner membrane (12Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although these results provide an explanation for the regulation of ςE RNA polymerase by controlling the stability of the RseA anti-sigma factor, this model does not account for the formation of ςE·RseA·RseB complexes. We report here the intracellular concentration of ςE:RseA:RseB, revealing a ratio of 2:5:1. When examined under heat shock, this ratio appeared largely unaltered, and we observed only a modest increase in RseA degradation. Affinity purification experiments revealed the presence of ςE·RNA polymerase, ςE·RseA, and ςE·RseA·RseB complexes. RseA binding to RseB increased the affinity of the anti-sigma factor for ςE. Furthermore, RseA·RseB binding sequesters ςE in the membrane, preventing the association of the sigma factor with core RNA polymerase. We discuss a model whereby the binding of RseB to the C-terminal domain of RseA modulates its affinity for ςEand the activity of ςE RNA polymerase. Strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I. Sequences of primers used in this study can be obtained from the authors upon request. Cells were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium (13Miller J.H.

Induction of RseAHis6 and His6ςE was accomplished by addition of arabinose (0.2%) to cultures of E. coli BC1Δ(rseArseB) harboring pBC3 or pDM2232.

The rseA gene was amplified from the chromosome using primers RseA-3 and RseA-6, introducing a 5′-NcoI site immediately preceding the start codon and a 3′-insertion of six histidine codons followed by a stop codon and aBamHI site. rseAHis6 was cloned into pBAD-A (Invitrogen) cut with NcoI and BamHI, yielding pBC3. Plasmid pDM2232 encodes His6ςEwith a six-histidine tag appended at the N terminus of RpoE.rpoE was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the chromosome using primers RpoE-1 and RseA-5, introducing a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-EcoRI site, respectively. This polymerase chain reaction product was cloned in vector pBAD-B (Invitrogen) using the BglII and EcoRI restriction sites. Purified His6ςE was cleaved with enterokinase to remove the N-terminal His tag. E. coli MC4100 or LMG190 were grown at 30 °C or 43 °C toA 595 nm 0.6. Culture aliquots were removed and plated on agar medium to count the number of colony forming units per milliliter. Cells of 200-ml culture were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with 0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5. Cells were suspended in 20 ml of the same buffer and lysed in a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The cell lysate was extracted by the addition of octylglucoside to 2% (v/v), and insoluble components were removed using an Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a colorimetric assay. For analysis on 12% SDS-PAGE, samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min and separated by gel electrophoresis. Proteins were revealed by immunoblotting with α-ςE, α-RseA, or α-RseB antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with 12 μCi of [125I]protein A per blot, and radioactive signals were quantified by PhosphorImager scanning. Each immunoblot was calibrated with a dilution series of known concentrations of ςE, RseA, or RseB. For fractionation experiments, cells of 50-ml culture were harvested as described above and suspended in 10 mm HEPES, 66 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgOAc, pH 7.6. After lysis in a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i., samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble proteins) and sediment (membrane proteins) were separated and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. E. coli MC4100 was grown at 30 °C to A 595 nm 0.7 in M9 minimal media lacking methionine and cysteine. Cells were pulse-labeled for 1 min with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express S35 protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Incorporation of radioactive amino acids was quenched by the addition of excess unlabeled amino acids (per milliliter of culture; 100 μl of 10% casamino acids, 2% methionine, and 2% cysteine). The stress response was initiated by shifting the temperature from 30 to 43 °C. Two kinds of experiments were conducted. Cultures were labeled at 30 °C for 1 min and quenched. Immediately after the addition of the quench (chase), cultures were divided into two equal aliquots. One sample was incubated at 30 °C, whereas the other was placed at 43 °C. During the other experiment, cultures were divided into two equal aliquots prior to labeling. One culture was incubated at 30 °C, labeled for 1 min, and quenched. Another culture aliquot was incubated at 43 °C, labeled for 1 min, and quenched. Labeled cultures were incubated for various amounts of time, and a 100-μl sample was withdrawn and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were washed in acetone, suspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 7.0, by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove any insoluble material. A 5-μl aliquot was removed and analyzed in a scintillation counter to account for the total amount of labeled protein. After adjusting for equal counts, aliquots were subjected to immunoprecipitation and samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Protein half-lives were determined by analyzing data with the exponential decay equation I t =I 0 × e −kt, whereI 0 and I t represent the intensity of the radioactive proteins at time 0 min and timet after beginning of chase. Experiments were conducted in triplicate each time. To determine whether temperature shift to 43 °C induced the ςE regulon, we examined the synthesis rate of β-galactosidase driven either by therpoHP3 or the htrL promoters (known ςE- and ς70-dependent promoters, respectively), as described by Nagai et al. (14Nagai H. Yuzawa H. Kanemori M. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10280-10284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the anti-β-galactosidase antibody from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). RseAHis6and protein complexes containing RseAHis6were purified from cell extracts of E. coli BC1 (pBC3), a Δ(rseArseB) derivative of strain LMG194. Cells of 8-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × gfor 10 min, suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and lysed in a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, and 2% octylglucoside was added to the supernatant. The detergent extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to chromatography on 1 ml of Ni-NTA (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Resin was washed with buffer A supplemented with 10 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted with buffer A and 0.5 m imidazole. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed either by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblot analysis using α-RseA and α-ςE rabbit serum. Purification of His6ςE and protein complexes containing His6ςE occurred from extracts of E. coli BC1 (pDM2232) and followed the same protocol. To obtain pure RseAHis6, Ni-NTA resin was precharged with extracts of E. coli BC1(pBC3) and washed with buffer A. Proteins bound to Ni-NTA were treated with two column volumes of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% octylglucoside, 10 mm imidazole, 4m urea, pH 8.0) and washed with 100 column volumes of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% octylglucoside, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Treatment with 4 m urea was observed to release proteins interacting with RseAHis6, yielding a 95% pure preparation of RseAHis6. Isolation of pureHis6ςE was achieved by submitting extracts ofE. coli BC1(pDM2232) to affinity chromatography without detergent extraction. Beads containing His6ςEwere incubated with enterokinase to cleave off the six-histidine tag, and enterokinase was removed as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RseB was purified as described previously using plasmid pSR2695 (10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For affinity measurements, a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin was prepared that contained bound RseAHis6 (0.1 pmol of RseA/μl of slurry). RseAHisRseB resin was prepared by incubating RseAHis:Ni-NTA with a 50-fold excess of RseB for 2 h at 20 °C. Beads were washed exhaustively with 20 column volumes of buffer B to remove unbound material. The concentration of bound RseB was found to be equal to the amount of RseAHis present on the beads. Increasing concentrations of ςE (0–300 nm) were added to a 1-ml suspension of either 50 μl of RseAHis:Ni-NTA-Sepharose or 50 μl of RseAHisRseB:Ni-NTA-Sepharose. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (850 μl) was removed, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Sediments were washed with acetone, solubilized in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 7.0, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with α-ςE, α-RseA, or α-RseB antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with 12 μCi of [125I]protein A, and radioactive signals were compared with a dilution series of purified protein with known concentration. E. coli pop6499,i.e. strain MC4100 malT1with a nonpolar deletion of malE, was used as a host for plasmids pHCME and pHCM31, encoding wild-type malE and malE31, respectively (16Betton J. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). E. coli pop6499 (pHCME) and E. coli pop6499 (pHCME31) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and suspensions were normalized to yield similarA 595 nm. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by suspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.7m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mm EDTA, and incubation with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant (periplasmic fraction) was separated from the sediment. The spheroplast sediment was washed and lysed by repeated freeze-thawing under hypo-osmotic conditions. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant (cytoplasm) was separated from the sediment. Pellets were washed twice using 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min prior to centrifugation. Supernatants were removed and the pellets (insoluble fraction containing the MalE31 aggregates) were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All samples were heated at 95 °C for 10 min and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted using α-MalE (New England BioLabs), α-RseA, α-RseB, and α-DsbC antibodies. To measure the cellular concentration of ςE, RseA, and RseB, E. coli was grown under non-heat shock as well as heat shock conditions. Cells were lysed and extracted with 2% octylglucoside, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Soluble proteins in the sample were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antisera. Immunoreactive signals of cell extracts were compared with signals generated by a dilution series of purified protein with known concentration. We measured concentrations of 21 (± 10) fmol of ςE, 50 (± 8) fmol of RseA, and 10 (± 3) fmol of RseB per μg of cellular proteins (numbers in parenthesis represent standard deviations obtained in three independent experiments). Similar ratios (2:5:1) between ςE:RseA:RseB were measured with E. colistrains MC4100 and LMG194. Approximately 80 ςE, 200 RseA, and 40 RseB molecules reside in an E. coli LMG194 cell. Others have recently measured the concentration of ςE and obtained a similar number (approximately 10 molecules of ςE per cell) (15Maeda H. Jishage M. Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under heat shock conditions, the ratio of ςE, RseA, and RseB remained unaltered even though the cellular concentration of these polypeptides was increased by 1.5- to 2-fold. Previous work reported degradation of pulse-labeled RseA under stress conditions (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We examined the stability of RseA by growing E. colicells (MC4100) in minimal medium, pulse-labeling newly synthesized protein with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and inducing stress via temperature shift to 43 °C. At timed intervals before and after heat shock, culture aliquots were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and proteins solubilized in hot SDS. Immunoprecipitated RseA was separated on SDS-PAGE, and radioactive signals were quantified by phosphorimaging (Fig.1 A). Heat shock stress ofE. coli cells caused a decrease in the stability of RseA molecules by 2- to 3-fold, i.e. the t 12of RseA was 30 (± 3) min at 30 °C and 11 (± 3) min at 43 °C. A similar half-life (RseA t 12 11 (± 3) min) was measured when E. coli cultures were incubated for 10 min at 43 °C prior to pulse-labeling. As a control for the induction of the ςE response, heat shock increased the expression of therpoHP3-lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, expression of htrL-lacZ, a gene transcribed by ς70-RNA polymerase, was not affected by the heat shock treatment (Fig. 1 B). No changes in the stability of ςE and RseB were observed when E. coli were grown at 30 °C and 43 °C (data not shown). These data corroborate previous observations that RseA is degraded more rapidly at elevated temperatures (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Using several different genetic backgrounds, Adeset al. (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) observed a more dramatic decrease in RseA stability when cells were shocked via the overexpression of outer membrane protein. This fulminant degradation of RseA appears to be catalyzed by the periplasmic protease DegS and represents a fascinating mechanism of regulation. However, such dramatic changes in RseA concentration are clearly not required for the induction of the ςE regulon under heat shock conditions. RseA binding to ςE prevents RNA polymerase function in vitro, and deletion of rseA leads to a constitutive activation of the ςE-dependent responsein vivo (9De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We wondered how many ςE and RseB molecules were associated with RseA under normal growth conditions. E. coli cells (MC4100) were lysed in a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i., and unbroken cells were removed by slow speed centrifugation. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Soluble periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins were separated with the supernatant from the sediment containing membrane proteins. Proteins in both fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). RseA sedimented with the membranes, whereas DsbC, the periplasmic protein disulfide reductase, remained soluble in the sample supernatant. In contrast, RseB and ςE associated in part with the cytoplasmic membrane, because 27% (± 5) of RseB and 64% (± 4) of ςE were found in the sediment. Membrane association of RseB and ςE absolutely required RseA, because RseB and ςE failed to sediment during the centrifugation of extracts obtained from rseA mutant E. coli cells (BC38). When extracts of rseB mutant E. coli(BC39) were subjected to centrifugation analysis, 36% (± 4) of ςE was found in the membrane, instead of the 64% previously observed in wild-type cells. The reduced membrane association of ςE was not due to a decrease in the number of RseA molecules, because the concentration of RseA in therseB deletion mutant was similar to that of wild-type cells. Thus, although RseB was not essential for the binding of ςE to RseA, association of ςE:RseA appeared to be increased in the presence of RseB, suggesting that RseB binding may affect the affinity of ςE:RseA interactions. To examine the molecular architecture of the ςE·RseA·RseB complex in greater detail, we expressed RseAHis orHisςE in wild-type (LMG194),rseA − (same mutation as BC38 transduced in LMG194) or Δ(rseArseB) (BC1) mutant strains. E. coli cells were lysed in a French pressure cell, and samples were extracted with octylglucoside and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Initial experiments determined the amount of detergent required for solubilization of ςE·RseA·RseB. Addition of 2% octylglucoside solubilized the membrane envelope and prevented sedimentation of RseA at 100,000 × g. These conditions were used for the preparation of all cell extracts that were subjected to affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin and eluted with 0.5m imidazole. The load and eluate fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting to reveal the co-purification of various components (Fig. 3). Expression of RseAHis in wild-type and rseA −mutant E. coli led to the co-purification of ςE and RseB (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, expression of RseAHis in Δ(rseArseB) mutant E. coli did not prevent the co-purification of ςE with RseAHis (Fig. 3 A, right panel). These data support our observation that RseA alone is sufficient to sequester ςE in the membrane compartment. We tested two models for RseA-mediated regulation of ςE RNA polymerase. RseA might capture ςERNA polymerase and arrest the holoenzyme in an inactive state. Alternatively, RseA might sequester ςE, preventing the assembly of α2ββ′·ςE holoenzyme. To distinguish between the two models, affinity-purified RseAHis complexes were probed by immunoblotting with α-RpoA for the presence or absence of the α subunit of RNA polymerase. Expression of RseAHis in wild-type orrseA − mutant E. coli did not lead to the co-purification of RpoA (Fig. 3 A). As a control, affinity chromatography of HisςE resulted in the co-purification of RpoA (Fig. 3 B). This result was expected, because HisςE was able to replace ςE in run-off transcription assays performed in vitro (data not shown) and hence allowed formation of α2ββ′·HisςE polymerase. Together our data indicate that binding of ςE to RseA prevents the association of the sigma factor with RNA polymerase but does not sequester preformed α2ββ′·ςE complexes in the membrane. Co-purification of ςE, RseB, and RseAHis can be explained as the association of ςE with RseA, or association of RseA with RseB, or the formation of ternary ςE·RseA·RseB complexes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressedHisςE in rseA − or Δ(rseArseB) mutant E. coli.HisςE co-purified with RseA and RseB from wild-type cells, however, RseB was not retained on the affinity column when HisςE was analyzed inrseA − cells (Fig. 3 B). Thus, co-purification of ςE·RseA·RseB represents a mixture of binary ςE·RseA and ternary ςE·RseA·RseB complexes. The C-terminal RseB binding domain of RseA is positioned in the bacterial periplasm, whereas the N-terminal ςE binding domain of RseA is located in the cytoplasm. Fusion of the C-terminal domain of RseA to glutathione S-transferase revealed that RseB binding occurred without the N-terminal domain of RseA (data not shown). Presumably, membrane-inserted RseA alternates between two states, unbound (free) RseA and RseA·RseB. We wondered whether RseA and RseA·RseB displayed different affinities for ςE and asked whether the anti-sigma activity of RseA is modulated by the binding to RseB. RseAHis was purified from the crude cellular extracts of E. coli BC1 Δ(rseArseB), and ςE was removed by washing the resin with two column volumes of urea-containing buffer, yielding a 95% pure preparation of RseAHis chelated to Ni-NTA beads. A 50% slurry of resin was dispensed into buffer containing purified ςE, and RseAHis-ςE binding was measured as the amount of ςE that sedimented during slow speed centrifugation. In a second experiment we measured the affinity of ςE for the RseAHis·RseB complex. The results in Fig.4 indicate that RseAHis bound ςE with 2- to 3-fold higher affinity when complexed to RseB. Variations of the values obtained for the dissociation constant were observed for different preparations of RseAHis. However, a 2- to 3-fold difference was reproducibly measured in five independent experiments. Data in Fig. 4 were used to calculate dissociation constants, yielding K d 50 nm for ςE/RseAHis·RseB and 100 nm for the ςE/RseAHisinteraction, respectively. The insert panel of Fig. 4 shows a Scatchard plot analysis of the data, revealing a 1:1 stoichiometry of ςE:RseA in the presence or absence of RseB. Together the data suggest that RseB binding to RseA modulates the affinity of RseA for ςE and the concentration of ςE RNA polymerase (Fig. 2). MalE31 is a mutant maltose binding protein that exhibits the remarkable property of aggregating in the periplasmic space ofE. coli, after the translocation of MalE31 across the cytoplasmic membrane and signal peptide processing of the precursor. Expression of MalE31, but not of wild-type MalE, leads to the induction of ςE RNA polymerase activity at the rpoH3promoter, suggesting that the RseAB signaling device may sense the presence of misfolded (aggregated) MalE31 in the periplasmic space (7Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar,16Betton J. Hofnung M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine whether RseB binds to misfolded polypeptide, we asked whether RseB is sequestered within macromolecular aggregates that formed during overproduction of MalE31. E. coli carrying a knockout mutation of the malE gene was transformed with plasmids that allowed overproduction of either wild-typemalE or malE31, respectively. After EDTA- and lysozyme-mediated spheroplasting of E. coli cells, samples were centrifuged, and the periplasmic contents in the supernatant (lane labeled Per, Fig. 5) were separated from the spheroplast sediment. Spheroplasts were lysed by multiple freeze thawing, and soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation. The remaining pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting (lane labeled Mb, Fig. 5), and their membrane protein contents were solubilized by extraction with Triton X-100 and separated from insoluble aggregates by a final centrifugation step (lanes labeledSol and Ins, respectively, Fig. 5). Wild-type MalE was found soluble in the periplasmic space of fractionatedE. coli cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, the periplasmic aggregates of MalE31 remained insoluble throughout this fractionation procedure and sedimented even after Triton X-100 extraction. As a control, Triton X-100 extraction of such samples resulted in solubilization of RseA. When examined in malE mutantE. coli or in strains overproducing wild-type MalE, RseB was found in the periplasm as well as associated with the fraction containing the membrane proteins. However, overproduction of MalE31 sequestered most RseB molecules within the Triton X-100-insoluble aggregate. We think it is likely that the sequestration of RseB in MalE31 aggregates prevents the association of RseB with RseA, thereby triggering the release of ςE. This hypothesis is also corroborated by the co-purification of RseB and MalE31, but not of RseA or ςE, during sedimentation centrifugation and affinity chromatography (data not shown). Overproduction of MalE31 did not alter the overall concentration of RseA, RseB, or ςE (Fig. 5; and data not shown) consistent with our earlier observations on the stability of these factors under non-heat shock and heat shock conditions (Fig. 2; and data not shown). As a control, periplasmic DsbC was not captured within the aggregates of MalE31. We have examined the role of RseA·RseB in signaling the presence of misfolded polypeptides in the periplasm of E. coli. Our current model predicts that RseA functions as an anti-sigma factor, sequestering ςE from core RNA polymerase (α2ββ′) (Fig. 6). Calculating the amounts of free and sequestered ςE from the dissociation constant and cellular concentrations of ςE and RseA, 99% of the sigma factor should be tethered to RseA. This is clearly not the case as 36% of ςE in wild-type and 64% in rseB mutant cells remained soluble within the bacterial cytoplasm. These soluble ςEmolecules are shown to be associated with RNA polymerase (α2ββ′·ςE) (Fig. 2), and we presume that very little sigma factor exists in an unbound (free) state. Thus, the concentration of soluble sigma factor must be accounted for by the affinity of ςE for RseA, RseA·RseB, as well as RNA polymerase core enzyme (α2ββ′). We assume that ςE displays greater affinity for RNA polymerase (α2ββ′) than for RseA. Overproduction of RseA should shift the physiological balance toward the sequestration of ςE, preventing the formation of α2ββ′·ςE RNA polymerase. This prediction is fulfilled as increased expression of RseA, similar to a reduction of ςE expression, is toxic for E. coli cells, causing the rapid accumulation of suppressor mutations. To alter the availability of ςE for core RNA polymerase under stress conditions, cells could either modify the affinity of the RseA-sigma factor interaction or reduce the relative concentration of the anti-sigma factor without altering that of ςE or RNA polymerase. In fact, both mechanisms appear to exist. Ades et al. (11Ades S.E. Conolly L.E. Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) reported specific, rapid degradation of all RseA molecules by the DegS protease in response to overproduction of outer membrane proteins. Due to its location in the periplasm, the DegS protease likely cuts the C-terminal portion of RseA, without affecting the N-terminal domain. DegS-initiated degradation is presumably completed by other proteases that cleave the N-terminal sigma factor binding domain of RseA. It appears that the massive degradation of RseA represents a state of extreme stress, because we did not observe massive RseA degradation when E. coli cells were exposed to heat shock or overproduction of MalE31. Under these conditions, the overall concentration of ςE, RseA, and RseB was unaltered even though transcription from α2ββ′·ςE RNA polymerase-dependent promoters was increased by about 3- to 4-fold, respectively. Our data suggest that the association and disassociation of RseB with the C-terminal domain of RseA modulates the affinity of the anti-sigma factor complex for ςE (Fig.6). We propose further that RseB binding to misfolded polypeptide affects its ability to interact with the C-terminal domain of RseA, thereby reducing the affinity of the anti-sigma factor and allowing for the association of ςE with core RNA polymerase. If so, one could view RseA·RseB complexes as representing a switch with an affinity for ςE that is equal or slightly above that of the sigma factor for RNA polymerase. Dissociation of RseB from the ternary ςE·RseA·RseB complex may flip the switch and promote release of the sigma factor from RseA. In this manner, the ςE·RseA·RseB complex may respond rapidly and reversibly to changes in the cellular environment that affect the folding of polypeptides in the bacterial envelope. Regulatory mechanisms that provide for a cellular response to environmental stress are conserved in other microorganisms. ςE belongs to a family of sigma factors, members of which regulate extra-cytoplasmic functions and are referred to as extra-cytoplasmic factors (18Lonetto M.

The fractions corresponding to a major protein peak were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 24 h at 4 °C and then stored at −20 °C. The labeling of cell membranes by PED6 was performed as described previously (13Farber S.A. Olson E.S. Clark J.D. Halpern M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19338-19346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A mixture of POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED6 (107:31:20:1 in molar ratio, 300 nmol total) in chloroform was dried under N2 and resuspended in ethanol (10 μl), followed by the addition of DMEM (10 μl). The solution was dried again under N2 until the volume was reduced to ∼7 μl to ensure that most of ethanol was evaporated. Additional 10 μl of DMEM was added to the mixture and vesicles were prepared by sonication of the mixture on ice (20 min). HEK293 cells (3–5 × 104 cells) were seeded into each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeK IITM chambered cover glass filled with the DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml ZeocinTM, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. The vesicle solution (10 μl) was then added to each of eight wells and incubated with HEK293 cells for 25–50 min at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) five times, resuspended in 300 μl of DMEM media, and 150 nm (or higher) sPLA2 and 2 mmCaCl2 (final concentration) were added. Imaging was done with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate the background autofluorescence. The signal from the Texas RedTM attached to W79C was observed directly upon excitation with a 568-nm argon/krypton laser and a 650-nm line pass filter whereas the BODIPYTM signal from the hydrolyzed PED6 was visualized with a 488-nm argon/krypton laser and a 530-nm band pass filter. A ×63 (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Using these tools, regions of interest in the cytosol and the membranes were defined, and the average fluorescence intensity in a square (1 mm × 1 mm) was obtained as a function of time. To label HEK293 cell membranes with DiIC12, each of 1 μl of dye solution in ethanol (2 mg/ml) was added rapidly to 400 μl of HEK293 cells that were cultured for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml ZeocinTM in each of eight wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeK IITMchambered cover glass. Unbound dye was removed by washing four times with PBS. Washed HEK293 cells were imaged in 400 μl of DMEM without phenol red. The preparation was placed on the stage of a Zeiss Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with a 570-nm line pass filter and a 543-nm He/Ne laser. 150 nm sPLA2and 2 mm CaCl2 (final concentration) were added and the imaging was performed as described above. HEK293 cells were plated onto a sterile cover glass and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The stable HEK293 cell line expressing 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) was generated by transfecting the cells with pcDNA3.1-human 5-LO plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), followed by selection of clones in the presence of geneticin (800 μg/ml) for 3–4 weeks. The cells were treated with 150 nm (final concentration) of hVPLA2 in DMEM for 5, 10, and 30 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. At the given time, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and then were fixed at room temperature with 3.6% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After fixation, the cells were washed six times with PBS and placed in a blocking solution (10% normal goat serum and 100 μm goat IgG in PBS) at room temperature for 3 h. The cells were then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBS, and incubated with the monoclonal antibodies raised against hVPLA2 (2 μg/ml) (14Muñoz N.M.

After 2 h incubation at room temperature, the antibodies were removed, and cells were washed six times with PBS. A secondary antibody, Alexa488 donkey anti-goat antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS containing 2% BSA, was applied for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing and incubation with another secondary antibody, Alexa568 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washing six times with PBS, the slide was mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech Associates, AL). Imaging was done with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. The sPLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of PED6 in the mixed vesicles of POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED-6 (107:31:20:1) was carried out at 37 °C in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl, 0.01 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm Ca2+. The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 520 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation wavelength set at 488 nm. Spectral band width was set at 10 nm for both excitation and emission. Values of specific activity were determined from the initial rates of hydrolysis. The internalization of sPLA2 to mammalian cells has been observed when the cells were treated with exogenously added sPLA2 (7Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R.

To rigorously and systematically determine the requirements for sPLA2 internalization, we selected the exogenous addition method that allows the use of the protein chemically labeled with a fluorescent probe for real-time monitoring. The chemical labeling was preferred to the genetic incorporation of a green fluorescence protein tag because the latter significantly altered either enzymatic activity or HSPG affinity (data not shown). First, we measured the internalization of hVPLA2 (W79A), its mutants (W79A/W31A and W79A/R100E/K101E), and hIIaPLA2 to unstimulated HEK293 cells by Western blotting analysis of cell extracts after sPLA2 treatment. For hVPLA2, the W79A mutant is used in place of wild type because it is fully active and gives a higher yield of refolding than wild type (11Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We previously showed that hVPLA2 (and W79A) has much higher activity on mammalian cells than hIIaPLA2 because of its ability to effectively bind and hydrolyze PC (11Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R.

We also showed that W79A/W31A of hVPLA2 has ∼50 times lower activity on PC membranes than W79A (11Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and that W79A/R100E/K101E has full PC activity but has much reduced affinity for HSPG (7Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, only hVPLA2-W79A showed a significant degree of internalization at 20 min. Even after 60 min, W79A/R100E/K101E and hIIaPLA2 did not show detectable internalization (data not shown). W79A/W31A was internalized at a greatly reduced rate: a faint band appeared at 20 min, which only after 60 min became comparable to that of wild type measured at 20 min (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, when HEK293 cells were treated with W79A/W31A in the presence of Naja naja naja PLA2 that was shown to have high PC activity (15Sumandea M. Das S. Sumandea C. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16290-16297Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), W79A/W31A was internalized as well as wild type (Fig.1 D). The dark 14-kDa band was not due to internalizedN. naja naja PLA2 because our hVPLA2monoclonal antibodies do not cross-react with N. naja najaPLA2 (14Muñoz N.M. Kim K. Han S.-K. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Sano H. Zhu X. Cho W. Leff A.R. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and because N. naja najaPLA2 owing to its extremely low HSPG affinity was not internalized under our experimental conditions. Thus, both HSPG affinity and the ability to hydrolyze the outer plasma membrane (i.e. PC membranes) are required for a sPLA2 to enter unstimulated HEK293 cells. In contrast, W79A, W79A/W31A, and hIIaPLA2 (Fig. 1 F), but not W79A/R100E/K101E, were internalized when HEK293 cells were primed with IL-1β. This indicates that HSPG affinity is both necessary and sufficient for the internalization of sPLA2 into IL-1β-primed HEK293 cells. The internalized sPLA2 remained intact after several hours in HEK293 cells, which is in sharp contrast to the rapid degradation of internalized sPLA2 in neutrophils (7Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L.

Taken together, these results indicate that although HSPG affinity is a critical factor for the internalization of sPLA2 into HEK293 cells, other factors, such as PLA2 hydrolysis products and cytokines, are also necessary for the internalization. Although several reports have suggested that sPLA2s might act intracellularly, whether they are intracellularly localized (16Bingham 3rd, C.O. Fijneman R.J. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10083-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), no direct experimental evidence for the notion has been documented. To determine the correlation between the internalization of sPLA2 and its intracellular lipolytic activities, we treated [3H]AA-labeled human neutrophils and HEK293 cells with W79A and W79A/R100E/K101E and measured the time courses of AA release. As we reported previously (7Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the liberation of AA from human neutrophils by W79A reached a plateau after ∼15 min, whereas the AA release by non-internalizing W79A/R100E/K101E continued to proceed even after 1 h (Fig. 2 A). The saturation of the AA release by W79A is due to its internalization into neutrophils and subsequent degradation (7Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AA release from HEK293 cells by W79A and W79A/R100E/K101E showed similar biphasic patterns and the slower second phases lasted for more than an hour (Fig. 2 B). In view of the different fate of the internalized hVPLA2 in neutrophils and HEK293 cells (i.e. degradation versus retention), these data imply that the second phase of W79A-induced AA release from HEK293 cells is due to the action of internalized enzyme on intracellular membranes. To corroborate the notion that the internalized sPLA2 is active on intracellular membranes and to determine the intracellular location of sPLA2 lipolytic action, we labeled HEK293 cells with a fluorogenic phospholipid, PED6, which has been used for in vivo PLA2 assays (17Hendrickson H.S. Hendrickson E.K. Johnson I.D. Farber S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 276: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,18Farber S.A. Pack M. Ho S.Y. Johnson I.D. Wagner D.S. Dosch R. Mullins M.C.

In this lipid, the fluorescent BODIPYTM moiety in thesn-2 position is quenched by the dinitrophenyl group in the head group, which is relieved when the PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis releases the BODIPYTM-labeled fatty acid. As summarized in Table I, all sPLA2s used in these studies showed relatively high activity on PED6 in the in vitro vesicle assay; however, cPLA2 had less than 0.1% of hVPLA2-W79A activity. Since the BODIPYTM fluorescence in PED6 is not completely quenched, the cellular distribution of intact PDE6 can be monitored if cells were illuminated with a higher laser power. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PDE6 was primarily localized in the plasma membrane within the first 20 min of incubation but more evenly distributed among various cellular membranes after 25 to 50 min of incubation under our experimental conditions.Table IRelative activities of PLA2 on PED6 substrateEnzymeRelative activityhVPLA2W79A1.001-aThe absolute specific activity value for W79A was 20 ± 2 μmol/ min/mg.hVPLA2 W79A/W31A0.25hVPLA2 W79A/R100E/K101E0.70hVPLA2W79C0.95Labeled hVPLA2 W79C0.90hIIaPLA20.54cPLA20.0008Each activity value was determined as an average of triplicate measurements.

We first treated PED6-labeled (unstimulated) HEK293 cells with hIIaPLA2, hVPLA2-W79A, and mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the addition of W79A to the cells resulted in the appearance of BODIPYTM fluorescence, first at the plasma membrane and then intracellularly with a clear annular pattern around the nucleus. The time lapse relative fluorescence intensity profiles of the region of interest clearly show that the signal at the plasma membrane peaks at ∼2 min and the signal at the nuclear envelope reaches the plateau at ∼4 min (Fig. 3 C). The cytoplasmic signal that is much weaker than nuclear envelope signal initially (i.e. <4 min) continued to rise until up to 6 min. Thus, this relatively diffuse cytoplasmic signal seems to reflect the diffusion of the short-chain BODIPY fatty acid from the nuclear membranes.

LPS directly activates the vascular endothelium and elicits an array of EC responses including the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and tissue factor.

The signaling pathway by which LPS activates NF-κB in EC has only recently been elucidated (8Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M.

We have previously elucidated an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway involving FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) that protects human EC from LPS-induced apoptosis (17Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C.

FLIP is a cytoprotective protein that is rapidly degraded by the proteosome. In the absence of new protein synthesis, FLIP levels decrease, resulting in sensitization of human EC to LPS-induced apoptosis. Recently, Tlr-4 has been reported to have a requisite involvement in LPS pro-apoptotic signaling (24Karahashi H. Amano F. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), similar to its role in mediating LPS-induced NF-κB activation. However, the intracellular signaling pathway through which LPS activates apoptosis remains unknown. We, therefore, decided to investigate whether downstream signaling molecules involved in Tlr-4-mediated activation of NF-κB were similarly involved in mediating apoptosis. LPS from Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4 and polymyxin B were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The caspase inhibitor peptide, z-VAD-FMK (zVAD) and the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, were purchased fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem. The human dermal microvascular EC line (developed and generously provided by F. J. Candal and Dr. E. Ades, Centers for Disease Control, and Dr. T. Lawley, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) (25Ades E.W.

Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). High titer retrovirus was prepared from the Phoenix amphotropic packaging cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) transfected with 24 μg of the expression plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation. Recombinant retroviral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and filtered through a Millex-HV 0.45-μm filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). For infection, 4 × 105 EC were seeded/well of a 6-well plate for 24 h to achieve ∼80% confluence. The growth medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of retroviral supernatant supplemented with 32 μg/ml Polybrene and 10 mm HEPES, and the plate was centrifuged for 2 h (1430 × g; 32 °C). The cells were then incubated for 10 h (5% CO2, 37 °C), after which the retroviral supernatant was replaced with normal growth medium. Cells were analyzed and sorted on the basis of EGFP expression using a FACVantage SE cell sorter (Becton Dickinson Corp., Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm vanadate, 50 mm NaF), scraped, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Total protein was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The supernatants were combined with 5× sample buffer (Genomic Solutions Inc., Chelmsford, MA) and boiled for 3 min, and 20 μg of protein/lane were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Novex Inc., San Diego, CA). Protein was subsequently transferred for 1 h at 100 V to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk and then incubated with anti-MyD88 (1.0 μg/ml; Evotech Biologics, Kent, WA), anti-human FADD (0.5 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories Inc., Lexington, KY), anti-AU1 (1.0 μg/ml; Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), or anti-hemagglutinin.11 (1.0 μg/ml; Berkeley Antibody Co.) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (0.13 μg/ml; Transduction Labs), developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A recombinant adenovirus (KZ142) system (gift of Dr. James Kelly, ZymoGenetics Inc., Seattle, WA) was used to transfect cells with a luciferase reporter construct. The adenoviral construct was created as follows. An oligonucleotide encoding a consensus NF-κB binding site, the tandem NF-κB binding sites of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (27Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), two copies of the collagenase AP-1 element, and a single copy of the c-Jun TRE (28Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar) were ligated into a luciferase reporter cassette and then placed in the pACCMV.pLpA adenoviral shuttle vector for construction of recombinant adenovirus as described (29Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W.F. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S.

For transfection of the luciferase reporter construct, ECs were seeded into 96-well black view plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at a density of 50,000 cells/well for 24 h and subsequently incubated for 16 h at a multiplicity of infection of 2000 in RPMI supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. After infection, ECs were exposed to experimental treatment in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was determined using a commercially available assay kit and a TopCount NXT luminescence counter (both from Packard Instrument Co.). ECs were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells/well, cultured for 24 h, and treated, and caspase activity was measured with the homogenous caspases assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plates were analyzed on a Cytofluor Series 4000 fluorescence plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) at 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission, and caspase activity was expressed relative to simultaneous medium control. Because human EC sensitization to LPS- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis is dependent upon the inhibition of new protein synthesis by a mechanism that we have previously characterized (17Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14924-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), treatment with these agents was performed in the presence of 40 μg/ml cycloheximide. The IκBα mutant (IκBαM) and β-galactosidase recombinant adenoviruses were gifts of Dr. C. B. Wilson (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The IκBαM (S32A/S36A) cDNA was generously provided by Drs. J. DiDonato and M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA) (30DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction and purification of IκBαM and control (β-galactosidase) recombinant adenovirus were performed as previously described (20Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J. Li X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28808-28815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For adenoviral transduction, ECs were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well for 24 h, washed once with medium, and incubated for 48 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 with control or IκBαM adenovirus in complete EC medium. ECs were washed once with complete medium and subjected to experimental treatment. A t test or analysis of variance was used to compare the mean responses between a single experimental group or multiple experimental groups, respectively, and the control group. For experiments analyzed by analysis of variance, the Tukey post hoc comparison test was used to determine between which groups significant differences existed. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. As the name implies, LPS is comprised of both a polysaccharide and a lipid moiety. It is well established that the lipid A moiety of LPS is responsible for it pro-inflammatory properties (31Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zahringer U. Di Seydel U. Padova F. Schreier M. Brade H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this portion of LPS alone activates the Tlr-4 receptor, resulting in NF-κB activation and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (32Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPS-induced apoptosis is similarly mediated by lipid A, ECs were exposed to medium or LPS preincubated with or without polymyxin B (Fig. 1). Polymyxin B, derived from the bacterium Bacillus polymyxa, binds and neutralizes the lipid A moiety of LPS (33Cooperstock M.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 6: 422-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Morrison D.C. Jacobs D.M. Immunochemistry. 1976; 13: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for lipid A in cell activation, neutralization with polymyxin B completely inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, polymyxin B was able to completely block LPS-induced apoptosis (Fig.1 B), suggesting that the pro-apoptotic properties of LPS are localized to the lipid A region as well. MyD88, by virtue of its direct recruitment to Tlr-4, is one of the most proximal intracellular signaling molecules involved in LPS-induced activation of NF-κB. MyD88 contains two distinct protein interaction domains, a TIR domain and a DD, which mediate its ability to bind to Tlr-4 and IRAK, respectively (12Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The expression of either domain alone blocks Tlr-4 mediated NF-κB activation in a dominant negative fashion (8Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 12Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). To determine whether MyD88 mediates LPS-induced apoptosis, ECs were stably transfected with cDNA encoding either the TIR domain or the DD. Expression of these two D/N forms of MyD88 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the functional efficacy of these D/N constructs was confirmed by assaying for the ability of each to inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 B). Expression of either the TIR domain or the DD alone inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation by >80%. In experiments conducted in parallel, expression of either MyD88 D/N also inhibited LPS-induced caspase activity, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 2 C). EC expressing either the TIR domain or the DD demonstrated a ≥30% reduction in caspase activity after LPS exposure than EC-expressing vector alone. Similar to LPS, TNF-α is a well described activator of EC NF-κB (35Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Distinct receptor membrane complexes and proximal intracellular signaling molecules mediate LPS- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation; farther downstream, however, the signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation converge at the level of NF-κB-inducing kinase and IκB kinase (36Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of MyD88 in mediating signaling elicited by LPS, but not TNF-α, expression of the MyD88 D/N encoding the DD had no effect on TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Fig.2 C). ECs expressing the MyD88 D/N encoding the TIR domain, however, demonstrated ∼15% less caspase activity after TNF-α exposure than ECs expressing vector alone. Although this decrease in caspase activity was subtle, it was statistically significant. After Tlr-4 activation and MyD88 recruitment, IRAK-1 transiently binds MyD88 and undergoes an autophosphorylation step leading to its activation (12Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Optimal activation of NF-κB by LPS is dependent upon functional IRAK-1 (8Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P.

To determine whether IRAK-1 has a similar involvement in promoting LPS apoptotic signaling, a truncated form of IRAK-1, reported to function as a D/N, was expressed in EC. Consistent with previous reports (12Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 20Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J. Li X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K.

Expression of this IRAK-1 D/N construct blocked >60% of the NF-κB activation elicited by LPS. Similarly, the IRAK-1 D/N was able to abrogate LPS-induced caspase activation by ∼50% (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the IRAK-1 D/N failed to block TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 B). FADD is a pro-apoptotic signaling molecule that couples death receptors to initiator caspases. FADD has been clearly established to mediate apoptosis initiated by several receptors, including those for TNF (37Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Both Tlr-2 and Tlr-4, which recognize bacterial lipoproteins and LPS, respectively, are highly homologous receptors belonging to the larger family of Toll-like receptors (43Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). Although each recognizes distinct ligands, Tlr-2 and Tlr-4 utilize a common intracellular signaling pathway that activates NF-κB. To determine whether FADD is required for LPS-induced apoptosis, ECs were transfected with cDNA encoding a truncated form of FADD that has previously been demonstrated to function in a D/N manner (37Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

ECs expressing the FADD D/N displayed equivalent amounts of caspase activity after LPS stimulation as EC-expressing vector alone (Fig.4 B). Consistent with previous studies (37Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), expression of the FADD D/N construct significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis. To determine whether NF-κB activation is required for LPS-induced apoptosis, ECs were transduced with a gene encoding mutations in the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, that render it resistant to phosphorylation and degradation (20Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J. Li X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of the IκBαM significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation compared with expression of a vector control encoding β-galactosidase (Fig. 5 A). ECs expressing the IκBαM, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of caspase activity after LPS exposure as those ECs expressing vector alone (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether caspase activation contributes to NF-κB signaling, EC were exposed to LPS in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitor, zVAD. At a concentration that could block 100% of the LPS-induced caspase activity (Fig.5 C), zVAD failed to inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 D). Interestingly, zVAD actually enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB activation by ∼40%. We have previously established that LPS induces human EC apoptosis by several different criterion including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, nuclear histone release, and DNA laddering (17Bannerman D.D.

Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify relative changes in apoptosis, we have used a caspase activity assay. Caspases are highly specific effector proteases that are activated during apoptosis and cleave cellular substrates (45Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). The observed increase in caspase activity after LPS exposure is consistent with previous reports that LPS-induced EC apoptosis is mediated, in part, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of key EC substrates (16Bannerman D.D. Sathyamoorthy M. Goldblum S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35371-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we have established that the lipid A moiety of LPS is responsible for its pro-apoptotic signaling properties. Consistent with its role in activation, neutralization of the lipid A moiety of LPS with polymyxin B inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, polymyxin B was able to completely abrogate LPS-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the lipid A portion of the molecule is responsible for its pro-apoptotic signaling properties. It has previously been reported that LPS-induced apoptosis is dependent on Tlr-4 signaling (24Karahashi H. Amano F. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors demonstrate that macrophages derived from C3H/HeJ mice, which have a missense mutation in the third exon of Tlr-4 (46Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar), were resistant to LPS-induced apoptosis. It has further been established that the domain of LPS recognized by Tlr-4 is the lipid A moiety (32Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Together, these data imply that the lipid A moiety confers pro-apoptotic signaling through a Tlr-4-dependent pathway. This is consistent with our finding that neutralization of lipid A completely protects against LPS-induced apoptosis. There has been some controversy in the past regarding whether Tlr-2 or Tlr-4 mediates LPS-induced signaling. The genetic evidence clearly indicates that Tlr-4 is the putative receptor for LPS (46Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). Other studies using overexpression conclude that Tlr-2 recognizes LPS (47Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar,48Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

It was later ascertained that certain commercial preparations of LPS were contaminated with bacterial lipoproteins, the latter of which activate Tlr-2 signaling (49Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In the present report, highly purified LPS, which was phenol-extracted and purified by ion exchange chromatography, was used for all experiments. The finding that polymyxin B completely blocks LPS-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis rules out that the EC responses studied were influenced by contaminating lipoproteins. To investigate whether signaling molecules that link Tlr-4 to NF-κB activation are also involved in mediating LPS-induced apoptosis, D/N versions of MyD88 and IRAK-1 were expressed in EC, and apoptosis was assayed. LPS-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by expression of either one of two MyD88 D/N constructs (Fig.2 C) or an IRAK-1 D/N (Fig. 3 B). These constructs had minimal or no inhibitory effect on TNF-α-induced apoptosis, consistent with previous reports that TNF-α signaling occurs independently of MyD88 and IRAK-1 (50Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12829-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 51Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Expression of a D/N form of FADD, a pro-apoptotic adapter molecule that links death receptors to initiator caspases, failed to block LPS-induced apoptosis (Fig.4 B). In accordance with the well described role of FADD in promoting TNF-α-induced apoptosis (37Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), FADD D/N expression significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced caspase activation. It has previously been reported that both MyD88 and FADD contribute to Tlr-2-induced apoptosis. Because LPS has been shown to initiate apoptosis via Tlr-4 (24Karahashi H. Amano F. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the present data suggest differences in pro-apoptotic signaling between different members of the Tlr family. Similar to Tlr-2, MyD88 promotes Tlr-4-induced apoptosis; in contrast, Tlr-4-induced apoptosis occurs independently of FADD. The MyD88 and IRAK-1 D/N constructs were able to inhibit ≥30 and 50% of the LPS-induced caspase activation, respectively. Expression of the FADD D/N, which has been demonstrated to have a requisite involvement in TNF-α-induced apoptosis (37Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), inhibited ∼50% of the caspase activity elicited by TNF-α. The inability to completely inhibit apoptosis using any of the D/N constructs is not surprising considering endogenously expressed full-length MyD88, IRAK-1, and FADD are still expressed. There is evidence suggesting that Tlr-4 activation of NF-κB can occur through a MyD88- and IRAK-1-independent pathway. First, LPS-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in macrophages derived from either MyD88 or IRAK-1 knockout mice was delayed, but not inhibited, indicating that cellular activation by LPS can occur in the absence of these signaling molecules (15Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4301-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 52Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Second, a MyD88-like protein has been recently described by two independent groups named MyD88-adapter-like protein (MAL) or TIR domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP), which can promote LPS-induced NF-κB signaling through IRAK-2 (53Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A.

Whether MAL/TIRAP and/or IRAK-2 mediate LPS-induced apoptosis remains unknown. The existence of alternative activation pathways, which may also be involved in LPS pro-apoptotic signaling, could explain the lower efficacy of the MyD88 D/N in abrogating LPS-induced caspase activation. Because both MyD88 and IRAK-1 contribute to LPS-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis, we investigated whether these two events were mutually dependent. NF-κB activation has been classically viewed as a cytoprotective event based on its ability to up-regulate anti-apoptotic proteins (55LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 56Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar); however, there are reports that NF-κB signaling has a role in pro-apoptotic signaling as well (57Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 58Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In the present study, inhibition of NF-κB activation had no effect on LPS-induced apoptosis, and inhibition of caspases failed to down-regulate LPS-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that these two responses occur independent of one another (Fig. 5). Interestingly, caspase inhibition augmented LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Recently, the p65 subunit of NF-κB has been identified as a substrate of EC caspases (59Neuzil J. Schroder A. von Hundelshausen P. Zernecke A. Weber T. Gellert N. Weber C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4686-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because zVAD-exposed EC demonstrated 30% less caspase activity than EC exposed to medium alone, it is possible that zVAD prevents the degradation of NF-κB under basal conditions, thus increasing the amount of functional NF-κB in the cell. This may account for the enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB activation in EC pretreated with the caspase inhibitor. In summary, we have identified a pro-apoptotic signaling pathway involved in LPS-induced apoptosis. First, the lipid A moiety of LPS was identified as the portion of the molecule that confers pro-apoptotic signaling. Second, a role for MyD88 and IRAK-1 in mediating LPS-induced apoptosis was established. Third, LPS-induced apoptosis was determined to occur through a FADD-independent pathway. Finally, despite the involvement of MyD88 and IRAK-1 in promoting both LPS-induced NF-κB signaling and apoptosis, these cellular responses were determined to occur independent of one another. We propose that LPS-induced apoptosis is mediated through Tlr-4 and involves the recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK-1. Furthermore, the data presented here suggest that the signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation and apoptosis diverge downstream of IRAK-1."

(1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31804–31810). To elucidate subunit C function, we performed random and site-directed mutagenesis of the yeast VMA5 gene. Site-directed mutations in the most highly conserved region of Vma5p, residues 305–325, decreased catalytic activity of the V-ATPase by up to 48% without affecting assembly. A truncation mutant (K360stop) identified by random mutagenesis suggested a small region near the C terminus of the protein (amino acids 382–388) might be important for subunit stability. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that three aromatic amino acids in this region (Tyr-382, Phe-385, and Tyr-388) in addition to four other conserved aromatic amino acids (Phe-260, Tyr-262, Phe-296, Phe-300) are essential for stable assembly of V1 with V0, although alanine substitutions at these positions support some activityin vivo. Surprisingly, three mutations (F260A, Y262A, and F385A) greatly decrease the stability of the V-ATPase in vitro but increase its k cat for ATP hydrolysis and proton transport by at least 3-fold. The peripheral stalk of V-ATPases must balance the stability essential for productive catalysis with the dynamic instability involved in regulation; these three mutations may perturb that balance.

In all of these locations, V-ATPases act as electrogenic proton pumps, coupling hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport either into membrane-bound compartments or across the plasma membrane to the outside of the cell. V-ATPases consist of a peripheral complex containing the sites of ATP hydrolysis, the V1 sector, attached to an integral membrane complex that forms the proton channel, the V0 sector. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an excellent model system for V-ATPases (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 5Forgac M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Kane P.M. J. Bioenerg.

The yeast V-ATPase is very similar to those of higher eukaryotes both in its overall structure and in the primary sequence of its subunit genes. To date, 13 subunits have been identified in the yeast V-ATPase and shown to have homologues in other organisms. The V1 sector contains eight subunits, designated A-H, which are encoded by the yeast VMA1,VMA2, VMA5, VMA8, VMA4,VMA7, VMA10, and VMA13 genes, respectively. The V0 sector contains five subunits, designated a, c, c′, c"", and d, which are encoded by theVPH1 (or STV1), VMA3,VMA11, VMA16, and VMA6 genes, respectively (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the V-ATPase couples hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton translocation is not fully understood. The F1F0-ATP synthase (F-ATPase) has been proposed as a model for the catalytic mechanism of V-ATPases (4Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). V- and F-ATPases are evolutionarily related, based on sequence similarity in the catalytic and regulatory nucleotide binding and the proteolipid subunits (8Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Structural data for the enzymes also suggest they are related. Electron microscopic analysis of the V-ATPase demonstrates that, similar to the structure of the F-ATPase, the V1sector is attached to the V0 sector through two stalks (9Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14291-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,10Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The F-ATPase stalks are vital in enzyme function; the central (rotor) stalk communicates ATP-dependent conformational changes in the catalytic subunit to the proton pore subunits, and the peripheral (stator) stalk imparts structural stability that is essential for productive rotation of the central stalk (11Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The stalks of the V-ATPases may well play similar functions during catalysis, but regulation of V-ATPases imposes additional demands on structure and function of the stator stalk. V-ATPases rapidly and reversibly disassemble into V1 and V0 sectors in response to changes in growth conditions (13Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and this appears to be a general regulatory mechanism in these enzymes. Thus, although the primary function of the peripheral stalk in F-ATPases appears to be structural stabilization, the peripheral stalk of the V-ATPase must both impart sufficient stability to allow productive rotation and be sufficiently labile to allow rapid disassembly of the V-ATPase. The balance of productively coupling ATP hydrolysis with proton transport and preserving dynamic instability is probably achieved by subunit-subunit interactions in the stator; the need to achieve this balance is an important difference between V- and F-ATPases. The yeast subunit C, Vma5p, is a 42-kDa subunit of the V1sector. Although all V-ATPases contain a subunit C, it has no homolog in any F-ATPase. Subunit C is believed to be a stalk subunit of V-ATPases, and Xu et al. (15Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) assigned it to the peripheral stalk of the bovine clathrin-coated vesicle V-ATPase based primarily on cross-linking of the C and E subunits in fully assembled V1− V0 complexes. Genetic deletion of VMA5 in yeast cells results in a typical Vma− phenotype characterized by inability to grow at elevated pH and elevated calcium concentrations. Vacuolar vesicles isolated from a vma5Δ strain have no V-ATPase activity and poor assembly of V1subunits at the vacuolar membrane (16Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that subunit C is an essential subunit of the V-ATPase. Certain features of the C subunit distinguish it from most other V1 subunits, however. Deletion of the A, B, D, E, F, or G subunits disrupts assembly of the remain V1 subunits to a much greater extent than deletion of the C or H subunits (17Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the C and H subunits could play a role in bridging the V1 and V0 sectors rather than acting as “core” subunits or either sector. Consistent with such a role for Vma5p, Puopolo et al. (20Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that partial proton pumping activity could be restored to clathrin-coated vesicles stripped of V1 by the addition of a V1 fraction lacking the C subunit, but the reconstituted complexes were unstable. In addition, all subunits of the V0 and V1 sectors except subunit C remain assembled with their respective sectors when reversible disassembly of the V-ATPase is induced by glucose deprivation (13Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The C subunit is released from cytosolic V1 sectors upon disassembly and reattached to the V1 and V0 sectors upon reassembly (13Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that subunit C is involved in the unique requirements for regulation of the enzyme and may be important for achieving the balance of stability and instability described above. To better understand the structural and functional roles of the C subunit, we have begun a mutagenesis study of the yeast VMA5 gene. Our studies reveal several distinct mutant classes that implicate subunit C in stabilization of the V-ATPase structure but also suggest that this subunit may not be essential for ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping by the V-ATPase.

The wild type strain referred to throughout the following study is the vma5Δ strain that has been transformed with a CEN plasmid carrying wild-type VMA5, pMH14. pMH14 fully complements the growth phenotypes of a vma5Δ strain (16Ho M.N.

Cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) buffered to pH 5 or fully supplemented minimal media (SD) lacking components used for selection (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.

Mutants were tested for growth on YEPD buffered to pH 7.5 containing 60 mm CaCl2prepared as described (23Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

For comparison of growth rates by serial dilution, cells were grown overnight to log phase in supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil (SD-uracil). Cells were diluted to the indicated density in water and then plated onto the media indicated. VMA5 was randomly mutagenized using a PCR-based protocol. The VMA5 gene was cloned from pMH10, which consisted of VMA5 cloned into pBluescript KS+, using theSpeI and HindIII restriction sites into a version of the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the vectorClaI and XbaI sites had been destroyed to form plasmid pCX5. VMA5 was amplified from pMH10 usingTaq polymerase and T3 and T7 oligonucleotides following the low frequency mutagenesis protocol described by Liu and Kane (25Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pCX5 was digested with EcoRI and ClaI, removing most of the VMA5-coding sequence. The vma5Δ strain was co-transformed with the gapped pCX5 vector and the mutagenized PCR product (23Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SD-uracil plates, then were patched onto YEPD pH 5.0 plates and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. These plates were then replica-plated to YEPD pH 7.5, SD-uracil, and YEPD pH 5.0. Colonies able to grow on SD-uracil and YEPD pH 5.0 but not YEPD pH 7.5 were selected as potential mutants and further characterized. Mutant constructs were produced using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega.

The double mutant Y382A,Y388A was constructed using VMA5containing the Y388A mutation as the template and the Y382A mutagenic oligonucleotide. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the BioResource Center DNA Sequencing Facility, Cornell University. All mutants were subcloned back into the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 using the HindII and SacI restriction sites. Yeast transformations were performed as described by Elble et al.(26Elble R. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis as previously described (27Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar vesicles were isolated as described by Roberts et al. (28Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were grown overnight in YEPD pH 5.0 or SD-uracil and converted to spheroplasts, but spheroplasts were washed two times in YEPD pH 5.0 containing 1.2m sorbitol. During the last wash cells were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to ensure V-ATPase assembly, then cells were lysed and homogenized in 50 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Mes-Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 12% Ficoll). ATPase activity was determined by the coupled enzyme assay described by Lotscher et al. (29Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A.

Vacuolar vesicles were solubilized using cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heating for 15 min at 75 °C. Equal amounts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. The presence of V-ATPase subunits was determined by Western blotting with the subunit-specific antibodies 10D7, 8B1, 13D11, and 7A2, mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the a, A, B, and C subunits (27Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody or a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the E subunit (a generous gift from Tom Stevens) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. V-ATPase complexes were isolated as described by Kane (13Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were labeled with Tran35S-label for 60 min while shaking at 30 °C. Labeled spheroplasts were then solubilized in the presence of 0.67 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), and V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated with the indicated monoclonal antibody followed by protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated complexes were visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. The S. cerevisiae subunit C gene VMA5 was both cloned based on protein sequence (33Beltran C. Kopecky J. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 774-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated in a genetic screen for V-ATPase mutants. The gene was demonstrated to encode a 42-kDa V1 sector subunit (16Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no homologue of VMA5 in F-ATPases, and relatively little is known subunit C function in any species. In an attempt to better understand the structure and function of this subunit we initiated a mutagenesis study. First, a random mutagenesis approach was taken. The VMA5gene was mutagenized using a PCR-based protocol that relies on the reduced fidelity of Taq polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”). A vma5Δ strain was transformed with constructs containing mutagenized VMA5 PCR products in combination with a gapped plasmid, and mutant plasmids were generatedin vivo by gap repair (34Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a VMA5-containing plasmid was mutagenized by passage through an Escherichia coli mutator strain (23Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Approximately 5000 transformants containing mutant plasmids generated by the two methods were analyzed for a Vma− growth phenotype, characterized by inability to grow at elevated pH and calcium levels (35Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although we and others have successfully isolated random mutations in several other V-ATPase subunit genes by this method (23Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Liu J. Kane P.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22075-22081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we recovered very fewvma5 mutant strains, and most of those that were recovered did not appear to express any Vma5p based on immunoblots of whole cell lysates. Two vma5 mutants were identified that did express the subunit protein; both proved to encode truncations. One mutation resulted in a frameshift at amino acid 353 that introduced a stop codon 6 amino acids later as well as a missense mutation, R310K. The second was a truncation mutant, K360stop, which exhibited a tight Vma− phenotype (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates revealed that the K360stop mutant produced a small amount of Vma5p with a molecular mass lower than the wild-type subunit (Fig. 2 B). Isolated vacuolar vesicles from this mutant displayed no V-ATPase activity (Fig. 2 C) and almost completely lacked V1 subunits (subunits A, B, and E) associated with the vacuolar membrane but contained wild-type levels of the V0 subunit a (Fig. 2 D). Both thevma5Δ mutant and the K360stop mutant vesicles do contain a small amount of B subunit at the vacuolar membrane, as described previously (16Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genes for subunit C have now been identified and cloned from a variety of different species. Fig. 1 is a multisequence alignment of subunit C genes cloned from five evolutionarily distant organisms, yeast, Arabidopsis,C. elegans, Drosophila, and Bos taurus(bovine). The K360stop mutation deleted the last 33 amino acids of Vma5p. The region after Lys-K360 is quite poorly conserved among the organisms shown in Fig. 1, except for a small region rich in aromatic amino acids between 380 and 389. We targeted this region for site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of these amino acids in Vma5p stability and function. Two truncation mutations, which changed Thr-380 and Ile-389 to stop codons, were designed to fall just before and just after this conserved C-terminal region. If this region were in fact needed for wild-type Vma5p function, then the T380stop mutant might display a classical Vma− phenotype, whereas I389stop mutant would not. Plasmids carrying the different truncation mutants were transformed into a vma5Δ strain, and transformants were screened for a Vma− growth phenotype (Fig.2 A). The T380stop mutant exhibited a strong Vma− phenotype; the I389stop mutant grew similarly to wild type. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates showed decreased levels of Vma5p in cells containing the T380stop mutation and wild type levels in cells containing the I389stop mutation (Fig. 2 B). These results implicated residues 381 through 388 in subunit stability. In previous mutagenesis studies, the presence of the Vma−phenotype typically suggested that there was less than 25% wild-type V-ATPase activity present in the cell (25Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We isolated vacuolar vesicles to quantitate the amount of V-ATPase activity in the presence of the T380stop and I389stop mutations. Consistent with the growth phenotype, Fig. 2 C demonstrates that compared with a wild-type strain, only 7.7% as much ATPase activity is found in vacuolar vesicles from the T380stop mutant, and 90% as much activity is found in vesicles from the I389stop mutant. Immunoblots of vesicle protein indicated decreased levels of V1 subunits assembled at the vacuolar membrane of the T380stop mutant (Fig. 2 D), whereas the I389stop mutation allowed assembly of wild-type levels. These results focused our mutagenesis efforts on the amino acids between Thr-380 and Ile-389. We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis in this region, focusing on the charged and aromatic residues. Glu-381, Tyr-382, Phe-385, and Tyr-388 were all individually mutated to alanine. Mutant constructs were transformed into vma5Δ cells. We did not observe a Vma− phenotype with any of the point mutations, even in the more sensitive serial dilution assay for growth (Fig.3 A). Levels of Vma5 protein were determined for all strains; all produced wild-type levels of Vma5p (Fig. 3 B). Some point mutants displayed a reproducible effect on the mobility of Vma5p. We determined that the mobility shifts were due to secondary structure differences, not covalent modifications, because they disappeared in gels run in the presence of high concentrations of urea (data not shown). Vacuolar vesicles were isolated from all strains, and V-ATPase activity was evaluated. Mutants E381A, Y382A, F385A, and Y388A supported an average of 106, 35, 90, and 41% of the wild-type V-ATPase activity, respectively, in vacuolar vesicles (Fig. 3 C). To ascertain if the reduced activity of mutants Y382A and Y388A was the result of a catalytic or an assembly defect, vacuolar vesicles were analyzed for V-ATPase subunit levels. Fig. 3 D demonstrates that vacuolar vesicles isolated from all of the strains contained comparable levels of the V0subunit a, but strains carrying the Y382A or Y388A mutations contained reduced levels of V1 sector subunits A, C, and E (once again the effect on subunit B is less pronounced). This suggests that the reduction in V-ATPase activity in these two mutants is due to decreased assembly of V-ATPase subunits at the vacuolar membrane. Surprisingly, there are reduced levels of all of the V1subunits in vacuolar vesicles isolated from cells containing the F385A mutant as well despite the near wild-type ATPase activity detected in the isolated vacuolar vesicles. This suggests that in the presence of the F385A mutant, there is a reduction in the amount of assembled V-ATPase, but the enzyme that is assembled has a higherk cat than wild-type. This point is addressed below. To establish whether the decreased levels of subunits found at the vacuolar membrane were due to a defect in enzyme assembly or stability, we examined the assembly of the V-ATPase in the Y382A,Y388A, and F385A mutants by immunoprecipitation. Strains harboring the differentvma5 mutants were biosynthetically labeled, and V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of cross-linker. Fig.4 indicates no differences between the immunoprecipitated complexes from wild-type and mutant strains. This implies that there are no fundamental defects in V-ATPase biosynthesis in strains containing the Y382A, F385A, or Y388A mutations, even though there is an effect on V-ATPase subunit levels in isolated vacuolar vesicles. We hypothesize that the enzyme is stable enough to exhibit function in vivo and remain assembled through immunoprecipitation in the presence of the cross-linker but is not stable enough to survive vacuole isolation. This phenomenon has previously been observed in mutagenesis studies of the G subunit (38Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine can be post-translationally modified, we mutated the Tyr-382 to phenylalanine, which cannot be phosphorylated. Fig. 3 shows that Y382F supports full wild-type function, suggesting that an aromatic residue 382 may be sufficient for Vma5p function. Both Y382A and Y388A had effects on the V-ATPase activity, so we determined whether there was an additive effect of simultaneously mutating both residues to al"

Although a direct functional link between gC1qR and MT1-MMP is still uncertain, our observations suggested that there might be reciprocal interactions involving these proteins in vivo. This prompted us to evaluate whether gC1qR is susceptible to MT1-MMP proteolysis. Here, we report that breast carcinoma cells release soluble gC1qR in the medium. MT1-MMP forms an enzyme-substrate complex with released gC1qR and cleaves this protein in vitro and in cell culture conditions. Our findings imply that the proteolytically inactive full-length MT1-MMP species may represent cell surface receptors of gC1qR, while MT1-MMP activity expressed at the surface of aggressive tumor cells is likely to reduce the levels of soluble gC1qR in the tumor vicinity. A murine mAb 60.11, directed against the N-terminal portion of gC1qR, and rabbit polyclonal antibody pAB-p33 were described earlier (12Ghebrehiwet B. Lu P.D. Zhang W. Lim B.L. Eggleton P. Leigh L.E.

Following washing, the beads were boiled with 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) with 50 mmdithiothreitol for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Bands containing biotin-labeled proteins were visualized by using ExtrAvidin-HRP (Sigma) and the TMB/M substrate (Chemicon). To generate catalytically active MT1-MMP-PEX, 600 ng of soluble Ser24–Val524 pro-MT1-MMP-PEX (12 pmol) was activated by incubating with 30 ng of MT1-MMP-CAT (1.5 pmol; 1:8 molar ratio) for 1 h at ambient temperature. 100-ng aliquots of MT1-MMP-PEX (2 pmol) were immediately used to cleave 2 μg of gC1qR (60 pmol) for 0.5–4 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of 50 mmHEPES, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, 0.01% Brij buffer, pH 6.8. In addition, gC1qR (2 μg, 60 pmol) was treated with MT1-MMP-CAT (50 ng, 2 pmol) for 0.5–4 h in the same buffer. The cleavage reactions were stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer. The cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting employing anti-gC1qR mAb 60.11. The main cleavage product, with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa, was subjected to N-terminal protein microsequencing. Aliquots (200 ng) of pro-MMP-2 essentially free from TIMP-2 were activated by MT1-MMP-CAT (20 ng) for 1.5 h at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μmZnCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35. Gelatin zymography (35Strongin A.Y. Collier I.E. Krasnov P.A. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. Goldberg G.I. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 158-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used to verify the conversion of the 68-kDa pro-MMP-2 into the 62-kDa activated MMP-2 enzyme. Further, the purified gC1qR (2 μg) was incubated with activated MMP-2 (100 ng) for 6 h followed by SDS-PAGE of the digested samples. 1 μg of the α1-antitrypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was hydrolyzed by MT1-MMP-CAT (20 ng) at 37 °C for 14 h in 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, containing 10 mmCaCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2 and 0.01% Brij-35. Where indicated, GM6001 (1 μm), AGN3340 (1 μm), TIMP-2 (200 ng or about a 10-fold molar excess) or TIMP-1 (200 ng or about a 7-fold molar excess) was added to the reaction to inhibit MT1-MMP activity. Following reduction, the digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ELISA was used to quantify biotin-labeled gC1qR. The gC1qR protein was labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). Wells of a 96-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with anti-gC1qR mAb 60.11 (1 μg/ml) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After removing unbound antibody, wells were blocked with 1% casein in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium samples (100 μl) were allowed to bind immobilized mAb 60.11 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, bound biotin-labeled material was identified by ExtrAvidin-HRP and the TMB/E substrate. TheA 450 of the samples was measured in a microplate reader. The concentrations of gC1qR in the medium samples were calculated by using a calibration curve that ranged from 10 to 100 ng/ml. Washes between reactions were done in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Wells of a 96-well plate (Costar) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of PBS containing MT1-MMP-CAT (200 ng/ml) or MT1-MMP-PEX (500 ng/ml; an equimolar amount relative to that of MT1-MMP-CAT). After blocking with 1% casein in PBS, MT1-MMP-CAT or MT1-MMP-PEX was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of PBS supplemented with AGN3340 (1 μm), GM6001 (1 μm), TIMP-2 (2 μg/ml), or TIMP-1 (2 μg/ml) or left untreated. Afterward, gC1qR solution (10 μg/ml) in 1% casein-PBS was allowed to bind the MT1-MMP samples for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound gC1qR was detected by incubating the plate with mAb 60.11 (1 μg/ml in PBS-1% casein) followed by incubation with donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP and the TMB/E substrate. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 between each change of reagents. The reading of casein control (background) was subtracted from the A 450 values of the experimental samples. Protein concentration was determined by dye methods with a Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Two soluble truncated forms of MT1-MMP, specifically pro-MT1-MMP-PEX, comprising both the CAT domain and the PEX domain, and the MT1-MMP-CAT construct that represents the individual catalytic domain of the enzyme, were used in our studies. The MT1-MMP-CAT construct isolated from E. coliexhibits high proteolytic activity after refolding (29Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation is required to convert the pro-MT1-MMP-PEX latent zymogen into the catalytically active MT1-MMP-PEX enzyme. The pro part of MT1-MMP-PEX was cleaved by MT1-MMP-CAT to generate catalytically active MT1-MMP-PEX. MT1-MMP-PEX was immediately used in the gC1qR cleavage reactions. At the 1:30 enzyme-substrate molar ratio, proteolytically active MT1-MMP-PEX (2 pmol) cleaved gC1qR (60 pmol), generating the predominant proteolytic fragment with a molecular mass of about 17 kDa and two minor fragments, 12 and 11 kDa (Fig.1 A). Since glucose oxidase has an acidic pI value similar to that of gC1qR, this control protein was used in our studies. In a 5-fold molar excess relative to gC1qR, glucose oxidase failed to affect the gC1qR proteolysis, thus supporting the unique sensitivity of gC1qR to MT1-MMP-PEX (Fig. 1 B). Both GM6001 (1 μm), a wide range hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs, and TIMP-2 (200 ng, 10 pmol) fully inhibited the cleavage of gC1qR by MT1-MMP-PEX. In contrast, TIMP-1 (270 ng, 9 pmol), known as a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP (36Butler G.S. Will H. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Earlier, we found that the cytoplasmic tail sequence of MT1-MMP associates with gC1qR.2 Our present observations show that, apparently, there is a second gC1qR binding site in the MT1-MMP molecule. We suggest that this site comprises the enzyme's CAT domain involved in the enzyme-substrate MT1-MMP·gC1qR complex. Intriguingly, the individual MT1-MMP-CAT construct that lacks the PEX domain in contrast to MT1-MMP-PEX was incapable of cleaving gC1qR (Fig.1 C). Evidently, the presence of the PEX domain is critical to accomplishing the cleavage of gC1qR by the protease. Further, we examined whether MMP-2 is capable of cleaving gC1qR (Fig.2). For these purposes, pro-MMP-2 essentially free of TIMP-2 was isolated from medium conditioned by p2AHT2A72 cells (a derivative of the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line doubly transfected with E1A and pro-MMP-2) (30Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 31Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified MMP-2 was activated by MT1-MMP-CAT. The conversion of the 68-kDa latent zymogen into the 62-kDa enzyme of MMP-2 was confirmed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 2 A). The activated MMP-2 enzyme was immediately employed in our cleavage studies. However, as can be seen in Fig.2 B, activated MMP-2 failed to induce any significant hydrolysis of gC1qR. To identify relative positions of the cleavage fragments within the gC1qR molecule, we used Western blotting with mAb 60.11 directed to the N-terminal portion of gC1qR. This antibody recognized the 12- and 11-kDa cleavage fragments but failed to interact with the 17-kDa fragment of gC1qR (Fig.3). These data indicated that the MT1-MMP cleavage sites were located within the N-terminal part of the gC1qR molecule. The N-terminal sequencing of the 17-kDa fragment indicated that MT1-MMP cleaved the mature gC1qR protein at the PSQG79↓80QKVE site, providing the 17-kDa fragment with the N-terminal QKVEEQE sequence. In the known crystal structure of the doughnut-shaped gC1qR (5Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the PSQG79Q80KVE segment represents a highly disordered 68PTFDGEEEPSQGQKVEEQEPE88 part of the loop connecting the β3 strand to the β4strand (Fig. 3 B). The surface location of this structurally disordered loop explains its sensitivity to proteolysis. Evidently, the binding of the loop sequence to the PEX domain is necessary to achieve the proper orientation of the loop relative to the active site of MT1-MMP-PEX. This may explain the inability of MT1-MMP-CAT that lacks the PEX sequence to accomplish the cleavage of qC1qR. The subsequent computer modeling supports this hypothesis (see “Discussion”). The in vitroresults prompted us to examine whether gC1qR is sensitive to MT1-MMP expressed in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. We specifically selected this cell line for our studies, since it is deficient in pro-MMP-2 and MT1-MMP (34Rozanov D.I. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This provided us with the opportunity to specifically identify the effects of MT1-MMP expressed in stably transfected cells. First, we evaluated by Western blotting the levels of soluble gC1qR in medium conditioned by mock cells and by cells expressing the MT1-MMP-E240A, MT1-MMP-WT, and MT1-MMP-ΔCT constructs. All cell lines exhibited soluble gC1qR in medium. We found that there was no significant difference in the levels of soluble natural gC1qR (about 10–20 ng/ml) in these cell lines (Fig.4 A). Second, we evaluated the ability of cellular MT1-MMP to degrade soluble gC1qR. To eliminate the contribution of the biosynthesis of gC1qR and to specifically target the degradation of this protein, we used biotin-labeled gC1qR. For these purposes, 30 ng/ml biotin-labeled gC1qR was added to medium conditioned by mock cells and by cells expressing the MT1-MMP-E240A, MT1-MMP-WT, and MT1-MMP-ΔCT constructs. After incubation of biotin-gC1qR with cells for 16 h, the residual concentrations of biotin-gC1qR in medium were measured by ELISA and calculated by using a calibration curve (Fig. 4 B), which ranged from 10 to 100 ng/ml biotin-labeled gC1qR (Fig. 4 B,inset). The levels of biotin-gC1qR remained largely unchanged in medium conditioned by the cell lines expressing no MT1-MMP activity such as mock cells and MT1-MMP-E240A-transfected cells. In turn, cell lines expressing MT1-MMP activity such as MT1-MMP-WT and MT1-MMP-ΔCT cells were both competent in depleting biotin-gC1qR (Fig.4 C). Thus, there was a correlation between expression of functionally active MT1-MMP in the cells and the levels of soluble gC1qR in the medium, thereby suggesting the degradation of gC1qR by this protease. Importantly, biotinylation did not significantly alter sensitivity of gC1qR to the cleavage by MT1-MMP-PEX (data not shown). The contribution of MT1-MMP to proteolysis of gC1qR was further confirmed by employing HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells in our studies. This cell line is known to express endogenous MT1-MMP, which upon stimulation for example by phorbol esters is recruited to the plasma membrane (31Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Maquoi E. Frankenne F. Noel A. Krell H.W. Grams F. Foidart J.M. Exp.

(Tokyo). 1998; 124: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, MT1-MMP participates in pro-MMP-2 activation (30Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 40Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). This inducible expression allowed us to examine how cell surface MT1-MMP contributes to the proteolysis of gC1qR (Fig. 4 C, inset). For these purposes, biotin-labeled gC1qR was added to medium conditioned by PMA-stimulated or untreated HT1080 cells. Pretreatment of HT1080 cells with PMA resulted in efficient activation of pro-MMP-2, while less significant activation of pro-MMP-2 was observed in untreated cells (Fig.4 C, inset). Concomitantly, PMA pretreatment enhanced degradation of biotin-labeled gC1qR by HT1080 cells and, accordingly, decreased the levels of the labeled protein in the medium. The addition of the hydroxamate GM6001 inhibitor alone or its co-addition with PMA strongly inhibited both the proteolysis of gC1qR and activation of MMP-2 in HT1080 cells (Fig. 4 C). Since purified activated MMP-2 failed to cleave gC1qR (Fig. 2), our data suggest that MT1-MMP naturally expressed in HT1080 cells is directly involved in proteolysis of gC1qR. Next, we examined the ability of MT1-MMP-CAT and MT1-MMP-PEX to directly bind gC1qR. For these purposes, the purified and refolded MT1-MMP-CAT or MT1-MMP-PEX were each coated on plastic and then allowed to bind gC1qR in the presence and absence of MT1-MMP inhibitors including hydroxamate class inhibitors AGN3340 and GM6001 and TIMPs such as TIMP-1 (a poor inhibitor of MT1-MMP activity) and TIMP-2 (a potent inhibitor of MT1-MMP activity). After washings, the bound gC1qR was identified by mAb 60.11 followed by incubation of immune complexes with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Our data indicated that MT1-MMP-CAT was capable of directly associating with gC1qR. Inhibition of MT1-MMP activity reduced but not abolished the ability of the recombinant construct to bind gC1qR. Similarly to MT1-MMP-CAT, MT1-MMP-PEX was capable of binding to gC1qR, and the binding was sensitive to inhibition by a hydroxamate (Fig.5 A). The cleavage of α1-antitrypsin by MT1-MMP was used to confirm the proteolytic activity of the MT1-MMP-CAT construct and the effects caused by the inhibitors. Consistent with the observations of other authors (41Kataoka H. Uchino H. Iwamura T. Seiki M. Nabeshima K. Koono M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 42Lang R. Kocourek A. Braun M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), α1-antitrypsin was sensitive to MT1-MMP. Thus, at the about 1:15 enzyme-substrate ratio, MT1-MMP-CAT (20 ng) efficiently cleaved α1-antitrypsin (1 μg) (Fig.5 B). All three potent inhibitors of MT-MMP activity (AGN3340, GM6001, and TIMP-2) fully blocked the gC1qR proteolysis by MT1-MMP-CAT, while TIMP-1 failed to significantly affect MT1-MMP activity. These findings presumably indicate that there is a partial but not complete overlap of the gC1qR- and inhibitor-binding sites within the active site of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP. Particularly, these data suggest that once inhibited by hydroxamates or TIMP-2, MT1-MMP expressed at the plasma membrane may represent a cellular receptor of gC1qR. To confirm our in vitro observations, we employed cells expressing MT1-MMP-WT in biotinylation and immunoprecipitation studies. A"

Finally, GCA is exclusively membrane-bound and is active mainly with Mg2+, whereas sGC is predominantly soluble and more active with Mn2+. adenylyl cyclase guanylyl cyclase soluble guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate cAMP and cGMP are important signaling molecules. In prokaryotes, cAMP regulates gene expression. Cyanobacteria contain high levels of cGMP relative to other bacteria, but their function as intracellular signaling molecules is not well understood (1Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, cAMP and cGMP regulate enzyme activities, channel activity, and gene expression, mainly via cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (2Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A.

A large and complex family of adenylyl cyclase (AC)1 and guanylyl cyclase (GC) is responsible for the synthesis of cAMP and cGMP (4Wedel B. Garbers D. Annu. Rev.

A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, cGMP is implicated as one of the second messengers for chemotaxis (10Van Haastert P.J.M. Kuwayama H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although its precise role is not known. On the other hand, cAMP can act as both first and second messenger (11Meima M. Schaap P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As first messenger, cAMP induces chemotaxis, cAMP signal relay, and gene expression.Dictyostelium possesses three AC and two GC genes. ACA is similar to mammalian 12-transmembrane AC and controls cAMP signaling during cell aggregation. ACG is an AC with the topology of a membrane-bound GC containing one cyclase domain and one transmembrane region (13Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); the enzyme produces cAMP, which regulates spore germination. ACB, encoded by the acrA gene, is most similar to cyanobacterial AC and controls spore maturation (14Soderbom F. Anjard C. Iranfar N. Fuller D. Loomis W.F.

Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30859-30862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently we identified two Dictyostelium GC gene, gcaA andsgcA, encoding GCA (17Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and sGC (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences and predicted topologies suggest that GCA and sGC are more related to animal AC than to animal GC enzymes. GCA has the topology of 12-transmembrane AC in which the two cyclase domains appear to be functionally swapped. Thus, the second cyclase domain of mammalian AC, which provides most catalytic interactions with ATP, is similar to the first domain of GCA interacting with GTP. GC enzymes with this topology have also been found inParamecium and Plasmodium (19Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E.

The secondDictyostelium guanylyl cyclase, sGC, contains two cyclase domains and two long (∼1000 amino acids) N- and C-terminal regions. The cyclase domains and the C-terminal region of sGC shows a high degree of identity with the corresponding segments of human soluble AC. Interestingly, homologs of sAC are present in bacteria and rat but are absent from the completely sequenced genomes of Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Phylogenetic analysis places the Dictyostelium sGC as the evolutionary intermediate between the bacterial and vertebrate sequences (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J.M.

First we show that all GC activity is lost in a cell line in which both genes are inactivated, suggesting that GCA and sGC represent all GC activity in Dictyostelium. Subsequently, GCA was characterized in a cell line with a deletion of sGC, and sGC was characterized in a strain without GCA.DISCUSSIONDictyostelium contains two genes that encode for unusual GC enzymes, GCA and sGC. Amino acid sequence alignment, phylogenetic studies, and topology suggest that sGC belongs to the small group of soluble AC enzymes present in human, rat, and some bacteria (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). GCA belongs to the large group of prevailing cyclases that harbors nearly all vertebrate ACs and GCs; GCA is most closely related to the family of 12-transmembrane ACs (17Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of cyclase domains and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that one amino acid may be crucial in determining substrate specificity of cyclases, which is a lysine in nearly all adenylyl cyclases and a glutamate in guanylyl cyclase (6Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 31Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40740-40745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In GCA this amino acid is glutamate (Glu440) and in sGC an aspartate (Asp1332). Two other amino acids proposed to be important for determining substrate specificity are an aspartate and a glutamine in adenylyl cyclases, which are an arginine and cysteine at the same positions in guanylyl cyclases. These amino acids are not conserved in GCA and sGC, as they are replaced by two histidines in GCA and by a glutamate and alanine in sGC. Although it is possible to provide a function for these amino acids in substrate recognition (Fig.1 B), it would be interesting to determine the three-dimensional structure of these unusual cyclases. Mutagenesis of GCA has shown that replacing the glutamate and histidine to the corresponding lysine and aspartate converts GCA into a fully active adenylyl cyclase (34Roelofs J. Loovers H.M. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40740-40745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The notion that GCA and especially sGC contain many unusual amino acids at positions that have been shown to provide substrate specificity suggests that conversion of an adenylyl to a guanylyl cyclase can be achieved in different ways.Regulation of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases by their natural effectors such as G-proteins or Ca2+ is generally detectable only with Mg2+, whereas Mn2+ uncovers all intrinsic activity (35Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This notion also holds for sGC because this enzyme is more active with Mn2+/GTP than with Mg2+/GTP, whereas GTPγS and Ca2+ strongly affect Mg2+-dependent activity but have no effect in the presence of Mn2+. Interestingly, GCA is active predominantly with Mg2+/GTP as substrate, whereas with Mn2+ the activity is reduced at least 3-fold. A trivial but unprecedented explanation for the low Mn2+-dependent GCA activity could be that Mn2+-dependent GCA activity remains inhibited by Ca2+. Although lysates contain EGTA to chelate Ca2+, Ca2+ will be released during the GC assay because EGTA has a higher affinity for Mn2+ than for Ca2+ (36Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We are not aware of a chelator that binds Ca2+ with 10,000-fold higher affinity than Mn2+, which would be needed to test the hypothesis. However, the small Mn2+-dependent GCA activity could not be inhibited by the addition of 10 μmCa2+, suggesting that GCA either has low intrinsic Mn2+-dependent activity or that the low Mn2+-dependent activity represents a residual Ca2+-insensitive activity.Despite the different sensitivities of GCA and sGC to bivalent cations, the physiologically relevant cation is probably Mg2+ for both sGC and GCA, because the intracellular concentration of Mn2+ (∼10 μm) is too low to support activity, whereas the Mg2+ concentration (∼3.5 mm) is sufficient (26Padh H. Brenner M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is expected that GCA with 12 hydrophobic segments is found in the particulate fraction of a cell lysate and that sGC without hydrophobic segments resides in the soluble fraction. All Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent GCA activity was found in the particulate fraction. 2J. Roelofs and P. J. M. Van Haastert, unpublished observations. Previously (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that a significant portion of sGC (∼20% of Mn2+-dependent activity) is measured in the particulate fraction and is equally active with Mg2+, whereas the large soluble Mn2+-dependent activity is nearly inactive with Mg2+/GTP as substrate. Thus, both GCA and sGC are membrane-associated enzymes with the physiologically relevant cation Mg2+.GCA as well as sGC can be stimulated by the chemoattractants folic acid and cAMP, although maximal stimulation of GCA is much weaker (2.5-fold) than maximal stimulation of sGC (8-fold). There is no simple explanation for this difference, because potential regulators such as GTPγS and Ca2+ have nearly the same effect on GCA as on sGC. Perhaps sGC is activated by additional mechanisms, a supposition that is also supported by the observation that osmotic stress activates sGC but not GCA. Translocation of soluble sGC to the membrane or modification of soluble sGC by which it becomes active with Mg2+/GTP could provide the additional activation of sGC that is not possible for GCA.The mechanism by which GTPγS stimulates GCA and sGC is not straightforward. Ample evidence indicates that in vivochemoattractants stimulate cGMP formation through a G-protein-mediated pathway. No detectable cGMP formation occurs upon stimulation of cells in which the single Gβ subunit has been deleted, suggesting that chemotactic stimulation of GCA and sGC are both mediated via heterotrimeric G-proteins (37Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In vitro GTPγS stimulates both GCA and sGC by inducing a 1.5-fold increase of theV max of the enzyme and a 3.5-fold reduction of the K m for GTP. Also the K a and Hill coefficient for the GTPγS dose dependence of GC stimulation are similar for both enzymes, which may suggest that GCA and sGC are regulated by the same GTP-binding protein. The in vitroGTPγS activation of sGC and GCA could represent the aforementioned essential requirement of heterotrimeric G-proteins for chemoattractant-mediated stimulation in vivo. However, several anomalies have been observed that are not consistent with a heterotrimeric G-protein as the target for GTPγS-mediated GC activation. First, GTPγS still stimulates GC activity in lysates from Gβ-null cells (37Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least the prevailing sGC is still sensitive to GTPγS. In addition, upon mutation of GCA to an adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme is still stimulated by GTPγS when expressed in cells with a deletion of Gβ or two Gα subunits (34Roelofs J. Loovers H.M. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40740-40745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Second, both GCA and sGC show normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, suggesting that GTP does not stimulate these enzymes. Third, it has been observed in starved wild-type cells (mainly expressing sGC) that addition of GTP before GTPγS inhibits the stimulating effect of GTPγS (28De Janssens P.M. Jong C.C. Vink A.A. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the target of GTPγS rapidly hydrolyses GTP and slowly releases the produced GDP. These properties have often been found in small GTP-binding proteins that, unlike Gα, do not require a Gβ for activation. This may suggest that the guanylyl cyclases in Dictyostelium are regulated via the concerted activation of surface receptors, heterotrimeric G-proteins and small G-proteins. A similar hypothesis was recently obtained for Saccharomyces cerevisiae where Gβγ recruits Far1p leading to the activation of Cdc42p (38Butty A.C. Pryciak P.M. Huang L.S. Herskowitz I. Peter M. Science. 1998; 282: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), as well as for other systems like fibroblasts, COS-7 cells, and human airway smooth muscle cells where Gi mediates the activation of p21ras(39Hawes B.E. van Biesen T.

Physiol. 1999; 276: L564-L570PubMed Google Scholar).The function of cGMP during chemotaxis and multicellular development is emerging. Previous mutant analysis uncovered several mutants with chemotaxis defects that have an altered cGMP metabolism (see Ref. 10Van Haastert P.J.M. Kuwayama H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), notably mutant KI-8, which has very low cGMP levels. In comparison with the absolute chemotaxis-null phenotype of KI-8, chemotaxis of gca −/sgc −double null cells is relatively normal. It has been demonstrated that cGMP induces the phosphorylation and rearrangement of myosin heavy chain II filaments. Chemotaxis of mhcII − null cells is disturbed but not absent. The preliminary phenotypic experiments ongca −/sgc − double null cells suggest that cGMP may play a role in chemotaxis through myosin filament formation but is not absolutely requires for chemotaxis as is the case for myosin heavy chain. Detailed computer-assisted chemotaxis analysis and phosphorylation of the myosin heavy and light chains ofgca −/sgc − single and double null cells is in progress and should uncover the mechanism by which cGMP regulates chemotaxis.The identification of two guanylyl cyclases inDictyostelium, GCA and sGC, uncovers unexpected evolutionary traits. GCA has the topology of a 12-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase, whereas sGC is the homolog of a soluble adenylyl cyclase. No close phylogenetic relationship can be found with mammalian guanylyl cyclase (17Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mammalian guanylyl cyclases, GCA and sGC, each developed independently into a guanylyl cyclase. From a biochemical point of view this may not be very surprising, considering the relative ease by which an AC can be converted experimentally to a GC (31Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J.

Yashiro K. Ohmori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10564-10569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, from an evolutionary perspective, one would expect that AC to GC interconversions would have occurred more frequently. In the family of phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP, a change of substrate specificity during evolution may have been relatively common (44Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 1-52Crossref Google Scholar, 45Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), but it seems also scarce in cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Apparently, the specificity of cyclases and kinases cannot be changed easily because the mechanisms that regulate cyclases and the substrate specificity of kinases have to remain functionally coupled. cAMP and cGMP are important signaling molecules. In prokaryotes, cAMP regulates gene expression. Cyanobacteria contain high levels of cGMP relative to other bacteria, but their function as intracellular signaling molecules is not well understood (1Ochoa De Alda J.A. Ajlani G. Houmard J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3839-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, cAMP and cGMP regulate enzyme activities, channel activity, and gene expression, mainly via cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (2Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A.

Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A large and complex family of adenylyl cyclase (AC)1 and guanylyl cyclase (GC) is responsible for the synthesis of cAMP and cGMP (4Wedel B. Garbers D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mammalian AC (6Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 7Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) suggests that the core of the enzyme consist of two cyclase domains that are associated in an antiparallel manner. In metazoan, four cyclase subgroups are recognized (4Wedel B. Garbers D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar): 1) the 12-transmembrane adenylyl cyclase is composed of two different cyclase domains and is regulated by G-proteins; 2) The single-transmembrane guanylyl cyclase contains one cyclase domain and functions as a homodimer, and GC activity is stimulated by extracellular peptides; 3) The nitric oxide-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase is a complex of two different proteins with one cyclase domain each; 4) The recently discovered soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) from rat and human possesses two cyclase domains, which share the highest degree of identity with bacterial adenylyl cyclases (9Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, cGMP is implicated as one of the second messengers for chemotaxis (10Van Haastert P.J.M. Kuwayama H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although its precise role is not known. On the other hand, cAMP can act as both first and second messenger (11Meima M. Schaap P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As first messenger, cAMP induces chemotaxis, cAMP signal relay, and gene expression.Dictyostelium possesses three AC and two GC genes. ACA is similar to mammalian 12-transmembrane AC and controls cAMP signaling during cell aggregation. ACG is an AC with the topology of a membrane-bound GC containing one cyclase domain and one transmembrane region (13Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); the enzyme produces cAMP, which regulates spore germination. ACB, encoded by the acrA gene, is most similar to cyanobacterial AC and controls spore maturation (14Soderbom F. Anjard C. Iranfar N. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Development. 1999; 126: 5463-5471PubMed Google Scholar, 15Meima M.E. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Kim H.J. Chang W.T. Meima M. Gross J.D. Schaap P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30859-30862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently we identified two Dictyostelium GC gene, gcaA andsgcA, encoding GCA (17Roelofs J. Snippe H. Kleineidam R.G. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and sGC (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences and predicted topologies suggest that GCA and sGC are more related to animal AC than to animal GC enzymes. GCA has the topology of 12-transmembrane AC in which the two cyclase domains appear to be functionally swapped. Thus, the second cyclase domain of mammalian AC, which provides most catalytic interactions with ATP, is similar to the first domain of GCA interacting with GTP. GC enzymes with this topology have also been found inParamecium and Plasmodium (19Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Kruger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Carucci D.J. Witney A.A. Muhia D.K. Warhurst D.C. Schaap P. Meima M. Li J.L. Taylor M.C. Kelly J.M. Baker D.A. J. Biol.

The secondDictyostelium guanylyl cyclase, sGC, contains two cyclase domains and two long (∼1000 amino acids) N- and C-terminal regions. The cyclase domains and the C-terminal region of sGC shows a high degree of identity with the corresponding segments of human soluble AC. Interestingly, homologs of sAC are present in bacteria and rat but are absent from the completely sequenced genomes of Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Phylogenetic analysis places the Dictyostelium sGC as the evolutionary intermediate between the bacterial and vertebrate sequences (18Roelofs J. Meima M. Schaap P. Van Haastert P.J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1013-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

We have used affinity chromatography with immobilized transcription elongation factor SII to purify a protein complex that contains core RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), the general transcription initiation factors, and several splicing factors, including the U1, U2, and U4 small nuclear RNPs, the U2AF65, and serine/arginine-rich proteins. The splicing factors and the transcription machinery co-purify through a gel filtration column and co-immunoprecipitate in experiments using an anti-U2AF65 antibody, indicating that they are part of a unique complex. Although the RNA Pol II-containing complex does not possess splicing activity, it can complement small nuclear RNP-inactivated extracts and can promote the formation of a pre-spliceosome complex. Because interactions between components of the splicing and transcription machineries occur in the context of a complex containing a hypophosphorylated RNA Pol II capable of initiating transcription, our results suggest that the coupling between transcription and splicing begins before transcription initiation.

Whereas a phosphorylated CTD is essential for the interaction with capping enzymes, the polyadenylation factor CPSF is brought to the transcription complex through an interaction with TFIID and transferred to the phosphorylated CTD after transcription initiation (19McCracken S.

The phosphorylated RNA Pol IIO isoform has been found to associate with splicing factors and has been identified in active spliceosomes (21Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J.

Truncation of the CTD leads to inefficient capping, polyadenylation, and splicing in cultured mammalian cells (16McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A.

Whereas the mechanisms by which the CTD presents splicing factors to the nascent pre-mRNA remain unclear, a recent study suggests that the CTD might play an active role (27Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Initiation of transcription by RNA Pol II can be achieved in vivo by large multiprotein complexes called RNA Pol II holoenzymes (reviewed in Refs. 28Greenblatt J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 310-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 29Myer V.E. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27757-27760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Various forms of holoenzymes have been isolated from mammalian cells and all have been found to contain core RNA Pol II and a number of general transcription factors that are required for accurate transcription initiation in vitro(30Coulombe B. Burton Z.F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 457-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that snRNPs, U2AF65, and SR proteins are part of a RNA Pol II holoenzyme (hereafter called RNA Pol II-containing complex) purified by affinity chromatography using transcription elongation factor SII. The splicing factors associated with this RNA Pol II-containing complex can function in splicing reactions and can promote the assembly of a pre-spliceosome complexin vitro. Our data support a model in which coordination between transcription and splicing begins prior to transcription initiation by RNA Pol II. RNA Pol II-containing complexes were purified from HeLa whole cell extract as described previously (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, a HeLa whole cell extract in ACB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl was loaded on a GST-SII affinity column. The column was washed with ACB buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and eluted with ACB buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. An equivalent GST column was used as a control. The eluate from the GST-SII affinity column was further purified by chromatography through a Sepharose CL2B gel filtration column in ACB containing 50 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Samples were concentrated 5–10-fold before use in Western blot and transcription assays. The RNA Pol II-containing complexes were found to elute slightly faster than blue dextran on the CL2B column. Transcription reactions were performed as described by Pan et al. (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using the adenovirus major late promoter fused to a G-less cassette as template (32Coulombe B. Killeen M. Liljelund P. Honda B. Xiao H. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar). Run-off transcripts were analyzed on 8% denaturating polyacrylamide gels. The GST-SII column eluate (10 μg) was treated with RNase A (0.5 μg) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (25 μl), which had previously been bound to 5 μl of either anti-U2AF65 or preimmune rabbit serum in a final volume of 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with bovine serum albumin (625 μg). The beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated using a 12.5% SDS gel and were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters, which were then probed with specific antibodies. The 32P-labeled RNA transcripts used in the splicing assays were prepared as described (33Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: a Practical Approach. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1994: 1-29Google Scholar). The S100 fraction (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and the SR proteins (35Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) were prepared as previously described. Either 87.5, 175, or 350 ng of purified SR proteins, or 2.5, 5, and 10 μg of GST-SII eluate were used to complement the splicing activity of the S100 extract. Specific snRNAs were removed from HeLa nuclear extracts and GST-SII column eluates by incubation with oligonucleotides (25 ng/μl) complementary to different snRNAs and RNase H (1 unit/μl) for 90 min at 37 °C (36Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For the U4 depletion, ATP (0.5 mm) and creatine phosphate (20 mm) were also included in the depletion procedure. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Splicing assays were performed as described for the S100 complementation assay, except that nuclear extracts or depleted nuclear extracts were used as sources of splicing factors and were complemented using 10 μg of either GST-SII eluates or snRNA-depleted GST-SII column eluates as described in the figure legends. Radiolabeled adenovirus transcript (∼5 fmol) (33Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: a Practical Approach. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1994: 1-29Google Scholar) was incubated with nuclear extract (2.5 μl), U2-depleted nuclear extract (2.5 μl), GST-SII column eluate (2.5 μg), or U2-depleted GST-SII column eluate (2.5 μg) under conditions identical to those used for the splicing reactions. Aliquots were collected at different time points and analyzed on 3.5% acrylamide:0.043% bisacrylamide native gels. The transcription elongation factor SII (also called TFIIS) has previously been used as a ligand in protein-affinity chromatography for the purification of a RNA Pol II-containing complex that contains core RNA Pol II and the general transcription factors (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as capping and polyadenylation factors (16McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 19McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The size of this complex is estimated to be in the 2–4-MDa range, sedimenting as a 70 S particle (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The RNA Pol II-containing complex is sensitive to high salt concentrations, and increasing the Na+/K+ concentration above 0.3m causes its dissociation in subcomplexes (data not shown). We show here that the eluate from a GST-SII column, but not from a GST control column, contains SR proteins, at least one Sm protein, the Y12-68K polypeptide, and the U2AF65 splicing factor (Fig.1). Although the eluate contains the bulk of U2AF65 and is enriched for a subset of SR proteins, it contains a smaller proportion of the total Y12-68K and Sm proteins. In agreement with Greenblatt and co-workers (31Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the general transcription initiation factors including TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH, and core RNA Pol II are present in the GST-SII column eluate (Fig. 1 and data not shown). As revealed by Western blot experiments with the N-20 antibody that specifically recognizes the N terminus of RPB1 (Fig. 1, first panel), the RNA Pol II in the complex corresponds to the hypophosphorylated IIA form (i.e. the form involved in transcription initiation), which we estimated to be 100-fold more abundant than the hyperphosphorylated IIO form in the complex preparation. This observation was confirmed by Western blot experiments with antibodies that specifically recognize either the IIA (Ab 8WG16) or the IIO (Ab CC3) forms of RNA Pol II. By comparing the ratios of RNA Pol IIA over the total amount of proteins in the whole cell extract and the SII column eluate, we estimated the purification factor of the SII affinity column to be approximately 1000-fold. The association of splicing factors with a complex containing the hypophosphorylated IIA form of RNA Pol II and capable of transcription initiation (see below) contrasts with previous reports that have documented an interaction between splicing factors and RNA Pol IIO or a phosphorylated CTD (20Chabot B. Bisotto S. Vincent M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3206-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8253-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To confirm that the splicing and transcription factors are part of the same multiprotein complex, we submitted the GST-SII column eluate to a gel filtration column and an immunoprecipitation experiment. Following a Sepharose CL2B gel filtration column, the splicing factors continue to co-purify with core RNA Pol II and the general transcription factors RAP74 and TFIIEα (Fig. 2 A), indicating that all these splicing and transcription factors are either part of a unique complex or are distributed in a collection of complexes of similar molecular masses. Virtually all the polypeptides that had bound to the GST-SII column co-migrated on the Sepharose CL2B column (data not shown), again indicating that the proteins that had bound to SII are part of a single complex or a set of complexes of similar molecular weight. As determined by the synthesis of a 400-nucleotide run-off transcript accurately initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter in vitro, the transcriptional activity found in the GST-SII column eluate also co-purifies with the splicing factors, core RNA Pol II, and the general initiation factors (Fig. 2 B). In addition, and notably, core RNA Pol II is recovered from both the GST-SII column eluate and the crude whole cell extract in immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-U2AF65 antibody but not a control antibody (Fig.3). Extensive treatment with RNase A does not dissociate U2AF65 from RNA Pol II in co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3), clearly demonstrating that the splicing machinery is primarily associated with the complex via protein-protein interactions. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that several components of the splicing machinery are tightly associated with a RNA Pol II-containing complex that is fully capable of initiating transcription in vitro, suggesting that coordination between splicing and transcription begins before transcription initiation.Figure 3Immunoprecipitation of the RNA Pol II-containing complex using anti-U2AF65 before, or following, an extensive treatment with RNase A. The SII-column eluate (top panel) and the crude whole cell extract (WCE; bottom panel) were either treated (+) or not treated (−) with RNase A and then immunoprecipitated using either an anti-U2AF65 (αU2AF65 ) or a pre-immune (Mock) antibody. A proportion (5%) of the loading reactions (Load) and the whole pellets were then analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Pol IIA antibody (Ab 8WG16).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the RNA Pol II-containing complex displays transcriptional activity and contains many splicing factors, it failed to splice a simple pre-mRNA in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that at least one essential splicing factor is missing and/or that some factors in the preparation are inactive. To assess the activity of the SR proteins present in the RNA Pol II-containing complex, we used the GST-SII column eluate to complement splicing reactions performed with a HeLa S100 extract. S100 extracts are known to contain all the factors required for accurate splicing of a pre-mRNA in vitroexcept the SR proteins (37Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows the human RNA Pol II-containing complex complementing the S100 extract (lanes 7–9) with an efficiency comparable with that of purified SR proteins (lanes 4–6), whereas the eluate from a GST control column does not (lane 10). Clearly, the SR proteins that are associated with the RNA Pol II-containing complex can function in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. The presence of the Y12-68K and the Sm proteins in the GST-SII column eluate, as detected by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 1), suggests that at least the U1 snRNP particle is associated with the RNA Pol II-containing complex. To identify the snRNPs present in the complex, we used a splicing assay performed with nuclear extracts that had specific snRNAs inactivated by treatment with RNase H and specific antisense oligonucleotides (36Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows that the RNA Pol II-containing complex preparation can stimulate the splicing activity of nuclear extracts depleted of U1, U2, or U4 snRNAs (lanes 4, 8, and 12). In each case, restoration of splicing activity was due to the presence of U1, U2, or U4 snRNAs in the RNA Pol II-containing complex, since GST-SII column eluates depleted of U1, U2, or U4 did not restore the splicing activity of nuclear extracts depleted of the same snRNA (compare lane 3 with lane 6, lane 7 with lane 10, and lane 11 with lane 14 in Fig.4 B). Because the bulk of U4 snRNA exists in association with U5 and U6 in the form of a tri-snRNP complex (2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World: the Nature of Modern RNA Suggests a Prebiotic RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar), these data suggest that the human RNA Pol II-containing complex is associated with all the spliceosomal snRNPs. To determine whether the splicing factors associated with the RNA Pol II-containing complex can support the assembly of splicing complexes, the GST-SII column eluate was incubated with a radiolabeled transcript containing an adenovirus splicing cassette. Complex formation was analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels. Fig.5 shows that the factors in the RNA Pol II-containing complex can support the assembly of complexes with an efficiency nearly comparable with that of a nuclear extract (comparelanes 2–5 with lanes 10–13). One of these complexes (RNA polymerase) nearly co-migrates with spliceosomal complex A, and its formation is severely compromised by inactivation of U2 snRNA (compare lanes 6–9 with 14–17). These results indicate that the splicing factors present in the RNA Pol II-containing complex preparation can be efficiently utilized to promote the assembly of a pre-spliceosomal complex. Because the physical interaction between RNA Pol II and splicing factors was shown initially to occur with a phosphorylated CTD (20Chabot B. Bisotto S. Vincent M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3206-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4649-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), coupling between transcription and splicing was thought to begin during transcription elongation. The fact that a RNA Pol II-containing complex exists in association with various components of the splicing machinery and that the CTD in the RNA Pol II-containing complex is hypophosphorylated implies that coupling can be initiated before transcription begins. Thus, a phosphorylated CTD is not absolutely required for the interaction of splicing factors with transcription complexes, suggesting that splicing factors can associate with an as yet unidentified component of the transcription machinery. Interactions between splicing factors and the general transcription machinery, including the transcription initiation factors TBP (38Yoshida T. Makino Y. Tamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and TFIIH, 2J. M. Egly, personal communication. have been reported. The splicing components that interact with the RNA Pol II-containing complex include SR proteins and snRNPs, factors that also associate with hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol II (20Chabot B. Bisotto S. Vincent M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3206-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4649-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, we document for the first time the interaction of U2AF65 with transcription complexes. Thus, as shown by the capacity of the RNA Pol II-containing complex to support splicing complex formation, all the components required for committing a pair of splice sites are part of the complex. However, the complex preparation cannot support splicing of a pre-mRNA, as if it is lacking one (or some) component(s) of the spliceosome. The identity of the splicing factor(s) that is lacking from the complex remains unknown. As is the case for the polyadenylation factor CPSF (25Dantonel J.-C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Tora L. Nature. 1997; 389: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we propose that CTD phosphorylation may trigger the transfer of splicing factors from the non-CTD site to the phosphorylated CTD (see Fig. 6 for a model). Splicing factors may then escort the elongating RNA Pol II until they are loaded onto the nascent pre-mRNA when appropriate RNA sites emerge from the elongating enzyme. While our results suggest that the coupling between transcription and splicing occurs before transcription is initiated, it is difficult to envision how the initial loading of splicing factors can sustain the splicing of multiple introns on a single pre-mRNA. An attractive possibility is that the non-CTD portion of the RNA Pol II-containing complex that interacts with splicing factors facilitates the continuous recruitment of splicing factors to the elongating enzyme as previous sets of splicing factors are transferred to the CTD (see Fig. 6). Because the CTD and the RNA exit channel are closely juxtaposed in the initiation complex (39Douziech M. Forget D. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19868-19873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), transit through the CTD may facilitate their unloading to the nascent pre-mRNA. If not loaded rapidly after transcription, secondary structure formation on the pre-mRNA may compromise the recognition of splicing signals by splicing factors. The association of splicing factors with a RNA Pol II-containing complex capable of initiating transcription also suggests that transcription initiation may play a critical role in the control of splicing. Consistent with this view, Cramer et al. (41Cramer P. Caceres C.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 42Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have shown that the identity of the promoter can influence the SR-dependent alternative splicing of a fibronectin pre-mRNA. Although recent studies have linked such effects to differences in the processivity of polymerase complexes (43Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Mak H.Y. Proudfoot N.J. Smith C.W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 44Kadener S. Cramer P. Nogues G. Cazalla D. de La Mata M. Fededa J.P. Werbajh S.E. Srebrow A. Kornblihtt A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5759-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it remains possible that various forms of RNA Pol II-containing complexes with different subsets of splicing factors may be recruited to different promoters in preparation for the accurate regulation of downstream splicing events. However, regulatory splicing factors that are recruited in initiation complexes may be used in the constitutive splicing of introns before the transcription machinery reaches the alternative splicing unit. The continuous recruitment of the same subset of regulatory splicing factors may be achieved if the assembly of transcription initiation complexes localizes transcription sites near regions that are specifically enriched in such factors. Thus, the model posits that the identity of the splicing regulators would be determined by interactions with transcription factors bound to the promoter. During transcription elongation, the phosphorylated CTD portion of RNA Pol II would act as a transit platform, essential for the efficient downloading of splicing factors to the nascent pre-mRNA.

After synthesis in the cytosol, chloroplast targeted precursor proteins are recognized by outer envelope receptors Toc34 and Toc159. Phosphorylation plays an important role in regulation of Toc34 activity and preprotein binding. Using kinase renaturation assays, we have identified an ATP-dependent 98-kDa outer envelope kinase which is able to selectively phosphorylate Toc34 at a specific site. A 70-kDa outer envelope polypeptide phosphorylating Toc159 was identified by the same strategy. Antiserum against the 98-kDa kinase inhibits phosphorylation of Toc34, whereas labeling of Toc159 remains unaffected. Both kinases do not autophosphorylate in vitroand are unable to utilize myelin basic protein as substrate.

Using kinase renaturation assays, we have identified an ATP-dependent 98-kDa outer envelope kinase which is able to selectively phosphorylate Toc34 at a specific site. A 70-kDa outer envelope polypeptide phosphorylating Toc159 was identified by the same strategy. Antiserum against the 98-kDa kinase inhibits phosphorylation of Toc34, whereas labeling of Toc159 remains unaffected. Both kinases do not autophosphorylate in vitroand are unable to utilize myelin basic protein as substrate. We propose that distinct kinases are involved in regulation of chloroplast import via desensitization of preprotein receptors. N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine myelin basic protein mitogen-activated protein polyvinylidene difluoride guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate precursor of the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase During evolution, chloroplasts have transferred the majority of their genes to the nucleus (1Martin W. Herrmann R.G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). This gene transfer required the genesis of novel regulatory and targeting mechanisms, which enabled the nuclear encoded proteins an efficient and faithful return to the organelle. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that protein phosphorylation and protein kinases play an important role in regulation and fine-tuning of protein translocation into various subcellular compartments. Upon translation in the cytosol, chloroplast, but not mitochondrial or peroxisomal, preprotein targeting sequences are phosphorylated by a specific protein kinase (2Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated preproteins engage an oligomeric guidance complex consisting of a 14-3-3 protein dimer and a cytosolic Hsp70 (3May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enclosed within this complex, preproteins represent highly import-competent substrates. Translocation is initiated by tethering of the guidance complex to the chloroplast outer envelope (3May T. Soll J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sohrt K. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recognition and binding of preproteins is performed by two integral receptor subunits of the translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts (Toc complex) Toc159 and Toc34 (5Keegstra K. Froehlich J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both proteins have distinct nucleotide binding sites. Phosphorylation appears to play a role in the regulation of Toc34 receptor function (6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between unphosphorylated Toc34 in its GTP-bound state and the precursor form of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit could be demonstrated in vitro (6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the phosphorylated state, Toc34 can not bind GTP, with a concomitant strong decrease in its capacity to interact with precursor proteins (6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of Toc159. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the initial binding of at least some preproteins by Toc159 can be bypassed (7Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), pointing toward different specificities of the receptor subunits or indicating that Toc34 acts as a key receptor. It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation specifically down-regulates the nuclear import pathways mediated by importin B and transportin (8Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Target of this regulation is most probably a nucleoporin, rather than some other receptor or soluble component playing a role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Further evidence for the involvement of protein phosphorylation in regulation of translocation into other cellular compartments exists (9Walter J. Fluhrer R. Hartung B. Willem M. Kaether C. Cappell A. Lammich S. Multhaup G. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14634-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and several soluble protein kinases have been proposed to play a role in these processes (10Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound, or even peripherally associated, protein kinase activities that could account for phosphorylation of translocation machinery components remain enigmatic. Although Toc34 and a 86-kDa proteolytic fragment of Toc159 are between the most prominently phosphorylated outer envelope proteins, several additional phosphoproteins have also been reported (12Soll J. Planta. 1985; 166: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and attempts have been made to purify and characterize enzymes involved in the phosphorylation (13Soll J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 898-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Soll J. Fischer I. Keegstra K. Planta. 1988; 176: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Complex phosphorylation pattern of outer envelope polypeptides and requirements for both ATP and GTP implicated the existence of multiple protein kinases associated with this membrane. Indeed, a GTP-dependent phosphorylation was proposed to be mediated by an envelope kinase of the casein kinase II-type (14Soll J. Fischer I. Keegstra K. Planta. 1988; 176: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas an ATP-dependent 70-kDa kinase was shown to operate independent of cyclic nucleotides, calcium, or calmodulin (13Soll J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 898-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role and significance of various phosphoproteins as well as the substrate specificity of involved kinases remained, however, elusive. In this study, we present evidence for the existence of a chloroplast outer envelope ATP-dependent protein kinase, which can phosphorylate Toc34 receptor with high specificity. The 98-kDa kinase behaves as an integral membrane protein, and we propose it is abona fide candidate for the regulator of this import receptor. Further, we identify Toc159 as a target of a distinct 70-kDa protein kinase activity, which does not phosphorylate Toc34. We conclude that protein import into chloroplasts could be regulated via two distinct protein kinases. The bacterial strains TOP10 and BL21(DE3) were from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). All chemicals used were from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) or Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Koeln, Germany) and Amersham Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany). Purification of pea chloroplast outer envelopes has been described previously (15Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Toc34ΔTM252-His was overexpressed and affinity purified on Talon metal affinity column (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) as described in Ref. 6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. Purified Toc34ΔTM(S113A) was a generous gift from M. Jelic and E. Schleiff. Recombinant Toc75 was produced from pET14–6xHis-Toc75 and purified according to Ref.16Sveshnikova N. Grimm R. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Proteins were electrophoretically separated over the entire width of slab gels. After staining with Coomassie, individual protein bands were excised, rinsed with water, equilibrated in buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS), and electroeluted. For internal sequencing, the protein was digested in the gel with protease LysC and peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A peptide was synthesized according to the obtained internal sequence of OEK98 with addition of a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus. Two hundred and fifty mg of thiol-activated Sepharose (Sigma) were washed three times in buffer A (20 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Four mg of peptide, dissolved in 500 μl of buffer A, were added to the pelleted resin and incubated over night at 4 °C with agitation. This resin was used for four consecutive steps of rabbit immunization. The serum was purified with pulverized Escherichia coli proteins to reduce cross-reactivity. Ten μg of outer envelope vesicles were resuspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer (10 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 MnCl2, 20 mmTricine1-KOH, pH 7.6), supplemented with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli loading buffer, and proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation with [γ-32P]GTP was performed in the same manner. Radioactively labeled polypeptides were detected by autoradiography using x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat) or a Fuji FLR-5000 phosphorimager. Fifty μg of outer envelopes were phosphorylated as described above. Membranes were solubilized with 2% SDS, boiled for 2 min, and diluted 10 times with IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA,1% Nonidet P-40). Antiserum against purified 86-kDa fragment of Toc159 was added in a ratio of 1:150 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. One hundred μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 3 h under constant agitation. The antibody-Sepharose conjugate was pelleted and washed three times with IP buffer and once again with IP buffer without Nonidet P-40. Proteins were released from the matrix by adding Laemmli loading buffer, boiling for 2 min, and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactively labeled proteins were detected by phosphorimager. Renaturation of kinase activity was carried out according to a modified protocol from Ref. 17Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Methods Enzimol. 1986; 200: 421-435Google Scholar. Outer envelope fractions were separated in 12.5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then incubated in denaturation buffer (7 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). After rinsing in washing solution 1 (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), proteins were renatured overnight at 4 °C in renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 μmCaCl2, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Buffer was supplemented with either 0.05% (v/v) casein (5% dephosphorylated solution, Sigma) or phosvitin (w/v). Specific substrates and synthetic peptides were supplemented in the amount of 20 ng/cm2 of the membrane. During this step the kinase substrate bound to the membrane. The membrane was then saturated with blocking solution (5% (w/v) BSA, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in which 1.2% unspecific or 50 ng/cm2 specific substrates were supplemented. Phosphorylation was performed for 1 h at room temperature in reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 80 μm CaCl2, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Upon completion, the membrane was washed twice with washing solution 1, once with washing solution 2 (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), and again in washing solution 1. Loosely bound [γ-32P]ATP was removed by incubation of the membrane in 1 m KOH for 10 min. The membrane was neutralized with washing solution 1, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film or a phosphorimaging plate. For in-gel renaturation, outer envelope extracts containing 10 μg of protein were fractionated in an 12.5% SDS-PAGE containing 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP). Protein denaturing, renaturing, and kinase activity assays in the gel were performed as described (18Kovtun Y. Chiu W.-L. Zeng W. Sheen J. Nature. 1998; 395: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of outer envelope proteins were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membrane. Membrane stripes containing OEK98 were excised, and protein kinase activity was renatured as described above. Stripes were then saturated with blocking solution containing either Toc34ΔTM or Toc34ΔTM(S113A) at concentration of 17 μg/ml, and phosphorylation was performed as described using 1.25 μg of ATP. Blocking solution was removed by a short wash with washing solution 1, and the stripes were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (1.175 Ci/mmol) labeled precursor of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit (preSSU) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1.25 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTPγS). After 20 min of incubation at 22 °C, unbound preSSU was removed by two rounds of extensive washing with the binding buffer. The amount of bound preSSU was quantified by scintillation counting. Control experiments were performed in the same manner, except the kinase activity of OEK98 has not been restored by the renaturation step. Phosphorylation was quantified from phosphorimaging data using Aida Image Analyser version 3.10 analysis software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Certain proteins contained within chloroplast outer envelope membranes can be phosphorylated by endogenous kinase(s) in vitro. At least a dozen different phosphoproteins can be resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography following a 15-min incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.1 A; Ref. 12Soll J. Planta. 1985; 166: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The most conspicuously phosphorylated proteins are in the molecular mass range of 86, 34, and 16 kDa. The 34-kDa phosphoprotein has recently been identified as the preprotein import receptor Toc34. Labeling in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP resulted only in one prominent phosphoprotein above 100 kDa, whereas the 86-, 34-, and 16-kDa proteins are much more weakly labeled (Fig. 1 A). The possibility that the 86-kDa polypeptide could be a proteolytic fragment of the preprotein import receptor Toc159 prompted further investigations. We have previously established (19Bölter B. May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that antibodies raised against a purified 86-kDa protein, formerly designated Toc86 (20Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heeymeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), efficiently immunoprecipitate Toc159 from the outer envelope preparations. The serum recognizes proteolytic fragments of Toc159 as well as Toc34 (19Bölter B. May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The latter is caused by a stretch of high sequence similarity around the putative nucleotide binding domain (15Seedorf M. Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heeymeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 21Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed after phosphorylation of 50 μg of outer envelope proteins with [γ-32P]ATP. The immunopellet contained mostly the phosphorylated 86-kDa proteolytic fragment of Toc159 and little intact receptor (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylated Toc34 could also be detected. Toc159 is most probably labeled on serine or threonine residues, because phosphorylation proved to be resistant to both alkali or acid treatments (Fig. 1 C). This is consistent with previous results, which demonstrated that the prevailing labeling of outer envelope proteins is on serine or threonine residues (13Soll J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 898-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the envelope-localized Toc159 and Toc34 kinase(s), a renaturation assay was performed using SDS-PAGE separated proteins. Twenty μg of outer envelope proteins were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. First we performed renaturation assays in the presence of the unspecific kinase substrates casein and phosvitin, using both [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP as phosphodonors. After extensive washing of unbound or loosely bound nucleoside triphosphate and denaturation with KOH, only those components that are able to transfer the phosphate group to itself or the surrounding substrate can be detected. No kinase activity could be detected in the outer envelopes under these conditions (Fig.2 A). This result indicated either that the renaturation assay failed or that the outer envelope kinases have a high substrate specificity. A positive control renaturation (Fig. 2 A), performed with commercially available catalytic subunit of bovine heart protein kinase, favors the latter idea. Therefore, heterologously expressed and purified Toc34 (Toc34ΔTM) was used as a substrate. This protein lacks the transmembrane domain at its COOH terminus, but contains the cytosolic nucleoside triphosphate binding domain as well as the proposed phosphorylation site. After overexpression, the protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a Talon affinity matrix (Fig. 2 B) and used as a substrate in kinase renaturation assays. Autoradiography revealed a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 98 kDa (Fig. 2 C) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP but not [γ-32P]GTP as the phosphodonor. This correlates with the results of the in vitro phosphorylation assays (Fig. 1 A). We conclude that Toc34 is phosphorylated in an ATP-dependent fashion by a putative kinase of 98 kDa molecular mass. To further address the substrate specificity of the 98-kDa kinase, we then asked if this polypeptide is able to phosphorylate Toc159, specifically the 86-kDa proteolytic fragment, which itself is an excellent phosphorylation substrate (Fig. 1 A). The 86-kDa peptide was prepared from high resolution SDS-PAGE of separated outer envelope proteins (Fig.2 D). The polypeptide was electroeluted from gel slices, concentrated, and used as a substrate in renaturation assays. The 98-kDa kinase failed to phosphorylate the substrate and was accordingly not detected. Instead, an additional 70-kDa protein was elicited (Fig.2 C). Again, only ATP but not GTP can serve as a phosphodonor. Toc75, the preprotein translocation channel and most abundant translocon subunit, however, failed to serve as a substrate for both renatured protein kinases (Fig. 2 C). This further indicates the specificity for the preprotein receptors Toc34 and Toc159. We designated the two identified protein kinase activities OEK98 and OEK70, for outer envelopekinase of 98 and 70 kDa, respectively. The phosphorylation site of pea Toc34 was determined and shown to be positioned at serine 113. 2E. Schleiff and J. Soll, unpublished data. The amino acid sequence around Ser-113 does not resemble any other canonical phosphorylation motif found in the PROSITE data base. This indicates that the Toc34 kinase may not belong to a conventional protein kinase class. To further test OEK98 selectivity and to establish the minimum motif requirements for phosphorylation, we used a synthetic peptide matching the sequence of the phosphorylation site. The peptide (DMALNIIKSFLLDKT) contains Ser-113 at position 9, surrounded by a hydrophobic pocket. Kinase renaturation assays supplemented with the peptide revealed that OEK98 can efficiently phosphorylate this substrate, whereas OEK70 activity remained undetected (Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility that phosphorylation occurred unspecifically, we offered an arbitrary peptide (TTSKYTSVLPLGORVLIC), containing two serine residues at position 3 and 7. The substrate was not recognized (Fig. 3) by any of the two kinases, indicating the phosphorylation specificity. To further establish the OEK98 selectivity, Ser-113 in Toc34ΔTM was exchanged for an alanine residue, resulting in Toc34ΔTM(S113A). The protein was overexpressed, purified, and used in renaturation experiments. OEK98 failed to accept this substrate (Fig.3), further indicating that other serine residues contained within the Toc34 sequence can not serve as alternative phosphorylation sites. Regulation of protein translocation into chloroplasts can be envisioned as a part of a signal transduction cascade, linking the organelle with cytoplasmic and nuclear events. Certain members of the MAP kinase family have been implicated in regulation of protein trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Cyert M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20805-20808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The intriguing possibility of OEK98 and OEK70 being related to MAP kinases prompted us to investigate whether they can phosphorylate MBP, a specific substrate for this protein kinase subclass. For this purpose, in-gel renaturation assays were carried out. Both OEK98 and OEK70 failed, however, to phosphorylate MBP under given conditions, suggesting that they are probably not related to the members of MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 3). To test if OEK98 is an integral or peripheral membrane protein, outer envelope membranes were extracted using different salt and urea treatments. Soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation, and kinase activity was assayed by renaturation experiments using Toc34ΔTM as a substrate. In every case we observed the OEK98 activity exclusively in the membrane fractions (Fig.4 A). This strongly suggests that OEK98 is an integral membrane protein. The membrane association properties of OEK98 are comparable with those of Toc64 (Fig.4 A), an integral component of the outer envelope translocon (4Sohrt K. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Toc34 phosphorylation site is located within a large hydrophilic, cytoplasmic-exposed domain. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the catalytic domain of OEK98 is also oriented in the similar manner. To test this assumption, outer envelope membranes, which are isolated as right-side-out vesicles (22Waegemann K. Eichacker L. Soll J. Planta. 1992; 187: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin and membrane fractions were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. Activity of OEK98 was subsequently assayed by kinase renaturation in the presence of Toc34ΔTM. Low concentrations of trypsin resulted in the accumulation of a major 55-kDa proteolytic fragment, which still exhibited kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). An additional minor band at ∼60 kDa could also be detected. Treatments with higher protease concentrations diminished the kinase activity present in the membrane fraction with simultaneous occurrence of a soluble 14-kDa fragment still possessing kinase activity (Fig. 4 B, indicated by an arrowhead). After proteolysis with 10 ng of trypsin, the phosphorylation activity was completely abolished in both the membrane and the soluble fractions. Together, our data indicate that the kinase domain of OEK98 is exposed to the cytosol and can be released by protease treatment. Both membrane extraction and protease digestion experiments were performed for OEK70 membrane association properties; however, kinase activity could not be restored after any of these treatments (data not shown). To obtain further information about the OEK98 identity, we purified the protein from outer envelope preparations and subjected it to microsequencing. The position of OEK98 protein was identified in high resolution SDS-PAGE, the protein was excised and enriched. To asses the purity and homogeneity of the sample, extracted protein was further resolved onto high resolution acrylamide gels. The kinase activity of isolated protein was checked by renaturation. The resulting polypeptide band was digested with the protease LysC, and internal fragments were sequenced. Two of the obtained amino acid sequences were further analyzed. The shorter sequence KVIDESI matches the sequence KVIDENI found in Bacillus subtilis stage 0 sporulation protein F. Interestingly, this protein is a member of a bacterial signal transduction machinery known as the two-component system (23Chang C. Stewart R.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The longer sequence KVENLELQVAGLQ shows high scoring sequence similarity with an ascidian mannose-binding lectin, yeast peroxisome ATPase PAY4, and bacterial ferric uptake regulation proteins (Fig. 5 A). This sequence was used for production of a synthetic peptide. The peptide, containing an additional cysteine at the carboxyl terminus, was then coupled with thiol-Sepharose resin and used as an antigen. The serum (anti-OEK98) was used for immunoblot analyses of outer envelope preparations and other chloroplast subfractions (Fig. 5 B). A single immunoreactive band with apparent molecular mass of 98 kDa could be detected in outer envelope vesicles (Fig. 5 B). A minor cross-reactive protein in inner envelopes was also detected at the same position, indicating a slight cross-contamination with outer envelopes (Fig. 5 B, lane IE) (24Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The serum was used further to investigate whether the kinase activity of OEK98 could be inhibited by the antibody. Fig. 6shows that preincubation of outer envelope vesicles with anti-OEK98 inhibited Toc34 phosphorylation. Anti-OEK98 reduced Toc34 phosphorylation by ∼70% in comparison to envelopes treated with preimmune serum. In contrast, anti-OEK98 had little effect on Toc159 phosphorylation when compared with preimmune serum-treated outer envelope vesicles. We observed comparable inhibition rates of Toc34 labeling when we performed outer envelope phosphorylation experiments in which anti-OEK98 was directly added to the reaction in a ratio of 1:100 (data not shown). These data further substantiate the concept of two kinases, which can selectively phosphorylate the two import receptors.Figure 6An antiserum against OEK98 peptide can inhibit phosphorylation of Toc34 but not of Toc159. Ten μg of outer envelope proteins were preincubated with 1 mg/ml preimmune serum (PS) or anti-OEK98 serum for 60 min on ice. Vesicles were pelleted, and phosphorylation was performed for 15 min in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation efficiency was quantified from phosphorimaging data. The histogram represents the mean from five different experiments. Bars represent minimum and maximum values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish the functional link between phosphorylation of Toc34 at Ser-113 and the preprotein recognition, we used renatured OEK98 activity to phosphorylate Toc34 and then analyzed the binding of radiolabeled preSSU. Nonphosphorylatable Toc34ΔTM(S113A) was used in a control experiment. When the OEK98 activity is not re-established by renaturation, both Toc34ΔTM and Toc34ΔTM(S113A) have comparable affinity for the preSSU (Fig. 7). This demonstrates that the exchange of serine 113 to alanine does not change Toc34 structure in a way that would influence its ability to recognize and bind precursor protein. Upon phosphorylation of Toc34ΔTM by OEK98, the binding of preSSU is reduced by ∼50% as compared with Toc34ΔTM(S113A) (Fig. 7). This is a strong indication that phosphorylation of Toc34 at Ser-113 has a specific effect on Toc34 function, namely the preprotein binding. In recent years, a considerable amount of evidence about molecular and structural properties of the chloroplast preprotein import machinery has accumulated. Much is known about energetic and chaperone requirements necessary for efficient translocation across both chloroplast envelope membranes. In contrast, our knowledge about regulatory checkpoints and auxiliary components involved in import regulation remains scarce. Recently, it has been demonstrated that protein phosphorylation plays an important role in regulation of a preprotein receptor Toc34 (6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This finding led us to investigate the nature of the protein kinase(s) involved in this process. When we performed phosphorylation assays of outer envelope preparations in the presence of radioactive ATP, we observed strong phosphorylation of not only Toc34, but also of the 86-kDa proteolytic peptide of Toc159. Thus, both preprotein receptors are likely to undergo regulation by phosphorylation. Both GTP and preprotein binding of Toc34 are inhibited after phosphorylation (6Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which implies that the kinase involved in this process is an important regulator of preprotein translocation into photosynthetic organelles. It is reasonable to conclude that functional properties of Toc159 are regulated in a similar manner. Because conventional phosphorylation assays cannot distinguish between substrate phosphorylation and possible kinase autophosphorylation, they are not suitable in the search for kinases. They can also create a considerable amount of confusion and ambiguity as to the real identity of kinase substrates (25Sokolenko A. Fulgosi H. Gal A. Altschmied L. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have employed functional renaturation assays in a search for outer envelope kinases. This approach has so far been successfully used in several investigations of other chloroplast protein kinases (25Sokolenko A. Fulgosi H. Gal A. Altschmied L. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Baginsky S. Tiller K. Link G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 34: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Renaturations in the presence of unspecific substrates failed to show kinase activity in outer envelopes, but simultaneously demonstrated that, at leastin vitro, no protein from this chloroplast subfraction is able to autophosphorylate. Previous studies (13Soll J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 898-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also demonstrated that protein kinases of outer envelopes are selective in substrate specificity. Casein, phosvitin, and histones II-S were poorly accepted, or not at all. This observations and our findings prompted us to use more specific substrates. Subsequently, the activity of a 98-kDa kinase could be restored to detectable levels only in the presence of Toc34 as the substrate and ATP as the phosphodonor. Similarly, the Toc159 kinase is elicited only when we offer the 86-kDa peptide as a substrate and ATP as a phosphodonor. Several lines of evidence indicate the substrate specificity of OEK98 and OEK70. First, none of the tested unspecific substrates could be utilized by the kinases. Also, specific substrates could not be interchanged between the kinases and therefore, each renaturation assay possessed an build-in control experiment. Second, recombinant Toc34 protein harboring a modified phosphorylation site was not accepted as a substrate. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the determined phosphorylation site in Toc34 was efficiently utilized. On the other hand, an arbitrary peptide or Toc75, containing several serine residues, could not be used as an alternative substrate. Third, antibodies generated against a peptide derived from an internal peptide sequence of OEK98 efficiently blocked phosphorylation of Toc34, whereas labeling of Toc159 remained unaffected. However, the latter experiment must be interpreted with caution because we have not used Fab fragments and therefore cannot rule out unspecific cross-linking. Additionally, it is possible that OEK98 is in closer proximity to Toc34 than to Toc159, so the inhibitory effect could be more pronounced for Toc34. The active kinase domain is located in the cytoplasmically exposed region of OEK98 and can be released as a 14-kDa soluble peptide. As an intermediate in this proteolytic degradation pattern, we observed a 55-kDa fragment, which was still membrane-bound but seemed to have increased enzymatic activity. It is tempting to speculate that this fragment contains the catalytic domain that is rendered into a more active state because of the lack of a regulatory domain, which has been digested away. Similar examples of increased catalytic activity upon proteolysis exist in other systems and usually lead to a constitutive activation of the kinase (27Takahashi M. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11566-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Khwaja A. Tatton L. Blood. 1999; 94: 291-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cross T. Griffiths G. Deacon E. Sallis R. Gough M. Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Already, the size of OEK98 could be an indicator of its receptor-kinase nature (30Torii K.U. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Receptor-protein kinases in this molecular size range have been reported previously in plant cells (31Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, this is the first report of high molecular weight protein kinases being associated with photosynthetic organelles. However, one argument that speaks against a possible receptor-protein kinase nature of both OEK70 and OEK98 is an apparent lack of their autophosphorylation activity. This has also been noticed in previous studies describing the 70-kDa outer envelope kinase (13Soll J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 898-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both kinases failed to phosphorylate myelin basic protein, and are therefore unlikely members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, they could still be a part of a different signal transduction circuit, linking chloroplasts with the cytosol and the nucleus. Located at the outer surface of chloroplasts, OEK98 and OEK70 could lie upstream of various signal transduction pathways, synchronizing protein import into organelles with translation and, eventually, transcription of nuclear encoded plastid proteins. The inactivation of import receptors by phosphorylation suggests that cells have evolved mechanisms to regulate almost the entire chloroplast protein transport pathway. The preprotein recognition of both Toc159 and Toc34 could be differentially regulated via OEK70 and OEK98. Recently, it has been shown that Toc34 is most probably a major preprotein receptor, because the recognition capacity of Toc159 could be bypassed in vitro (7Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can have a profound effect on the biological function, selectivity, and sensitivity of the import receptors. It is possible that the functional state of the kinases can be adopted by reception of regulatory signals coming from either the organelle or the cytosol, depending on the overall requirements of the cell. The nuclear encoded plastid proteins may require different import rates, depending on the stage of plastid development, physiological states of the cell, or conditions under which photosynthesis is performed. The process of desensitization, which requires phosphorylation of a receptor rendering it insensitive for a given agonist (32Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), may be responsible for granting certain proteins a higher order of import priority. Polypeptides that are less important for the proper chloroplast function under, for example, rapidly changing environmental conditions, would therefore not interfere with the transport of essential components. Such a mechanism could be concerted with short term adaptation mechanisms (33Vener A.V. Ohad I. Andersson B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), maintaining a steady state of multisubunit photosynthetic complexes before transcription and translation processes are re-modulated to meet a new demand. The kinases could themselves be perceptive for particular protein requirements or could be regulated by a still unknown mechanism. The identification of auxiliary components involved in import regulation and, in particular, elucidation of the signal transduction mechanisms connecting import with physiological responses are important emerging topics of current research in the protein translocation field.

The FSPs of several sea urchin species are linear polymers of 1 → 3-linked α-l-fucose with species-specific patterns ofO-sulfation (7Vilela-Silva A.C. Alves A.P. Valente A.P. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The pattern of sulfation is what makes FSP a species-specific inducer of the AR (8Alves A.P. Mulloy B.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FSP induces the sequential activation of two sperm calcium channels. The first channel, which is transiently opened, is blocked by dihydropyridines (10Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second channel, which is insensitive to dihydropyridines, allows a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) that triggers the AR (11Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. de De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The second channel may be a store-operated channel that is dependent for activation on the increase in intracellular pH (pHi (11Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. de De La Torre L. Zapata O.

Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies to suREJ1 induce the AR, and purified suREJ1 neutralizes FSP as an inducer of the AR (15Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Sea urchin sperm suREJ3 is a 2681-amino acid orphan receptor that localizes exclusively to the cell membrane covering the sperm acrosomal vesicle. suREJ1 and suREJ3 share significant homology with each other and with the human polycystin-1 family (the protein mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (17Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). Although ligands binding suREJ3 remain unknown, it is reasonable to assume that suREJ3 is somehow involved in AR induction. EJ contains several high molecular weight components. Although purified FSP, devoid of amino acids, induces all the ion channel events triggering the AR (6SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev.

Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggested that other EJ macromolecules may also be involved in secondary or redundant signal transduction pathways leading to the AR. For example, protease treatment of EJ, which has no effect on FSP, was found to decrease the AR inducing activity of EJ by as much as 50% (18Ishihara K. Dan J.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 1970; 12: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu T. Kinoh H. Yamaguchi M. Suzuki N. Dev. Growth Differ. 1990; 32: 473-487Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Treatment of EJ with sodium metaperiodate decreased AR activity but left FSP intact (18Ishihara K. Dan J.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 1970; 12: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Treatment of EJ with peptide-N-glycosidase-F releases N-linked oligosaccharides from EJ and decreases its AR activity (20Keller S.H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Growth Differ. 1994; 36: 551-556Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results, and other conflicts in the literature (21Keller S.H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), caused us to revisit the question of the role of the oligosaccharide fraction of EJ in AR induction. Here we present data showing that β-elimination of total EJ, followed by DEAE chromatography and electrodialysis, separates the sialic acid-rich high molecular mass glycans from FSP. This fraction has no AR activity of its own. However, it greatly potentiates the FSP-induced AR, indicating that it works through a receptor pathway that is different from the FSP pathway. The sialoglycan fraction appears to elevate sperm pHi, suggesting that its ultimate target might be the Na+/H+ exchanger responsible for the pHi increase (3Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Treatment of sialoglycans with neuraminidase or mild metaperiodate that specifically destroys sialic acid renders the fraction inactive. This is the first direct evidence for the involvement of sialic acid as a ligand in the induction of the animal sperm AR. Fura-2 AM, BCECF-AM, and nigericin were from Molecular Probes. Rhodizonic acid disodium and l-ascorbic acid were from Aldrich. Ionomycin and NeuAc were from Calbiochem. 1,9-Dimethylmethylene blue was from Serva. Heparin, Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase, l-fucose, nifedipine, and DEAE-cellulose were from Sigma. Sepharose CL-6B was from Amersham Biosciences. Affi-Gel Hz was from Bio-Rad. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm were collected as undiluted semen by intercoelomic injection of 0.5m KCl and kept on ice. Eggs were spawned into beakers filled with seawater. Preparation of crude EJ was described (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparation and fractionation of EJ oligo/polysaccharides were performed as described (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude EJ, dialyzed against deionized water, was subjected to β-elimination (0.05 nKOH, 1 m NaBH4, 45 °C for 24 h), diluted with 4× of acetate buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0), and the pH adjusted to 5.0 by addition of 2 macetic acid. The solution containing EJ oligo/polysaccharides was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in the above acetate buffer. The column (1.4 × 6 cm) was then washed with 10× acetate buffer. Bound materials were eluted with a 0–3 m NaCl gradient in acetate buffer. Each 3-ml fraction was tested for negatively charged polysaccharides by the metachromatic assay (23Terho T.T. Hartiala K. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The fractions containing sialoglycans eluted between 0 and 1 mNaCl. They were pooled and sialoglycans precipitated by addition of 3× 95% ethanol. FSP eluted between 1.5 and 2.5 m NaCl and was precipitated by adding 1× 95% ethanol. Both sialoglycan and FSP precipitates were then sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatants were decanted, and the centrifuge tubes were air-dried. For FSP, the pellet was dissolved in deionized water (dH2O) and dialyzed overnight against dH2O at 4 °C. For some experiments (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), the sialoglycan fraction was further purified by electrodialysis. For electrodialysis, the sample was placed in a Centricon YM-10 cartridge (10-kDa cut-off; Amicon), and the cartridge was placed in the electrodialysis apparatus (Centrilutor, Amicon) and filled with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The sample was subjected to 1 watt for 4 h at room temperature. After electrodialysis, sialoglycans remaining in the cartridge were recovered and dialyzed against dH2O. The Sepharose CL-6B column (1.2 × 60 cm) was equilibrated with Millipore filtered seawater. The sample was applied, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were tested in the metachromatic assay for negatively charged polysaccharides, the thiobarbituric acid assay for sialic acid (24Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), the Dische-Shettle cysteine assay for fucose (25Dische Z. Shettles L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 192: 579-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sperm AR potentiation assay. Sialogycans in the concentration range equivalent to 0.1–1 mg of heparin/ml (metachromatic assay) were placed in acetate buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, 4 mmCaCl2, pH 5.5) and V. cholerae neuraminidase (0.3 units/mg of sialoglycans) added, and the reaction tube was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10× quenching buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), and the released sialic acid was removed by electrodialysis using Centricon YM-10 cartridges. Sialogycans were treated with NaIO4 to truncate specifically the glycerol side chain of sialic acid (26Lenten L.V. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sialoglycans were treated with 2 mmNaIO4 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min on ice in the dark. This reaction mixture was immediately used for cross-linking to Affi-Gel Hz. For biological assays of mild metaperiodate treated sialoglycans, the resulting aldehyde of sialic acid was reduced with 10 mm NaBH4 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h on ice in the dark. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed overnight against seawater at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot of Affi-Gel Hz beads was washed twice with 20× dH2O. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was discarded. Fifty μl of solution containing mild periodate-treated sialogycans was mixed continuously with the beads for 30 min at room temperature (total volume 100 μl). The beads were sedimented by centrifugation, and the supernatant was recovered. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of high salt buffer (2 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. The beads were then resuspended in 50 μl of acetate buffer and heated to 100 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation. The supernatants recovered after different washes were tested in the metachromatic assay and the thiobarbituric acid assay. Sperm intracellular Ca2+ and pH were measured as described (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh, undiluted semen was suspended in 4× dye loading buffer (450 mm NaCl, 9 mm KCl, 48 mmMgSO4, 6 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.0). The suspension was gently mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, final concentration 0.6%) containing either fura-2 AM or BCECF-AM at a final concentration of 12 μm, and the tube was incubated on ice at least 8 h before washing. To remove free dye, sperm were sedimented by centrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor at 430 × gfor 7 min. The supernatants were removed, and 9× dye loading buffer was added, followed by gently mixing until the pellet of sperm was completely resuspended. This washing procedure was repeated 3 times. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 4× dye loading buffer without soybean trypsin inhibitor and stored on ice in the dark. For the measurements, 50 μl of fura-2 loaded sperm (2 × 108cells/ml) or 10 μl of BCECF loaded sperm were placed in an 11-mm diameter round bottomed-glass tube containing 1.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES-buffered-Millipore filtered seawater, pH 8.0 (HEPES-SW). The tube was mounted in a temperature-controlled cell holder (16 °C) in a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer (JOBIN YVON-SPEX), and the fluorescence at excitation/emission wavelength pairs of 380/500 and 340/500 nm (for fura-2) and 490/510 and 440/510 nm (for BCECF) were recorded while continuously stirred with a micromagnetic bar. Fura-2 signals were calibrated to the ratio of 340/380 nm and presented as the increased [Ca2+]i/K d value or Δ[Ca2+]i/K d (27Kao J.P.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) obtained after 5 min of recording. The calibration of pHi was performed as described (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide analyses were done by Glycobiology Core Resource, Glycobiology Research and Training Center (University of California, San Diego). The DEAE-fractionated (dSG) and electrodialyzed (eSG) sialoglycan fractions were hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates were then analyzed by high pH anion-exchange (HPAE) chromatography on a Dionex CarboPac PA-10 or PA-1 column with pulsed amperometoric detector. Standard mixtures of monosaccharides were run in parallel to calibrate HPAE retention times and to allow qualifications. The AR was evaluated by scoring the number of acrosome intact and reacted sperm under a phase contrast microscope at 1200× magnification (16Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of sperm suspension that was freshly diluted 50-fold in ice-cold HEPES-SW was mixed in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube with 30 μl of HEPES-SW containing the test compound at 16 °C. After 5 min sperm were fixed with 40 μl of 6% glutaraldehyde in HEPES-SW. For the AR potentiation assay, the concentration of FSP resulting in 10–20% AR was determined. FSP at this concentration was then mixed with sialoglycans in the range of 0–25 μg of heparin equivalent/ml. These mixtures were then tested in the AR assay. EJ was subjected to β-elimination which released theO-linked oligosaccharides and FSP from total EJ. The EJ oligosaccharides were then separated from FSP by DEAE chromatography. Each eluted fraction was tested in the metachromatic assay for negatively charged glycans such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (28Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) and sulfated fucans (9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The first peak appeared in the fractions at∼0.7 m NaCl (Fig.1 A). Monosaccharide compositional analysis of this sharp peak showed that it contained two major constituents: N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc; 78.5% of total sugar) and fucose (12.3% of total sugar; TableI). The high molar ratio of NeuGc to fucose suggests the presence of polysialic acid in this fraction (4Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Troy F.A. Cho J.W. Lennarz W.J. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22712-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metachromatic assay is a novel method for the detection of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, so the first peak was examined for uronic acid. Neither glucuronic acid nor galacturonic acid was detected (Table I). This first peak is hereafter referred to as the DEAE-purified sialoglycans (dSG). The second broad peak eluting at 1.6–2.5m NaCl is FSP as determined in previous experiments (6SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A.

The elution profile of the FSP peak has a shoulder, which probably represents the two isotypes of FSP present in S. purpuratusEJ that differ in sulfate content (9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fractions 16–20, representing the dSG peak, and fractions 40–75, representing the FSP peak, were pooled, and both pools were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was stained with 0.1% toluidine blue (Fig.1 B). Samples were equalized on the basis of heparin equivalents as determined by the metachromatic assay. FSP appeared as a smear in the high molecular mass range, whereas no staining appeared in the dSG lane. Because toluidine blue stains the fragmented FSP (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the lack of stain in the dSG lane does not represent the degradation of FSP.Table IMonosaccharide composition analyses of EJ sialoglycan fractionsMonosaccharidedSGeSGmolar ratio1-aThe error margins in the values are ±10%.Fucose1.001-bArbitrarily set to 1.00.1.001-bArbitrarily set to 1.00.Mannose/xylose1-cThe peak in the HPAE profile may consist of a mixture of mannose and xylose.

The specific activity of purified FSP to induce the AR was examined in comparison with total EJ. Sugar concentrations of EJ and FSP were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method and are presented as hexose equivalents. Although sperm obtained from different batches differ in sensitivity of response to EJ (16Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), EJ is always a better inducer of the AR than purified FSP (Fig.2 A). In this experiment, 10 μg of hexose/ml FSP was needed to achieve 50% AR, whereas only 0.5 μg/ml total EJ induced 50% AR. Although purified FSP is an AR inducer, these data suggest that EJ contains other components that enhance AR induction. The dSG fraction was tested for AR inducing activity, alone or in combination with FSP (Fig. 2 B). EJ at 3 μg of hexose/ml induced 98% AR, whereas 1% AR occurred with only seawater as the negative control. FSP at 3 μg/ml induced 20% AR, whereas 3 μg/ml dSG induced 2%. However, when FSP and dSG (3 μg/ml each) were combined, the AR reached 95%. Decreasing both FSP and dSG to 1.5 μg/ml each resulted in 90% AR. A 5-fold increase in FSP to 15 μg/ml induced 92% AR; however, the dSG at 15 μg/ml yielded only 1% AR. These data clearly show that the dSG fraction potentiates the FSP-induced AR. The dSG fraction was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B. Fractions were tested in the metachromatic assay, and the peak was found to have an average mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig.3 A). Because the dSG fraction contains fucose at 12.3% mol of total monosaccharides (Table I), fucose content in each fraction was also determined by the Dische-Shettles cysteine method. The peak for fucose elution was identical to the peak determined by the metachromatic assay (Fig.3 B). Sepharose CL-6B fractions were further tested in the AR potentiation assay in the presence of limiting amount of FSP. The maximum activity for AR potentiation corresponded to the peak determined by the metachromatic assay (Fig. 3 C). The dSG fraction was subjected to further purification by electrodialysis. After 4 h of electrodialysis, 23% total sialic acid was removed (data not shown). A molar ratio between fucose and NeuGc was ∼1:6 (Table I). The electrodialyzed sialoglycan fraction (eSG) was tested in the AR potentiation assay. The AR specific activity of the eSG increased ∼4-fold relative to the dSG fraction when both fractions were normalized to heparin equivalents (Fig.4 A). To be specific, the concentrations of dSG or eSG that are required for 50% AR were 13.5 or 3.0 μg/ml, respectively. eSG was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B. Two peaks, one representing the metachromatic assay and the other sialic acid, closely overlapped but were not perfectly superimposable (Fig. 4 B). The eSG fractions were treated with V. cholerae neuraminidase. After a 24-h incubation, the reaction mixture was rechromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B. The peaks of metachromasia and sialic acid were now superimposable (Fig.4 C). The small peak at fraction 57 is monosialic acid released by the neuraminidase. However, the majority of sialic acid remained associated with the original glycans. The reason that the two peaks are not perfectly superimposable (Fig. 4 B) may be because of the heterogeneous sialylation of the SG molecules (4Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Troy F.A. Cho J.W. Lennarz W.J. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22712-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of sialic acid release (Fig. 4 D) shows maximum release (30% of total) by 1 h. These results show that ∼70% of total sialic acid in the eSG is neuraminidase-resistant. The parallel decreases in both metachromasia and sialic acid suggest that the glycans detected by the metachromatic assay contain sialic acid (Fig.4 D). The eSG fraction was treated with 2 mm NaIO4(mild metaperiodate) to remove the glycerol side chain and form an aldehyde in the sialic acid (26Lenten L.V. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the treatment, the aldehyde group of eSG was used to covalently couple it to Affi-Gel Hz (beads containing hydrazine groups). Using the thiobarbituric acid assay, 86.2% of total sialic acid bound to the beads. However, in the absence of NaIO4 oxidation, 34.4% bound to the beads (Fig.4 E). Using the metachromatic assay, 81.2% of total negatively charged glycans bound to the beads, whereas in the no NaIO4 control, only 11.3% bound to the beads. These data show that the metachromasia-positive glycans responsible for AR potentiation contain sialic acid. To understand the underlying mechanism of AR potentiation by sialoglycans, we first examined the effect on sperm [Ca2+]i. The eSG alone, when added to fura-2 loaded-sperm, had no effect on [Ca2+]i (Fig.5 A). FSP at 0.25 μg/ml induced 30% of the sperm to AR; these sperm showed a moderate increase in [Ca2+]i compared with that of total EJ. FSP mixed with eSG increased the percentage of AR in a concentration-dependent manner (0–10 μg/ml). However, this mixture did not significantly alter the [Ca2+]i in comparison to FSP alone. Increases in [Ca2+]i were quantified and are represented as Δ[Ca2+]i/K d as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified FSP caused a concentration-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5 B). However, eSG did not increase [Ca2+]i either in the presence or absence of FSP. These results show that sialoglycans do not up-regulate sperm Ca2+ channels. Next, we examined the effect on sperm pHi, because an increase in pHi is a crucial event in AR induction (3Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 29Garbers D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 719-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The eSG alone increased sperm pHi in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6 A). The pHi change produced by FSP was ∼3-fold greater than that produced by eSG. The FSP-induced pHi increase is known to be blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers such as nifedipine (22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or extracellular high K+ (10Guerrero A. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19593-19599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, 50 μmnifedipine, which completely blocks the opening of the first sperm Ca2+ channel (11Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. de De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), inhibited the FSP-induced pHiincrease (Fig. 6 B). The FSP-induced pHi increase was also inhibited by 50 mm K+. Three hundred mm Ni2+, which blocks the second sperm Ca2+ channel (11Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. de De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), also inhibited the FSP-induced pHi increase (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, nifedipine and 50 mm K+ were only moderately effective in blocking the eSG-induced pHi increase (Fig. 6 B). However, Ni2+ completely blocked the eSG-induced pHi increase. These data show that EJ sialoglycans induce sperm pHi increases by a different pathway than the one used by FSP.Figure 6Sialoglycans increase sperm pHi. A, changes in sperm pHi were measured at various concentrations of FSP and eSG. The increased pHi(ΔpHi) values obtained 5 min after addition of FSP (●) or eSG (○) are presented. B, 2.5 μg of heparin/ml FSP or 25 μg of heparin/ml eSG were tested in the absence or presence of 50 μm nifedipine (Nif), 50 mm KCl (K+), and 300 μm NiCl2(Ni2+). The columns show mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The eSG fractions, treated either with neuraminidase or mild metaperiodate, were tested in the AR potentiation assay. The non-treated eSG fraction (plus FSP) potentiated the AR in a concentration-dependent manner, and a maximum percentage AR was obtained at 80 μg of heparin/ml (Fig.7 A). The potentiation activity of the eSG was completely lost when it was treated with either neuraminidase or mild metaperiodate (Fig. 7 A). The percentage AR was constant at 15 ± 5% in either neuraminidase or mild periodate-treated eSGs up to 160 μg/ml, showing that neither sample negatively affects AR induction. These results demonstrate that a glycerol side chain of NeuGc residues is essential for potentiation activity. Finally, we tested the effects of the treated eSGs on sperm pHi. The non-treated eSG at 50 μg of heparin/ml caused a 0.05 unit increase in pHi (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, the eSG fractions treated with either neuraminidase or mild metaperiodate were completely ineffective at increasing pHi. In conclusion, sialoglycans, consisting mainly NeuGc, increase sperm pHi by an unknown mechanism that is independent of the FSP-regulated [Ca2+]i increasing pathway. These sialoglycans markedly potentiate the FSP-induced AR. Approximately 80% of the mass of S. purpuratus EJ is FSP, and 20% composes the sialoglycoproteins (6SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The purified FSP alone will induce the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and pH needed to trigger the AR (9Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourao P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but it is much less active than whole EJ (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of EJ with mild periodate, which has no effect on FSP, decreases the AR activity (18Ishihara K. Dan J.C. Dev. Growth Differ. 1970; 12: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results suggest that other EJ components, especially periodate-sensitive glycans, must be involved in AR induction through an ancillary pathway or as co-factors that facilitate the FSP-induced AR. β-Elimination of whole EJ degrades the protein components and releases O-linked oligosaccharides. Sialoglycans can be completely separated from FSP by DEAE chromatography (Fig. 1). Monosaccharide analysis of the SG fraction shows that its molar ratio of fucose to sialic acid is ∼1:6 with small amounts of other monosaccharides (Table I). Other workers (30Hotta K. Kurokawa M. Isaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6307-6311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also found that the oligosaccharides in EJ are rich in sialic acid and that only NeuGc and not NeuAc is present. S. purpuratus EJ contains a unique polysialic acid, [Neu5Gcα2→5-O-glycolylNeu5Gc]n, which isO-glycosidically linked to a 250-kDa glycoprotein (4Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Troy F.A. Cho J.W. Lennarz W.J. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22712-22718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a disaccharide, Fucp1→4NeuGc, was found in the acid hydrolysate of Pseudocentrotus depressus EJ (31Hotta K. Kurokawa M. Isaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 629-631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although some of these investigators had tried to induce the AR with fractionated SG, until now no one had reported attempts to use the SG mixed with limiting amounts of FSP to look for possible synergistic effects on AR induction. This paper demonstrates for the first time that the SG fraction is a potent potentiator of the FSP-induced AR. When tested alone, no AR inducing activity was found in the SG fraction (Fig. 2 B), showing that FSP is a necessary component. The AR potentiation activity was found in glycans of an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa that are strongly negatively charged and contain fucosyl residues (Fig. 3). Further purification of dSG by electrodialysis removed 23% of the total sialic acid and resulted in a 4-fold increase in AR potentiation activity (Fig. 4 A). The evidence that sialic acid is a constituent of the metachromasia-positive glycans was demonstrated by Sepharose CL-6B chromatography of eSG after digestion with V. cholerae neuraminidase (Fig. 4, B and C). This enzyme is known to cleave a unique EJ polysialic acid (32Inoue S. Lin S.L. Inoue Y. Groves D.R. Thomson R.J. von Itzstein M. Pavlova N.V. Li S.C. Li Y.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Mild metaperiodate treatment of the eSG fraction immobilized the metachromasia-positive glycans to hydrazine beads (Fig. 4 E). The sialyl residues of the eSG fraction are crucial for the AR potentiation, because the above treatments, which specifically destroy sialyl residues, caused a loss of biological activity (Fig.7 A). The eSG fraction had no effect on the [Ca2+]i of fura-2-loaded sperm (Fig. 5). However, eSG increased pHi even in the absence of FSP (Fig.6 A). These data suggest that the SG-induced AR potentiation signaling pathway is different from the FSP-induced pathway. This hypothesis was further supported by the differential sensitivities of the FSP and eSG responses to the Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine, and high extracellular K+ (Fig. 6 B). The eSG-induced pHi increase was abolished by neuraminidase or mild metaperiodate treatment, suggesting that sialyl residues of sialoglycans are responsible for the AR potentiation. Our previous studies (15Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) showed that suREJ1 is a receptor for FSP. Antibodies showed that suREJ1 localizes to the entire flagellum as well as the acrosomal region (33Trimmer J.S. Trowbridge I.S. Vacquier V.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 697-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). suREJ3, a homologue of suREJ1, localizes only to the acrosomal region (17Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because suREJ3 also has extracellular carbohydrate recognition domains (17Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Zygote. 2000; 8: 28-30Crossref Google Scholar), we speculate that it might be a receptor for SG. The eSG fraction increased pHi by 0.08 units at maximum concentration, whereas a pHi increase of 0.23 units occurred in FSP (Fig.6 A). If SG binds to suREJ3 to evoke the pHiincrease, this small increase (compared with FSP) may be due to a local pHi increase that might occur only in the acrosomal region. Two different sperm plasma membrane Ca2+ channels mediate the FSP-induced AR (11Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. Galindo B.E. de De La Torre L. Zapata O. Rodriguez E. Florman H.M. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that there may be two distinct channel/exchanger systems to regulate the pHi increase occurring during AR induction. Several parallel signaling pathways may underlie AR induction by whole EJ (3Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration for a role of sialic acid residues in the induction of the animal sperm AR.

Protein traffic in any living cell requires the specific recognition of the proteins to be transported and their selective transport across the lipid bilayer through an aqueous channel providing the polar environment for translocation. It is now evident that the core components of this protein-conducting channel, termed SecYEG in bacteria and Sec61 in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes, are conserved in all three kingdoms of life (1Müller M. Koch H.G. Beck K. Schäfer U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 107-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting of proteins to the SecYEG complex in Escherichia coli is mediated by two pathways exhibiting different substrate specificity.

Binding of SRP to the nascent chains of membrane proteins initiates a cotranslational targeting to FtsY, the bacterial homologue of the SRP-receptor, and subsequently to the SecYEG translocon (5Valent Q.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The translocation of secretory proteins, on the other hand, involves the posttranslational binding of the preprotein by the chaperone SecB and its subsequent transfer to SecA, which then translocates the preprotein across the SecYEG channel in an ATP-dependent manner (8Driessen A.J.M. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). While there is no general overlap between the SRP and SecA/B pathways, the integration of a subset of membrane proteins, i.e. membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains, requires the cooperative activity of both SRP and SecA (7Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Manting E.H. Urbanus M.L. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. J.

This has been demonstrated for a single spanning membrane protein carrying a 320-amino acid-long periplasmic loop, which is cotranslationally targeted to SecY by SRP but remains untranslocated until SecA is present (7Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Recent evidence indicates that the translocase activity and the integrase activity of the SecYEG complex depend on different domains of SecY and different components of the translocon (10Newitt J.A.

The engagement of different components of the translocon during SRP-dependent integration of membrane proteins and SecA-dependent translocation of secretory proteins is further corroborated by recent results indicating that the integration of membrane proteins requires an additional component, the 60-kDa membrane protein YidC (12Houben E.N.G.

Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Beck K.

Even small phage-derived membrane proteins, previously thought to spontaneously insert into the E. coli membrane, depend on YidC for their correct insertion (17Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Since the integration of these phage proteins occurs most likely in a SecYEG-independent manner, it is assumed that for some proteins YidC can mediate membrane insertion independently of the SecYEG translocon (18Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Like YidC, its orthologues, Oxa1p in the inner mitochondrial membrane and Alb3 in the thylakoid membrane, are specifically involved in membrane protein assembly (18Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because mitochondria do not contain homologues to the bacterial SecYEG translocon, it has been suggested that Oxa1p represents a component of an individual integration machinery in the inner mitochondrial membrane through which membrane proteins, like the nuclear-encoded Oxa1p itself, are integrated from the matrix side into the inner membrane (19Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,20Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Oxa1p consists of five transmembrane domains and a hydrophilic N-tail of about 100 amino acids, which is translocated into the intermembrane space of mitochondria (19Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This topology is reminiscent of the bacterial protein ProW, which contains seven transmembrane domains and a periplasmic N-tail of about 100 amino acids (21Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the N-tail of ProW is translocated independently of the SecA/SecY system (21Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The major topological difference between theE. coli YidC and Oxa1p/ProW is that it contains an additional N-terminal signal anchor sequence, which is connected by a 320-amino acid-long loop to the second TM (Ref. 22Sääf A.

In view of this special topology of YidC we wanted to analyze the mechanism of its integration. In particular, we asked whether the requirements for integration were comparable with those of single spanning membrane proteins, carrying large periplasmic domains. We demonstrate here that the integration of YidC into the inner membrane of E. coli requires a functional SecYEG translocon and the coordinated activity of both the signal recognition particle and SecA. Protein traffic in any living cell requires the specific recognition of the proteins to be transported and their selective transport across the lipid bilayer through an aqueous channel providing the polar environment for translocation. It is now evident that the core components of this protein-conducting channel, termed SecYEG in bacteria and Sec61 in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes, are conserved in all three kingdoms of life (1Müller M. Koch H.G. Beck K. Schäfer U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 107-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting of proteins to the SecYEG complex in Escherichia coli is mediated by two pathways exhibiting different substrate specificity.

Binding of SRP to the nascent chains of membrane proteins initiates a cotranslational targeting to FtsY, the bacterial homologue of the SRP-receptor, and subsequently to the SecYEG translocon (5Valent Q.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The translocation of secretory proteins, on the other hand, involves the posttranslational binding of the preprotein by the chaperone SecB and its subsequent transfer to SecA, which then translocates the preprotein across the SecYEG channel in an ATP-dependent manner (8Driessen A.J.M. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). While there is no general overlap between the SRP and SecA/B pathways, the integration of a subset of membrane proteins, i.e. membrane proteins with large periplasmic domains, requires the cooperative activity of both SRP and SecA (7Neumann-Haefelin C.

This has been demonstrated for a single spanning membrane protein carrying a 320-amino acid-long periplasmic loop, which is cotranslationally targeted to SecY by SRP but remains untranslocated until SecA is present (7Neumann-Haefelin C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The engagement of different components of the translocon during SRP-dependent integration of membrane proteins and SecA-dependent translocation of secretory proteins is further corroborated by recent results indicating that the integration of membrane proteins requires an additional component, the 60-kDa membrane protein YidC (12Houben E.N.G.

Biochemical studies indicate that the entry of certain SNARE proteins into complexes is inhibited by intramolecular interactions that generate a closed conformation. For example, an essential N-terminal regulatory domain of the yeast plasma membrane SNARE Sso1p sequesters the C-terminal SNARE motif and prevents it from binding to its assembly partners Sec9p and Sncp. Here, we introduce mutations into Sso1p that cause it to remain constitutively open. These open mutants can functionally substitute for wild-type Sso1p protein in vivo, demonstrating that inhibition of SNARE assembly is not the essential function of the N-terminal regulatory domain. Furthermore, the open mutants suppresssec9–4, a mutation that causes a severe defect in SNARE assembly. Elevated levels of SNARE complexes are observed in cells expressing the open mutants. In the presence of sufficient Sec9p, these complexes accumulate to levels that cause severe growth defects. Similarly, overexpression of the open mutants in yeast carrying mutations in the SNARE disassembly machinery impairs growth. Our findings indicate that elevated levels of SNARE complexes can be toxic and that these levels are normally controlled by the SNARE disassembly machinery, by the limited availability of Sec9p, and by the closed conformation of Sso1p.

Central to this process are proteins anchored in the vesicle membrane called v-SNAREs1 and proteins anchored in the target membrane called t-SNAREs (1Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins contain one or two “SNARE motifs,” generally located adjacent to their C-terminal transmembrane anchors (3Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the SNARE motif is characterized by a repeating heptad pattern of hydrophobic amino acids. These SNARE motifs form helical bundles during the assembly of v- and t-SNAREs into “trans” (i.e.membrane bridging) complexes (4Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Because SNARE complexes play essential roles in directing traffic among cellular compartments, substantial effort has been devoted to investigating the regulation of SNARE complex assembly. A number of proteins, especially those of the Rab and Sec1 families, have been implicated in the regulation of SNARE assembly (9Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also shown that SNARE proteins themselves can adopt conformations that control their entry into intermolecular complexes (10Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H.

Structural studies of several SNAREs have identified so-called “closed” conformations, in which the SNARE motif, through intramolecular interactions with a regulatory domain, is rendered inaccessible (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Tochio H. Tsui M.M. Banfield D.K. Zhang M. Science. 2001; 293: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such regulatory domains impose a kinetic block on SNARE assembly in vitro (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct.

In the most dramatic case yet studied, an N-terminal regulatory domain of the yeast SNARE Sso1p slows its assembly into SNARE complexes by over 3 orders of magnitude (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This regulatory domain might act in vivo to prevent the assembly of ectopic or promiscuous trans-SNARE complexes (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regulatory domain of Sso1p might also act to limit the formation of “cis” SNARE complexes (i.e. complexes between v- and t-SNAREs localized to the same membrane). In vivo, these complexes are disassembled by a chaperone system consisting of the hexameric ATPase Sec18p/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and the accessory protein Sec17p/SNAP (17Weber T. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Johnston R.J. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18May A.P. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21991-21994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Active disassembly is necessary, because SNARE complexes are unusually stable. In some systems, Sec17p and Sec18p have been shown to act upstream of fusion, disassembling cis-SNARE complexes so that their constituent SNARE proteins can form membrane-bridging trans complexes (7Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Sec17p and Sec18p also act downstream of membrane fusion, disassembling the resulting cis-SNARE complexes and allowing v-SNAREs to recycle (19Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regulatory domain could prevent newly disassembled SNAREs from promptly reassembling. The N-terminal regulatory domain of Sso1p is essential for viability (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this domain is not required for membrane fusionin vitro (20Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or for protein stability or proper localization in vivo(15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 2M. Munson and F. M. Hughson, unpublished results. Here, we ask whether the N-terminal domain regulates the entry of Sso1p into SNARE complexesin vivo and, if so, whether this regulatory activity is itself the essential function of this domain. By combining mutations known to destabilize the closed conformation, we have created constitutively “open” Sso1p proteins. These unregulated open mutants assemble rapidly into SNARE complexes in vitro. Yeast expressing the open mutants exhibit substantially increased levels of Sso1p-containing SNARE complexes, confirming that the N-terminal domain inhibits SNARE assembly in vivo. This regulatory activity is not essential, since the open mutants can substitute functionally for wild-type Sso1p. Nonetheless, further analysis of the open mutants suggests that the closed conformation plays a major role in blocking formation of cis-SNARE complexes. Bacterial expression plasmids encoding Sso1p mutants Sso1-Open1 (V84E,K95E,Y148A) and Sso1-Open2 (K95A,K99A,R119A,L123A,Y148A) were produced by PCR mutagenesis; the Sso1p coding region was sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations. The soluble cytoplasmic domains (residues 1–265) of Sso1p, Sso1p mutants, and the C-terminal SNAP-25-like domain (residues 416–651) of Sec9p (also called Sec9CT) were purified as described (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); this Sec9 domain is fully functional in yeast (21Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by UV absorbance. 200-μl samples containing 10 μm Sso1p, Sso1-Open1, or Sso1-Open2 in binding buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl) were applied to a calibrated Superdex 200 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Spectra were recorded using an AVIV 62DS CD spectropolarimeter (Lakewood, NJ). Each sample contained proteins (5 μm) in binding buffer in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. Kinetic analyses were performed at 18 °C as described previously (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are shown in Table I. All strains were grown at 25 or 30 °C (unless otherwise indicated) on rich media (YPD) or synthetic complete (SC) media minus the appropriate amino acid (22Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (310–311): 293-297Google Scholar). Copper sulfate was added as indicated. Wild-type SSO1 together with 0.5 kb of flanking genomic DNA on each side was used to create the previously described plasmids pMM251 (SSO1-CEN-LEU2) and pMM252 (SSO1-2μ-LEU2) (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Genes encoding Sso1p mutants Sso1-Open1 and Sso1-Open2 were subcloned by a two-step PCR scheme into pMM251 and pMM252 using BstZI andMluI restriction sites to create pMM255 and pMM256, respectively. Wild-type SSO1 and open mutants were cloned into the copper inducible CEN-LEU2 plasmid pCu415CUP1 (Ref.23Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; ATCC number 87727). PCR was used to clone each gene without flanking genomic sequences into pCu415CUP1 at the uniqueBamHI and PstI sites, creating the following plasmids: pMM268 (pCu-SSO1), pMM266 (pCu-SSO1-Open1), and pMM267 (pCu-SSO1-Open2). Each plasmid was “shuffled” into FHY102 (TableI) by transforming cells and selecting Leu+ transformants. Colonies were streaked onto SC media minus leucine (SC −leu) and grown for 2 days to allow for loss of the wild-type SSO1-URA3 plasmid. Subsequently, colonies were streaked onto 5-fluoro-orotic acid media to select for cells containing only the LEU2 plasmid. TheSEC9-2μ-URA3 plasmid was kindly provided by P. Brennwald (University of North Carolina).Table IStrains usedStrainGenotypeSourceNY179MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52P. NovickNY768MATαleu2–3,112 ura3–52 sec1–1P. NovickNY772MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52 sec3–2P.

Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis were performed essentially as described (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted and washed in ice-cold TAF buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium azide, and 20 mm sodium fluoride) to deplete cells of ATP and inhibit SNARE complex disassembly. Cells were resuspended in cold IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M.

Sso1p was immunoprecipitated from the precleared lysate using affinity-purified α-Ssop antibodies (a generous gift from E. Grote, Yale University). Western blots were probed with biotinylated affinity-purified α-Ssop, α-Sncp (both gifts from E. Grote), α-Sec9p (provided by P. Brennwald), or α-Sec1p antisera (provided by C. Carr, Yale University) and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (α-Ssop) or α-rabbit IgG (α-Sncp, α-Sec9p, α-Sec1p), followed by chemiluminescent detection using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. Localization of Sec1p-GFP was performed as described (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells containing either pCu415CUP1, pMM268 (pCu-SSO1), or pMM266 (pCu-SSO1-Open1) were grown overnight in SC −ura −leu. At early log phase, cells were pelleted, resuspended in YPD plus 100 μm copper sulfate, and grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were pelleted, washed in ice-cold TAF buffer, fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min, and then washed once with −20 °C acetone and three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (25Miller R.K. Cheng S.C. Rose M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Microscopy was carried out with the use of an Axiophot microscope equipped with a 1.3 numerical aperture ×100 FLUAR lens (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) or a 1.3 numerical aperture ×100 UplanFl iris lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were recorded with the use of a Hamamatsu SIT Video Camera 3200 (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) with a Hamamatsu camera controller C2400. Images were initially processed with the use of an Omnex image-processing unit (Imagen, Princeton, NJ) and captured to computer disc with the use of a Scion image capture board (Las Vegas, NV). In vitro, and presumably in vivo, the formation of SNARE complexes at the yeast plasma membrane proceeds along an ordered assembly pathway (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The initial step, which is slow, entails binding of Sso1p to its partner t-SNARE Sec9p. This binding reaction is inhibited by intramolecular interactions within Sso1p. Once binary Sso1p-Sec9p complexes are formed, they can bind the v-SNARE Sncp in a reaction with a much faster in vitro rate constant. The crystal structure of Sso1p reveals two hydrophobic cores that stabilize its native closed conformation (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The conversion of this closed conformation to a more open one, with the concomitant release of the SNARE motif, appears to be required for binding to Sec9p (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As a consequence, single mutations within either hydrophobic core can generate substantial (up to 30-fold) increases in the rate of Sec9p binding (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We wished to investigate the consequences of unregulated assemblyin vivo. Previous biochemical studies showed that deletion of the N-terminal domain of Sso1p increases its rate of binding to Sec9p by almost 3,000-fold (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, since the N-terminal domain is essential (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we could not simply delete it for in vivostudies. Instead, we combined mutations in both hydrophobic cores to create two different “open” mutants (Fig.1 A). None of the mutations lie within the SNARE motif, where they might affect the structure or stability of SNARE complexes. Sso1-Open1 carries the mutations Val84 → Glu, Lys95 → Glu, and Tyr148 → Ala. Sso1-Open2 carries alanine mutations at five positions: Lys95, Lys99, Arg119, Leu123, and Tyr148. Gel filtration analysis of the purified cytoplasmic domains of these proteins indicates that each has a significantly larger hydrodynamic radius than wild-type Sso1p, consistent with a more open conformation (Fig. 1 B). Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that this alteration in gel filtration behavior is not due to significant aggregation. 3M. Munson and R. Fairman, unpublished observations. To evaluate the in vitro assembly rate constants for Sso1-Open1 and Sso1-Open2, each protein was mixed with Sec9p. Formation of binary Sso1p-Sec9p complexes was monitored by circular dichroism, which registers the increase in α-helix content that accompanies assembly (12Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As anticipated, the rate of binary complex assembly is dramatically increased relative to wild-type Sso1p: 1,100- and 1,300-fold for Sso1-Open1 and Sso1-Open2, respectively (Fig.1 C). Within a factor of 3, these open mutants assemble as rapidly as proteins from which the N-terminal regulatory domain has been deleted. The genes encoding Sso1-Open1 and Sso1-Open2 were cloned into a centromeric (CEN) plasmid and introduced into the yeast strain FHY102 (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Wild-type yeast have two functionally redundant SSO genes (SSO1 and SSO2). Genomic copies of both genes have been deleted in FHY102; the essential SSO function in this strain is provided by an episomal copy of wild-typeSSO1. This wild-type SSO1 plasmid can be functionally replaced by plasmids carrying SSO1-Open1 orSSO1-Open2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, the open Sso1p mutants, expressed at approximately wild-type levels (under the control of their own promoters on low copyCEN plasmids), can substitute for wild-type Sso1p. Furthermore, these yeast exhibit normal growth rates and cell morphology at various temperatures and in various media, and they secrete invertase and carboxypeptidase Y at levels similar to wild type (data not shown). The ability of the open Sso1p mutants to functionally replace wild-type Sso1p in vivo is subject to several possible interpretations. It is possible that assembly of the open Sso1p mutants into SNARE complexes is limited in vivo by some mechanism other than, or in addition to, the closed conformation. Alternatively, it could be that the open mutants assemble more readily in vivo, as they do in vitro, but that the resulting elevated levels of assembled SNARE complexes are not deleterious. Consistent with the latter possibility, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the levels of assembled exocytic SNARE complexes in cells expressing the open mutants are substantially increased (Fig. 3). An important caveat in this experiment, however, is the possibility that some fraction of the observed complexes assemble in the yeast extracts rather thanin vivo. This possibility has been ruled out previously for wild-type Sso1p using mixing experiments (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); however, similar experiments using open Sso1p mutants show significant postlysis assembly (data not shown). Therefore, we carried out additional experiments to confirm that the open mutants form higher levels of SNARE complexes in vivo. The yeast Sec1 protein binds assembled exocytic SNARE complexes and, as a consequence, localizes to sites of secretion (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In this respect, Sec1 differs from its neuronal homolog, which binds a closed conformation of the uncomplexed t-SNARE syntaxin (28Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 29Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez L.C. Scheller R.H. J.

Therefore, GFP-tagged Sec1p can serve as an in vivo probe for the location and abundance of exocytic SNARE complexes. We used fluorescence microscopy to examine cells expressing Sec1p-GFP in conjunction with wild-type Sso1p or the open Sso1p mutants (Fig.4 and data not shown). As expected, modest overexpression of wild-type Sso1p causes a modest increase in the level of localized Sec1p-GFP. Similar overexpression of Sso1-Open1 or Sso1-Open2, by contrast, causes a dramatic increase in the level of localized Sec1p-GFP. Increased levels of localized Sec1p are also observed in sec18-1 mutant cells, which are deficient in SNARE complex disassembly (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In no case is mislocalization of Sec1p-GFP observed. Furthermore, total Sec1p-GFP levels were similar in all experiments (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that open Sso1p mutants form increased levels of exocytic SNARE complexes at sites of exocytosis. The level of SNARE complexes that can form in vivo is limited by the availability of Sec9p. This limitation is significant because the level of Sec9p in vivo is 5–10-fold lower than the levels of both Sso1p and Sncp (31Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To relieve this limitation, we raised the levels of Sec9p by introducing a high copy 2μ-SEC9 plasmid into strains carrying the variousSSO1 plasmids. The consequences were striking; the open mutants cause a strong growth defect when Sec9p is not limiting (Fig.5). This growth defect was evident upon initial transformation of the open mutants with 2μ-SEC9; the resulting colonies were significantly smaller than with vector alone. The presence of overexpressed Sec9p during subsequent growth of the cells for several generations on −leu −ura plates and overnight in −leu −ura liquid media led to increased toxicity, presumably due to increased accumulation of SNARE complexes. The toxicity of the open mutants in the presence of overexpressed Sec9p prevented us from measuring the level of SNARE complexes in these cells using Sec1-GFP fluorescence. Nonetheless, it seems likely that sharply elevated levels of SNARE complexes are present and account for the observed growth phenotype. Overexpression of the open Sso1p mutants does not itself cause a significant growth defect (TableII). Growth defects are observed, however, when the open Sso1p mutants are overexpressed in a number of strains carrying temperature-sensitive mutations known to compromise Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking (Table II). These synthetic growth defects are observed at permissive or semipermissive temperatures. Synthetic toxicity is observed between open Sso1p mutants and mutations in exocyst subunits (sec3-2,sec5-24, sec6-4,sec8-9, sec10-2, andsec15-1), the relevant Sec1 and Rab family members (sec1-1, sec4-8), and general SNARE complex disassembly proteins (sec17-1 and sec18-1). Furthermore, growth defects are observed even for temperature-sensitive mutants, such as sec1-1, which are suppressed by overexpression of wild-type Sso1p (32Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keränen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). No effect was observed in the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi SNARE mutant,sed5-1. These results indicate that the open Sso1p mutations impair Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking.Table IIGrowth properties of late secretory pathway mutants transformed with empty vector, wild-type SSO1, or open SSO1 mutantsStrainVectorSSO1SSO1-Open1SSO1-Open2Temperature°CNY179++++++++++++Allsec1–1++++−−34sec3–2+++++++37sec4–8++++++++30sec5–24+++++++34sec6–4+++−−34sec8–9+++++++++34sec9–4−++++++34sec9–7++++++30sec10–2++++++++++35sec15–1+++++++/−35sec17–1++++++++23sec18–1+++++−−29sed5–1++++++++++++30The indicated yeast strains transformed with pRS425 (2μ-LEU2) (40Christianson T.W.

Other combinations of + and − indicate intermediate growth defects. Several of these results were particularly striking. First, overexpression of open Sso1p mutants in sec17-1and sec18-1 cells had a strong dominant negative effect on growth (Fig. 6). This effect was noticeable even at 23 °C, far below the restrictive temperature for either mutant. Sec17p binds to SNARE complexes and serves as an essential cofactor for their disassembly by the ATPase Sec18p. Presumably, even at permissive temperatures, these mutant cells have a SNARE disassembly defect that is exacerbated by the increased levels of SNARE complexes formed by the open mutants. Of the mutations tested (Table II), only sec9-4was suppressed by the constitutively open Sso1p mutant proteins (Fig.7). This robust, allele-specific suppression was striking compared with the relatively weak suppression conferred by wild-type Sso1p at this temperature. Thesec9-4 allele is deficient in exocytic SNARE complex assembly (26Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, the suppression ofsec9-4 probably arises from the ability of the open Sso1p mutants to compensate for the assembly defect insec9-4. These results provide further evidence that the open Sso1p mutants are enhanced in their ability to enter into productive membrane-bridging SNARE complexes. Based on the x-ray structure of Sso1p in its closed conformation, we have generated constitutively open mutants that assemble into SNARE complexes much more rapidly than wild-type Sso1p (Fig. 1). Here, we establish that these open mutants form SNARE complexes more readily in vivo as well as in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, one function of the N-terminal domain of Sso1p is to limit, through the formation of a closed conformation, its entry into SNARE complexes. Despite forming elevated levels of SNARE complexes in vivo, the open mutants can functionally substitute for wild-type Sso1p in yeast (Fig. 2). The deleterious consequences of the open Sso1p mutants appear to be masked in vivo by the limiting levels of its partner t-SNARE, Sec9p. Sec9p is normally present at levels 5–10-fold lower than those of Sso1p and Sncp (31Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we find that the open mutants cannot functionally substitute for wild-type Sso1p in yeast cells overexpressing Sec9p (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest that high levels of cognate Sso1p-Sec9p or Sso1p-Sec9p-Sncp complexes are toxic and that unregulated SNARE assembly is deleterious. The N-terminal domain appears to have an additional role beyond regulating SNARE assembly. An Sso1p deletion mutant that lacks the N-terminal domain altogether is expressed at wild-type levels (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and correctly localized,2 yet unlike the open mutants it cannot substitute for full-length Sso1p in vivo (15Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This mutant Sso1p is unlikely to be disabled for membrane fusion itself, since a corresponding deletion in syntaxin (the neuronal Sso1p homolog) enhances in vitro fusion (20Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We favor the possibility that the N-terminal domain interacts with another factor essential for the efficient formation or functioning of trans-SNARE complexes. In this model, the open mutants retain the ability to interact with this as yet unidentified factor, but the deletion mutant does not. Sec1p, which binds Sso1p-Sec9p-Sncp complexes in vitro andin vivo (24Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), displays increased localization to sites of secretion in cells expressing open Sso1p (Fig. 4). Without a comparablein vivo probe for noncognate SNARE complexes, we cannot directly assess whether open Sso1p shows an increased level of promiscuous SNARE assembly. The ability of the open mutants to assemble in extracts2 also compromises our ability to use coimmunoprecipitation to evaluate in vivo binding to noncognate SNAREs. Nonetheless, the failure to observe growth or secretion defects in cells carrying only open Sso1p (in the absence of overexpressed Sec9p) argues against promiscuous formation of significant levels of SNARE complexes in vivo. Because Sso1p-Sec9p complexes are capable of interacting with noncognate vesicle SNAREs in vitro (33McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), our results imply that additional layers of regulation are needed to restrict promiscuous SNARE assembly in vivo. If the open mutants have an enhanced capacity to enter into cognate SNARE complexes, why do they fail to grow in the presence of overexpressed Sec9p (Fig. 5)? The preponderance of evidence presented here suggests that this growth defect results from the accumulation of high levels of SNARE complexes. Further work, however, will be required in order to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon. It may be that sequestered Sncp v-SNAREs fail to recycle properly (see below). Alternatively, the complexes may titrate out factors needed for fusion. It is possible, too, that the increased levels of SNARE complexes simply serve as substrates for, and ultimately overwhelm, the Sec17p/18p disassembly machinery. In support of this interpretation, insec17-1 and sec18-1 mutant backgrounds, overexpression of open Sso1p causes synthetic toxicity well below the restrictive temperature (Fig. 6). In any case, our results are consistent with the conclusion that high levels of SNARE complexes are deleterious. Does the overabundance of SNARE complexes formed by open Sso1p consist primarily of cis (v- and t-SNAREs anchored in the same membrane) or trans (membrane bridging) complexes? They seem unlikely to be trans for several reasons. First, the maximum level of trans-SNARE complexes is presumably limited by the availability of vesicles and the other components needed for vesicle transport, tethering, and docking. Furthermore, geometric considerations suggest that only a fraction of the v-SNAREs present on a trafficking vesicle can be involved in trans-SNARE complexes. Finally, the productive trans-SNARE complexes that do form are short lived, since they are converted to cis complexes by membrane fusion. Thus, we conclude that the excess cognate SNARE complexes formed by open Sso1p are likely to be predominantly cis complexes. Based on the localization of Sec1-GFP, which binds to ternary Ssop-Sec9p-Sncp complexes, these cis complexes are largely localized to sites of secretion (Fig. 4). High levels of cis complex are unlikely to be generated exclusively through conversion (via membrane fusion) from trans complexes, since the rate of this conversion is limited by the overall rate of secretion, which is unchanged in cells expressing the open mutants (data not shown). Instead, cis complexes may form on the plasma membrane, where all three constituent proteins are primarily localized (21Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 34Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), or on exocytic vesicles. Based on the arguments presented in the preceding paragraph, it seems likely that fusing secretory vesicles deposit large numbers of uncomplexed v-SNAREs into the plasma membrane. The uncomplexed v-SNAREs would normally be blocked from entering into nonproductive cis-SNARE complexes by the closed conformation of Sso1p and would be recycled via endocytosis (35Lewis M.J. Nichols B.J. Prescianotto-Baschong C. Riezman H. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 36Grote E. Vlacich G. Pypaert M. Novick P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4051-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If, on the other hand, the Sso1p molecules residing on the plasma membrane are open, assembly of cis-SNARE complexes could proceed unchecked. Furthermore, cis complexes disassembled by the Sec17p/18p chaperone system may readily reassemble when the functional “off switch” normally provided by the N-terminal domain is disabled (17Weber T. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Johnston R.J. Westermann B. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a result, cis-SNARE complexes accumulate at sites of secretion. Given the extremely slow bimolecular rate constant for binding of wild-type Sso1p to Sec9p (2.2 m−1s−1), the ability of exocytotic SNARE complexes to assemble on a reasonable time scale in vivo seems likely to require additional factors. Such factors could either act directly, by relieving the inhibition caused by the Sso1p regulatory domain, or indirectly, by concentrating Sso1p and Sec9p within a localized region in order to overcome the intrinsically slow biomolecular rate constant. We tested for genetic interactions between open Sso1p and a number of late acting secretory mutants, in part to determine whether any of these other proteins have the characteristics expected of an “opener” protein. Specifically, mutations in an opener protein are expected to impair trafficking but should be suppressed by the constitutively open Sso1p mutants. Only one of the mutants tested,sec9-4, has this property (Fig. 7). Thus, open Sso1p is a gain-of-function mutant with respect to the assembly of exocytic SNARE complexes. We have not ruled out the possibility that Sec9p acts as an opener protein; in addition, genetic screens aimed at identifying novel openers are in progress.

https://openalex.org/W2049180619,"It is currently under debate whether the mechanism of Golgi retention of different glycosyltransferases is determined by sequences in the transmembrane, luminal, or cytoplasmic domains or a combination of these domains. We have shown that the cytoplasmic domains of α1,3-galactosyltransferase (GT) and α1,2-fucosyltransferase (FT) are involved in Golgi localization. Here we show that the cytoplasmic tails of GT and FT are sufficient to confer specific Golgi localization. Further, we show that the expression of only the cytoplasmic tail of GT can lead to displacement or inhibition of binding of the whole transferase and that cells expressing the cytoplasmic tail of GT were not able to express full-length GT or its product, Galα1,3Gal. Thus, the presence of the cytoplasmic tail prevented the localization and function of full-length GT, suggesting a possible specific Golgi binding site for GT. The effect was not altered by the inclusion of the transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain may act as an anchor, these data show that, for GT, only the cytoplasmic tail is involved in specific localization to the Golgi.

Although the transmembrane domain may act as an anchor, these data show that, for GT, only the cytoplasmic tail is involved in specific localization to the Golgi. Proteins and lipids are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi where carbohydrates are sequentially added by glycosyltransferase enzymes. The glycosyltransferases are considered to reside in the Golgi in a spatial configuration that allows the sequential specific addition of carbohydrates (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms governing their ordered localization and retention is not clear. Glycosyltransferases are type II integral membrane proteins with a C-terminal catalytic domain in the lumen of the Golgi and an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (2Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms of glycosyltransferase localization in the Golgi have been suggested: kin recognition (3Nilsson T. Slusarewicz P. Hoe M.H. Warren G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), where similar proteins form aggregates within the Golgi, and the lipid bilayer model (4Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), where the length of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain retains the transferases. However, neither mechanism fully explains the localization of transferases to specific sites within the Golgi. Thus far, no amino acid consensus sequence for localization has been described, and there is difficulty in competitively saturating the glycosyltransferase retention mechanisms (5Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have proposed a third mechanism of retention involving the cytoplasmic domain of proteins resident in the Golgi. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence implicating the cytoplasmic domain of Type I (6Gonatas J.O. Chen Y.J. Stieber A. Mourelatos Z. Gonatas N.K. J.

One of the most convincing studies showed that Myc and FLAG tags placed at the N terminus of the cytoplasmic tails of α2,6-sialyltransferase andN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I disrupted Golgi localization (18Yang W. Pepperkok R. Bender P. Kreis T.E. Storrie B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 53-61PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-amino acid spacer between the tag at the N terminus and the cytoplasmic tail sequence was able to restore Golgi localization, suggesting the importance of the cytoplasmic tail in localization (18Yang W.

However, the currently accepted view in the field is that the influence of the cytoplasmic domain is of minor importance as compared with the influence of kin recognition and the length of the transmembrane domain (20Colley K.J.

We recently showed that the cytoplasmic tails of α1,3-galactosyltransferase (GT) 1The abbreviations used are GT, α1,3-galactosyltransferase; FT, α1,2-fucosyltransferase; IB4,Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolialectin 1; UEA 1, Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GLF, GT tail-Ly9-Flag; FLF, FT tail-Ly9-Flag. or α1,2-fucosyltransferase (FT) determine the order of action and localization within the Golgi of the two enzymes (23Osman N.

We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tails of GT and FT are sufficient to confer Golgi localization and that the cytoplasmic tail of GT can displace the full-length transferase or inhibit localization, suggesting a specific Golgi binding site for the GT cytoplasmic tail. GT tail-Ly9-FLAG (GLF) and FT tail-Ly9-FLAG (FLF) were produced by annealing two partially overlapping oligonucleotides and completing the strands using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The oligonucleotides for GLF were: 5′-GCGGATCCATGAATGTCAAAGGAAGATTTTGGCTCCTGCTCCTCCTGGTTTTGCTCTTGTTGATGCTCATTGGCGGTTAC-3′ and 5′-CGTCTAGATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCCTCAAAATGAAGTAACCGCCAATGAGCATCAACAAG-3′.

The GT-Myc construct contains the Myc tag at the C terminus and was produced by PCR using the untagged pig GT (25Sandrin M.S. Dabkowski P.L. Henning M.M. Mouhtouris E. McKenzie I.F. Xenotransplantation. 1994; 1: 81-88Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as template.

Tagged DNA was digested with BamHI andXbaI and ligated into pcDNA1. Peptide-encoding constructs were produced by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing BamHI andXbaI sites at their ends and ligated into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for the constructs encoding GT tail were 5′-GATCCATGAATGTCAAAGGAAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTCATCTTCCTTTGACATTCATG-3′; for GT tail/TM, they were 5′-GATCCATGAATGTCAAAGGAAGAGTGGTTCTGTCAATGCTGCTTGTCTCAACTGTAATGGTTGTGTTTTGGGAATGAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATCATTCCCAAAACACAACCATTACAGTTGAGACAAGCAGCATTGACAGAACCACTCTTCCTTTGACATTCATG-3′; for GT random tail, they were 5′-GATCCATGGGAAGAAATAAAGTCTGAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATCAGACTTTATTTCTTCCCATG-3′. DNA was purified using Qiagen products and transfected into COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran (27Vaughan H.A. Henning M.M. Purcell D.F. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. Immunogenetics. 1991; 33: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL) supplemented with 10% FCS (CSL). Cells were surface-stained 24–48 h after transfection by incubation in antibody or lectin diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Counting was performed blind, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. For confocal microscopy, cells were passaged into chamber slides and cultured overnight before incubation in cycloheximide (100 μg/ml for 2 h). Cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of protein and eliminates this as a cause of Golgi localization. Brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), which disrupts Golgi structure (28Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also used to confirm Golgi localization. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization and incubation in 0.5% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline containing diluted antibodies or lectins. The cells were mounted in Prolong (Molecular Probes). The lectins IB4 and UEA 1 (Sigma) and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (29Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) were conjugated to FITC. Sheep anti-mouse Ig-FITC and -biotin were from Silenus, and streptavidin-Alexa 594 was from Molecular Probes. The confocal laser scanning microscope was by Optiscan. DNA constructs encoding tagged wild type GT and FT and chimeric proteins (Fig. 1,A–J) were used to determine whether cytoplasmic tail sequences could affect the detection, and therefore localization, of the full-length transferase. To test whether the GT or FT tail alone could localize to the Golgi without contributions from transmembrane or luminal domains of the transferase, expression constructs were made encoding each cytoplasmic domain fused to a hydrophobic sequence from an unrelated plasma membrane protein, mouse Ly9 (30Sandrin M.S. Gumley T.P. Henning M.M. Vaughan H.A. Gonez L.J. Trapani J.A. McKenzie I.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1636-1641PubMed Google Scholar), and a FLAG tag at the C terminus (sequence DYKDDDDK). The GLF chimera (Fig.1 A) contained the 6-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (MNVKGR) of GT, the FLF chimera (Fig. 1 B) contained the 8-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of FT (MWVPSRRH), and the ran-GLF chimera (Fig.1 C) contained the 6-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of GT in random order (MGRNKV). In each case, the expression of the construct could be detected with biotinylated monoclonal antibody anti-FLAG M2 and streptavidin-Alexa 594. The DNA for full-length GT was also used and was constructed to be Myc-tagged at the C terminus (Fig.1 D, Myc epitope EQKLISEEDL, detected by the monoclonal antibody 9E10-FITC); the Myc tag was used as there are no reagents to directly stain for GT in the Golgi. Three lines of evidence demonstrated that GT-Myc, GLF, and FLF were all localized to the Golgi (Fig. 2,A–F): (a) The intracellular juxtanuclear staining pattern of wild type GT-Myc, GLF, and FLF after transfection of COS-7 cells was typical of Golgi staining after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2, A, C, and E, respectively, dense non-granular perinuclear appearance). (b) Brefeldin A treatment entirely disrupted the staining of the GT-Myc, GLF, and FLF (Fig. 2, B, D, andF, respectively). (c) GT-Myc colocalized with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker, γ-adaptin (data not shown). Furthermore, full-length Ly9 localized to the cell surface but not the Golgi (data not shown), and ran-GLF (GT cytoplasmic tail in random order) did not localize to the Golgi but was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 G). Clearly, the 6- and 8-amino acid cytoplasmic tails of GT and FT are sufficient to localize the enzymes to the Golgi. It was considered that if GT is localized to a specific site in the Golgi by a saturable mechanism, high level expression of the cytoplasmic tail should affect the level of expression of the full-length transferase by displacing the transferase and inhibiting its binding to a specific localization site. Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine whether full-length GT could be inhibited from binding or displaced by coexpression of the GT cytoplasmic tail. COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length GT-Myc and with GFL or FLF (Fig. 3,A–I). Expression of GT-Myc correlates with Galα1,3Gal as measured by IB4-FITC binding. As expected, transfection of GT-Myc alone resulted in ∼50% of cells staining positive for Galα1,3Gal (data not shown). It was noted that cells expressing high levels of the GLF protein (Fig. 3 A, red, ∼10% of cells,short white arrows) did not have concurrent staining for full-length GT-Myc protein (Fig. 3 C, short white arrows), whereas cells expressing lower levels of GLF protein (Fig. 3 A, red, ∼40% of cells, no white arrows) had GT-Myc staining (Fig. 3 B,green), and when the images were superimposed, costaining was yellow (Fig. 3 C, long white arrows). Thus, in the presence of high levels of GLF, GT-Myc was not detectable. To confirm the findings using a more sensitive technique, measurements of both GT function (using intracellular IB4 staining for Galα1,3Gal) and localization of GLF protein were performed. Detection of Galα1,3Gal intracellular IB4 staining is more sensitive than staining for the GT-Myc protein as GT products, i.e. Galα1,3Gal, can be detected with IB4 even when cells are expressing undetectable levels of GT-Myc protein (data not shown). Again, cells expressing high levels of the GLF protein, as described above (Fig.3 D, red, short white arrows) did not display detectable IB4 staining (Fig. 3 F, short white arrows), whereas cells expressing low levels of the GLF protein (Fig. 3 D, red, cells without white arrows) also stained with IB4 (Fig. 3 E,green, and Fig. 3 F, yellow). Thus, the presence of the inhibitory chimeric protein containing only the cytoplasmic tail of GT displaced full-length GT from the Golgi. These effects were specific, as when GLF protein was coexpressed with full-length FT, cells containing high levels of GLF protein (Fig.3 G) did not displace FT (detected by UEA 1 lectin, which measures H substance, the product of FT; Fig. 3 H). All cells stained for both intracellular UEA 1 lectin (green) and GLF (red), and when the images were superimposed, costaining was yellow (Fig. 3 I). Thus, methods detecting either the transferases or their products demonstrate that full-length GT can be displaced or inhibited from binding by the expression of the GT cytoplasmic tail and suggests a specific Golgi binding site for the GT cytoplasmic tail. The specificity of the binding of the GT cytoplasmic tail and the impact of the transmembrane domain on displacement was further tested and quantified. The ability of the GT cytoplasmic tail alone (Fig. 1 E, GT tail), the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain (Fig.1 F, GT tail/TM), or the GT cytoplasmic tail in random order (Fig. 1 G, GT random tail) to inhibit the localization of full-length GT (Fig. 1 H) was examined by measuring the enzymatic function of GT by cell surface staining with IB4-FITC (Fig.4, A–C). The full-length GT DNA was transfected at different concentrations: 1.5, 0.75 ,and 0.15 μg of DNA/well together with DNA for the GT tail, GT tail/TM, or GT random tail or vector alone (1.5 μg of DNA/well). The amount of DNA transfected was progressively reduced as DNA transfected at very high levels affects the distribution of glycosyltransferases in the cell (31Gleeson P.A. Teasdale R.D. Burke J. Glycoconj J. 1994; 11: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There was a reduction in the number of cells expressing Galα1,3Gal (by ∼50%) at all concentrations when GT tail and GT tail/TM were cotransfected with full-length GT (Fig. 4 A), showing that the glycosyltransferase was not overexpressed. The presence of the transmembrane domain did not augment the level of inhibition conferred by the GT cytoplasmic tail. The presence of either the GT tail or GT tail/TM inhibited the function of the full-length GT similarly as there was a 50% reduction in the number of cells expressing Galα1,3Gal, whereas the GT random tail and the vector alone did not inhibit expression of Galα1,3Gal (Fig. 4 A). In preliminary experiments, this effect was not caused by transfection efficiency as the level of GT mRNA expressed in each sample was similar (data not shown). Again, the inhibition caused by expression of the GT cytoplasmic tail was specific as the presence of the 6-amino acid GT tail protein did not decrease the function of a different glycosyltransferase with a different cytoplasmic tail sequence (Fig. 1 I, FT). There was no alteration in the function of full-length wild type FT (1.5, 0.75, and 0.15 μg of DNA transfected/well) as measured by cell surface UEA 1 staining when expressed with any of the proteins (Fig. 4 B, 1.5 μg of DNA transfected/well), showing that the expression of GT tail proteins specifically inhibited GT but not FT. To exclude the possibility that overexpression of chimeric proteins effects the enzymatic function of GT rather than its position in the Golgi GT tail, GT tail/TM, or GT random tail proteins were coexpressed with a full-length chimeric transferase, gt-FT, which contains the 6-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of GT followed by the FT transmembrane and catalytic domains (Fig. 1 J). Thus, the chimera has the GT localizing sequence in the cytoplasmic tail, but as it contained the FT catalytic domain, it could be measured by staining the cells with UEA 1. When the gt-FT chimera (Fig. 4 C, 1.5, 0.75, and 0.15 μg of DNA/well) was coexpressed with GT tail, GT tail/TM, or GT random tail proteins (1.5 μg of DNA/well) and tested in the inhibition assay, it behaved like the GT rather than the FT. Thus, the GT tail and GT tail/TM peptides did inhibit the function of the gt-FT chimera as cell surface staining was reduced at least by 50% at all concentrations (Fig. 4 C), similar to the reduction shown for the full-length GT (Fig. 4 A). The data show that: (a) specific localization conferred by the cytoplasmic tail does not require the transmembrane domain, and (b) the localization conferred by the cytoplasmic tail is specific and is not dependent on the catalytic function of the enzyme. Thus, the expression of the 6-amino acid cytoplasmic tail inhibits the function of the full-length enzyme, presumably by affecting the ability of the enzyme to bind to a specific localizing site on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi. The data described show that the cytoplasmic tails of GT and FT are sufficient to direct both localization and retention of these transferases in the Golgi. The 6 amino acids of the GT cytoplasmic tail, MNVKGR, must contain Golgi retention and localization sequences as (a) when this 6-amino acid sequence is attached to an irrelevant transmembrane domain, the chimeric protein was expressed in the Golgi; (b) the GT cytoplasmic tail is able to displace full-length GT; and (c) the GT cytoplasmic tail specifically inhibited the localization of full-length GT or gt-FT. These effects did not require the presence of the GT transmembrane domain as there was no improvement when the transmembrane domain was included. Thus, for GT, the 6-amino acid GT cytoplasmic tail specifically inhibited the binding of full-length transferase to specific sites in the Golgi, and the transmembrane domain did not have a role in the inhibition of the GT binding site. For FT, the localization and function in COS-7 cells relies mainly on one amino acid residue in the cytoplasmic tail (24Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and here we show that the 8 amino acids of the FT cytoplasmic tail, MWVPSRRH, were sufficient to localize to the Golgi when attached to an irrelevant transmembrane domain. In addition to the kin recognition and lipid bilayer models, the findings provide further evidence for the third mechanism of Golgi localization determined by the cytoplasmic tails of GT and FT (24Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concept of a specific binding site or receptor is supported by the ability of the GT cytoplasmic tail to inhibit localization. Previously, it was suggested that the retention mechanism for glycosyltransferases (a) would be difficult to saturate because enzyme activity was already increased 25-fold in transfected cells from a different species and (b) is not species-specific (5Teasdale R.D. D'Agostaro G. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4084-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gleeson P.A. Teasdale R.D. Burke J. Glycoconj J. 1994; 11: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the assay of GT and FT competition for substrate enables specific changes in localization to be quantified by a readout of the function of the enzyme (23Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Firstly, it is possible for glycosylation to occur when a transferase does not have a cytoplasmic tail, as FT without its cytoplasmic tail remained in the Golgi and TGN but was still able to fucosylate even though it was not localized in its specific functional subcompartment (24Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Presumably this is due to the fact that the transmembrane domain holds the transferase in the Golgi/TGN, and it still has access to acceptor substrate and donor sugar. This would account for a certain level of glycosylation, but our assay of competition for substrate is more sensitive and can detect saturability (Figs. 3 and 4). Secondly, the cytoplasmic tail sequences of many glycosyltranferases are highly conserved across species, and it is possible that the specific Golgi binding site would be compatible with transferases from other species. Therefore, the nature of the retention afforded by the transmembrane domain could contribute to a high level of expression in transfected cells, but the more specific localization site to which the cytoplasmic tail binds can be blocked. The role of the transmembrane domain is not entirely clear. Our studies show that it has no specific localization role as the GT transmembrane domain can be exchanged with that of a cell surface molecule (Ly-9) and still localize to the Golgi. Further, the cytoplasmic tail without the transmembrane domain could still inhibit GT localization (Fig.4 A), indicating that the transmembrane domain does not play a major role in specific localization. In the kin recognition model, the transmembrane domain can play an important role in Golgi localization of transferases in the TGN (32Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas for the medial Golgi enzymes mannosidase II andN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, amino acids in the luminal stem domain affect aggregation (33Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Munro S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not clear in this model how such aggregation would lead to localization in the Golgi at a specific site. Our data for the GT and FT cytoplasmic tails can be reconciled with the kin recognition theory as the cytoplasmic tail of certain transferases could interact with a binding site in Golgi and thus localize aggregates to a specific compartment. The lipid bilayer model, which has been suggested for α2,6-sialyltransferase (4Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), is not reliant upon specific sequences in the transmembrane domain but upon the general property of hydrophobicity and length. This model proposed that a 17-amino acid transmembrane domain of the α2,6-sialyltransferase could not span the more cholesterol-rich membranes beyond the Golgi/TGN. Our data showing that the GLF and FLF proteins, (containing a longer transmembrane domain) successfully localized to the Golgi (Fig. 2, C–F) indicate that the transmembrane domain is not the major means by which specificity is conferred on the localization of these transferases to the site in the Golgi where they perform their function. Based on these models, we propose that the transmembrane domain acts as a general anchor or retention sequence not unlike that which occurs for cell surface molecules where the transmembrane domain acts as a hydrophobic sequence holding them in the membranes. The difference in the Golgi is that transferases are required to be in distinct sites so that sequential glycosylation can occur. For GT and FT, that site is determined by the cytoplasmic tail, although this does not exclude other interactions of the transmembrane domain within the Golgi membrane. We believe that for GT and FT, the cytoplasmic tail confers specific localization in the Golgi, possibly by binding to a specific site or receptor(s) on the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi. The ∼12-amino acid cytoplasmic tails of p24 family proteins in the Golgi are involved in complex and specific interactions with cytoplasmic proteins COPI and COPII (35Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43040-43048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Gommel D.U. Memon A.R. Heiss A. Lottspeich F. Pfannstiel J. Lechner J. Reinhard C. Helms J.B.

Receptor-mediated retention of Golgi enzymes is compatible with the current models for Golgi formation and maintenance of cisternal maturation (37Glick B.S. Elston T. Oster G.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as a receptor could facilitate recycling and/or retention of transferases in an appropriate compartment. A receptor-mediated model involving Golgi localization is also consistent with other examples of localization in the cell such as endoplasmic reticulum localization via the KDEL sequence (43Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 44Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.

Thus, we propose that, although the two currently accepted means of localization are likely to be important in retaining these proteins in the Golgi, sequences within the cytoplasmic domain confer the key determinants for specific localization within the Golgi by interacting with a cytoplasmic binding site or receptor."

Inhibition of lysosomal cysteine proteinases protects the P426L-ASA and restores the sulfatide catabolism in fibroblasts of the patients. P426L-ASA, but not wild type ASA, was cleaved by purified cathepsin L at threonine 421 yielding 54- and 9-kDa fragments. X-ray crystallography at 2.5-Å resolution showed that cleavage is not due to a difference in the protein fold that would expose the peptide bond following threonine 421 to proteases. Octamerization, which depends on protonation of Glu-424, was impaired for P426L-ASA. The mutation lowers the pH for the octamer/dimer equilibrium by 0.6 pH units from pH 5.8 to 5.2. A second oligomerization mutant (ASA-A464R) was generated that failed to octamerize even at pH 4.8. A464R-ASA was degraded in lysosomes to catalytically active 54-kDa intermediate. In cathepsin L-deficient fibroblasts, degradation of P426L-ASA and A464R-ASA to the 54-kDa fragment was reduced, while further degradation was blocked. This indicates that defective oligomerization of ASA allows degradation of ASA to a catalytically active 54-kDa intermediate by lysosomal cysteine proteinases, including cathepsin L.

In the endoplasmic reticulum ASA receives three N-linked oligosaccharides, undergoes conversion of a critical cysteine to Cα-formylglycine, and forms dimers. The dimers are transported to the Golgi, where they receive mannose 6-phosphate recognition markers and bind to mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The ASA-receptor complexes are transported to endosomes where the complexes dissociate. The receptors return to the Golgi, and the ASA is delivered to lysosomes. Within the lysosomes the dimers oligomerize in a pH-dependent manner to an octamer (1Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The major natural substrate of ASA is cerebroside 3-sulfate, which is presented to the enzyme as a 1:1 complex with the sphingolipid activator protein B (4Vogel A. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Deficiency of ASA causes metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), a lysosomal storage disorder associated with progressive demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. In rare cases MLD is caused by the deficiency of the sphingolipid activator protein B (5von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Jaeken J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet M.D. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3695-3724Google Scholar). One of the most frequent ASA alleles in MLD patients causes the substitution of Pro-426 by leucine. Homozygosity for the P426L-ASA allele is associated with the adult form of MLD, presenting first clinical symptoms at the age of 17 or later and characterized by a protracted clinical course. The combination of the P426L-ASA allele with one of the MLD alleles that causes the most severe form of the disease, the late infantile MLD, is usually associated with an intermediate form of MLD manifesting at ages between 6 and 16. This juvenile form of MLD is usually fatal in the second or third decade of life (6Polten A. Fluharty A.L. Fluharty C.B. Kappler J. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The P426L-ASA allele is characterized by a decreased stability within lysosomes, whereas its trafficking to lysosomes and its catalytic activity are normal. In fibroblasts from MLD patients carrying a P426L-ASA allele, the mutant enzyme can be stabilized by the addition of inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Under these conditions ASA activity increases and the catabolism of cerebroside 3-sulfate is normalized (7von Figura K. Steckel F. Hasilik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6066-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8von Figura K. Steckel F. Conary J. Hasilik A. Shaw E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 39: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar). Protection of P426L-ASA from lysosomal degradation could therefore be a means to alleviate or even correct the metabolic defect in a substantial fraction of MLD patients. This prompted us to analyze the structural basis for the decreased lysosomal stability of the P426L-ASA and to characterize the lysosomal cysteine proteinase(s) responsible for its degradation. The cDNA encoding human ASA (9Stein C. Gieselmann V. Kreysing J. Schmidt B. Pohlmann R. Waheed A. Meyer H.E. O'Brien J.S. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Gene. 1988; 68: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The following complementary primers were applied (only coding sequences given, mutated triplets underlined): GCTCATGAGCCCCTGCTGCTCTATGAC (P426L), GCTTCAGCTGCTCAAGCGCCAGTTAGACGCAGC (A464R). Escherichia coli DH5α was transformed with the mutagenized plasmids by electroporation (Electroporator 1000, Stratagene). The mutant cDNAs were checked by sequencing to preclude any PCR-derived errors. Plasmids carrying the mutated ASA-cDNAs and pGK-hygro as selection marker were stably transfected into mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in both mannose 6-phosphate receptors (mpr− MEF cells, as described) (11Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). mpr− MEF cells expressing human wt-ASA were those described elsewhere (12Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The different ASA forms were purified to homogeneity from secretions of the transfected cells by affinity chromatography (1Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Cathepsin B was purified from rat liver (13Towatari T. Kawabata Y. Katunuma N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 102: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), cathepsin H from Epstein-Barr virus transformed human B-lymphocytes (14Maubach G. Schilling K.

All cathepsins were purified to homogeneity, and the concentration of the cathepsins was determined by titration with E64 (16Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). The concentrations given for cathepsins refer to those of the active enzymes. wt-ASA and the P426L mutant were incubated with cathepsins L, H, or B for 8 h at 37 °C in a 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, containing 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. The cathepsins and the ASA had the following concentrations: 0.7 μm cathepsin L/2.7 μm ASA; 1.1 μm cathepsin B/2.2 μm ASA; 1.1 μm cathepsin H/2.3 μm ASA. After the digestion the samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C in electrophoresis sample buffer, subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue or silver. For a preparative digest 0.63 nmol of P426L-ASA (40 μg) were incubated with 0.17 nmol of cathepsin L for 8 h at 37 °C in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. The peptides were separated by RP-HPLC using a C4 column (Aquapore butyl column, 2.1 × 200 mm; BAI, Lautertal) with increasing concentration of acetonitrile (2% per minute) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and N-terminal Edman sequencing (2Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Crystallization of P426L-ASA was done under similar conditions to those described for wt-ASA (3Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (17McPherson A. J. Crystal Growth. 1998; 122: 161-167Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) at 18 °C. The protein solution (∼5 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) was mixed 1:1 with a reservoir solution prepared with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3–5.4, containing 10–13% polyethylene glycol 6000. Crystals suitable for x-ray analysis grew within 2 weeks. They had a bipyramidal shape with a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm3 and belonged to the tetragonal space group I422 (unit cell parameters: a = b = 131.4, c = 192.0 Å). There is one molecule per asymmetric unit and a Matthews coefficient (18Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature using MAR Research image plate detectors at EMBL c/o Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, on the X11 synchrotron beamline with an x-ray wavelength of 0.91 Å. As crystal decay took place a complete data set with a reasonable resolution could only be obtained by merging data of three crystals. The data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) to a resolution of 2.5 Å.

These residues were fitted into the electron density of the omit maps. Solvent waters and the cation were included from the structure of the wild type after examination of the difference electron density. Additional waters were included if they had suitable stereochemistry and individual B-factors below 80 Å. The structure was refined with the program REFMAC (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) using maximum likelihood as the target. The final model was refined to anR-factor of 18.5% and anR free-factor of 25.0% calculated on 5% of the data chosen at random (see Table I). The model comprises 3552 protein atoms, 174 water molecules, a magnesium ion, and 28 atoms of a sugar residue. The program PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton M.T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to check the stereochemical and geometrical outliers in the final structure, and the results are comparable to those of the wild type ASA. Graphical modeling was performed using the program XtalView (22McRee D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Rutgers Protein Data Bank with the entry codes 1e33 and r1e33sf, respectively. Purified wt-ASA or ASA mutants (2 μg) was incubated for 3 h on ice in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) or 100 mm NaAc/HAc, 150 mm NaCl (pH 4.8–6.0) and then subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200-column (PC3.2/30, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., bed volume 2.4 ml), equilibrated in the respective buffers, and eluted at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The fractions were examined for ASA activity (8von Figura K. Steckel F. Conary J. Hasilik A. Shaw E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 39: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]ASA was affinity-purified from secretions of mpr− MEF cells expressing the wt-ASA, the P426L mutant, or the A464R mutant that had been metabolically labeled for 24 h in the presence of [35S]methionine. Confluent dishes (60 mm) of human control or late infantile MLD skin fibroblasts, or mouse control or cathepsin L-deficient fibroblasts (29Reinheckel T. Deussing J. Roth W. Peters C. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar), were incubated for 6–24 h in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30–50 × 103 cpm of [35S]ASA as described previously (23Bresciani R. Peters C. von Figura K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated the cells were treated with 100 μm leupeptin for 24 h prior to and during the endocytosis period. [35S]ASA was immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells and medium (8von Figura K. Steckel F. Conary J. Hasilik A. Shaw E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 39: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and labeled polypeptides were visualized by phosphorimaging (BAS 1000 → Bas 1000+, Raytest). To identify the lysosomal cysteine proteinase that preferentially or selectively degrades the P426L-ASA, wt-ASA and P426L-ASA were purified to homogeneity and incubated at pH 4.8 with purified cathepsin B, H, and L, the three major lysosomal cysteine proteinases. wt-ASA and P426L-ASA were resistant to cathepsin H, whereas both were equally susceptible to degradation by cathepsin B (Fig. 1 A). P426L-ASA but not wt-ASA was susceptible to cathepsin L (Fig. 1 B). Varying the pH between 4.8 and 6.5 showed that degradation of the mutant was maximal between pH 4.8 and 5.5 (not shown). Digestion of the P426L mutant with cathepsin L produced three major fragments with apparent molecular masses of 54, 30, and 9 kDa (Fig. 1 B). To separate the fragments, the digest was subjected to RP-HPLC. The 54- and 9-kDa fragments were obtained in amounts sufficient to allow N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The N terminus of the 54-kDa polypeptide corresponded to the N terminus of mature ASA (RPPNIVL), whereas the N terminus of the 9-kDa fragment was heterogenous. The major (72%) sequence started with AHEPLLLYDLSK, indicating that the N terminus of this peptide corresponds to position 422 of ASA. The minor (28%) sequence started with histidine 423 and the following sequence was identical to that of the major 9-kDa fragment. N-terminal sequencing of both 9-kDa peptides of the P426L mutant verified the presence of a leucine residue at position 426. If the 9-kDa peptides represent the C-terminal ASA fragments 422–507 and 423–507, their theoretical mass is 9031.4 and 8960.3 Da, respectively. By MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry the masses of the two 9-kDa peptides were determined as 9034.2 and 8960.2 Da. This shows that the 9-kDa peptides indeed represent a mixture of ASA 422–507 and ASA 423–507 (Fig.2). The mass of 9-kDa peptides and of the 54-kDa fragment add up to the apparent size of the ASA precursor (62 kDa). This indicates that the two fragments represent most, if not all of the ASA sequence and that cathepsin L cleaves N-terminal from residue 422. Cathepsin L is known to prefer a hydrophobic residue in position −2 (24Kirschke H. Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1587-1643Google Scholar). ASA contains in position 420 a leucine residue supporting the notion that cathepsin L cleaves the P426L mutant between threonine 421 and alanine 422. Because cathepsin L has no aminopeptidase activity (16Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar), the ASA 423–507 fragment may arise from a minor cathepsin L-cleavage site between alanine 422 and histidine 423. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the initial cathepsin L cleavage site is located further upstream of threonine 421 and that the 9-kDa fragments are generated by cathepsin L-mediated processing of an originally larger C-terminal fragment. The close proximity of the cathepsin L cleavage site to the site of the P426L mutation suggested that the P426 L substitution caused a local structural change uncovering a cathepsin L cleavage site following residue 421. Therefore, the crystal structure of the P426L mutant was determined. X-ray data of P426L-ASA were collected, and the structure was solved using the coordinates of the wt-ASA omitting the amino acids surrounding the mutation. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2.5 Å, and overall it shows no difference to the structure of the wt-ASA (data to 2.1 Å), the root mean square deviation of a fit between the Cα atoms in both structures being 0.2 Å. The crystals were obtained at pH 5.3 and contained octamers. The asymmetric unit is occupied by a monomer, the rest of the oligomeric moiety being generated by the symmetry operators. The ASA-monomer has a hat-like form made up of one large and one small β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 3 B). The cathepsin L cleavage site and the mutation are found in β18, which is made up by the residues 421 to 430 and lies in the small β-sheet (Fig. 3, A and B). Residues 424 to 426 form a β-bulge, which seems to be caused by the conformation of the neighboring cis-Pro-425. The leucine residue in position 426 could well be fitted into the electron density found in the omit maps (not shown). It is surrounded by hydrophobic residues of the same dimer. The shortest interatomic distances to neighboring atoms of the leucine lie in the range of 3.7 Å. Thus the interactions of the side chain of Leu-426 with the surrounding residues are sterically not hindered. A more detailed structural comparison of the region around the cleavage site following threonine 421 and the residue 426 in both wt and P426L-ASA shows that all atoms but those of the cis-Pro-425 and Leu-426 lie at the same positions within the experimental uncertainty. All atoms of the cis-Pro-425 are shifted by 0.8–1.2 Å, whereas the side chain of Leu-426 is different due to the mutation (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the structural alterations seen in the crystal structure of P426L-ASA as compared with the wild type ASA are minor and cannot explain why the former but not the latter is cleaved by cathepsin L. At acidic pH the ASA dimers oligomerize to octamers, which are mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Adjacent to the mutated residue 426 are cis-Pro-425 and Glu-424, which both contribute to the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the octamers. Glu-424 is of critical importance for the pH dependence of the ASA oligomerization. The side chain of Glu-424 is disordered among two discrete sites (Fig.4). In one conformation the protonated form of Glu-424 establishes intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of His-423 (distance 2.7 Å) and to Nε2of Gln-460 (distance 3.0 Å). In the alternative conformation it binds to the carbonyl oxygen of Phe-398 of the neighboring dimer (distance 2.9 Å). Deprotonation of the Glu-424 side chain at neutral pH will prevent binding to the carbonyl oxygen of His-423 and favor the conformation toward the surface of the ASA molecule. In this conformation, however, the negative charge of the Glu-424 side chain has a repulsive effect on the hydrophobic residues of the other dimer thus explaining the failure of ASA to octamerize at neutral pH. The P426L substitution induces slight structural changes in the region of residues 425 to 426 (see Fig. 3 C). These changes could affect the octamerization of ASA by altering the pK of the γ-carboxyl group of Glu-424 and/or the hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the octamer. The cathepsin L cleavage site in the P426L mutant is located at the periphery of the contact site between the dimeric subunits of the octamer. In the octameric form of ASA the peptide bond between residues 421 and 422 is likely to be inaccessible to the protease (Fig. 5). We therefore determined the quaternary structure of ASA by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column. At pH 5.4 wt-ASA eluted as an octamer, whereas two-thirds of the P426L mutant eluted as a dimer (Fig.6 A). When the octamer/dimer ratio was determined at pH 4.8–7.0, it became apparent that below pH 5.6 wt-ASA exists essentially as an octamer and above pH 6.0 as a dimer. For full octamerization of the P426L mutant the pH must be below pH 4.8 (Fig. 6 B). The pH, at which half of the ASA exists as octamer, is shifted by the P426L substitution from pH 5.8 to 5.2. The P426L substitution could affect the hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the octamer. ASA was therefore subjected to gel chromatography in the presence of 20% acetonitrile. The pH was chosen to achieve complete octamerization, i.e. pH 5.6 for wt-ASA and pH 4.8 or the P426L mutant (see Fig. 6). The presence of 20% acetonitrile decreased the octamer fraction from 100 to 60% for wild type ASA and from 100 to 80% for the P426L (not shown). This indicates that a shift of the pK of the γ-carboxyl group of Glu-424 rather than a weakening of hydrophobic interactions impairs the octamerization of the P426L mutant. The analysis of the P426L mutant showed that the decreased stability within lysosomes correlates with an impaired octamerization between pH 5 and 6. To determine whether the inability of ASA to octamerize causes susceptibility toward lysosomal proteinases, we attempted to create an ASA mutant that does not octamerize. For this purpose, alanine 464, which is exposed at the hydrophobic interface participating in octamerization, was substituted by arginine. This substitution indeed prevented octamerization. The A464R mutant eluted as a dimer both at pH 4.8 and 7.0 (Fig.7). For determination of the intralysosomal stability, wt-ASA, the P426L mutant, and the A464R mutant were purified from the secretions of stably expressing mpr− MEF cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Fibroblasts from patients with the late infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, which lack ASA polypeptides, were incubated for 6–24 h in the presence of 35S-labeled sulfatase, and the internalized [35S]ASA polypeptides were immunoisolated from cell extracts. In parallel the internalized ASA was determined by measuring the ASA activity in the cell extracts. When [35S]wt-ASA was offered to the fibroblasts, 18.7% of the labeled ASA were recovered in the cells after an endocytosis period of 24 h as a 62-kDa polypeptide (Fig.8, lane 2). When analyzed by catalytic activity measurement, 19.5% of wt-ASA was internalized within 24 h. Treatment of the recipient cells with 100 mm leupeptin prior to and during the endocytosis to inhibit degradation by lysosomal cysteine proteinases had no effect on the amount of internalized wt-[35S]ASA (Fig. 8,lane 3). When [35S]P426L-ASA was offered for internalization, 1.3% of the added ASA was recovered after 24 h in the cells, as determined both as [35S]polypeptides (Fig. 8, lane 2) and as catalytic activity. Treatment with leupeptin increased the recovery of [35S]P426L-ASA from 1.3 to 7.4% (Fig. 8,lane 3). This agrees with earlier observations (7von Figura K. Steckel F. Hasilik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6066-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that the P426L substitution causes susceptibility of the mutant ASA to degradation by lysosomal cysteine proteinases. Interestingly, when control fibroblasts were used as recipient cells, the recovery of internalized [35S]P426L-ASA increased slightly (2.8% instead of 1.3%) and a 47/49-kDa doublet was observed in addition to the 62-kDa form (Fig. 8, lane 4; note the 4-fold longer exposure time of this lane). When [35S]A464R-ASA was offered for internalization 2.1% of the labeled ASA was recovered intracellularly after endocytosis for 24 h as the 62-kDa form. In addition, a major 54-kDa form and a minor 47/49-kDa doublet were recovered, representing 8.1 and 1.3% of the offered ASA (Fig. 8, lane 2). The 54-kDa form appears to be catalytically active, because 9.5% of the added A464R-ASA activity was recovered in the cell after a 24-h endocytosis period. Internalization into leupeptin-treated cells increased the recovery of the 62-kDa form from 2.1 to 14%, whereas the fraction of smaller forms decreased from 9.4% to less than 1% (Fig. 8, lane 3). This indicates that the internalized A464R-ASA is rapidly degraded by lysosomal cysteine proteinases to a 54-kDa form, which is only slowly further degraded to the 47/49-kDa doublet. In contrast to P426L-ASA internalization of A464R-ASA by control fibroblasts neither affected the amount nor the composition of the internalized [35S]polypeptides (Fig. 8, lane 4). Thein vitro and in vivo data had suggested that defective oligomerization of the P426L-ASA is a cause for its rapid degradation by cathepsin L. To assess the role of cathepsin L for the instability of P426L-ASA in lysosomes, we offered [35S]P426L-ASA for internalization to control and cathepsin L-deficient mouse fibroblasts (29Reinheckel T. Deussing J. Roth W. Peters C. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). The P426L-ASA internalized by control mouse fibroblasts was degraded to products indistinguishable from those seen in human control fibroblasts (compare Fig. 9, lane 2, with Fig. 8,lane 4). In addition, trichloroacetic acid-soluble radiolabeled degradation products were released into the medium (not shown). Treatment with leupeptin inhibited the degradation of internalized P426L-ASA, increased its intracellular recovery 3-fold (Fig. 9, lane 3), and decreased the appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products in the medium. This indicates that P426L-ASA is degraded by thiolproteinases in mouse fibroblasts as rapidly as in human fibroblasts. In cathepsin L-deficient mouse fibroblast P426L-ASA was degraded to a 54-kDa form, which was stable (Fig. 9, lane 4). The latter was indicated by the observation that treatment with leupeptin prevented cleavage of the 62-kDa precursor to the 54-kDa form, and increased the recovery of internalized P426L-ASA less than 1.2-fold (Fig. 9, lane"

The N-terminal binding protein of BRCA1, BARD1, may participate in some of these activities since it associates with BRCA1 and RAD51 in nuclear dots during S-phase (4Jin Y. Xu X.-L. Tang M.-C.W.

Importantly BRCA1 protein bearing the disease-associated C61G mutation, which occurs in a zinc-ligating residue of the RING domain, does not bind BARD1 (6Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T.

While molecular evidence implicates BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression, genetic evidence is scarce. Two somatic mutations and one germ line mutation have been reported in human malignancy (8Hao-Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and reduced expression has been noted in a small percentage of breast tumors (9Yoshikawa K. Ogawa T. Bear R. Hemmi H. Honda K.

BARD1 also appears to provide a link between DNA repair and mRNA processing since it interacts with the polyadenylation factor CstF and inhibits 3′ end processing of mRNA precursors following DNA damage. Interestingly the BARD1 germ line mutation has only partial activity in this process (10Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Science. 1999; 285: 1575-1579Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The BRCA1·BARD1·CstF complex may function to prevent short transcripts being erroneously processed after Pol II1 has stalled during transcription coupled DNA repair. The ubiquitination activity associated with many proteins containing RING fingers, including the BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer, may play a part in this process (11Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Accad. Sci. U. S.

The extent to which BARD1 participates in tumorigenesis is unclear, but reduction of Bard1 expression in cultured mammary epithelial cells results in phenotypic changes suggestive of a pre-malignant phenotype, implying that it may be a tumor-suppressor gene in its own right (14Iriminger-Finger I. Soriano J.V. Vaudan G. Montesano R. Sappino A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the NMR structure of the BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer each molecule is composed of three structural elements: the RING itself and two α-helices which in the primary sequence flank the RING, but in the three-dimensional structure are antiparallel to each other and closely packed together (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The helices interface in a hydrophobic core formed by two helices from each molecule, whereas the RING motifs themselves interact little. The structural data suggests that the interaction is augmented by polar interactions. Here we show that mutations in single leucine residues of the BARD1 hydrophobic face to either proline or charged amino acids are able to inhibit the interaction with BRCA1, whereas changes in polar residues predicted to play a role were not correlated with inhibition of the interaction. Mutations in residues located away from the helical core, but in areas significant for BARD1 structure stabilization also inhibit heterodimer formation. This information provides a functional:structural framework for understanding the potential pathology of newly identified polymorphisms and/or mutations in BARD1 and BRCA1 N-terminal regions from patient material. Human BRCA1 and BARD1 cDNAs were used as template in PCR. For ligation into pLexA (Qbiogene, Harefield, United Kingdom) the forward primers were synthesized with additional 5′ linker sequences, (5′ to 3′) GAATTCCCGGGATCCGT (containing aBamHI site) in-frame with codons 2–7 of BRCA1 or codons 27–32 of BARD1. The reverse primers consisted of the linker sequences (5′ to 3′) GGCTGCAGGTCGACG (containing a SalI site) and the complement of codons 105–111 of BRCA1 or 134–140 of BARD1. Each PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into a similarly digested pLexA plasmid. For ligation into pSHM.1-LacZ, referred to in this study as pVP16-LacZ (Qbiogene, Harefield, UK), the forward primers were synthesized with 5′ linker sequences (5′-3′) CGCTGGATCCCCTCTAGA (containing aBAMH1 site) in-frame with BARD1 codons 27–32, 49–55, or 87–93. The reverse primers contained linker sequences (5′-3′) GCGGGGGATCCAAGATCT (containing a Bg1II site) and the reverse complement of BARD1 codons 134–140, 113–119, 81–87, or 43–49. Different combinations of primers were used to generate BARD1 N-terminal variants and each PCR fragment was digested withBamHI and BglII and ligated into a similarly digested pVP16-LacZ plasmid. All constructs were sequenced. One pVP16-BARD1 aa 27–119-LacZ construct was found to contain an A insertion before the BARD1 sequence. This was utilized as a frameshift LacZ and BARD1 negative control. The yeast two-hybrid strain, L40 (a kind gift of Richard Goodman, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), and yeast split-hybrid strain, Y1596 (Qbiogene, Harefield, UK), were used in two-hybrid and split-hybrid assays as described by Shih et al.

Protein extracts were prepared from yeast in urea/SDS cracking buffer (18Printen J.A. Sprague G.F.J. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and blotted as described (19Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). A 1:2000 concentration of monoclonal αVP16 (Santa Cruz, sc-7545) or αLexA (sc-7544) antibody was used followed by incubation with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and ECL reaction (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) detected by short exposure to x-ray film. Mutagenic PCR exploited the 1 in 500 bp error rate ofTaq polymerase (Promega). The VP16-BARD1 aa 27–119-LacZ construct was used as template and reactions contained standard PCR buffer and dNTP concentrations. The primers used annealed to elements in the vector; the forward primer (5′-3′) annealed to the VP16 sequence, TATATATATGTTTTTCTAATGTGTTAAAGT, and reverse primer (5′-3′) to the LacZ,TGTGCTGACTTACCAGATGGGACACTCTAA. The product from 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min was purified and combined at a ratio of 2:1 of product to digested (BamHI/BglII) pVP16-LacZ vector in yeast Y1596 cells (already transformed with pLexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111). Yeast gap-repair in situ ligated the BARD1 randomly mutated library. Degenerate codon libraries where created by the use of PCR primers with degenerate nucleotides at each base of the codon. BARD1 codon 43 and codon 44 libraries were made using a modified forward primer together with the LacZ-reverse primer (shown above) generating a product for yeast gap-repair to constitute the library. Codon 102, 105, and 111 libraries were made using a modified reverse primer and the VP16 primer (shown above) generating a product for yeast gap-repair.

Amino acids 26–119 of BARD1 and 1–109 of BRCA1 make up the smallest stable BRCA1:BARD1 N-terminal heterodimersin vitro (20Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To establish, functionally, in eukaryotic cells, which regions of the BARD1 N terminus were required for interaction with BRCA1 we tested subdivisions of BARD1 (shown in TableI) for the ability to bind the N terminus of BRCA1, in a yeast two-hybrid assay. Importantly BARD1 polypeptides were flanked by the VP16 transactivation domain and 3′ by theLacZ gene. The LexA DNA-binding protein was fused to BRCA1 residues 2–111 or used alone. Table I illustrates that BARD1 amino acids 27–140 or 27–119 allowed growth on selective medium lacking histidine, indicating an interaction. Conversely frameshift BARD1 27–119, pLexA alone, or any other BARD1 fragment failed to allow growth in the absence of histidine indicating that residues on either side of the RING domain are required for the interaction. All constructs allowed growth on media with histidine but selective for the inclusion of the pLexA and VP16-LacZ plasmids (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis confirmed there was approximately equal expression of fusion proteins from each construct (data not shown).Table ISummary of yeast two-hybrid experiment showing regions of BARD1 required for heterodimerization with BRCA1. Open table in a new tab BARD1 has two potential ATG translation initiation sites, at codons 1 and 26. We tested whether aa 1–26 may inhibit or ameliorate the N-terminal interaction of BARD1 with BRCA1 in a eukaryotic system. BARD1 amino acids 2–119 either with or without a Met to Leu change at codon 26 (to prevent internal initiation) were tested for growth in the two-hybrid system with BRCA1 amino acids 2–111. No increase or decrease in growth over the BARD1 construct aa 27–119 in the same system was observed, either on solid plates or liquid culture (Table I). We conclude that the earlier translational initiation of BARD1 would be unlikely to alter its ability to bind BRCA1. The results above and those of others (20Meza J.E. Brzovic P.S. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggest that the flanking helices and the RING of BARD1 are required for the interaction with BRCA1. To establish which residues were required we performed a yeast split-hybrid screen (15Shih H.-M. Goldan P.S. DeMaggio A.J. Hollenberg S.M. Goodman R.H. Hoekstra M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13896-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) on a library mutated in a random fashion across BARD1 residues 27–119. The split-hybrid strain contains two integrated reporters. In the first, the coding region of the Tet-repressor TetR gene is fused to the nuclear localization signal of SV40 and its expression is controlled by binding sites for lexA in its promoter. In the second, the coding region of yeast HIS3 is regulated by the Tet operator. Since the expression of TetR depends on the formation of a complex between VP16·BARD1·LacZ and LexA·BRCA1, the system gives growth on media lacking histidine when complex formation is prevented. Indeed the yeast split-hybrid strain, Y1596, failed to grow on selective media lacking histidine when transformed with plexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111 and pVP16-BARD1 aa 27–119-LacZ, whereas pLexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111 and the truncated BARD1 aa 48–119 construct allowed growth (data not shown). The BARD1 library was generated within the pVP16-BARD1 aa 27–119 lacZ construct using PCR primers located in the flanking VP16 and LacZ sequences. A total of 75,000 transformants of pLexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111 and library constructs were screened of which 10,000 grew on selective media. 103 clones were picked and re-streaked on selective media and β-galactosidase assays performed to eliminate frameshift, nonsense mutations, or clones with poor protein expression. 78 expressed high levels of β-galactosidase and DNA from these was then transformed into bacteria. Candidate plasmids were transformed into the two-hybrid stain together with pLexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111 to eliminate false negatives (i.e. clones that interact). 74 showed no growth in the two-hybrid system and were sequenced. Those with 2 or more amino acid substitutions or changes in the VP16 transactivation domain were discarded. 15 had single amino acid substitutions in BARD1 alone which represented 8 different mutations (shown in Fig.1). Generation of the BARD1 N terminus library exploited the 1 in 500 bp error rate ofTaq polymerase. However, errors generated by Taqpolymerase are frequently transitions (21Keohavong P. Thilly W.-G.

Nevertheless nonconserved substitutions that could be brought about by transitions include Ala ↔ Thr, Trp ↔ His, Trp ↔ Gln, Ala ↔ Gly, Ile ↔ Thr, His ↔ Tyr, Met ↔ Thr, Ala ↔ Gly, Ala ↔ Lys, and Leu ↔ Pro. The split-hybrid screen described above of BARD1 randomly mutated constructs with BRCA1 selected 6/8 transitions CT(G/T) to CC(G/T), (Leu to Pro), one transversion TGT to TGG (Cys to Trp), and one compound change ATT to TAT (Ile to Tyr), presumably generated by two separate transversions. Therefore of the many transitional substitutions possible the screen selected Leu to Pro changes, while some substitutions arose by transversion, and one by more complex changes. These observations suggest that the range of mutations available to the screening process was not significantly restricted. Since the split-hybrid system is an assay for loss of function and the substitution to Pro introduces the most structurally disruptive amino acid, it was important to establish whether changes to proline in other residues within the helices might prevent the interaction. Based on the NMR structure (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), Asp-102 is a surface residue on the C-terminal helix, proximal to the RING structure. It is acidic and protrudes into the solvent. It is not predicted to have either intra- or intermolecular contacts. We screened a library in which codon 102 had been replaced with degenerate nucleotides so that all amino acids should be represented at that position. Sequencing clones selected by the split-hybrid system revealed that no substitution of Asp-102 was found in the absence of another mutation, suggesting that an Asp at this position is not required for the interaction with BRCA1. Furthermore, sequencing clones that were selected in the two-hybrid screen, which selects for the formation of the heterodimer, revealed many substitutions at codon 102 (see Fig. 1) confirming that this residue is unlikely to be part of the BARD1:BRCA1 interface. Since growth in the two-hybrid system requires that the proteins be sufficiently correctly folded to retain their binding function it is interesting to note that potentially disruptive amino acid substitutions such as Gly and Pro were found. Although correct folding can only be inferred from this data we can conclude that the inclusion of potentially disruptive amino acids such as Pro into this helix do not, simply by their very presence, affect BARD1 folding enough to prevent the interaction with BRCA1. We theorize that the behavior of the substitution is also greatly influenced by the role of the amino acid replaced. Several of the mutations found in the split-hybrid screen (Leu-44, Leu-101, and Leu-111) map to the hydrophobic core formed by the four helices of BARD1 and BRCA1 (Fig. 2). To establish whether these residues functionally form part of a hydrophobic interaction face, degenerate libraries at codon 44 and 111 were independently examined in the split-hybrid system (to select for substitutions inhibitory to heterodimer formation) and the two-hybrid system (to select for tolerated substitutions). The results are shown in Fig. 1. Both polar (Gln) and charged amino acids (Arg, Asp) at codon 44 result in inhibition of heterodimer formation, whereas hydrophobic substitutions (Trp, Ala, Ile, and Phe) are tolerated. The requirements at codon 111 are less strict as hydrophobic (Ile, Ala, and Val) and polar residues (Thr and Gln) are tolerated but the basic residue Arg is not. These observations confirm the view that substitution to amino acids other than Pro can inhibit the interaction. They show that a hydrophobic core is required for the interaction between BARD1 and BRCA1 since hydrophobic substitutions are tolerated, whereas hydrophilic, particularly charged substitutions are not. Importantly, despite the extent of the hydrophobic core, a single charged residue within it is able to prevent the formation of the heterodimer. From the NMR structure it has been inferred that electrostatic interactions between four charged residues of BARD1 and BRCA1 may augment the hydrophobic interactions and form part of the binding face (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We had screened a degenerate codon library for one of these, Arg-43, and created a degenerate codon 43 library which was then tested in the yeast-split hybrid system with pLexA-BRCA1 aa 2–111. No substitution of Arg-43 was found in the absence of another, already characterized, heterodimer inhibiting mutation. We can conclude therefore that Arg-43 has no significant role in the interaction since heterodimer inhibition required a second mutation elsewhere in BARD1, although we cannot discount a slight contribution to electrostatic interactions from this residue. The remainder of the mutations found in the split-hybrid screen map to residues that form intramolecular contacts (Fig. 2), either in the packing between the helices (Leu-41, Leu-48, Ile-105, and Leu-115) or in a zinc ion ligand of the RING (Cys-71). Leu-48 is in close physical proximity to Met-104 in the NMR structure (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the screen of codon 44 above one clone was found to be wild-type (Leu) at codon 44 but carried a Leu-48 to Arg change, suggesting that charged residues at the interface between the helices of BARD1 inhibit the interaction with BRCA1, presumably by preventing the correct packing of the N and C helices. The effects on the interaction to changes of amino acids at codon 105 (wild-type Ile) were also examined. Ile-105 is in proximity with residues Ile-56 and Arg-58 that make up the RING domain. Screening of a degenerate nucleotide library of codon 105 in the split-hybrid and two-hybrid systems revealed that disruptive substitutions are both charged (His and Asp) polar (Tyr) and hydrophobic (Trp) and tolerated changes are both hydrophobic (Ala and Cys) and charged (Arg). While broadly speaking hydrophobic substitutions are tolerated and charged ones are not, there are two exceptions. The explanation may be that the bulk of Trp (two aromatic rings) prevents close packing and alters the relationship between the helices, or between the helices and the RING. Whereas Arg, although charged carries a large side chain which may allow it to fill the hydrophobic pocket yet leave the charge in contact with the solvent. While more data is required to elucidate the precise mechanism of the inhibition it is clear that mutations in residues predicted to make contacts between secondary structural elements of the BARD1 N terminus can inhibit the interaction with BRCA1. The C71W mutation is within one of the four cysteine residues required for zinc binding at site 2 in the RING (see Fig. 2). While one might predict that a loss of a zinc-binding residue would have serious consequences for the structure of the RING domain in the absence of further mutations in the remaining three chelating site II residues this remains conjecture. It is possible that the substitution to Trp may be largely responsible for the loss of structural integrity which leads to an inhibition of heterodimer formation. These data arise from eukaryotic assays and identify residues that are required for the interaction between BARD1 and BRCA1. The initial screen was random and blind, selecting only for single amino acid changes that prevent the interaction of BARD1 with BRCA1. Of the 15 mutations identified in that screen 14 occurred in the two areas corresponding to the N- and C-terminal helices (Fig. 1), demonstrating their importance in the interaction. In the 40 or so residues that make up the RING domain only one mutation was found, and this in a zinc-ligand, suggesting that any direct interactions of the RING with BRCA1 are slight, and that intramolecular contacts with the helices are flexible. No mutations occurred in charged or polar residues. No mutations, apart from those at the hydrophobic face of the four helical bundle occurred on surface residues. We cannot conclude that such mutations might not have presented in an exhaustive screen, however, the fact that several of the mutations described in the helical regions occurred twice and three times in the screen suggests that they represent the most common population. Directed substitution of a residue, Arg-43, potentially forming part of an electrostatic interaction with BRCA1, could not inhibit heterodimer formation alone, suggesting that either electrostatic interactions are not part of the BARD1-BRCA1 interaction or at least that removal of one of the several charged interactions is insufficient to prevent binding. The nature of the initial screen means that weak, co-operatively acting residues could not be identified. Of the helical substitutions identified here we find that mutation of leucines to charged residues in the hydrophobic core of the helical interactions do indeed prevent heterodimerization, whereas substitutions to other hydrophobic residues are tolerated. These results support the view that BRCA1 and BARD1 interact via hydrophobic interactions between the helices. In the absence of evidence for a large role for electrostatic interactions it appears that the BRCA1-BARD1 interaction at the N terminus relies largely on hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly the screen also identified several residues predicted to form intramolecular contacts. The majority of these residues are involved in the packing between helices (see Fig. 2), emphasizing the importance of the connection between the helices for binding to BRCA1. These are also chiefly hydrophobic interactions as they are substitutions from leucine or isoleucine. Furthermore, replacement with charged residues, with one exception, inhibits the interaction with BRCA1. The relevance of the C71W mutation is not clear. The data concerning the effect of mutations of zinc-chelating residues on the structure of the RING domain and proteins bound to the N terminus is not consistent.

Conversely others using bacterially expressed proteins characterized by gel-filtration have found that BRCA1 mutants of site II are able to bind BARD1 (22Brzovic P.S. Meza J.E. King M.-C. Klevit R.E.

While the impact of this change is clearly to prevent heterodimer formation is not clear that all substitutions at this site would behave the same way. Given that the N-terminal regions of BARD1 and BRCA1 are broadly similar, this study is relevant to analysis of potential mutations and polymorphisms in BARD1 and BRCA1. To date there has been a limited search in breast, ovarian, and uterine cancer patients for mutations and polymorphisms in BARD1, no mutations of BARD1 residues 26–119 have yet been found (8Hao-Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Many mutations in BRCA1 RING and heterodimerization regions have been recorded (Breast Cancer Information Core (www.nhgri.nih.gov/Intramural_research/Lab_transfer/Bic), however, sites of known cancer-predisposing mutations of BRCA1 occur in the RING domain and not in residues predicted to disrupt the interaction with BARD1. Some BRCA1 mutations of unknown clinical relevance do map to interacting residues, however, extrapolating from our results only those bearing changes to charged or (sometimes) polar residues would be likely to disrupt the interaction with BARD1, such as I15T, M18T, and I89T. Similarly BRCA1 mutations with the potential to disrupt packing between C- and N-terminal helices may impact on BARD1 binding (I90T). The marriage of functional data described herein with the structural (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and mutational data from BRCA1 patients (data from Breast Cancer Information Core) does not suggest that tumor-associated mutations influence the ability to bind BARD1. Future work in the field must establish what contribution BARD1 has in BRCA1-mediated tumorigenesis. This data provides in vivo binding evidence that compliments the recent NMR data of the BRCA1:BARD1 heterodimer (1Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We show that single amino acid changes in BRCA1 are capable of preventing interaction with BARD1 by placing charge in the hydrophobic core of the helical bundle that mediates dimerization or by distorting the helices at crucial residues with prolines. The disrupted residues can either contribute mainly to the interchain or intrachain helical packing. It is interesting to note that although point mutations in BARD1 can disrupt interaction with BRCA1, no tumorigenic mutations have yet been found in this region of BARD1."

The enzymatic disproportionation of superoxide produces molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Under normal conditions, hydrogen peroxide is further detoxified through its reaction with either catalase or glutathione peroxidase. In addition to its normal reaction with superoxide, SOD has also been shown to react with the hydrogen peroxide product of its catalytic cycle, ultimately leading to the inactivation of the SOD (1Hodgson E.K.

In support of that hypothesis, a higher intracellular concentration of H2O2 has been measured in lymphoblast cell lines derived from fALS patients compared with cell lines from control patients (8Ahmed M.S.

The normal enzymatic reaction mechanism of SOD involves the alternating reduction and oxidation of the active site copper ion (Reactions 1–R2). SOD­Cu2++O⨪2→SOD­Cu++O2 REACTION 1 SOD­Cu++O⨪2+2H+→SOD­Cu2++H2O2 REACTION 2The peroxidase reaction of SOD involves the reaction between the cuprous SOD intermediate formed in Reaction 1 above with H2O2. The SOD product of that reaction is highly oxidizing and has been alternately described as hydroxyl radical (free or bound to the active site cupric ion), or as some highly oxidizing hypervalent copper species (Reaction 3) (11Liochev S.I.

The H2O2-reactive cuprous SOD can be produced either by oxidation of H2O2 by the active site cupric ion (Reaction 4) or by reduction of the cupric ion by cellular reductants (11Liochev S.I. Chen L.L. Hallewell R.A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SOD­Cu2++H2O2→SOD­Cu++HO2·+H+ REACTION 4In the absence of a suitable substrate, the SOD itself can be oxidized, resulting in damage to one or more amino acid residues of the enzyme (1Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 12Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the stable product of the self-peroxidation of bovine SOD is 2-oxohistidine formed by the oxidation of a histidine residue (His-118) (12Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which histidine is converted to the final product has not been determined (13Uchida K. Kawakishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is also unclear whether any other amino acid residues are also oxidized. In the present study, the nature of the amino acid residue of bovine SOD that is oxidized in the self-peroxidation reaction was determined and its chemistry was explored. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trapping technique were applied toward identification of the amino acid residue oxidized in the peroxidase reaction. The possible reaction of the product radical with oxygen was studied using an oxygen electrode and UV-visible spectroscopy. Bovine SOD and Pronase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biopharmaceuticals (Indianapolis, IN). 2-Methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), peracetic acid, diethylpyrocarbonate, titanium (III) chloride, and histidine hydrochloride were from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) andt-butylhydroperoxide were from Sigma. Ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide were from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Stock solutions of SOD were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The SOD concentrations of the stock solutions (typically 1–2 mm, depending on the experiment to be performed) were determined by atomic absorbance spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer model 380 atomic absorbance spectrophotometer. The EPR spectra of the SOD solutions provided no evidence for free copper ions (data not shown). SOD solutions enriched in the cuprous form of the enzyme were prepared by addition of cysteine at the same concentration as the copper to SOD stock solutions prepared in argon-saturated phosphate buffer followed by a 10-min incubation at 30 °C. Stock solutions (100 mm) of H2O2, peracetic acid, and t-butylhydroperoxide were prepared by dilution of the concentrated solutions into E-pure deionized water. Stock solutions of MNP (22 mm) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, by stirring overnight in a sealed, foil-covered flask. When MNP was added at late time points, it was prepared as a 1 m solution in argon-saturated acetonitrile and stored in the dark at 4 °C until use. Stock solutions of DTPA were prepared as the trisodium salt at a concentration of 100 mm in deionized water. Stock solutions of ferrous sulfate were prepared in deionized water at a concentration of 100 mm. Incubations contained SOD (250 or 500 μm), DTPA (1 mm) to prevent any reactions of trace transition metal ions or released copper ions, and the spin trap MNP (11 to 16 mm). Reactions were initiated by addition of H2O2, peracetic acid, ort-butylhydroperoxide (final concentration 1 or 2 mm, depending on SOD concentration) to solutions containing the spin trap and SOD. Reactions involving cuprous SOD were initiated by addition of the SOD to solutions containing MNP, DTPA, and the hydroperoxide used. Hydrolyzed MNP/⋅SOD adducts were obtained by treatment with Pronase (20 mg/ml) for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the acquisition of their EPR spectra. Reactions involving histidine were initiated by addition of ferrous sulfate (1 mm) to a mixture containing histidine (20 mm), H2O2 (2 mm), and MNP (16 mm) in deionized water. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer equipped with a SHQ resonator after the solutions were transferred into a flat EPR sample cell (Wilmad Glass Co., Buena, NJ). EPR spectrometer settings used for each experiment are reported in the figure legends. Computer simulations of EPR spectra were calculated using the WinSim program in the NIEHS public ESR software tools package (www.epr.niehs.nih.gov/) (14Duling D.R. J. Magnet. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). H2O2 (2–8 mm, depending upon [SOD]) was added to a solution containing SOD (0.5–1 mm Cu) and DTPA (2 mm). After mixing with a vortex mixer, the samples were drawn into a truncated disposable 1-ml plastic syringe and frozen in liquid nitrogen, typically within 7 s of the addition of H2O2. After freezing the samples were transferred to a quartz fingertip Dewar containing liquid nitrogen and their EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker EMX spectrometer. The following instrument parameters were used: modulation amplitude, 4 G; time constant, 1.3 s; scan time 335 s/300 G; receiver gain, 5 × 103; the microwave power was systematically varied; 8 scans were averaged to obtain the final spectra. Integrated spectral intensities were obtained using the EPR-main program of the NIEH public EPR software tools package (www.epr.niehs.nih.gov/). The oxygen concentrations in solutions of SOD or histidine were followed as a function of time using a YSI Model 5300 Biological Oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) equipped with a Clark electrode. Reactions were initiated by addition of the final component (ferrous sulfate in the case of histidine reactions, SOD in the case of SOD reactions) after establishment of a steady baseline oxygen concentration. In histidine experiments, the solutions contained histidine (20 mm), H2O2 (1 or 2 mm), and ferrous sulfate (0.5 or 1 mm). SOD experiments contained SOD (75 μm), DTPA (100 μm), and H2O2 (250 μm). When MNP was used the histidine or the H2O2 and DTPA (in the SOD reactions) were dissolved in MNP stock solution (22 mm). Experiments were repeated at least 3 times to ensure reproducibility. The formation of the stable product of the oxidation of SOD by H2O2 was followed using UV-visible difference spectroscopy. The sealed quartz sample cuvette contained SOD (210 μm Cu) and H2O2 (5 mm) and was incubated at room temperature for the desired time before the difference spectrum was obtained. The sealed quartz reference cuvette contained SOD (210 μm). Difference spectra were obtained under air-saturated, argon-saturated, and oxygen-saturated conditions. The effects of MNP on the observed difference spectra were determined by adding MNP to a final concentration of 20 mm in both sample and reference cuvettes from a stock solution (1 m) prepared in acetonitrile. UV-visible spectra were collected using an Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer operating in split (sample and reference) mode. Treatment of proteins with diethylpyrocarbonate results in the N-ethoxylcarbonylation of histidine residues on the protein (15Bateman Jr., R.C. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SOD was incubated with a 16-fold molar excess of diethylpyrocarbonate (SOD has 8 histidine residues per subunit) for 10 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, an aliquot of the SOD solution was removed and diluted 1:100 into water and its UV-visible spectrum was obtained from 220 to 400 nm. The difference in absorbance of the diethylpyrocarbonate-treated SOD and untreated SOD at 240 nm was used to calculate the number of histidine residues modified per subunit using a molar extinction coefficient of 3,600 m−1 cm−1 (15Bateman Jr., R.C. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether a SOD-centered free radical is formed during its H2O2-induced inactivation, bovine SOD was incubated with H2O2 and the spin trap MNP. The EPR spectrum of the SOD/H2O2/MNP reaction mixture was anisotropic and typical of an immobilized nitroxide-free radical adduct (Fig. 1 A). Protein radicals spin trapped with MNP typically give an immobilized nitroxide EPR spectrum due to the proximity of the radical center (the N-O bond) to the protein, which limits the rotational dynamics of the nitroxide-free radical. To determine whether the SOD-centered free radical adduct formation was H2O2-specific, the experiment was repeated using the organic hydroperoxides peracetate andt-butylhydroperoxide (Fig. 1, B andC). When peracetate was used, a weak immobilized nitroxide spectrum on the side of a copper line was observed (Fig.1 B). The copper spectrum likely arose from the release of some copper from the SOD active site by the acidic peracetate solution. When a higher buffer concentration was used, the slope of the baseline was greatly decreased (data not shown). When t-butylhydroperoxide was substituted for H2O2 in the reaction mixture, the anisotropic EPR spectrum was replaced by an isotropic, 3-line signal witha N = 17.2 G, characteristic of di-t-butylnitroxide (Fig. 1 C). The spectrum of di-t-butylnitroxide was also detected when no hydroperoxide was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 D). Di-t-butylnitroxide is a contaminant frequently found in solutions of MNP (16Makino K. Suzuki N. Moriya F. Rokushika S. Hatano H. Radiat. Res. 1981; 86: 294-310Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The failure to observe the contaminant di-t-butylnitroxide in the reaction mixtures containing either H2O2 or peracetate indicates that the peroxidase activity of SOD is able to oxidize the di-t-butylnitroxide to form EPR-silent product(s). The detection of di-t-butylnitroxide whent-butylhydroperoxide was included in the reaction mixtures is likely due to the inability of SOD to utilize the hydroperoxide to initiate its peroxidase reaction. The proposed mechanism for the peroxidase reaction of SOD involves the reaction between cuprous SOD and the hydroperoxide to form the product-free radical(s) (reaction 3 above). According to that mechanism, enrichment of the SOD solution with the cuprous form of the enzyme should promote SOD-centered radical formation. When cuprous SOD was reacted with H2O2, the intensity of the detected EPR spectrum was increased by about 2-fold, compared with an equal concentration of cupric SOD (data not shown). Similarly, the intensity of the detected EPR spectrum was increased by about 3-fold when cuprous SOD was reacted with peracetate compared with the same concentration of cupric SOD (data not shown). An intact active site copper center is required for the proposed peroxidase mechanism to be involved in SOD-centered free radical formation. Inclusion of 1 mm sodium cyanide, a well known inhibitor of SOD activity (17Borders Jr., C.L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in the reaction mixture resulted in the detection of the EPR spectrum of di-tert-butylnitroxide (data not shown), indicating that SOD-centered free radical formation was inhibited by cyanide. Heat denaturation of the SOD at 100 °C for 1 h (18Lepock J.R. Arnold L.D. Torrie B.H. Andrews B. Kruuv J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Roe J.A. Butler A. Scholler D.M. Valentine J.S. Marky L. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) also prevented SOD-centered radical formation (data not shown), further confirming that an intact copper center is required for the reaction. To further control for possible reactions of non-active site copper, all of the reaction mixtures in this study contained the chelator DTPA at a concentration that exceeded that of the copper. DTPA has previously been shown to prevent hydroxyl radical formation from the reaction between Cu+ and H2O2(20Gunther M.R. Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Cohen M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The anisotropic nature of the EPR spectra obtained from products of the reactions between SOD and either H2O2 or peracetate prevent the detection of hyperfine couplings from atoms of the original radical that would allow an assignment of the spectrum to a particular amino acid radical. Treatment of the solution with the nonspecific protease mixture Pronase prior to acquisition of the EPR spectra of the solutions resulted in the conversion of the anisotropic spectrum to a nearly isotropic spectrum with reasonably well resolved hyperfine couplings (Fig. 2 A). When the reaction mixture containing cuprous SOD, peracetate, and MNP was treated with Pronase, an identical EPR spectrum to that shown in Fig. 2 A was detected, consistent with the same amino acid residue being oxidized in both cases (Fig. 2 B). Both experimental spectra exhibited complex hyperfine structures (Fig. 2,A and B), suggesting couplings to more than one hydrogen and/or nitrogen atom(s). The complexity of the hyperfine coupling patterns in the EPR spectra of Pronase-treated SOD suggested that the oxidized amino acid residue might be a histidine. A strikingly similar EPR spectrum was detected when a solution of histidine (20 mm) was incubated with the Fenton reagent (Fe2+ + H2O2) and MNP (Fig. 2 D). Coordination of the ferrous iron by the imidazole ring of histidine might promote oxidation at a particular atom on the imidazole ring. To control for that, Ti3+, which does not appear to be coordinated by imidazole (21Lassmann G. Eriksson L.A. Lendzian F. Lubitz W. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 9144-9152Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was used in place of iron, with very similar results (data not shown). When the experiment was repeated in D2O, a nearly identical EPR spectrum was obtained (data not shown), indicating that none of the resolved hyperfine couplings came from exchangeable hydrogen atoms. When the experiment was repeated using histidine specifically 13C-labeled at C-2 of the imidazole ring of histidine (see Fig. 9 for the ring numbering system), a splitting in the EPR spectrum was detected witha 13C = 4.85 G, providing strong evidence for adduct formation at that carbon atom (Fig.2 F). To assist in the deconvolution of the hyperfine coupling pattern of the EPR spectrum of MNP/⋅His, a simulated EPR spectrum was calculated and compared with the experimental spectrum. The experimental spectrum was best matched by the simulated spectrum when the following hyperfine coupling constants were used:aN = 15.3 G for the nitroxide nitrogen,aN = 1.8 G and aN = 1.9 G for the two imidazole nitrogens, and aH = 2.1 G for an imidazole hydrogen atom, and aH = 0.8 G for another imidazole proton (Fig. 2 E). The EPR spectrum obtained from the Pronase-treated SOD sample was convincingly simulated using the same hyperfine coupling constants (Fig. 2 C). Those results support the trapping of a histidinyl radical from SOD. The EPR spectrum of MNP/⋅His obtained in D2O was computer simulated using the same parameters used for MNP/⋅His in H2O with only a slight difference in the amount of di-t-butylnitroxide included in the calculated spectrum (data not shown). In an attempt to confirm that the detected SOD-centered free radical adduct was formed at a histidine residue, the experiment was repeated using SOD pretreated with diethylpyrocarbonate, which labels the imidazole rings of histidine residues (15Bateman Jr., R.C. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4237-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparison of the UV-spectra of SOD incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with a 16-fold molar excess of diethylpyrocarbonate to that of untreated SOD indicated that approximately half of the histidine residues on the SOD were modified by the diethylpyrocarbonate treatment. When hydrogen peroxide and MNP were added to diethylpyrocarbonate-treated SOD, the intensity of the detected EPR spectrum was decreased by about 75% (spectra not shown). In addition, the apparent value of a ‖‖obtained from the immobilized nitroxide spectra increased from 18.1 G for the untreated SOD to 22.5 G for the treated SOD, indicating that a different amino acid residue radical had been trapped in the latter case. However, the radical adduct formed to the diethylpyrocarbonate-treated SOD was insufficiently stable to characterize after Pronase treatment (data not shown). The reaction between SOD and H2O2 has been proposed to form 2-oxohistidine through the addition of a hydroxyl radical formed in the SOD active site to the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (12Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our detection of a histidinyl radical by spin trapping supports a free radical mechanism for the formation of 2-oxohistidine. In addition to the direct addition of HO⋅ to a histidine residue, 2-oxohistidine could also be formed from histidinyl radical, either after addition of molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical or after the addition of water to histidinyl radical. If 2-oxohistidine formation involves intermediate histidinyl radical formation, trapping the precursor radical with a spin trap (MNP) should prevent its formation. Incubation of SOD with H2O2 resulted in the development of an absorbance band at ∼295 nm, detected as the difference between the SOD-H2O2 incubation and SOD without added H2O2 (Fig.3 A), consistent with 2-oxohistidine formation (12Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the absorbance band at 295 nm was prevented by inclusion of the spin trap MNP in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3 B). If 2-oxohistidine formation occurs through a peroxyl radical intermediate, its formation should also be prevented in the absence of molecular oxygen. When SOD was reacted with H2O2 in an argon-saturated solution, the UV spectrum featuring absorbance at 295 nm was replaced by a spectrum with absorbance bands at 250 and 280 nm (Fig.4 A). That spectrum is similar to the spectrum reported for the free radical formed in the reaction between histidine and aqueous electrons (22Rao P.S. Simic M. Hayon E. J. Phys. Chem. 1975; 79: 1260-1263Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The UV spectrum obtained after MNP was added to the anaerobic SOD-H2O2solution consisted of a strong band at 328 nm with no absorbance between 250 and 300 nm (Fig. 4 B). That result suggests that the product with strong absorbance between 250 and 300 nm is a compound that readily reacts with MNP, i.e. a free radical. When the experiment was repeated in oxygen-saturated buffer, the same UV spectrum was obtained as in the air-saturated experiment, but the final spectrum was obtained at an earlier time point (data not shown). To confirm that the addition of spin trap resulted in conversion of a histidinyl radical to a spin adduct, the EPR spectrum of a solution of SOD incubated with H2O2 under argon-saturated conditions was obtained after addition of MNP (Fig.5 A). The EPR spectrum of the anaerobic (argon-saturated) incubation was consistent with the formation of an immobilized nitroxide, i.e. a protein-centered radical was spin-trapped. Addition of MNP to an air-saturated solution of SOD and H2O2 after a 30-min incubation at room temperature resulted in detection of the EPR spectrum of di-t-butylnitroxide (Fig. 5 B). Pronase treatment of the solution giving rise to spectrum 5A resulted in the detection of a spectrum that was very similar to spectrum 2A, confirming the trapping of a histidinyl radical (data not shown). There are two possible explanations for the absence of the spectrum of the contaminant di-t-butylnitroxide in spectrum 5A. Oxygen might be required for the H2O2-dependent loss of the peroxidase activity of SOD or the SOD-centered histidinyl radical might convert the di-t-butylnitroxide to EPR-silent product(s). To differentiate between the two possibilities, an anaerobic incubation of SOD and H2O2 was treated with catalase to remove any residual H2O2 prior to the addition of the spin trap. The EPR spectrum of that solution was the isotropic spectrum of di-t-butylnitroxide (Fig. 5 C). Those data suggest that oxygen is involved in the decay of the histidinyl radical with subsequent loss of peroxidase activity, implying the formation of a peroxyl radical. The ability of histidinyl radical to consume oxygen was determined using an oxygen electrode to assess the possibility of peroxyl radical formation. The reaction between histidine and hydroxyl radical (from either H2O2 or peracetic acid + Fe2+) resulted in the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen (Fig. 6, A and B). A similar result was observed when Ti3+ was substituted for Fe2+ in the incubation (data not shown), indicating that coordination of the metal ion by the imidazole ring was not necessary for oxygen consumption. Trapping of the histidinyl radical by inclusion of MNP in the reaction mixture prevented the consumption of oxygen in the solution (Fig. 6 C). Those data confirm that histidinyl radical will react with molecular oxygen to form the corresponding peroxyl radical. To determine whether the SOD-centered histidinyl radical will react with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical, the effects of the addition of SOD to a solution containing H2O2on the oxygen consumption were determined. Addition of 75 μm SOD to a solution containing 250 μm H2O2 resulted in an increase in the oxygen concentration in the solution (Fig.7 A). That result is reasonable since the initial reaction between SOD and H2O2results in the formation of HO2· (Reaction 4 above), which disproportionates either spontaneously or catalyzed by SOD to form molecular oxygen and H2O2 (Reactions 1 and 2 above). Unfortunately, the oxygen release from the SOD reaction masks any oxygen consumption by the SOD-centered histidinyl radical that is formed in the subsequent reaction between cuprous SOD and another molecule of H2O2. When SOD that had been previously enriched in the cuprous form was added to a H2O2 solution, however, the oxygen concentration of the solut"

The most striking difference between these two related proteins is that Eps15R is also found in the nucleus, whereas Eps15 is excluded from this compartment at steady state. To better understand the individual functions of these two proteins, the mechanisms responsible for their different localization were investigated. Interestingly, some mutants of Eps15 were found in the nucleus. This nuclear localization was correlated with the loss of the last ≈100 amino acids of Eps15, suggesting the presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) within this region. As expected, the last 25 amino acids contain a leucine-rich sequence matching with classical NESs, show a leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export activity, and bind to the exportin CRM1 in a leucine residue-dependent manner. In contrast, no NES could be found in Eps15R, a result in keeping with its constitutive nuclear localization that appears to be regulated by alternative splicing. Altogether, these results are the first characterization of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signals for endocytic proteins.

The Eps15 constructs encoding each structural domains (DI, DII, DIII), the C-terminal deleted mutant (EΔP/C), and the mutant with an internal deletion of the central coiled-coil domain (EΔCC) were described previously (11Benmerah A.

Briefly, the deleted mutants were obtained by PCR and introduced within Eps15 subcloned between theBamHI/XhoI sites of the PGEX5.1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using appropriate restriction sites. All the constructs were then transferred in the EGFP-C2 vector from CLONTECH or in the PCMV-Tag3 vector from Invitrogen allowing fusion of the constructs with the GFP and with the Myc tag, respectively. To generate the EΔ(CC+C) construct, the region corresponding to the C-terminal part of the EΔCC construct was removed usingClaI (+1937) and XhoI sites and exchanged with aClaI/XhoI fragment obtained from the EΔC construct lacking the 46 last amino acids (17Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The point mutations of the putative monopartite nuclear localization signal KRK were generated by a two-step PCR. Alanine substitutions were introduced in the DI construct and then transferred in the EΔCC construct. The region corresponding to the amino-terminal part of the EΔCC construct was removed using BamHI and HindIII sites and exchanged by the same region with either one (KRA), two (KAA), or three alanine (AAA) substitutions. The point mutations of Eps15 NES (m1, m2, and m3; see Fig. 6) were generated using the PCR-based method described by Ansaldi et al. (34Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in the EΔCC context. The construct corresponding to the COOH-terminal NES containing region (E766/896) was obtained using PCR. Briefly, BamHI and XhoI sites were introduced in the upper and the lower primers, respectively, to allow subcloning of the PCR fragments between the same sites of the PGEX5.1 vector. All these mutants were then transferred from the PGEX5.1 vector to the EGFP-C2 vector to generate the corresponding GFP constructs. To generate the GFP-Eps15R construct, full-length Eps15R (20Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was subcloned between EcoRI/XbaI sites of the EGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). The GFP-D3R construct corresponding to the COOH-terminal part of Eps15R (amino acids 660–907) was generated by subloning aBamHI/XbaI fragment of Eps15R into the same sites of the EGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). The ER747 mutant was generated by PCR by introducing a stop codon and a XbaI site in the lower primer and the mutated fragment was introduced between BamHI/XbaI sites of the GFP-Eps15R construct instead of the wild-type sequence. The point mutations of the putative Eps15R NLS were generated as described for Eps15 (see above). Finally, to generate complete splice forms of Eps15R, the 5′ part of full-length Eps15R was replaced by the correspondingBamHI/XbaI fragment from the three characterized splice forms (ERB, ERC, and ERD). All the constructs were checked by nucleotide sequencing. Sequences of the used primers are available on request. Subconfluent HeLa cells were used for transient expression of the different constructs. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate transfection kits from CLONTECH or Invitrogen. For fluorescence microscopy, transfected HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and used 1 or 2 days after transfection. When a treatment with leptomycin B (a kind gift of Dr B. Wolff, Novartis) was performed, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for at least 30–60 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-2% fetal calf serum containing 20 nmleptomycin B. The cells were then washed in cold PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.03 m sucrose for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and mounted on microscope slides in 100 mg/ml Mowiol (Calbiochem), 25% glycerol (V/V), 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed as described above, then washed once in PBS, and after quenching for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, washed again in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with the first antibodies in permeabilization buffer (PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30–45 min at room temperature. After two washes in the permeabilization buffer, the first antibodies were revealed by incubating the cells for 30 min at room temperature in permeabilization buffer containing labeled secondary antibodies. After two washes in permeabilization buffer and one in PBS, the cells were mounted on microscope slides as described above. The samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan II, Zeiss) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Spot-2, Diagnostic Instruments) or under a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss). GST recombinant proteins were produced and purified as described previously (27Benmerah A. Bègue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

In vitro binding experiments were performed as described previously (31Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, human CRM1 was translated in vitro using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System from Promega in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Then, 15 μg of each GST construct were incubated with 20 μl of in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled hCRM1 in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 1% boiled fetal bovine serum, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin) in the presence or absence of 2 mm GTP-loaded RanQ69L. The incubation was performed at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were subsequently washed with binding buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Eps15 and Eps15R are constitutive components of CCPs (13Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

The most striking difference between the distribution of the two proteins is that Eps15R shows a bright nuclear staining, 2The nuclear staining obtained with the polyclonal anti-Eps15R antibody is specific, since it is lost when incubations are done in the presence of the Eps15R-derived fusion protein used as immunogen (data not shown). whereas Eps15 is not found in this compartment at steady state (Fig. 1,arrowheads). Transport of large proteins (>50 kDa) through nuclear pores is mediated by import and export machineries, which, respectively, recognize NLSs and NESs. Both classical NLS and NES are short peptidic sequences, lysine-arginine-rich and leucine-rich, respectively, which are sufficient to drive nuclear import and export of carrier proteins (reviewed in Refs. 35Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar and 36Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). We recently showed that Eps15 is translocated in the nucleus in the presence of leptomycin B (LMB) (31Vecchi M. Polo S. Poupon V. van de Loo J.W. Benmerah A. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a drug that specifically inhibits the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway (37Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C.

This result and the fact that Eps15 is excluded from the nucleus at steady state (Figs. 1 a and6 a) suggested the presence of a classical leucine-rich NES within Eps15. To precisely map this signal, GFP-tagged Eps15 mutants were tested for their nuclear localization at steady state. The expected results was that mutants lacking the NES containing region should be allowed to accumulate in the nucleus. Addition of the GFP to the NH2terminus of Eps15 did not modify its intracellular localization (11Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Bègue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,17Benmerah A. Poupon V. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3288-3295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the resulting construct showing a punctate staining at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 a) similar to the endogenous protein (Fig. 1 a). GFP-Eps15 was also found in the cytoplasm, but no substantial accumulation was observable in the nucleus (Figs. 2 b and 6 a). As shown previously, the mutant EΔP/C, deprived of the 131 last COOH-terminal amino acids (Fig. 8), is efficiently targeted to CCPs (Fig. 2 c). However, in contrast to what was observed for Eps15 (Fig. 2 b), this mutant was found in the nucleus with a clear pattern of nucleolar exclusion (Fig. 2 d). This was in keeping with the presence of a NES in the last 131 amino acids (766–896) of Eps15 that are lacking in the EΔP/C construct. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that a leucine-rich region was found between amino acids 870 and 896, which matches well with previously characterized NESs (Fig.3 A). To assess the presence of a functional NES within this region, its nuclear export activity was further tested using GFP. GFP is a 26-kDa protein that passively diffuses through the nuclear pore and can be detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 3 B, panel a). The E766–896 construct, corresponding to the COOH-terminal 131 amino acids region of Eps15 fused to GFP (Fig. 8), displayed a distribution clearly different from that of GFP alone, with a cytoplasmic staining surrounding a dark area corresponding to the nucleus (Fig.3 B, panel b). Therefore, addition of the COOH-terminal part of Eps15 encompassing amino acids 766–896 leads to nuclear exclusion of GFP. This nuclear exclusion was not simply due to an increased molecular weight of the resulting fusion protein compared with GFP alone but rather to constitutive export from the nucleus. First, in contrast with the E766–896 construct, the E766–890 construct, lacking the 6 COOH-terminal amino acids, 3The last 6 amino acids of Eps15 were chosen to be deleted, because they are not conserved in Eps15R (see Fig.6). was found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, with a staining pattern similar to GFP alone (data not shown). A 6-amino acid difference was unlikely to cause differences in passive diffusion through nuclear pores sufficient to explain the difference between the two constructs. These data rather suggest that the last 6 amino acids are required for nuclear export activity (see below). Second, the presence of a functional NES was further confirmed using LMB. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the E766–896 construct, normally excluded from the nucleus (b), was found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus after a 30-min incubation with LMB (c). The effect of LMB was specific in that no nuclear accumulation of GFP-DII construct, corresponding to the central domain of Eps15 (see Fig. 8), was observed upon LMB treatment (d and e). Altogether, these results show the presence of a functional classical NES in the COOH-terminal part of Eps15.Figure 8Structural organization of Eps15 and Eps15R mutants and summary of the results.

These sequences, which are annotated as “hypothetical proteins,” will become a rich source of information, provided that their structures and biological functions are investigated. Here we present the structure and function analysis of a hypothetical protein from the pathogenic microorganismHelicobacter pylori. Several implications of H. pylori on human health have been established since its discovery in 1983 by Warren and Marshal (1Warren J.R. Marshal B. Lancet. 1983; 1: 1273-1275PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that gastric diseases such as duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are caused by H. pylori, and its implication in extradigestive diseases is under discussion. Infection by H. pylori has also been linked to dyspepsia and to a multitude of non-gastric diseases including cardiovascular, autoimmune, dermatological, and liver diseases. Implications of H. pylori on human health have been reviewed in several articles (2Blaser M.J. Perez-Perez G.I. Kleanthous H. Cover T.L. Peek R.M. Chyou P.H. Stemmermann G.N. Nomura A.

For approximately two-thirds of all H. pyloriORFs,1 functions were assigned by sequence comparison methods, and for approximately one-third, the three-dimensional structure of a homologous protein is available. Among the ORFs without a functional annotation, there is a group of hypothetical proteins that are rich in cysteine residues. Therefore the corresponding gene products are designatedHelicobacter cysteine-rich proteins (Hcp) (9Cao P. McClain M.S. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2984-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mittl P.R.E. Lüthy L. Hunziker P. Grütter M.G. J. Biol.

The Hcps, which are so far unique to microorganisms from theHelicobacter and Campylobacter genera, possess molecular sizes in the range between 15 and 40 kDa and show a stringent pattern of cysteine pairs. Two cysteine residues are separated by 7 amino acids, and there are 36 amino acids between adjacent cysteine pairs, suggesting that the Hcp proteins possess modular architectures of repetitive α/β-motifs. Sequence conservation among this family varies between 22 and 66% sequence identity (Fig. 1). It was shown recently that the Helicobacter cysteine-rich protein A (HcpA) possesses a β-lactamase activity, although there was no detectable sequence homology to known β-lactamases (10Mittl P.R.E. Lüthy L. Hunziker P. Grütter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17693-17699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To work toward a functional and structural characterization of the Hcp family, we expressed and characterized the HP0336 gene product, designated HcpB, and determined its crystal structure. The HcpB structure possesses a fold that is related to the structures of tetratricopeptide repeat proteins. This fold has so far never been observed for a penicillin-binding protein. The plasmid GHPDN49 harboring the ORF HP0336 was obtained from the American Tissue and Culture Collection, and the ORF was amplified by PCR. The sequences of the sense and antisense primers were 5′-GCACCCCATGGTAGGGGGTGGAACGGTAAA-3′ and 5′-TACGCTCCCGGGTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTAGTTGTTTAAAATACCACATGC-3′, respectively. The PCR reaction amplified the entire HP0336 gene sequence and included additional NcoI and XmaI restriction sites (underlined) at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. In addition, the PCR reaction introduced a stop codon and six codons for histidine residues (bold characters) at the 3′-end of the HP0336 gene. The PCR products were inserted into pTFT74 expression vectors using theNcoI and XmaI restriction sites. After sequencing the inserted ORF, the pTFT74/HP0336 plasmid was used to transform competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. For the expression of native HcpB, protein cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with constant agitation (280 rpm). When an OD600 of 0.6 was reached, the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. Selenomethionine-labeled HcpB was overexpressed in the same strain using M9 salt medium containing 1 mg/liter biotin and 1 mg/liter thiamin. 20 min before induction, additionall-selenomethionine (Sigma, 50 mg/liter), lysine hydrochloride (100 mg/liter), threonine (100 mg/liter), phenylalanine (100 mg/liter), leucine (50 mg/liter), isoleucine (50 mg/liter), and valine (50 mg/liter) were added as solid salts, and the culture was grown for an additional 13 h after induction. HcpB protein was refolded in a similar way to HcpA (10Mittl P.R.E. Lüthy L. Hunziker P. Grütter M.G. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (30 min, 2000 × g, 4 °C), and the pellet was suspended in 10–20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm magnesium chloride, pH 6.8). After passing the suspension two times through a French pressure cell, 50 μg/ml DNase and 65 μg/ml RNase were added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After adding EDTA and CHAPS to final concentrations of 25 mm and 0.25%, the solution was kept on ice for an additional 30 min. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C), and the soluble fraction was discarded. The pellet was washed two times with buffer A (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) and subsequently buffer B (0.5 m GdmHCl in buffer A). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer C (5 mGdmHCl, 0.2 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Solubilized inclusion bodies were dialyzed overnight against buffer D (5 m GdmHCl, 0.1m acetic acid). Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at λ = 280 nm (ε280 = 14,800 m−1 cm−1). HcpB was refolded by immobilizing the solubilized inclusion bodies on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and removing the guanidinium hydrochloride from the buffer. To bind the unfolded inclusion bodies to the resin, 20 mg of unfolded HcpB was added to 5–10 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in buffer D. After adjusting the pH to 8.0, the slurry was filled into a column. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer E (5 m GdmHCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0). HcpB was refolded by replacing buffer E immediately with buffer F (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm glutathione, pH 8.0) and washing the column with 50 ml of buffer F at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The protein was eluted with buffer G (250 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm glutathione, pH 7.0). Protein containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1000 ml of buffer H (40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5). Buffer H was also used for gel-permeation chromatography. After concentrating the protein in a Centriprep (Millipore), 0.4 ml of refolded HcpB (1 mg) was loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Purified HcpB eluted as a single peak at a volume of 13.47 ml. The comparison with the calibration profile (blue dextran (2 MDa), 8.63 ml; bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), 9.97 ml; ovalbumin (43 kDa), 10.90 ml; chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), 13.17 ml; ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), 14.17 ml) revealed that HcpB eluted as a monomer. The folding/unfolding behavior of HcpB was investigated by CD spectroscopy. Spectra were recorded at a protein concentration of 10 μm in 0–4 mGdmHCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9 on a Jasco J-751 CD spectrometer. The temperature was maintained at 22 °C, and the data were fitted against Eq. 1 (11Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Yobs is the observed CD signal; a and b andc and d are the intercepts and the slopes at low and high GdmHCl concentrations, respectively. [GdmHCl]½ is the GdmHCl concentration where half of the protein is unfolded, and mis the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction. R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The theoretical value for the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction was calculated according to the literature (12Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M.

Absorption maxima and molar absorption coefficients are given in TableI. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxim, cloxacillin, and benzylpenicillin were from Fluka; carbenicillin, cefalotin, cefoxitin, cephaloridin, and oxacillin were from Sigma; and nitrocefin was from Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, New York). All reactions were performed in 20 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0, at 25 °C on a Cary 300 UV-spectrophotometer. The steady-state rate constants (K m and k cat) were determined by fitting all data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the KALEIDOGRAPH software. IC50 values were determined by inhibiting nitocefin hydrolysis at substrate and protein concentrations of 200 and 2 μm, respectively. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis.Table IKinetic constants for β-lactam hydrolysisAntibioticΔɛλ[Antibiotic]HcpA1-aTaken from reference 10.HcpBK mk catIC50KmkcatIC50M−cm−nmμmμmmin−1μmμmmin−1μm6-Aminopenillinic acid derivativesAmpicillin−8202350.1–8001451.06 ± 0.04ND1-bND, not determined.1740.76 ± 0.08NDBenzylpenicillin−7752350.1–400480.74 ± 0.02ND1260.68 ± 0.14NDAmoxicillin−8002350.1–4001550.55 ± 0.17ND470.45 ± 0.04NDCarbenicillin−8002350.1–30,000ND0.0463ND0.1238Cloxacillin−8002350.1–30,000ND< 0.0119ND< 0.0117Oxacillin−8002350.1–30,000ND< 0.016.7ND< 0.01107-Aminocephalosporanic acid derivativesNitrocefin160004860.1–300470.28 ± 0.08ND530.45 ± 0.10NDCephaloridin−100002600.1–10004060.30 ± 0.07ND> 1000NDNDCefotaxim−75002600.1–30,000ND< 0.01> 30,000ND< 0.01> 30,000Cefoxitin−77002600.1–30,000ND0.034300ND< 0.011100Cephalothin−65002600.1–30,000ND0.041000ND< 0.026401-a Taken from reference 10.1-b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Crystallization trials using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method of native and selenomethionine-labeled HcpB were set up exactly the same way. Droplets consisted of 2 μl of reservoir buffer and 2 μl of refolded HcpB (4.4 mg/ml protein in 40 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5). The droplets were equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution (25% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 3.0). Pencil-shaped crystals were obtained within 14 days at 20 °C. They belonged to space group P6522 with unit cell dimensions a =b = 51.07 Å, c = 206.39 Å, and a Matthew's parameter of 2.40 Å3/Da with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Single crystals were transferred into a cryo-buffer (25% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m citrate, 20% ethylene glycol, pH 3.0) and flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 110 K. For phasing by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion, three data sets were collected up to a 2.5-Å resolution from a single crystal at the BM14 beamline (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble). Later, a further high resolution native data set was collected at a 1.95-Å resolution on station ID14–3. Data were scaled and integrated using the DENZO/SCALEPACK package (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The HcpB structure was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the selenium absorption edge. Several dispersive and difference Patterson maps were calculated among the selenomethionine derivative data sets. To improve the signal to noise ratio, the maps were merged, and the selenium site was identified by the automated Patterson search method implemented into the program CNS (14Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: D431-D441Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Initial phases were calculated using data between 25- and 3.8-Å resolution. Solvent flattening using the program SOLOMON (16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: A110-A119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Subsequently, phases were calculated to a 2.5-Å resolution, and side chains became visible, allowing the sequence to be fitted into the electron density. The refinement was performed using the programs CNS and REFMAC (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: D247-D255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The free R-factor was calculated with a test set containing 10% of the data. When the 1.95-Å data set became available, refinement was finalized using the program ArpWarp (19Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Amino acids Met-1, Val-2, Asn-136, Asn-137, and Tyr-138 as well as the six C-terminal histidine residues were not modeled due to the lack of interpretable electron density. Fold analysis was performed using the Dali internet service (20Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). Figures within this publication were prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (21Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and BOBSCRIPT (22Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). Helix packing angles were calculated using the program INTERHELIX. The crystal structure analysis of HcpB revealed, in contrast to the sequence-based secondary structure prediction, an essentially α-helical fold. The 133 residues of HcpB fold into eight α-helices that pack into a right-handed superhelix with overall dimensions of 63 × 35 × 25 Å (Fig.2 a). Four disulfide bridges are observed between cysteine pairs Cys-22/Cys-30, Cys-52/Cys-60, Cys-88/Cys-96, and Cys-124/Cys-132. The disulfide bridges subdivide the structure into four (1, 2, 3,4) pairs (A, B) of α-helices confirming the proposed modular architecture. Helices A and B are 14 and 10 residues long, respectively. The two cysteine residues forming a disulfide bridge are located at the C terminus of helix A and four residues behind the N terminus of helix B. However, there are three exceptions. Helix 1A has a three-residue-long α-helical extension at the N terminus, and helix 4B is two residues shorter. In addition, two residues at the N terminus of helix 1B are not in an α-helical conformation. The packing angle of helices A and B belonging to the same α/α-motif (e.g. 1A/1B) is 42°, whereas the angle between helices B and A of adjacent motifs (e.g. 1B/2A) is 14°. The helix packing creates a fan-like structure with an angle between the first and the last α-helix of 130° (Fig. 2 a). The convex surface of the molecule is formed by helices 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A. This surface area is predominately positively charged. On the opposite side of the molecule, helices 1B, 2B, 3B, and 4B create an amphipathic groove. Polar side chains of helix 2B form the bottom of the grove that is flanked on both sides by hydrophobic side chains coming from helices 1B, 3B, and 4B. The four α-helix pairs possess very similar conformations (Fig. 2 b). The sequence identity for the pairwise alignments varies between 33 and 58%, and the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) varies between 0.33 and 1.35 Å (TableIII). Although the overall sequence composition of motif 1 is similar to motifs 2–4, the conformation of motif 1 is different from motifs 2–4. The r.m.s.d. between motif 1 and motifs 2–4 is well above 1 Å, whereas the r.m.s.d. among motifs 2–4 is much smaller (Table III). The increased r.m.s.d. is due to a different conformation of the loop that connects helices 1A and 1B. In loop 1, the amino acid at position 26 is in the left-handed helix conformation (φ/ϕPhe-28 = 70°/3°), whereas the corresponding residues in loops 2–4 are all in right-handed helix conformations (φ/ϕAsn-58 = −56°/−40°, φ/ϕ Asp-94 = −83°/−33°, and φ/ϕAsp-130 = −54°/−38°).Table IIIR.m.s.d. and sequence identity among α/α-motifs of HcpBRmsd [Å] and sequence identity3-aMotifs M1, M2, M3, and M4 refer to residues 10–36, 40–66, 76–102, and 112–135, respectively. Sequences were aligned as shown in Fig. 2c.M1M2M3M4M146%58%31%M21.1850%27%M31.110.3335%M41.350.660.643-a Motifs M1, M2, M3, and M4 refer to residues 10–36, 40–66, 76–102, and 112–135, respectively. Sequences were aligned as shown in Fig. 2c. Open table in a new tab The structure-based sequence alignment of the four motifs reveals that the sequence pattern extends beyond the conserved cysteine pairs (Fig.2 c). The cysteine residues at positions 20 and 28, alanine at position 19, and glycine at position 27 are conserved for structural reasons. The disulfide bridge fixes helices A and B in a defined orientation and restrains the conformation of the loop. The covalent disulfide bond brings the helices very close together in space. Therefore the side chains of residues preceding the cysteines (e.g. alanine at position 19 and glycine at position 27) are at van der Waals distances. Throughout the whole Hcp family, residues preceding the cysteines are always glycine, alanine, or serine residues because these residue types possess sufficiently small side chains. Residues with larger side chains would prevent helices A and B from adopting the proper packing angles. Leucine at position 31 is also conserved because its side chain fits like a knob into a hole on the surface of the preceding helix A. The leucine at position 31 in motif 1 (Leu-33) is completely buried in the center of a hydrophobic core formed by helices 1A, 1B, and 2A, whereas leucine residues in motifs 2–4 (Leu-63, Leu-99, and Leu-135) are solvent accessible. In addition, lysine residues at positions 11 and 18, leucine residues at position 22, and asparagine residues at position 14 are also conserved (Fig. 2,b and c). Since these amino acids occur in subsequent turns on the solvent-exposed side of helix A, they form rims of identical residues on the convex side of the molecule. Data base searches revealed that the structure of HcpB is most similar to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of the human protein phosphatase 5 (PP5, Protein Data Bank accession number 1a17) (23Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The isolated PP5 TPR repeats superimpose well onto the HcpB structure (Fig.2 d). However, the relative orientation of repeats in HcpB and PP5 are different. Since HcpB was refolded from inclusion bodies, proper refolding was verified by CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum shown in Fig. 3 areveals a pronounced minimum at 222 nm. Based on the CD spectrum, the α-helix content was predicted to be 73%, which is in perfect agreement with the crystal structure. Upon the addition of GdmHCl, the minimum at 222 nm vanishes from the spectrum. By plotting the CD signal at 222 nm over the GdmHCl concentration, the free energy of unfolding and the cooperativity parameter (m) were determined from the intercepts and the slopes of the titration curve at the transition phase. From the titration curve shown in Fig. 3 b, we derived [GdmHCl]½ and m values of 1.93 ± 0.02 m and 11.24 ± 0.99 kJ/(mol·m), respectively, yielding a free energy of unfolding of −22 kJ/mol. The theoretical cooperativity of unfolding calculated from the amino acid sequence is 12 kJ/(mol·m). It was shown recently that HcpA has β-lactamase and penicillin binding activities (10Mittl P.R.E. Lüthy L. Hunziker P. Grütter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17693-17699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Kinetic data summarized in Table I reveal that HcpB possesses similar activities. Generally, 6-aminopenicillinic acid compounds are better substrates or inhibitors than 7-aminocephalosporanic acid derivatives. With the exception of nitrocefin, 6-aminopenicillinic acid derivatives showK m and IC50 values in the micromolar range, whereas the kinetic parameters for 7-aminocephalosporanic acid derivatives are in the millimolar range. Attempts to detect the nitrocefin binding site in HcpB failed because the crystals disintegrated upon soaking nitrocefin into the HcpB crystals. However, the crystal color turned dark red, indicating that the nitrocefin β-lactam ring was cleaved by HcpB. Electron density maps calculated between the refined HcpB structure and x-ray diffraction data collected on HcpB co-crystallized with oxacillin (data not shown) revealed significant difference electron density in the amphipathic grove, but the maps were not sufficiently clear to fit oxacillin precisely into the HcpB structure. Upon refinement of the HcpB crystal structure, we observed strong electron density at the putative penicillin binding site. This density was refined as a cluster of densely packed water molecules as shown in Fig. 4 a. However, the close distances of water molecules and the continuous electron density suggest that this density might represent a copurified ligand rather than a cluster of isolated water molecules. Mass spectrometric analysis of HcpB revealed two peaks with molecular masses of 16,159.2 and 16,450.8 Da (data not shown). The two peaks account for a mixture of free HcpB and a complex between HcpB and a compound with a molecular weight of ∼292 Da. N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) is a compound that is found in the peptidoglycan of all Gram-negative bacteria. NAM has the right molecular size (molecular size = 293.3 Da) and fits the observed electron density as indicated in Fig.4 a. The proposed binding site is located in the amphipathic grove close to the N termini of helices 1B, 2B, and 3B (Fig.4 b). Modeling NAM into the proposed binding site revealed that NAM would be recognized by a number of hydrogen bonds. Residues that could interact with the putative ligand are Asn-58, Asp-92, Asp-94, and Ser-128. The conservation of the sequence pattern among the Hcp family suggests that all family members are composed of the same α/α-motif. This motif is similar to the TPR repeat, although there are substantial differences. As the name implies, TPR proteins consist of repeats of 34 amino acids that fold into two α-helices and are frequently found in multidomain proteins where they serve as protein/protein interaction modules. The TPR sequences are very versatile, and there is no position characterized by an invariant residue. Small hydrophobic residues are observed at positions 8, 20, and 27 of the TPR motif. The sequence alignment deduced from the superposition of the HcpB motifs onto the three TPRs of PP5 reveals that this pattern is partially conserved in the HcpB structure (Fig.2 c). The alanine/leucine residues at positions 12 and 19 of the HcpB motif superimpose onto the alanine/valine residues at positions 20 and 27 of the TPR. In addition, leucine at position 22 is also conserved in TPR repeats 1 and 2, whereas the lysine and asparagine residues at positions 11, 14, and 18 that are located on the convex surface of HcpB are not. There might be a functional requirement for the conservation of these amino acids, particularly if HcpB interacts with proteins that also show a modular architecture. On the other hand, the conservation might be a remnant from the duplication of an ancestral α/α-motif sequence. S"

The present data further support earlier suggestions of an inverse correlation of the density of hydroxyamino acid residues (and by inference the density of peptide GalNAc) with the extent of substitution of the peptide-linked GalNAc by β-1,3-Gal. This effect is highly correlated for Ser-linked glycans but not for Thr-linked glycans. A similar correlation is observed with respect to the in vivo peptide GalNAc glycosylation pattern. In contrast, the addition of α-1,2-Fuc to β-Gal shows no apparent correlation with hydroxyamino acid density, although a marked elevation in the fucosylation of Ser-linked glycans compared with Thr-linked glycans is observed. The above effects may represent both steric and conformational factors acting to alter the relative accessibility and activity of the glycosyltransferases toward substrate.

These glycoproteins are typically 20–30% Ser and Thr, are between 50 and 80% carbohydrate by weight, and commonly contain tandemly repeated peptide sequences. Mucins and glycoproteins containing mucin-like domains play a major role protecting epithelial cell surfaces and are thought to be involved in modulating many biological processes including the immune response, adhesion, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and perhaps development (2Van den S.P.

The expression of ppGalNAc transferase isoforms with different peptide and/or glycopeptide specificities therefore represents the first step in the regulation ofO-glycan structure by peptide sequence in vivo. Subsequent elongation of O-linked glycans proceeds by the stepwise addition of single sugar residues via a series of substrate-specific Golgi resident transferases (25Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).

Factors affecting site-specific N-glycan structures include specific peptide sequence motifs, protein surface structures, and the folded state of the protein. The paucity of our understanding of the influence of the acceptor peptide structure onO-glycan elongation in mucin-like domains arises from the difficulty in determining the site-specific glycosylation pattern of mucins and other heavily O-glycosylated glycoproteins. With the goal of understanding the influence of peptide sequence and structure on mucin O-glycosylation, our laboratory has previously reported the site-specific GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr and core 1 ([R1-,R2-]β-Gal-1,3-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) glycosylation patterns of 29 of the 31 glycosylated residues in the 81-residue tandem repeat of the porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM) pooled from several different animals (34Gerken T.A.

Aminoff D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). We found that the extent of GalNAc core glycosylation was site-specific and that the degree of core 1 glycosylation appeared to inversely correlate to the density of Ser and Thr residues in the polypeptide sequence. From the latter finding, we suggested that the oligosaccharide side chain length may also correlate with the density of glycosylated Ser and Thr residues. These results suggested the reasonable possibility of steric interactions of neighboring glycosylated Ser and Thr residues affecting glycan elongation. In this article we have extended these studies to the characterization of the site-specific glycosylation pattern of the PSM tandem repeat isolated from blood group A-negative animals, obtaining the mono- (GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr), di- (β-Gal-1,3-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr), and trisaccharide (α-Fuc-1,2-β-Gal-1,3-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) distributions at each individual glycosylation site. The analysis of the glycan distributions from PSM obtained from three different animals with similar oligosaccharide compositions gave highly reproducible site-specific glycosylation patterns with GalNAc and core 1 glycosylation patterns nearly identical to those described previously for pooled mucin (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The analysis of the complete glycosylation pattern of these mucins provides additional support for the notion that oligosaccharide side chain structures and side chain lengths may be modulated to a significant extent by the density of neighboring (presumably partially glycosylated) hydroxyamino acid residues in the polypeptide sequence and that this effect is primarily observed on Ser-linked glycans at the initial step of β-Gal addition by the core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase, forming the core 1 structures. In contrast, our results indicate that the porcine α2-fucosyltransferase in these animals prefers to add Fuc to Ser-linked glycans compared with Thr-linked glycans by a factor of ∼1.6, while exhibiting no correlation to hydroxyamino acid density for either linkage residue. These results unambiguously show that the elongation ofO-linked mucin-type glycans is significantly and reproducibly affected, whether directly or indirectly, by local peptide sequence. This work represents the most complete characterization to date of the in vivo O-linked glycosylation pattern of any highly O-glycosylated glycoprotein. Paired frozen porcine submaxillary glands from individual animals were obtained from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR) and screened for the presence of blood group A determinants by the ability of gland extracts (47Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit the agglutination of human A-positive erythrocytes with Phaseolus limensis lectin (Sigma). Mucin used in this work was purified from paired blood group A-negative glands. Oligomeric PSM tandem repeat glycosylated domains, called TR-PSM, were obtained after trypsinization and gel filtration chromatography of the reduced and carboxymethylated mucin as described previously (37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tandem repeat domains were further purified from contaminating globular proteins by passage through SP-Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mmformic acid, pH 4, followed by passage through octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 1 m(NH4)2SO4, 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 5. The oligosaccharide composition of the purified mucin was obtained by integration of the anomeric carbon resonances of the carbon-13 NMR spectrum (50Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), see below. Mild, 0 °C, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA)/anisole treatments (37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used to trim O-linked glycans from intact or modified TR-PSM domains, leaving intact peptide-linked GalNAc residues. This treatment on intact TR-PSM gives TTR-PSM-containing GalNAc residues at all positions originally containing glycans, irrespective of glycan length or structure. We shall refer to glycopeptides derived by this approach as “Native GalNAc”-PSM tandem repeats. Selective removal of C-3 unsubstituted GalNAc residues on TR-PSM by periodate oxidation (100 mmIO4−, 166 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaHOAc, pH 4.5, 0 °C) followed by NaBH3reduction (∼0.67 m, in 0.5 mNa2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0 °C) and subsequent mild 0 °C TFMSA/anisole treatment was performed as described previously (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This procedure gives TROTR-PSM, which contains GalNAc residues only at those sites originally containing core 1 glycans (i.e. di- and trisaccharides in A-negative blood type mucin). These derivatives will be referred to as “Core 1” PSM tandem repeats. Several changes were made to optimize further these procedures as follows: 1) by using a 10–20-fold molar excess periodate over oxidizable carbohydrate and an oxidation time of 5–6 h; 2) by destroying periodate by NaI/NaHCO3/NaS2O3 (200, 200, and 800 mm) (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); 3) by using a maximum NaBH3reduction time of 15 min with a pH maximum of ∼8.5; and 4) by treating with 0 °C TFMSA/anisole for no more than 4 h. Under these conditions the degradation of the peptide core was kept to a minimum while completely removing oxidized GalNAc. These preparations were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S200 as described previously (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The trisaccharide site-specific glycosylation pattern was determined by the enzymatic conversion of the disaccharide side chains to monosaccharide side chains followed by periodate oxidation and mild TFMSA. Unsubstituted β-1,3-Gal residues of the disaccharide were selectively removed from 20 to 30 mg of TR-PSM in 2–4 ml of buffer by placing in dialysis tubing with 5–8 units of bovine testes β-galactosidase (Sigma, or Glyco Inc., Novato CA) and dialyzing against 250 ml of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, overnight at 33 °C. A prior treatment with 1 unit of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (Sigma) dialyzed against 250 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 4–8 h at 33 °C was performed to remove sialic acid which might interfere with the removal of β-Gal. Glycosidase treatments were repeated until complete removal of β-Gal and sialic acid was demonstrated by the complete loss of the β-Gal and sialic acid anomeric carbon-13 NMR resonances at 105 and 101 ppm, respectively (50Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These preparations after oxidation/reduction and TFMSA treatments (as described above) yield mucin containing GalNAc residues only at sites that originally contained fucosylated trisaccharide. These TROGNTR-PSM preparations (designated “Trisaccharide” PSM tandem repeat domains) were further purified by Sephacryl S200 chromatography (data not shown) giving a major high molecular weight excluded volume peak identical to those reported previously (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the chemical periodate oxidation/reduction approach for removing unsubstituted GalNAc residues, an enzymatic approach was also performed using the α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from chicken liver (Sigma). Briefly 5–10 mg of β-galactosidase-neuraminidase-treated mucin was incubated with 5–10 units of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and dialyzed against ∼250 ml of 100 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 3.7, overnight at 42 °C. Glycosidase treatments were repeated until the complete removal of unsubstituted GalNAc was confirmed by carbon-13 NMR, by monitoring the loss of the unique monosaccharide GalNAc C-5, C-4, and C-3 resonances at 72.57, 69.92, and 69.03 ppm (50Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fully deglycosylated apo-PSM was obtained from Native GalNAc PSM oligomeric tandem repeats (containing only peptide-linked GalNAc residues) as described earlier (53Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by oxidation and alkaline elimination. The 81-residue tandem repeat glycopeptides were obtained from the above Native GAlNAc, Core 1, and Trisaccharide PSM preparations after trypsinolysis with 1% modified sequence grade trypsin (TRSEQZ, Worthington) in 50 mm(NH4)2CO3, pH 8.5, for 7 h at 37 °C (37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Trypsin was inhibited by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tandem repeat glycopeptides were pooled after chromatography on Sephacryl S200. The C-terminal portion of the tandem repeat glycopeptide (residues 39–79) was obtained after N-terminal biotinylation and digested with protease GluC as described (34Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The large C-terminal glycopeptide beginning at residue 39 of the tandem repeat was isolated from the N-terminal glycopeptide after passage through 1 ml of immobilized avidin column (Pierce) and subsequent Sephacryl S200 gel filtration. Pulsed liquid phase Edman degradation amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Process 494 protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using manufacturer recommended pulse liquid cycles as described previously (34Gerken T.A.

Amino acid phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives were chromatographed on an ABI 5-μm C18 PTH column using the fast normal I gradient program. The PTH-Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc elute as two diastereotopic peaks in the chromatogram at relatively unique positions (37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Picomoles of PTH derivatives were obtained after eliminating long range cycle preview and lag for each PTH derivative by a simple base-line subtraction approach as described (37Gerken T.A. Owens C.L.

https://openalex.org/W1967403698,"We previously found that bikunin (bik), a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, suppresses phorbol ester (PMA)-stimulated expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). In the present study, we tried to answer this mechanism using human chondrosarcoma HCS-2/8 cells. Our results showed the following novel findings: (a) the standard form of CD44 (CD44s; 85 kDa) is expressed in both unstimulated and PMA-stimulated cells, while CD44v isoforms containing epitope v9 (110 kDa) are strongly up-regulated in response to treatment with PMA; (b) CD44v isoforms containing epitope v9 present on the same cell exclusively form aggregates in stimulated cells; (c) induction ofuPA mRNA expression could be achieved by using a second cross-linker antibody to cross-link Fab monomers of anti-CD44; (d) co-treatment of stimulated cells with anti-CD44 mAb alone or anti-CD44v9 mAb alone suppresses PMA-induced clustering of CD44, which results in inhibition of uPA overexpression; (e) bikunin efficiently disrupts PMA-induced clustering of CD44, but does not prevent PMA-induced up-regulation of CD44v isoforms containing epitope v9; and (f) after exposure to bik, ∼150-kDa band is mainly detected with immunoprecipitation and this band is shown to be a heterodimer composed of the 110-kDa v9-containing CD44v isoforms and a 45-kDa bik receptor (bik-R). In conclusion, we provide, for the first time, evidence that the bik-R canphysically interact with the CD44v isoforms containing epitope v9 and function as a repressor to down-regulate PMA-stimulated uPA expression, at least in part, by preventing clustering of CD44v isoforms containing epitope v9."
https://openalex.org/W1974931063,"We compared human endothelial cell (EC) responses to interferon-γ (IFNγ) and oncostatin M (OnM), cytokines that utilize Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. Both cytokines cause phosphorylation of Tyr residue 701 and Ser residue 727 of STAT1, as shown by immunoblotting. Both activate DNA binding of STAT1 homodimers, shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, only IFNγ increases expression of three STAT1-dependent gene products examined, namely transporter associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP1), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1), and class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein, as demonstrated by immunoblotting. Only IFNγ increases TAP1 transcription assessed by reporter gene assay. OnM pretreatment or co-treatment does not inhibit IFNγ responses. Interestingly, IFNγ activation of STAT1 is considerably more long-lived than that produced by OnM. To determine whether duration is functionally significant, we transduced EC with a chimeric receptor containing extracellular domains of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β and intracellular regions of gp130, the signaling subunit of the OnM receptor, mutated to prevent binding of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Addition of platelet-derived growth factor to such transduced cells produces STAT1 activation that is comparable in magnitude and duration to that caused by IFNγ, but still fails to induce TAP1, IRF1, or class I MHC molecules. OnM also activates STAT1 but not transcription of STAT1-dependent genes in HepG2 cells. Transient transfection of HepG2 cells with a STAT-defective mouse IFNγ receptor failed to complement the OnM STAT signal. We conclude that STAT1 activation is necessary but not sufficient for induction of transcription of IFNγ-responsive genes.

They are unusually sensitive to activation by interferon-γ (IFNγ), showing IFNγ-dependent expression of class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules under basal conditions, when most other cell types are unresponsive (1Goes N.

A previous study from our laboratory suggested that this sensitivity may be attributed to the fact that EC are relatively deficient in expression of Src homology-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) which normally dampens signaling by IFNγ (4Min W.

Binding of IFNγ to IFNγ receptor-1 (IFNGR1) in the presence of IFNγ receptor-2 (IFNGR2) results in receptor clustering followed by rapid phosphorylation of the intracellular region of the IFNGR1 at Tyr residue 440 by receptor-associated JAKs (7Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic STAT1 proteins then bind to this phosphorylated Tyr residue in IFNGR1 and subsequently become phosphorylated themselves at Tyr residue 701 by receptor-associated JAKs. The tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 proteins dissociate from the receptor and form a homodimer which translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific γ-activated sequence (GAS) elements (TTCNNNGAA consensus sequence) in the enhancers of IFNγ-inducible genes, stimulating their transcription (9Ramana C.V.

The ability of STAT1 to activate gene transcription may additionally depend on phosphorylation of Ser residue 727, possibly through the actions of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family member (11Decker T.

Ramassar V. Goes N. Urmson J. Halloran P.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4260-4269PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinated up-regulation of these proteins by IFNγ enhances the capacity of these cells to present foreign peptides bound to class I MHC molecules to cytolytic CD8+ T cells (21Joly E. Mucke L. Oldstone M.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this way, IFNγ contributes to immune-mediated host defense. Whereas IFNγ is considered to be pro-inflammatory, interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type cytokines are often immunoregulatory or cytoprotective, reducing inflammation and host injury (22Trepicchio W.L. Bozza M. Pedneault G. Dorner A.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3627-3634PubMed Google Scholar, 23Qiu B.S. Pfeiffer C.J. Keith Jr., J.C. Dig. Dis.

The members of this cytokine family which include IL-6, IL-11, leukemia-inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotropic factor, cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M (OnM), utilize a common cytokine receptor signaling subunit, called gp130, which is expressed on the surface of target cells (25Bravo J. Heath J.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2399-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, IL-6-type cytokines associate with a cytokine-binding α chain that, upon ligand binding, heterodimerizes with gp130 and promotes receptor clustering. Receptor-associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) then phosphorylate gp130 on several intracellular tyrosine residues, providing docking sites for adapters and transcription factors. Four tyrosine residues in the intracellular region of gp130 (Tyr-767, Tyr-814, Tyr-905, and Tyr-915) contribute to activation of STAT3 and two of these tyrosine residues (Tyr-905 and Tyr-915) also contribute to the activation of STAT1 (26Gerhartz C.

The levels of STAT1 phosphorylation on Tyr residue 701 induced by treatment with OnM were striking, as assessed by immunoblotting, yet there was no evidence of increased expression of class I MHC molecules. 2K. Mahboubi and J. S. Pober, unpublished observations.2K. Mahboubi and J. S. Pober, unpublished observations. This observation led us to examine more carefully whether OnM can increase the expression of IFNγ-inducible STAT1-dependent proteins in HUVEC. We find that although OnM is a potent activator of STAT1, it cannot activate STAT1-dependent genes. These findings suggest that IFNγ must have some other, as yet unidentified, activities that are necessary for STAT1-dependent gene expression.

Confluent HUVEC cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride and lysed with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min and protein concentrations of supernatant were determined by using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and heating the mixture in a boiling water bath for 3 min. 20 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electrophoresis. After blocking with Tris-buffered saline Tween (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with blocking solution containing the indicated Ab overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated detecting reagent specific for the primary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

HepG2 cells were transiently transfected using Targefect F-2 and peptide enhancer reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Targeting Systems, Santee, CA). To assess the induction of TAP1-GH promoter-reporter gene construct, culture medium was assayed for GH using a solid phase sandwich radioimmunoassay as described by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter (20/20 series, Iso-Data Inc., Palatine, IL). Cell lysates were assayed for Renilla luciferase activity using a Promega reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured using a Berthold model LB9501 luminometer (Schwarzwald, Germany). GH values in ng/ml were normalized to luciferase values in relative light units (RLU) to control for transfection efficiency. To assess the induction of α2M-luciferase promoter-reporter gene construct, cell lysates were assayed for Renilla and Firefly luciferase activities using a dual Promega reporter assay system (Promega) and measured as described above. Firefly luciferase activity in RLU were normalized to Renilla luciferase values in RLU to control for transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared following a modification of the procedure of Dignam et al. (40Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (3 × 106) were harvested by scraping into PBS, resuspended into 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 100 μm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with the mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors used for immunoblotting and incubated 10 min on ice. Cells were lysed by the addition of 15 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 5 min, vortexed for 10 s, and the nuclei pelleted by centrifugation (500 × g, 2 min, 4 °C). The nuclear pellets were washed with 100 μl of buffer A, resuspended in 50 μl of extraction buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above, and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on rocking platform, the tubes were then centrifuged (20 min at 11,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove debris from the extract. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined to be 1 to 2 μg/μl against a BSA standard using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A final concentration of 10% glycerol was added to the extracts and nuclear extracts were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. The following oligonucleotides were used in EMSAs (listed 5′ to 3′: complement sequence are not shown): sis-inducible element of the c-Fos promoter region (m67SIE): GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC (41Wagner B.J.

Briefly, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), and separated from unincorporated nucleotides over a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciencss, Inc.). Nuclear extracts (10 μl) containing 4 μg of protein were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 10 μl of EMSA mixture (2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 2 μm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μl of probe). Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol in a Tris glycine-EDTA buffer (0.8 m glycine, 100 mm Tris base, 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 4 h. Gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed. For immunoanalysis of STAT-DNA complexes, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody to STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or irrelevant rabbit Ab at room temperature for 20 min prior to addition of DNA. The EMSA mixture containing the labeled m67SIE-oligonucleotide was then added for an additional 20 min and EMSA was performed. The presence of STAT1 in a complex was assessed by loss of a band in the presence of anti-STAT1 Ab, but not irrelevant Ab. Retroviral expression vectors coding for chimeric receptors containing the extracellular domains of human PDGFRβ receptor and transmembrane and cytosolic portions of wild type gp130 (gp130(Y759)) or mutant gp130 (gp130(Y759F)), in which Tyr residue 759 was replaced with Phe, were constructed as follows. Human PDGFRβ cDNA in expression vector pLXSN was obtained from Dr. A. Kazlauskas (Schepens Eye Research Institute, Boston, MA). The DNA fragment coding for the extracellular domains of PDGFRβ receptor (1593 bp) was isolated by PCR amplification. Human gp130(Y759) cDNA and human gp130(Y759F) in expression vector pSVL was kindly provided by Dr. F. Schaper (Institute für Biochemie, Aachen, Germany). The DNA fragments (947 bp) coding for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130(Y759) and gp130(Y759F) were isolated by PCR amplification. TheHindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the extracellular domains of PDGFRβ receptor andEcoRI-NotI fragment containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 were subcloned into the LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector using 5′ HindIII and 3′ NotI cloning sites. The LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector and LZRSpBMN-Z retroviral vector containing EGFP was kindly provided from Dr. A. Bothwell (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT) (42Zheng L. Dengler T.J.

These retroviral vectors containing EGFP, PDGFRβ-gp130(Y759), and PDGFRβ-gp130(Y759F) were directly transfected into the Phoenix-Amphoteric packaging cell line using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection Phoenix cells were selected in media containing puromycin (1 μg/ml) and puromycin-resistant cells were used to condition medium, providing a source of retroviral stock. Transduction of HUVEC was accomplished by serial infections over 2 weeks without drug selection as previously described (42Zheng L. Dengler T.J. Kluger M.S. Madge L.A. Schechner J.S. Maher S.E. Pober J.S. Bothwell A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A round of viral infections in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) was performed for 5 h with HUVEC in primary culture. The normal growth medium was replaced and cells were maintained overnight. The infection was repeated the next day. After the second round of infection, cells were passaged and then the process of double infection was repeated. Using this protocol the percentage of HUVEC expressing transduced genes is routinely >95%. For immunostaining, HUVEC were washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and incubated for 1 min with trypsin/EDTA. Detached cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% BSA, and incubated with specific mouse monoclonal Ab to PDGFRβ (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or irrelevant control Ab for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, 1% BSA and then were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ab (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 30 min on ice followed by washing twice with PBS, 1% BSA prior to fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde.

In some GPCR systems, arrestins have also been demonstrated to be involved in receptor internalization, resensitization, and the activation of signaling cascades. The objective of the current study was to examine binding interactions of members of the arrestin family with the formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a member of the GPCR family of receptors. Peptides representing the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of the FPR were synthesized and bound to polystyrene beads via a biotin/streptavidin interaction. Using fluorescein-conjugated arrestins, binding interactions between arrestins and the bead-bound FPR carboxyl terminus were analyzed by flow cytometry. Arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 bound to the FPR carboxyl-terminal peptide in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, withK d values in the micromolar range. Binding of visual arrestin, which binds rhodopsin with high selectivity, was not observed. Arrestin-2-(1–382) and arrestin-3-(1–393), truncated mutant forms of arrestin that display phosphorylation-independent binding to intact receptors, were also observed to bind the bead-bound FPR terminus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, but with much greater affinity than the full-length arrestins, yieldingK d values in the 5–50 nm range. Two additional arrestin mutants, which are full-length but display phosphorylation-independent binding to intact GPCRs, were evaluated for their binding affinity to the FPR carboxyl terminus. Whereas the single point mutant, arrestin-2 R169E, displayed an affinity similar to that of the full-length arrestins, the triple point mutant, arrestin-2 I386A/V387A/F388A, displayed an affinity more similar to that of the truncated forms of arrestin. The results suggest that the carboxyl terminus of arrestin is a critical determinant in regulating the binding affinity of arrestin for the phosphorylated domains of GPCRs.

G protein-coupled receptor N-formyl peptide receptor fluorescein isothiocyanate mitogen-activated protein bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are the largest family of cellular surface receptors, the mediators of numerous physiological responses, and the targets of ∼50% of therapeutic drugs (1Gurrath M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1257-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Their activation occurs through the binding of specific ligands to the extracellular face of the receptor, whereas cellular activation is mediated through interactions with cytoplasmic proteins, such as G proteins. Following ligand-mediated activation, GPCRs are the target of regulatory mechanisms aimed initially at terminating and then at reinitiating the signaling capacity of the cell. Furthermore, GPCR processing has also been shown to be important in the activation of Src and certain MAP kinase pathways (2Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The protein arrestin was first characterized as a protein involved in GPCR desensitization following receptor phosphorylation, but has recently been demonstrated to play multiple roles in receptor function, including acting as an adapter for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a scaffolding protein for MAP kinase cascade components (3Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In light of our expanding knowledge of arrestin's many diverse functions, it is clear that a greater understanding of its interactions with GPCRs is essential. Arrestins comprise a family of four known members in mammals: two visual arrestins, 1 and 4, found in the rod and cone cells of the retina, and two nonvisual arrestins, 2 and 3, which are found in most other tissues of the body (4Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å crystal structure of visual arrestin (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and 1.9-Å crystal structure of arrestin-2 (6Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) both indicate that arrestin exists as a bipartite molecule consisting of two seven-stranded β sandwiches with a network of hydrogen-bonded charged residues forming what has been described as a polar core (5Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The current model of arrestin-mediated interactions with ligand-occupied GPCRs holds that, after ligand occupancy, cytoplasmic regions of the receptor are phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues by a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (7Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Upon arrestin binding, these phosphorylated residues disrupt arrestin's polar core, inducing a conformational change within the molecule that allows it to interact further with the receptor (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This model proposes that arrestin binding to the receptor blocks further receptor interactions with G proteins, presumably by steric inhibition, thus preventing further G protein-mediated cellular activation (9Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that arrestins play roles in receptor signaling other than desensitization. Arrestin has been shown to act as an adapter protein that interacts with the clathrin adapter AP-2 as well as with clathrin itself, leading to the internalization of some arrestin-bound receptors via clathrin-coated pits (10Goodman Jr., O.B.

Arrestin has also been suggested to determine the rate of resensitization and re-expression of receptors based upon the rate of its dissociation from internalized receptor (12Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A.

However, one of the more recent observations made of arrestin has been the discovery that arrestins act as scaffolding proteins in some MAP kinase cascades, specifically in cascades leading to JNK3 and ERK2 activation (14DeFea K.A.

These studies have elevated arrestin's role in receptor signaling from a desensitizing agent to an active and multipurpose participant in signal transduction. Despite the importance of arrestin-GPCR interactions, little is known about the receptor domains and mechanisms involved in arrestin binding. Mutagenesis experiments have defined regions of arrestin involved in recognizing the phosphorylation status as well as the activation status (i.e. whether or not ligand is bound) of the receptor (6Han M.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Swapping of carboxyl-terminal domains between GPCRs has also indicated that the pattern of receptor phosphorylation in this domain can affect rates of receptor internalization and recycling/resensitization (13Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We have been examining mechanisms of receptor activation, desensitization, and internalization using theN-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a member of the chemoattractant/chemokine family of receptors (20Bennett T.A.

Our results have demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation is critical in arrestin binding (22Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Arrestin interactions with the FPR are, however, not required for FPR internalization or the prevention of G protein binding, as we have recently demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation alone can be sufficient to block G protein interactions in the absence of arrestin (22Bennett T.A.

These results suggest that the primary roles of arrestin in certain GPCR systems may in fact be to act as an adapter and a scaffold. In this study, we examined the interactions between members of the arrestin family with the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of the FPR using a bead-based, cell-free assay. Biotinylated peptides were synthesized that represent the 47 residues of the FPR carboxyl terminus in both a phosphorylated and unphosphorylated state and bound to streptavidin-coated, polystyrene beads that were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated arrestins and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess arrestin binding. We found that arrestins bound carboxyl-terminal peptides in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Truncated arrestins, which normally bind intact receptor in a phosphorylation-independent manner, also bound only phosphorylated peptides on beads. Additionally, direct binding and competition assays demonstrate that truncated arrestins bind the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal peptide with significantly higher affinity than full-length arrestins. When compared with phosphorylation-independent, full-length variants of arrestin, our results reveal an important role for the carboxyl-terminal domain of arrestin in controlling the affinity of binding interactions with phosphorylated receptor domains. Streptavidin-coated 6.2-μm beads were purchased from Spherotech, Inc. Chicken anti-FPR carboxyl terminus (generated from a peptide representing the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids of the receptor) and goat anti-chicken-FITC antibodies were purchased from Aves Lab, Inc. Alkaline phosphatase (Escherichia coli), protease inhibitor mixture 1, and phosphatase inhibitor were purchased from Calbiochem, Inc. NHS-fluorescein was purchased from Pierce and Molecular Probes. Plasticware was obtained from VWR Scientific. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Arrestin proteins were expressed in E. coli (strain BL21) and purified by sequential heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose chromatography essentially as described (25Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 422-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated N-formyl peptide receptor carboxyl-terminal peptides were synthesized by New England Peptide, Inc. Briefly, peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method using Fmoc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems 433 peptide synthesizer. Phospho-residues were incorporated as Fmoc-Ser[PO(OBzl)OH] and Fmoc-Thr[PO(OBzl)OH]. The peptide was cleaved with reagent K for 4 h at room temperature and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, on a YMC C18 column with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile. Mass was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry using a Perseptive Voyager. Biotinylated FLAG peptide (DYKDDDKKεNH-biotin) was synthesized at the University of New Mexico Protein Chemistry Laboratory as described (26Buranda T. Lopez G.P. Simons P. Pastuszyn A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Approximately 50,000 (as determined with a hemacytomer) 6.2-μm streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads were used per assay. The nonspecific bead binding sites were first blocked by incubation in 0.1% BSA in TBS for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Excess (7–15 μm) biotinylated peptide was added and incubated with the beads for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with several volumes of 0.1% BSA in TBS. To detect FPR-derived peptides on the streptavidin beads, peptide-coated beads were incubated with the chicken anti-FPR carboxyl-terminal antibody (1:100), washed three times with several volumes of 0.1% BSA in TBS, and then incubated with goat anti-chicken-FITC antibody (1:100). To detect phosphorylated peptides on the streptavidin beads, peptide-coated beads were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of mouse anti-phosphoserine-FITC and mouse anti-phosphothreonine-FITC (1:200 for each antibody). All incubations were for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Arrestin-2, arrestin-2-(1–382), and arrestin-3-(1–393) were fluoresceinated using NHS-fluorescein according to instructions provided by Pierce. Briefly, arrestin (100–400 μg) in 25 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.5, was incubated in 2% NHS-fluorescein for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The reaction was then quenched by addition of excess Tris-HCl (pH 7.6, 100 mm final). The labeled arrestin was separated from unreacted fluorescein and the buffer exchanged by Sephadex gel filtration or centrifugal filtration using the Centricon YM-30,000 (Millipore). Concentrated labeled arrestin was resuspended in arrestin storage buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 1, pH 7.5) to a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. The average fluorescein to protein ratio ranged from 2 to 5 for all arrestin preparations. Streptavidin-coated beads were blocked with 0.1% BSA in TBS for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Biotinylated peptides or free biotin was added in a molar excess relative to the number of binding sites on the beads and incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% BSA in TBS, then incubated with arrestin-2-FITC for 1–2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Direct binding experiments were carried out using phosphorylated FPR carboxyl terminus coated beads in 15 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS. The beads were incubated with the indicated amounts of arrestin-2-FITC, arrestin-2-(1–382)-FITC, or arrestin-3-(1–393)-FITC for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The fluorescence observed with unphosphorylated FPR carboxyl terminus coated beads incubated with the maximum amount of arrestin-2-FITC, arrestin-2-(1–382)-FITC, or arrestin-3-(1–393)-FITC was used as a measure of background fluorescence. Competitive binding experiments were carried out using phosphorylated FPR carboxyl terminus coated beads in 15 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS. The indicated amounts of unlabeled arrestin was added immediately, followed by the addition of arrestin-2-FITC or arrestin-3-(1–393)-FITC. The beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, pelleted, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1% BSA in TBS, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. The fluorescence observed with unphosphorylated FPR carboxyl terminus coated beads incubated with arrestin-2-FITC or arrestin-3-(1–393)-FITC was used as a measure of background fluorescence. K d andK i values were calculated using Prism software (GraphPad Software). The FPR was solubilized in its phosphorylated state from membranes by n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside as recently described (23Key T.A. Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J.

Briefly, FPR-expressing U937 cells were grown until confluent and stimulated at 37 °C with 10 μm fMLF. Membranes were isolated by nitrogen cavitation and solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Calbiochem). Purified, wild type arrestin-2 was incubated with either 140 μm 47-mer or phospho-47-mer, or equivalent volume buffer at 4 °C for 90 min. The detergent-solubilized FPR was then added to each of the arrestin samples and mixed for 10 min at 4 °C. Controls containing solubilized receptor and buffer alone were also analyzed.N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (10 nm) was added and the samples gently mixed at 4 °C for 120 min. Blocked samples received an excess of nonfluorescent peptide, 1 μm N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Phe (fMLFF), 15 min prior to fluorescent ligand addition. Following ligand incubation, samples were brought up to a volume of 200 μl of buffer containing 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and transferred to an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (Spectronics). For the first 10 s, equilibrium fluorescence was obtained. At 10 s, 60 nm anti-fluorescein antibody was added, which has been shown to bind unbound fMLFK-FITC with high affinity. Therefore, after an initial quenching resulting from the binding of antibody to free ligand, the decline in fluorescence over time is a measure of the dissociation rate of ligand from receptor, reflecting the extent of FPR-arrestin complex formation. Arrestin proteins are known to display selectivity for the activated (i.e. ligand-bound), phosphorylated form of GPCRs. In most GPCRs, it is the carboxyl-terminal domain that undergoes ligand-dependent phosphorylation, although in the case of a number of receptors such as the m2-muscarinic receptor, phosphorylation takes place on the large third intracellular loop (27Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), or even the second intracellular loop, as in the case of the μ opioid receptor (28Celver J.P. Lowe J. Kovoor A. Gurevich V.V. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4894-4900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the case of the FPR, arrestin binding requires phosphorylation at multiple sites within the carboxyl-terminal domain as well as an intact DRY sequence at the beginning of the second intracellular loop, which may serve to convey the activation state of the receptor. However, little is known regarding the individual contributions of various receptor domains to arrestin binding. The goal of this study was to investigate arrestin interactions with the FPR carboxyl terminus. To this end, we designed a bead-based assay wherein the isolated FPR carboxyl terminus could be allowed to interact with arrestins and then analyzed for arrestin binding by flow cytometry. Isolation of the carboxyl terminus of the FPR was provided by synthetic peptides that duplicate the carboxyl-terminal 47-amino acid sequence of the FPR (Fig. 1). These peptides were synthesized both as an unphosphorylated 47-amino acid peptide (hereafter referred to as 47-mer) and a phosphorylated version of that peptide, containing phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues at 4 sites (Thr-329, Thr-331, Thr-336, and Ser-338) (hereafter referred to as phospho-47-mer, Fig. 1). The phosphorylated peptides were designed to represent the carboxyl terminus of the FPR following G protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation, which has been seen to occur after agonist occupancy of the intact receptor (29Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15213-15219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These particular sites were chosen because they represent partial phosphorylation of the two serine/threonine-rich regions of the FPR carboxyl terminus (sites A and B in Fig. 1) that we have previously identified as being crucial to receptor desensitization, internalization, and arrestin binding (21Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of either site A or site B alone is inadequate to permit arrestin binding to the FPR, but introduction of either of the first or second pair of serine and threonine residues within site A combined with phosphorylation within site B restores arrestin binding (22Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49195-49203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The peptides were biotinylated at the amino terminus to allow for specific and oriented binding to streptavidin-coated beads of a size suitable for analysis by flow cytometry. Binding of the biotinylated peptides to the streptavidin beads was assessed with both anti-FPR as well as anti-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibodies. Streptavidin-coated beads that had been incubated with 47-mer or phospho-47-mer were stained with a chicken anti-FPR carboxyl terminus (amino acids 341–350) antibody and secondarily stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-chicken antibody. The fluorescence of these beads, as measured by flow cytometry, was compared with that of control beads that had been incubated with either a biotinylated FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK-biotin) or free biotin. The relative fluorescence of the two FPR carboxyl-terminal peptide-incubated beads shows clearly that these peptides are present on the beads and that there is little nonspecific binding of the antibody to biotin or the control FLAG peptide (Fig.2 A). Similar experiments were performed where beads incubated with 47-mer, phospho-47-mer, biotinylated FLAG peptide, or free biotin were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of FITC-labeled mouse anti-phosphoserine and mouse anti-phosphothreonine antibody. The relative fluorescence as revealed by flow cytometry showed excellent discrimination by the antibodies between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal peptides as well as little nonspecific binding to beads that were bound with FLAG peptide or biotin (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate both the binding of synthetic peptides to beads and the capability to distinguish phosphorylated from unphosphorylated peptides on beads. The current understanding of GPCR desensitization and internalization holds that, after agonist occupation of the receptor and dissociation of G protein, serine and threonine residues in cytoplasmic domains of the receptor are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (7Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated domain disrupts charge-charge interactions within the arrestin protein, inducing a conformational change that allows arrestin to bind additional cytoplasmic regions of the receptor and thus prevent further interactions with G protein (8Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether arrestins can bind to an individual domain of the FPR, in either its phosphorylated or unphosphorylated state, arrestin-2 was labeled with fluorescein. Beads were incubated with 47-mer, phospho-47-mer, biotinylated FLAG, or free biotin. The beads were washed and incubated with fluorescein-labeled arrestin-2. Histogram data obtained from flow cytometry indicated that arrestin-2-FITC-treated phospho-47-mer-coated beads displayed ∼5–10-fold greater fluorescence than arrestin-2-FITC-treated, 47-mer-coated beads (Fig. 3 A). Fluorescence associated with the 47-mer-coated beads was similar to that observed with beads coated with biotinylated FLAG peptide or free biotin, suggesting that there was no specific binding to the unphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal peptide. To determine whether the high level of bead-associated fluorescence was indeed caused by specific arrestin-2-FITC binding, phospho-47-mer-coated beads were preincubated with excess unlabeled arrestin-2 before incubation with arrestin-2-FITC. In this instance, fluorescence was reduced to the level seen with 47-mer-coated, FLAG-coated, and biotin blocked beads (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate arrestin-2 binds the FPR carboxyl-terminal peptide on beads in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, consistent with our observations of arrestin-2 binding to intact FPR in live cells (22Bennett T.A.

The possibility existed that the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated 47-mer peptides assume fundamentally different conformations in solution as a result of folding during the synthesis or rehydration of the lyophilized peptides.

Remnant kidney glomerular injury is limited in female rats compared with male rats despite similar elevations in glomerular capillary pressure. In vitro, mechanical strain leads to the activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated kinase (p44/42 MAPK) and Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in glomerular mesangial cells (MC). Accordingly, we studied the effect of 17β-estradiol on mechanical strain-induced signal transduction in MC. Exposure of MC to mechanical strain increased p44/42 MAPK activation (3-fold) and SAPK activation (2.5-fold), and kinase activation was inhibited by pretreatment with 17β-estradiol (10−8 to 10−11m) for 24 h in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanical strain-induced nuclear translocation of p44/42 MAPK and SAPK and nuclear protein binding to AP-1 were also attenuated by 17β-estradiol. The inhibitory effects of 17β-estradiol were not reproduced by the cell-impermeable estrogen, BSA/17β-estradiol, nor did preincubation with 17β-estradiol lead to actin cytoskeleton disassembly or impaired stress fiber formation. However, 17β-estradiol did increase base-line levels of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1. The inhibitory effects of 17β-estradiol on p44/42 MAPK activation and SAPK activation, translocation, and AP-1 binding were all abrogated by the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI-182,780. We conclude that attenuation of mechanical strain-induced MAPK activation by 17β-estradiol is dependent on intracellular estrogen receptor. The attenuation of stretch-induced kinase activation may be due, at least in part, to an effect of 17β-estradiol on MKP-1 expression.

Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F324-F337PubMed Google Scholar). This is most directly apparent in the ability of agents that prevent rises in intraglomerular pressure, such as angiotensin antagonists, to delay disease progression (2Anderson S. Meyer T.W. Rennke H.G. Brenner B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). More recently, other factors that impact progression of chronic renal disease have also been identified. Interestingly, it has been reported that females progress more slowly than males, and a protective effect of gender has been hypothesized (3Silbiger S.R. Neugarten J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 515-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In support of this, estrogen has been found to limit both mesangial cell (MC) proliferation and matrix protein production (4Kwan G. Neugarten J. Sherman M. Ding Q. Fotadar U. Lei J. Silbiger S. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It was reported that acute estrogen exposure activated p42/44 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 in resting MC and that this resulted in suppression of matrix protein synthesis (5Neugarten J. Medve I. Lei J. Silbiger S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies also demonstrated that preincubation with estrogen antagonized p44/42 MAPK activation in response to angiotensin II or platelet-derived growth factor (5Neugarten J. Medve I. Lei J. Silbiger S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar). Since estrogen exposurein vivo is not an acute event, it is probable that this latter observation is the more relevant.MC are positioned as architectural supports for capillary loops and are therefore exposed in vivo to pulsatile stretch/relaxation (6Akai Y. Homma T. Burns K.D. Yasuda T. Badr K.F. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of mechanical forces on MC in vitro can be modeled by culturing cells in wells with deformable bottoms, with application of a vacuum to the well to generate alternating cycles of strain and relaxation. Induction of mRNA for c-fos, the proto-oncogene and AP-1 transcription factor component, maximally at 30 min was the paradigmatic response observed with this system (6Akai Y. Homma T. Burns K.D. Yasuda T. Badr K.F. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MC proliferation (7Harris R.C. Haralson M.A. Badr K.F. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar) and collagenous and noncollagenous extracellular matrix protein synthesis, the sine qua non of sclerotic injury, are observed after 48 h of pulsatile stretch-relaxation (8Riser B.L.

Thai K. Ly H. Kang M. Scholey J.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 476-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that MC proliferation in this setting was associated with MAPK activity (10Ingram A.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1067-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We further showed that the ability of stretch to activate p44/42 MAPK was dependent on the actin cytoskeleton (12Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40301-40306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both p44/42 MAPK and SAPK are well recognized to lie upstream of AP-1 (13Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). In support of the importance of p44/42 MAPK/AP-1 signaling, glomerular p44/42 MAPK activation and AP-1 nuclear protein binding were shown in response to angiotensin II infusion (14Hamaguchi A. Kim S. Yano M. Yamanaka S. Iwao H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 372-380PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 activation may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerular sclerosis, since it has been shown to mediate transforming growth factor-β1 induction (15Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Given the apparent protective effect of female gender on renal disease progression, the ability of preincubation with estrogen to down-regulate growth factor-induced p44/42 MAPK activity, and the induction of MAPK by MC stress, we postulated that estrogen was likely to inhibit MC MAPK activation in stretched cells. Accordingly, we studied the effect of estrogen on stretch-induced activation of p44/42 MAPK and SAPK in MC.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureSprague-Dawley rat MC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Experiments were carried out in cells between passages 15 and 20.Application of Strain/RelaxationMC (5 × 104/well) were plated on six-well plates with flexible bottoms coated with bovine type I collagen (Flexcell International Corp., McKeesport, PA). Cells were grown to confluence for 72 h and then rendered quiescent by incubation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum. To characterize the time of maximum response, cells were initially exposed to cycles of strain/relaxation for periods of 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min, generated by a cyclic vacuum produced by a computer-driven system (Flexercell Strain Unit 2000; Flexcell). To establish if more than one peak of MAPK activation exists, a longer time course with stretch exposure for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min and 4 and 24 h was conducted. For all experiments, plates were exposed to continuous cycles of strain/relaxation, each cycle consisting of 0.5 s of strain and 0.5 s of relaxation, for a total of 60 cycles/min. Initially, vacuum pressures used were −10 to −27 kPa, inducing a 16–28% elongation in the diameter of the surface. Subsequent experiments were performed at the time and strain level of maximal response, 10 min and −27 kPa (average 28% elongation in diameter of the plates).For experiments studying estrogen effects, 17β-estradiol or the cell-impermeable 17β-estradiol/bovine serum albumin (BSA) (both from Sigma) were added at the indicated concentrations 24 h prior to the initiation of stretch protocols. ICI-182,780 (Tocris Cookson, St. Louis, MO), a high affinity estrogen receptor antagonist, was added 24 h prior to the initiation of stretch protocols where indicated.MAPK Phosphorylation and ActivitiesProtein Isolation and Western BlottingInitially, the time course and concentration dependence of MAPK activities in response to stretch were studied, and subsequent experiments were performed at −27 kPa at 10 min. Cultures were serum-starved overnight prior to stretch protocols. After stretch protocols with or without estrogen and inhibitors, medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmDTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysate (50 μg/lane) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 5% skim milk, primary antibodies were applied. The following antibodies were used for immunoblots: anti- p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (1:500), anti-SAPK (1:500), anti-phospho-p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Thr202/Tyr204, 1:1000), anti-phospho-SAPK (Thr183/Tyr185, 1:1000) (New England Biolabs), anti-MKP-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MKP-3 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma). Signals were detected by use of an ECL Western blotting Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).Activity AssaysAfter protein isolation from total cell lysate as above, 200 μg of total protein was then incubated with p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody (1:200) New England Biolabs) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl of 50% beads) were then added, and the gentle rocking continued an additional 3 h. Lysate was then microcentrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm to recover the beads, and the pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of 1× lysis buffer. For kinase assays, after immunoprecipitation, pellets were washed twice with 0.5 ml of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2). p44/42 MAPK activity was then performed by suspending the pellet in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer, with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk1 fusion protein. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated with 25 μm 3× sds sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm DTT, 0.3% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, vortexed, and then microcentrifuged for 2 min. 20 μl of sample was then run on a SDS-PAGE gel. Membranes were then blotted to nitrocellulose, incubated overnight at 4 °C with phosphospecific anti-Elk (Ser383) antibody (1:1000) and visualized as above. To assay SAPK activity, a “pull-down” SAPK assay was employed. After protein isolation as above, 2 μg of c-Jun fusion protein beads (New England Biolabs) were added to 250 μg of cell lysate protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Lysate was then centrifuged for 30 s to recover the beads and washed twice with 1× lysis buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in kinase buffer and boiled as previously. 20 μl of sample was run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Blotting and detection were performed as above, except that the primary antibody was phosphospecific c-Jun (Ser63) at 1:1000 dilution.ERα ImmunoblottingERα expression in response to 17β-estradiol was assessed in unstretched cells by immunoblotting exactly as above with monoclonal mouse anti-ERα (1:500; Affinity Bioreagents) as the primary antibody.Fluorescence MicroscopyMAPK Nuclear TranslocationAfter each strain protocol with or without estrogen and inhibitors, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (300 μl/well) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, washed again with PBS and incubated with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK or anti-phospho-SAPK (both 1:50 dilution in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with an Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) 1:50 dilution in PBS for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed and then mounted by removing the flexible base from each well and placing it directly on a glass slide using one drop of anti-fade mount medium (Slow Fade, Molecular Probe). A drop of mount medium was then placed on top of the cells and covered with a glass slip. Slides were stored at 4 °C in the dark until confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope within 10 days.F-actin StainingMC were fixed with formaldehyde exactly as above and then permeabilized by dipping in acetone for 5 min at −20 °C. Subsequently, Texas Red phalloidin solution (Molecular Probes) was applied for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed, mounted, and analyzed exactly as above.Nuclear Protein Binding to AP-1 Consensus SequencesAfter each strain protocol, MC were washed in cold PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared by lysis in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.6% Nonidet P-40), homogenized, and sedimented at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.42 m NaCl2, 20% glycerol and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g, the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected, and protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad assay kit.Radiolabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were prepared by incubating 2 μl of consensus oligonucleotide (1.75 pmol/μl; Promega), 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase 10× buffer, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/ml) (Amersham Biosciences), and 5 μl of nuclease-free water for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Unlabeled [32P]ATP was removed from the oligonucleotide mixture with Chroma-Spin STE-10 columns (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).Nuclear proteins (3 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.8 mm MgCl2,2 mm DTT, 0.5 EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml BSA) for 30 min at room temperature and then reacted with radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotides at room temperature for 20 min (50,000–100,000 cpm). Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Competition experiments were performed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides.RNA Isolation and Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCRTotal RNA from MC was isolated by the single step method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62970) Google Scholar) as we have described (17Ingram A. Parbtani A. Thai K. Ly H. Shankland S.J. Morrissey G. Scholey J.W. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1857-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA was stored in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at −80 °C. The purity and concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 and 280 nm prior to use. TheA 260/A 280 ratio ranged from 1.75–1.95.Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as previously reported (17Ingram A. Parbtani A. Thai K. Ly H. Shankland S.J. Morrissey G. Scholey J.W.

The specific primer sequences were as follows: β-actin, 5′-AAC CCT AAG GCC AAC CGT GAA AAG-3′ and 3′-TCA TGA GGT AGT CTG TCA GGT C-5′; c-fos, 5′-GAGCTGACAGATACGCTCCAAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGGGTCTGCTGCAATTAAGGAAGGGAAAACCCAA-3′.For amplification, 2.5 μl of the RT product was mixed with 7.5 μl of PCR mix containing 0.1 μm of each of the primer pairs and 2 units of Taq polymerase. The sample was placed onto a PerkinElmer DNA thermal cycler (model 480) and heated to 94 °C for 4 min prior to the application of temperature cycles. β-Actin was co-amplified to standardize the amount of RNA subjected to reverse transcription. The temperature cycle for amplification was as follows: 1) denaturing at 94 °C for 60 s, 2) cooling-annealing at 55 °C for 30 s; and 3) heat extension at 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products plateaued at 28 cycles; therefore, 25 cycles was chosen for the final amplification. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, photographed, and quantitated with a GS 300 transmittance/reflectance scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) utilizing a MacIntosh Class II (System 7.0) computer and Dynamax HPLC Method Management (version 1.2) software.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed with the INSTAT statistical package (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The difference between means was analyzed using the Bonferroni Multiple comparison test. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.DISCUSSIONIn the best characterized animal model of chronic renal failure, the subtotally nephrectomized rat, increased glomerular capillary pressure (as little as 20%) triggers MC responses that ultimately result in glomerulosclerosis (8Riser B.L. Cortes P. Zhao X. Bernstein J. Dumler F. Narins R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Yasuda T. Kondo S. Homma T. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it has been observed that female rats subjected to subtotal nephrectomy suffer only a fraction of the sclerotic injury observed in male rats (28Lombet J.R. Adler S.G. Anderson P.S. Nast C.C. Olsen D.R. Glassock R.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1989; 114: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, differences in glomerular hemodynamics have also been observed in female rats, with a tendency to vasorelaxation (29Munger K. Baylis C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F223-F231PubMed Google Scholar).The MC is central to the injurious glomerular response to insults that result in progressive renal failure, such as subtotal nephrectomy. In vitro studies of the application of cyclic mechanical strain to MC have demonstrated that this stimulus results in MC proliferation (30Harris R.C. Akai Y. Yasuda T. Homma T. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 45: 17-21PubMed Google Scholar) and production of collagenous protein (7Harris R.C. Haralson M.A. Badr K.F. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar), thus mimicking the in vivo responses observed after increases in intraglomerular pressure. We and others have repeatedly observed activation of MAPKs in response to either cyclic or static MC strain and have shown such activation to signal proliferation and matrix production (9Kawata Y. Mizukami Y. Fujii Z. Sakamura T. Yoshida K. Matsuzaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16905-16912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Ingram A.J. James L. Ly H. Thai K.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the apparent protection afforded by female gender to 5/6 nephrectomized rats, we hypothesized that estrogen would limit MAPK activation in stretched MC and thus prevent proliferation.Indeed, the first major finding of the current study was that 24-h preincubation with 17β-estradiol prevented the usual prompt activation of p44/42 MAPK and SAPK observed after the initiation of strain. Similarly, the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated kinases was also prevented. Tellingly, preincubation with 17β-estradiol for 2 h was unable to affect strain activation, suggesting that the observed effect of estrogen was not an acute event but probably involved genomic actions. This was supported by two other observations, that inhibition of 17β-estradiol binding to receptors by ICI 182,780 restored MAPK activation in stretched cells and that a cell-impermeable estrogen agonist, 17β-estradiol/BSA, had significantly less inhibitory effect on strain-induced MAPK signaling. These data indicate that 17β-estradiol enters the cell and binds to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors to exert inhibitory actions on MAPK signaling.A number of studies have examined the effect of estrogen on vascular smooth muscle cells and MC, and estrogen has been shown to inhibit serum and growth factor-induced p44/42 MAPK activity. In addition, 17β-estradiol limits tumor necrosis factor α-induced SAPK activation in chondrocytes. Interestingly, estrogen was found to inhibit type I collagen synthesis in quiescent MC in response to transforming growth factor-β1, an effect that is dependent on Sp1 (5Neugarten J. Medve I. Lei J. Silbiger S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies of the effects of 17β-estradiol on strain-induced kinase activation in MC are in accord with these observations. Short term studies have, however, also revealed that 17β-estradiol can activate MAPKs (5Neugarten J. Medve I. Lei J. Silbiger S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was also observed with selective estrogen receptor modulators (23Neugarten J. Acharya A. Lei J. Silbiger S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F309-F318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although two or more peaks of MAPK activity may occur in MC in response to some stimuli (33Bonacchi A. Romagnani P. Romanelli R.G. Efsen E. Annunziato F. Lasagni L. Francalanci M. Serio M. Laffi G. Pinzani M. Gentilini P. Marra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9945-9954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we observed only one peak of MAPK activation over 24 h of strain.The two well established nuclear estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, are known to exist in murine MC (23Neugarten J. Acharya A. Lei J. Silbiger S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F309-F318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of ERα after ligation by estrogenic agonists such as 17β-estradiol are well defined. One target of the activated nuclear ERα is AP-1. An interaction between the ERα-estrogen complex can modify binding of the Fos-Jun heterodimer to AP-1 consensus sequences (34Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated p44/42 MAPK-dependent induction of AP-1 nuclear protein binding in stretched MC (12Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40301-40306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consequently, we reasoned that 17β-estradiol might affect AP-1 nuclear protein binding to consensus sequences in stretched MC. Consistent with its inhibitory effects on p44/42 MAPK and SAPK activation, 17β-estradiol also prevented AP-1 nuclear protein binding in stretched MC. As expected, this effect depends on an interaction of 17β-estradiol with the ER, since it could be prevented by ICI 182,780. Concordantly, c-fos induction in this setting was also inhibited by 17β-estradiol. We and others have shown that MAPK-AP-1 signaling is a critical inducer of proliferation in stretched MC (9Kawata Y. Mizukami Y. Fujii Z. Sakamura T. Yoshida K. Matsuzaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16905-16912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K.

Harris R.C. Contrib. Nephrol. 1996; 118: 222-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of 17β-estradiol to inhibit this signaling pathway was not via up-regulation of ERα, since incubation of MC with 10−8 17β-estradiol for 24 h did not affect ERα expression by Western blot.We have demonstrated that stretch-induced MAPK activation depends on the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton (12Ingram A.J. James L. Cai L. Thai K. Ly H. Scholey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40301-40306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been observed that estrogen leads to actin depolymerization in cervical epithelia (36Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C2028-C2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that cytoplasmic estrogen receptors may interact with RhoGTPases (37Su L.F. Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consequently, we sought to determine whether the ability of 17β-estradiol to prevent stretch-induced MAPK signaling in MC was secondary to effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Phalloidin staining revealed that actin stress fibers formed normally (within 10 min) in stretched MC in the presence of estrogen, indicating that other mechanisms must account for estrogen's inhibition of MAPK signaling in this setting.Recently, Nuedling et al. (38Nuedling S. Kahlert S. Loebbert K. Meyer R. Vetter H. Grohe C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have shown that MKP-1 is up-regulated by 17β-estradiol in unstretched cardiac myocytes, an effect seen as early as 30 min after stimulation and associated with a concurrent decrease in estrogen-mediated p44/42 MAPK activation in these cells. MKP-1 is the prototype of the MAPK dual specificity phosphatase family and may inactivate both p44/42 MAPK and SAPK (25Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated the effects of 17β-estradiol on MKP-1 expression in MC and found that 24-h incubation with 17β-estradiol induced protein levels of MKP-1. No such effect was observed with the phopsho-p44/42 MAPK-specific phosphatase MKP-3. Although additional mechanisms may exist whereby 17β-estradiol inhibits stretch-induced signaling in MC, this effect on MKP-1 may be responsible"
https://openalex.org/W2147141401,"Escherichia coli DNA gyrase is comprised of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB. Previous studies have shown that GyrI, a regulatory factor of DNA gyrase activity, inhibits the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase and that both overexpression and antisense expression of the gyrI gene suppress cell proliferation. Here we have analyzed the interaction of GyrI with DNA gyrase using two approaches. First, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that GyrI interacts preferentially with the holoenzyme in an ATP-independent manner, although a weak interaction was also detected between GyrI and the individual GyrA and GyrB subunits. Second, surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that GyrI binds to the gyrase holoenzyme with higher affinity than to either the GyrA or GyrB subunit alone. Unlike quinolone antibiotics, GyrI was not effective in stabilizing the cleavable complex consisting of gyrase and DNA. Further, we identified an 8-residue synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acids 89ITGGQYAV96 of GyrI, which inhibits gyrase activity in an in vitro supercoiling assay. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the ITGGQYAV-containing peptide-gyrase interaction indicated a high association constant for this interaction. These results suggest that amino acids 89–96 of GyrI are essential for its interaction with, and inhibition of, DNA gyrase. Escherichia coli DNA gyrase is comprised of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB.

DNA gyrase inhibitor dithiothreitol surface plasmon resonance phosphate-buffered saline DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase found in all bacteria and is essential for viability. It is involved in the replication, repair, recombination, and transcription of DNA (1Menzel R. Gellert M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 201-225PubMed Google Scholar). DNA gyrase consists of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB, and the active holoenzyme is an A2B2 complex (2Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies have revealed the steps involved in the gyrase supercoiling reaction (3Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev.

This process involves the wrapping of DNA around the A2B2 complex, cleavage of this DNA on both strands, and the passage of a segment of DNA through the double strand break. Religation of the break results in the introduction of two negative supercoils. These processes require the binding and hydrolysis of ATP (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A.

Coumarins are potent inhibitors of gyrase supercoiling and ATPase reactions. Through the use of x-ray crystallography the molecular details of the ATPase reaction and its inhibition by coumarin have been revealed (10Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Quinolones, on the other hand, stabilize a conformation of the enzyme-DNA complex referred to as the “cleavable complex.” This complex blocks the passage of RNA polymerases (13Willmott C.J.R. Critchlow S.E. Eperon I.C. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Wentzell L.M. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Although the majority of compounds known to target DNA gyrase are either quinolones or coumarins, natural toxins also exist such as microcin B17 (15Liu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4618-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and CcdB (16Couturier M. Bahassi E.M. Melderen L.V. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Microcin B17 is a peptidyl antibiotic secreted in the stationary phase by several strains ofEscherichia coli and induces DNA cleavage in a fashion similar to that of the quinolones (17Madison L.L. Vivas E.I. Li Yue-M Walsh C.T. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The antibiotic efficacy of this polypeptide depends on the post-translational modification of eight of its cysteine and serine residues to thiazoles and oxazoles, respectively (18Milne J. Roy R.S.

CcdB is a bacterial toxin encoded by theE. coli F plasmid (22Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These natural toxins target domains of the GyrA and GyrB proteins distinct from those targeted by the quinolones and coumarins (23Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Microcin B17 targets GyrB (24Vizán J.L. Hernández-Chio C. del Castillo I. Moreno F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and CcdB targets GyrA (23Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). No cross-resistance to quinolones has been observed.DNA gyrase inhibitor (GyrI)1was the first chromosomally nucleoid encoded DNA gyrase regulatory factor identified in E. coli. In previous work, we found that this purified protein inhibited DNA supercoiling in vitro and that abnormally high or low GyrI levels resulted in the suppression of cell proliferation in vivo (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The promoter activity of gyrI increases in the late exponential phase and peaks in the stationary phase (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Independently, Baquero et al. (26Baquero M.R. Bouzon M. Varea J. Moreno F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that the gyrI gene (identical to thesbmC gene) belongs to the SOS regulon. The inactivation of GyrI causes cells to be more sensitive to microcin B17, whereas its overexpression yields microcin B17-resistant cells (26Baquero M.R. Bouzon M. Varea J. Moreno F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In this work, we examined the interaction of the GyrI protein with the DNA gyrase A2B2 tetramer. We show that the interaction of GyrI with DNA gyrase requires both the GyrA and GyrB subunits and that a specific region of GyrI mediates its interaction with, and inhibition of, DNA gyrase.DISCUSSIONWe previously discovered GyrI during the purification of DNA gyrase from E. coli (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we wished to characterize the molecular interaction between GyrI and DNA gyrase. To do so, DNA gyrase was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a novobiocine-Sepharose column (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Sato K. Inoue Y. Fujii T. Aoyama H. Inoue M. Mitsuhashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Aoyama H. Sato K. Fujii T. Fujimaki K. Inoue M. Mitsuhashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The GyrA subunit was eluted with 2 m KCl, and the GyrB subunit was eluted with a combination of 2 m KCl and 5 m urea. The DNA gyrase holoenzyme, consisting of two subunits (i.e. A (GyrA) and B (GyrB)), was eluted with 5 m urea. The GyrI protein coeluted with the fraction containing the two subunits. This result suggests that GyrI interacts with the holoenzyme consisting of GyrA and GyrB, but not with GyrA or GyrB alone.To investigate the interaction of GyrI with gyrase, we used SPR and immunoprecipitation. The results of the immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that GyrI binds directly to the holoenzyme and that binding is also observed, albeit to a lesser degree, with the individual GyrA and GyrB subunits. We also showed that ATP is not required for the interaction between GyrI and the gyrase holoenzyme. Kinetic parameters from SPR experiments used to examine the interaction between GyrI and GyrA, GyrB, or the holoenzyme supported the immunoprecipitation results. The association rate constant for the formation of the GyrI-holoenzyme complex was determined to be ∼104m−1 s−1. This is similar to that for the association of CcdB and GyrA. Like GyrI, CcdB is a natural toxin that targets gyrase. Analysis of the CcdB-gyrase interaction reveals that this complex forms through the direct binding of GyrA to CcdB (39Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10936-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mode of action of CcdB appears to be similar to that of the quinolones on gyrase (40Maki S. Takiguchi T. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It would be very interesting to determine the structure of gyrase complex containing GyrI.We used GyrI-derived synthetic peptides to determine the regions of GyrI involved in its binding to DNA gyrase. The peptide corresponding to an 8-amino acid sequence in GyrI (ITGGQYAV; 89–96 of GyrI) was sufficient to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. This peptide did not affect topoisomerase I activity, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide was not an artifact of the supercoiling assay.Gyrase is a target of several antibiotics, some of whose mechanisms have been characterized in detail. Coumarin binds the amino-terminal domain of the GyrB subunit and inhibits gyrase-dependent ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, quinolone antibiotics bind a cleavable complex of DNA bound to DNA gyrase. When we introduced the GyrI-peptide (ITGGQYAV (200 μm); 89–96 of GyrI) into the cleavage assay, no cleaved DNA-gyrase complexes were observed (data not shown). This result suggests that the inhibitory mechanism of the ITGGQYAV peptide might be different from that of the quinolones. It would be interesting to modify this peptide to develop a more effective inhibitor of gyrase activity. The discovery and analysis of natural molecules with anti-gyrase activity hold promise for further investigations into mechanism of DNA gyrase activity. Finally, the GyrI peptides we describe here may form the basis for a novel class of peptide-based antibacterial agents. DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase found in all bacteria and is essential for viability. It is involved in the replication, repair, recombination, and transcription of DNA (1Menzel R. Gellert M.

Coumarins are potent inhibitors of gyrase supercoiling and ATPase reactions. Through the use of x-ray crystallography the molecular details of the ATPase reaction and its inhibition by coumarin have been revealed (10Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G.

Quinolones, on the other hand, stabilize a conformation of the enzyme-DNA complex referred to as the “cleavable complex.” This complex blocks the passage of RNA polymerases (13Willmott C.J.R. Critchlow S.E. Eperon I.C. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Wentzell L.M. Maxwell A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the majority of compounds known to target DNA gyrase are either quinolones or coumarins, natural toxins also exist such as microcin B17 (15Liu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4618-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and CcdB (16Couturier M. Bahassi E.M. Melderen L.V. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 269-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Microcin B17 is a peptidyl antibiotic secreted in the stationary phase by several strains ofEscherichia coli and induces DNA cleavage in a fashion similar to that of the quinolones (17Madison L.L. Vivas E.I. Li Yue-M Walsh C.T. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The antibiotic efficacy of this polypeptide depends on the post-translational modification of eight of its cysteine and serine residues to thiazoles and oxazoles, respectively (18Milne J. Roy R.S.

CcdB is a bacterial toxin encoded by theE. coli F plasmid (22Maki S. Takiguchi S. Miki T. Horiuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12244-12251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These natural toxins target domains of the GyrA and GyrB proteins distinct from those targeted by the quinolones and coumarins (23Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Microcin B17 targets GyrB (24Vizán J.L. Hernández-Chio C. del Castillo I. Moreno F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and CcdB targets GyrA (23Bernard P. Couturier M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). No cross-resistance to quinolones has been observed. DNA gyrase inhibitor (GyrI)1was the first chromosomally nucleoid encoded DNA gyrase regulatory factor identified in E. coli. In previous work, we found that this purified protein inhibited DNA supercoiling in vitro and that abnormally high or low GyrI levels resulted in the suppression of cell proliferation in vivo (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The promoter activity of gyrI increases in the late exponential phase and peaks in the stationary phase (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Independently, Baquero et al. (26Baquero M.R. Bouzon M. Varea J. Moreno F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that the gyrI gene (identical to thesbmC gene) belongs to the SOS regulon. The inactivation of GyrI causes cells to be more sensitive to microcin B17, whereas its overexpression yields microcin B17-resistant cells (26Baquero M.R. Bouzon M. Varea J. Moreno F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the interaction of the GyrI protein with the DNA gyrase A2B2 tetramer. We show that the interaction of GyrI with DNA gyrase requires both the GyrA and GyrB subunits and that a specific region of GyrI mediates its interaction with, and inhibition of, DNA gyrase. DISCUSSIONWe previously discovered GyrI during the purification of DNA gyrase from E. coli (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we wished to characterize the molecular interaction between GyrI and DNA gyrase. To do so, DNA gyrase was partially purified by affinity chromatography on a novobiocine-Sepharose column (25Nakanishi A. Oshida T. Matsushita T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ohnuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1933-1938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Sato K. Inoue Y. Fujii T. Aoyama H. Inoue M. Mitsuhashi S. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1988; 32: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The GyrA subunit was eluted with 2 m KCl, and the GyrB subunit was eluted with a combination of 2 m KCl and 5 m urea. The DNA gyrase holoenzyme, consisting of two subunits (i.e. A (GyrA) and B (GyrB)), was eluted with 5 m urea. The GyrI protein coeluted with the fraction containing the two subunits. This result suggests that GyrI interacts with the holoenzyme consisting of GyrA and GyrB, but not with GyrA or GyrB alone.To investigate the interaction of GyrI with gyrase, we used SPR and immunoprecipitation. The results of the immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that GyrI binds directly to the holoenzyme and that binding is also observed, albeit to a lesser degree, with the individual GyrA and GyrB subunits. We also showed that ATP is not required for the interaction between GyrI and the gyrase holoenzyme. Kinetic parameters from SPR experiments used to examine the interaction between GyrI and GyrA, GyrB, or the holoenzyme supported the immunoprecipitation results. The association rate constant for the formation of the GyrI-holoenzyme complex was determined to be ∼104m−1 s−1. This is similar to that for the association of CcdB and GyrA. Like GyrI, CcdB is a natural toxin that targets gyrase. Analysis of the CcdB-gyrase interaction reveals that this complex forms through the direct binding of GyrA to CcdB (39Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10936-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mode of action of CcdB appears to be similar to that of the quinolones on gyrase (40Maki S. Takiguchi T. Horiuchi T. Sekimizu K. Miki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It would be very interesting to determine the structure of gyrase complex containing GyrI.We used GyrI-derived synthetic peptides to determine the regions of GyrI involved in its binding to DNA gyrase. The peptide corresponding to an 8-amino acid sequence in GyrI (ITGGQYAV; 89–96 of GyrI) was sufficient to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. This peptide did not affect topoisomerase I activity, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide was not an artifact of the supercoiling assay.Gyrase is a target of several antibiotics, some of whose mechanisms have been characterized in detail. Coumarin binds the amino-terminal domain of the GyrB subunit and inhibits gyrase-dependent ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, quinolone antibiotics bind a cleavable complex of DNA bound to DNA gyrase. When we introduced the GyrI-peptide (ITGGQYAV (200 μm); 89–96 of GyrI) into the cleavage assay, no cleaved DNA-gyrase complexes were observed (data not shown). This result suggests that the inhibitory mechanism of the ITGGQYAV peptide might be different from that of the quinolones. It would be interesting to modify this peptide to develop a more effective inhibitor of gyrase activity. The discovery and analysis of natural molecules with anti-gyrase activity hold promise for further investigations into mechanism of DNA gyrase activity. Finally, the GyrI peptides we describe here may form the basis for a novel class of peptide-based antibacterial agents.

https://openalex.org/W1965501817,"The deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma results from the translocation that links one c-myc allele to one of the immunoglobulin genes. This physical linkage promotes interactions between c-myc and immunoglobulin gene regulatory elements that affect c-myc transcription initiation and elongation. We have located a region in the c-myc promoter that is required for the complete activation by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer. This regulatory element contains a core sequence, GGGAGG, similar to the GA box recognized by the transcription factor Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ). UV cross-link analysis indicated that the mass of this protein did not correspond to that of MAZ, suggesting that a protein related to but distinct from MAZ bound to this site. Mutation of this regulatory element resulted in a loss of promoter activity induced by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer. This site was also required for the c-mycpromoter shift from P2 to P1. In vivo footprinting revealed that this site was occupied on the translocated c-mycallele but not on the untranslocated allele. Taken together, these findings suggest that this regulatory element is required for the full activation of c-myc promoter activity by the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer.

The most common form of the translocation is t(8;14) where the c-myc gene is covalently linked to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH)1. The translocated c-myc gene is highly expressed, whereas the normal allele is silent. Furthermore, the transcripts initiated from the c-myc P1 promoter, which normally contribute to a minor (10–20%) population of c-myc mRNA, increase to a level greater than the transcripts initiated from the P2 promoter, a phenomenon known as promoter shift (1Strobl L.J. Eick D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar, 3Taub R.

It is assumed that the physical linkage of the c-myc gene to one of the immunoglobulin loci promotes the interactions between c-mycand Ig regulatory elements that affect c-myc transcriptional initiation and elongation. In support of this view, it has been demonstrated that linkage of the murine IgH 3′ enhancer region, MHS1234, to a 2.3-kb region of the human c-myc promoter in an episomal vector is sufficient to reproduce the activation of c-myc transcription and the promoter shift in stably transfected Raji cells (4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained with the Igκ (5Polack A. Feederle R. Klobeck G. Hortnagel K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3913-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Igλ (6Gerbitz A. Mautner J. Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Christoph B. Asenbauer H. Klobeck G. Polack A. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) light chain enhancers. Despite these findings, most of the cis-acting enhancer and promoter elements that contribute to the deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene remain unidentified.We have shown previously that an NF-κB site in the MHS4 region of the IgH enhancer is required for the transcriptional activation of the translocated c-myc gene and is involved in inducing the c-myc promoter shift from P2 to P1 (7Kanda K. Hu H.-M. Zhang L. Grandchamps J. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32338-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Others have found that NF-κB and PU.1 sites are critical for the deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene by the Igκ enhancer (8Wittekindt N.E. Hortnagel K. Geltinger C. Polack A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 800-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the IgH enhancer MHS1234 activates expression from the c-myc P2 promoter by a mechanism involving increased histone acetylation along the c-myc promoter region (9Madisen L. Krumm A. Hebber T.R. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6281-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This finding, however, fails to explain the increased expression from the P1 promoter, suggesting that the c-myc P1 and P2 promoters are activated through somewhat different mechanisms by the IgH enhancer.Several cis-acting elements in the c-myc promoter have been identified and implicated in the basal and activated expression of the c-myc gene. Transcription factors such as Sp1 (10DesJardins E. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5710-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11De Majello B. Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) (12Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to bind to three cis-elements located between the P1 and P2 start sites. These sites are required for the basal activity of the P2 promoter in proliferating cells; however, their roles in the deregulation of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma cells have not been fully studied. Core promoter elements, including an Sp1 site and a TATA box located within 100-bp upstream of the c-myc P1 promoter, are essential and sufficient for Igκ enhancer-activated P1 expression (15Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Polack A. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). Two NF-κB sites are active in the regulation of c-myc in normal cells as well as in Burkitt's lymphoma cells (16Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kessler D.J. Spicer D.B. La Rosa F.A. Sonenshein G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2447-2453PubMed Google Scholar, 18La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sites contribute to activation of the P2 promoter with very little effect on the P1 promoter (16Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with the t(8;22) translocation have shown that c-myc promoter sequences upstream of the immediate P1 promoter (−101 to −1056) are required for full activation by the Igλ enhancer and for the induction of the promoter shift (6Gerbitz A. Mautner J. Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Christoph B. Asenbauer H. Klobeck G. Polack A. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The specific transcription factor binding sites that mediate this activity were not identified.In this report, we show that a positive regulatory element located −523 bp upstream of the P1 transcription start site is required for the transcriptional activation of the translocated c-mycgene and that it is involved in inducing the promoter shift mediated by the IgH enhancer. This element contains a GA box binding core, which is similar to that of a zinc finger transcription factor, MAZ. We also evaluated the effect of the Sp1 site in the P1 core promoter on the activation of c-myc transcription by the IgH enhancer.DISCUSSIONThe breakpoints on the c-myc gene in t(8;14) Burkitt's lymphoma can be internal to the transcription unit or up to several hundred kilobases 5′ of the c-myc gene. The regulation of expression of the translocated c-myc allele in these variants may involve different sets of transcription factors that bind to the c-myc promoter region and interact with IgH enhancer elements. It has been shown that four enhancer regions, MHS 1, 2, 3, and 4, located 3′ of the murine IgH are sufficient to activate transcription and induce the promoter shift when linked to the c-myc promoter region (4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which the IgH enhancer deregulates c-myc expression are not well understood. In this study we analyzed the upstream region of the c-myc gene for elements that are required for deregulation by the IgH enhancers using both transient and stable transfections into Raji cells. We identified a novel regulatory element located −523 bp upstream of the c-myc P1 transcription start site. Functional studies demonstrated that this element was required for the full activation of the c-myc promoter by the IgH enhancers. In vivo footprinting revealed that the MAZ-R site was occupied on the translocated c-myc allele but not on the untranslocated allele. The MAZ-R site also played a role in inducing the promoter shift from P2 to P1 that is observed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. These results are in agreement with the findings that the Igλ enhancer requires sequences 1 kb upstream of the c-myc P1 promoter for the full activation and induction of the promoter shift. Our study with the IgH enhancers extends these results by identifying the element that is responsible for this activity.The transcription factor that interacts with this promoter element is most likely a novel factor. Analysis of its DNA binding site suggested that it might be a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family. The competition EMSA showed that the protein binding to the element also recognized, to a lesser extent, the binding site for MAZ. UV cross-linking studies revealed that the molecular masses of the proteins that interacted with this element did not correspond to that of MAZ, suggesting that a different DNA-binding protein that recognizes a similar binding sequence interacts with this element. Hence, we designated this novel regulatory c-myc element a MAZ-related protein binding site. It is not clear whether three proteins bind to the MAZ-R site or whether the two smaller proteins represent degradation products.The MAZ-related protein binding site appears to exert its effect by activation of the P1 promoter rather than the P2 promoter. S1 protection analysis showed that deletion of this site caused a 50% drop in the P1/P2 ratio, mostly because of a large decrease in the level of the P1 transcripts with very little change in the level of the P2 transcripts. Previous studies have suggested that the P1 and P2 promoters are activated through different mechanisms by the IgH enhancers. Increased histone acetylation is one of the possible mechanisms through which the IgH enhancer activates expression from the P2 promoter, but this mechanism does not account for the activated transcription from the P1 promoter (9Madisen L. Krumm A. Hebber T.R. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6281-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to chromatin structure remodeling, the IgH enhancer may facilitate the assembly of the transcriptional machinery on the promoters through direct protein-protein interactions between the enhancer binding proteins and the transcription initiation complex. The IgH enhancer also increases the elongation efficiency by removing the block near the P2 promoter (2Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar, 4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The MAZ-related factor binding site may contribute to the formation of the initiation complex on the P1 promoter or enhance P1 transcription elongation or both. Our results do not provide an explanation for why the MAZ-R site appears to influence transcription from the P1 promoter as opposed to the P2 promoter.We also showed that the P1 promoter core elements, including the Sp1 site located upstream of the P1 promoter, are critical for the IgH enhancer-mediated activation of the c-myc promoter. S1 analysis showed that the IgH enhancer activated the expression of the c-myc gene when linked to the core promoter, and a P1/P2 ratio of ∼1.0 was achieved. This result is consistent with the findings with the Igκ enhancers, which demonstrated the requirement of these sites for enhancer-mediated activation of the P1 promoter (15Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Polack A. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). Our study showed that inclusion of the MAZ-R site in the promoter region further increased the total promoter activity by 50% and also increased the P1/P2 ratio to 1.7. An analysis of our results with those of Geltinger et al. (15Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Polack A. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that at least three elements (the MAZ-R site, the Sp1 site, and the TATA sequence) are required for interaction with the Ig enhancers. These studies provide additional insights into the mechanisms involved in the deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene by translocation into one of the Ig loci. Burkitt's lymphoma is characterized by specific chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the proto-oncogene c-myc on chromosome 8 to one of the Ig loci on chromosome 2, 14, or 22. The most common form of the translocation is t(8;14) where the c-myc gene is covalently linked to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH)1. The translocated c-myc gene is highly expressed, whereas the normal allele is silent. Furthermore, the transcripts initiated from the c-myc P1 promoter, which normally contribute to a minor (10–20%) population of c-myc mRNA, increase to a level greater than the transcripts initiated from the P2 promoter, a phenomenon known as promoter shift (1Strobl L.J. Eick D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar, 3Taub R. Kelly K. Battey J. Latt S. Lenoir G.M. Cell. 1984; 37: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the physical linkage of the c-myc gene to one of the immunoglobulin loci promotes the interactions between c-mycand Ig regulatory elements that affect c-myc transcriptional initiation and elongation. In support of this view, it has been demonstrated that linkage of the murine IgH 3′ enhancer region, MHS1234, to a 2.3-kb region of the human c-myc promoter in an episomal vector is sufficient to reproduce the activation of c-myc transcription and the promoter shift in stably transfected Raji cells (4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained with the Igκ (5Polack A. Feederle R. Klobeck G. Hortnagel K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3913-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Igλ (6Gerbitz A. Mautner J. Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Christoph B. Asenbauer H. Klobeck G. Polack A. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) light chain enhancers. Despite these findings, most of the cis-acting enhancer and promoter elements that contribute to the deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene remain unidentified. We have shown previously that an NF-κB site in the MHS4 region of the IgH enhancer is required for the transcriptional activation of the translocated c-myc gene and is involved in inducing the c-myc promoter shift from P2 to P1 (7Kanda K. Hu H.-M. Zhang L. Grandchamps J. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32338-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Others have found that NF-κB and PU.1 sites are critical for the deregulation of expression of the c-myc gene by the Igκ enhancer (8Wittekindt N.E. Hortnagel K. Geltinger C. Polack A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 800-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the IgH enhancer MHS1234 activates expression from the c-myc P2 promoter by a mechanism involving increased histone acetylation along the c-myc promoter region (9Madisen L. Krumm A. Hebber T.R. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6281-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This finding, however, fails to explain the increased expression from the P1 promoter, suggesting that the c-myc P1 and P2 promoters are activated through somewhat different mechanisms by the IgH enhancer. Several cis-acting elements in the c-myc promoter have been identified and implicated in the basal and activated expression of the c-myc gene. Transcription factors such as Sp1 (10DesJardins E. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5710-5724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11De Majello B. Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) (12Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 13Pyrc J.J. Moberg K.H. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and E2F (14Moberg K.H. Logan T.J. Tyndall W.A. Hall D.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 411-421PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to bind to three cis-elements located between the P1 and P2 start sites. These sites are required for the basal activity of the P2 promoter in proliferating cells; however, their roles in the deregulation of the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma cells have not been fully studied. Core promoter elements, including an Sp1 site and a TATA box located within 100-bp upstream of the c-myc P1 promoter, are essential and sufficient for Igκ enhancer-activated P1 expression (15Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Polack A. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar). Two NF-κB sites are active in the regulation of c-myc in normal cells as well as in Burkitt's lymphoma cells (16Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kessler D.J. Spicer D.B. La Rosa F.A. Sonenshein G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2447-2453PubMed Google Scholar, 18La Rosa F.A. Pierce J.W. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sites contribute to activation of the P2 promoter with very little effect on the P1 promoter (16Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7967-7974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with the t(8;22) translocation have shown that c-myc promoter sequences upstream of the immediate P1 promoter (−101 to −1056) are required for full activation by the Igλ enhancer and for the induction of the promoter shift (6Gerbitz A. Mautner J. Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Christoph B. Asenbauer H. Klobeck G. Polack A. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The specific transcription factor binding sites that mediate this activity were not identified. In this report, we show that a positive regulatory element located −523 bp upstream of the P1 transcription start site is required for the transcriptional activation of the translocated c-mycgene and that it is involved in inducing the promoter shift mediated by the IgH enhancer. This element contains a GA box binding core, which is similar to that of a zinc finger transcription factor, MAZ. We also evaluated the effect of the Sp1 site in the P1 core promoter on the activation of c-myc transcription by the IgH enhancer. DISCUSSIONThe breakpoints on the c-myc gene in t(8;14) Burkitt's lymphoma can be internal to the transcription unit or up to several hundred kilobases 5′ of the c-myc gene. The regulation of expression of the translocated c-myc allele in these variants may involve different sets of transcription factors that bind to the c-myc promoter region and interact with IgH enhancer elements. It has been shown that four enhancer regions, MHS 1, 2, 3, and 4, located 3′ of the murine IgH are sufficient to activate transcription and induce the promoter shift when linked to the c-myc promoter region (4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which the IgH enhancer deregulates c-myc expression are not well understood. In this study we analyzed the upstream region of the c-myc gene for elements that are required for deregulation by the IgH enhancers using both transient and stable transfections into Raji cells. We identified a novel regulatory element located −523 bp upstream of the c-myc P1 transcription start site. Functional studies demonstrated that this element was required for the full activation of the c-myc promoter by the IgH enhancers. In vivo footprinting revealed that the MAZ-R site was occupied on the translocated c-myc allele but not on the untranslocated allele. The MAZ-R site also played a role in inducing the promoter shift from P2 to P1 that is observed in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. These results are in agreement with the findings that the Igλ enhancer requires sequences 1 kb upstream of the c-myc P1 promoter for the full activation and induction of the promoter shift. Our study with the IgH enhancers extends these results by identifying the element that is responsible for this activity.The transcription factor that interacts with this promoter element is most likely a novel factor. Analysis of its DNA binding site suggested that it might be a member of the zinc finger transcription factor family. The competition EMSA showed that the protein binding to the element also recognized, to a lesser extent, the binding site for MAZ. UV cross-linking studies revealed that the molecular masses of the proteins that interacted with this element did not correspond to that of MAZ, suggesting that a different DNA-binding protein that recognizes a similar binding sequence interacts with this element. Hence, we designated this novel regulatory c-myc element a MAZ-related protein binding site. It is not clear whether three proteins bind to the MAZ-R site or whether the two smaller proteins represent degradation products.The MAZ-related protein binding site appears to exert its effect by activation of the P1 promoter rather than the P2 promoter. S1 protection analysis showed that deletion of this site caused a 50% drop in the P1/P2 ratio, mostly because of a large decrease in the level of the P1 transcripts with very little change in the level of the P2 transcripts. Previous studies have suggested that the P1 and P2 promoters are activated through different mechanisms by the IgH enhancers. Increased histone acetylation is one of the possible mechanisms through which the IgH enhancer activates expression from the P2 promoter, but this mechanism does not account for the activated transcription from the P1 promoter (9Madisen L. Krumm A. Hebber T.R. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6281-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition to chromatin structure remodeling, the IgH enhancer may facilitate the assembly of the transcriptional machinery on the promoters through direct protein-protein interactions between the enhancer binding proteins and the transcription initiation complex. The IgH enhancer also increases the elongation efficiency by removing the block near the P2 promoter (2Strobl L.J. Kohlhuber F. Mautner J. Polack A. Eick D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1437-1447PubMed Google Scholar, 4Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The MAZ-related factor binding site may contribute to the formation of the initiation complex on the P1 promoter or enhance P1 transcription elongation or both. Our results do not provide an explanation for why the MAZ-R site appears to influence transcription from the P1 promoter as opposed to the P2 promoter.We also showed that the P1 promoter core elements, including the Sp1 site located upstream of the P1 promoter, are critical for the IgH enhancer-mediated activation of the c-myc promoter. S1 analysis showed that the IgH enhancer activated the expression of the c-myc gene when linked to the core promoter, and a P1/P2 ratio of ∼1.0 was achieved. This result is consistent with the findings with the Igκ enhancers, which demonstrated the requirement of these sites for enhancer-mediated activation of the P1 promoter (15Geltinger C. Hortnagel K. Polack A. Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2170948558,"Abstract The 5′-flank of the H19 gene harbors a differentially methylated imprinting control region that represses the maternally derived Igf2 and paternally derivedH19 alleles. Here we show that the H19imprinting control region (ICR) is a potent silencer when positioned in a promoter-proximal position. The silencing effect is not alleviated by trichostatin A treatment, suggesting that it does not involve histone deacetylase functions. When the H19 ICR is separated from the promoter by more than 1.2 ± 0.3 kb, however, trichostatin A stimulates promoter activity 10-fold. Deletion analyses revealed that the silencing feature extended throughout the ICR segment. Finally, chromatin immunopurification analyses revealed that the H19ICR prevented trichostatin A-dependent reacetylation of histones in the promoter region in a proximal but not in a distal position. We argue that these features are likely to be side effects of the H19 ICR, rather than explaining the mechanism of silencing of the paternal H19 allele. We issue a cautionary note, therefore, that the interpretation of insulator/silencer data could be erroneous should the distance issue not be taken into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2062329371,"The retinoblastoma family of proteins are key cell cycle regulatory molecules important for the differentiation of various mammalian cell types. The retinoblastoma protein regulates transcription of a variety of genes either by blocking the activation domain of various activators or by active repression via recruitment to appropriate promoters. We show here that the retinoblastoma family of proteins functions as direct transcriptional repressors in a heterologous yeast system when fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4. Mapping experiments indicate that either the A or the B domain of the pocket region is sufficient for repression <i>in vivo</i>. As is the case in mammalian cells, a phosphorylation site mutant of the retinoblastoma protein is a stronger transcriptional repressor than the wild type protein. We show that transcriptional repression by pRb is dependent on <i>CLN3 in vivo</i>. Furthermore, the yeast histone deacetylase components, <i>RPD3</i> and <i>SIN3,</i> are required for transcriptional repression."
